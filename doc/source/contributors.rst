Contributes to FederatedScope
========================

As an open-sourced project, we classify our users into two categories:

- Running our code with different configurations, or re-organizing the training courses with their own entry scripts. These users may have no interest in understanding our implementation details.
- Customizing some modules of FederatedScope by themselves, e.g., customized data loader, novel function approximators, and even novel federated learning algorithms. If you believe that other users could benefit from your ideas, we welcome your pull-requests.

This post targets for the latter. We give an overview of our design and clarify the requirements any pull-request should obey.
