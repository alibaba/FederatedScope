   RAR archiver:

 * RAR introduces an original compression algorithm.  It provides
   high compression ratios on executable files, object libraries,
   large text files, etc.

 * RAR provides functionality for creating a 'solid' archive, which
   can raise the compression ratio by 10% - 50% over more common
   methods, particularly when packing large numbers of small files.

 * RAR offers the ability to create and change SFX archives using
   default and external SFX modules.

 * RAR offers the ability to create a multi-volume archive as SFX.

 * RAR offers a number of service functions, such as encrypting files,
   adding archive comments and repairing physically damaged archives.
