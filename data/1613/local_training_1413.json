She was one of the leading players on the women's circuit in the late-1980s and early-1990s. She won one women's grand slam singles title at the US Open in 1990, the women's grand slam doubles title at Wimbledon in 1988, two WTA Tour Championships titles in 1988 and 1994, and a silver medal at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Context_2 : Steffi Graf and Gabriela Sabatini are retired professional tennis players who played each other on 40 occasions between 1985 and 1995. Steffi Graf was the world No. 1, whilst Sabatini reached a career high of No. 3. They are both Grand Slam Champions, the German winning 22 titles whilst Sabatini won her only Grand Slam title against Graf.

Context_3 : Steffi Graf successfully defended her tile, defeating Monica Seles 7\u20135, 6\u20134 in the final to win the Women's Singles title at the 1996 US Open. It was a rematch of the 1995 US Open final, where Graf defeated Seles in three sets. It also marked the final time Seles and Graf would play each other at the US Open. The 1996 U.S Open proved to be the last for Gabriela Sabatini, as she retired later that year. Sabatini was twice a finalist at the U.S Open. In the 1988 US Open final, Sabatini lost to Graf in three sets. Two years later, at the 1990 US Open, Sabatini defeated Graf in two sets to win her only Grand Slam title. Context_4 : The 1988 Virginia Slims of Florida was a women's tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts at the Boca Raton Resort & Club in Boca Raton, Florida in the United States and was part of Tier II of the 1988 WTA Tour. The tournament ran from March 7 through March 13, 1988. Fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini won the singles title and earned $60,000 first-prize money, ending a 30-match winning streak by Steffi Graf. It was Sabatini's first win over Graf after 11 previous defeats. Context_5 : Claudio Panatta (born 2 February 1960 in Rome, Italy) is a former Italian tennis player and younger brother of 1976 French Open champion Adriano Panatta. Context_6 : Adriano Panatta (born 9 July 1950) is a former professional tennis player from Italy. He is best remembered for winning the French Open in 1976, and for being the only player to ever defeat Bj\u00f6rn Borg at Roland Garros, which he did on two occasions. Context_7 : Steffi Graf was the defending champion going into the final against her rival Gabriela Sabatini. Just the previous month, Sabatini defeated Steffi Graf 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 7\u20135 in the final at Amelia Island, Florida. Now, in her native Germany, Steffi would turn the tables against Sabatini, beating her 6\u20133, 6\u20131. Prior to this match, Sabatini had played in four finals in 1989, with her winning twice.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.", "input": "Context_1 : The Incoterms rules or International Commercial Terms are a series of pre-defined commercial terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) relating to international commercial law. They are widely used in International commercial transactions or procurement processes as the use in international sales is encouraged by trade councils, courts and international lawyers. A series of three-letter trade terms related to common contractual sales practices, the Incoterms rules are intended primarily to clearly communicate the tasks, costs, and risks associated with the transportation and delivery of goods. Incoterms inform sales contract defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved in the delivery of goods from the seller to the buyer. However, it does not constitute contract or govern law. Also it does not define where titles transfer and does not address the price payable, currency or credit items. Context_2 : In business or commerce, an order is a stated intention, either spoken or written, to engage in a commercial transaction for specific products or services. From a buyer's point of view it expresses the intention to buy and is called a purchase order. From a seller's point of view it expresses the intention to sell and is referred to as a sales order. When the purchase order of the buyer and the sales order of the seller agree, the orders become a contract between the buyer and seller. Context_3 : A land contract \u2014 often described by other terminology listed below \u2014 is a contract between the buyer and seller of real property in which the seller provides the buyer financing in the purchase, and the buyer repays the resulting loan in installments. Under a land contract, the seller retains the legal title to the property, while permitting the buyer to take possession of it for most purposes other than legal ownership. The sale price is typically paid in periodic installments, often with a balloon payment at the end to make the timelength of payments shorter than in the corresponding fully amortized loan (i.e., a loan without a final balloon payment). When the full purchase price has been paid including any interest, the seller is obligated to convey (to the buyer) legal title to the property. An initial down payment from the buyer to the seller is usually also required. Context_4 : The point of total assumption (PTA) is a point on the cost line of the profit-cost curve determined by the contract elements associated with a fixed price plus incentive-Firm Target (FPI) contract above which the seller effectively bears all the costs of a cost overrun. The seller bears all of the cost risk at PTA and beyond, due to a dollar for dollar decrease in profit beyond the costs at the PTA. In addition, once the costs on an FPI contract reach PTA, the maximum amount the buyer will pay is the ceiling price. Note, however, that between the cost at PTA and when the cost equals the ceiling price, the seller is still in a profitable position; only after costs exceed the ceiling price is the seller in a loss position. Context_5 : In commodities transactions, formula pricing is an arrangement where a buyer and seller agree in advance on the price to be paid for a product delivered in the future, based upon a pre-determined calculation. For example, a packer might agree to pay a hog producer the average cash market price on the day the hogs will be delivered, plus a 2-cent per-pound premium. Context_6 : Lost volume seller is a legal term in the law of contracts. Such a seller is a special case in contract law. Ordinarily, a seller whose buyer breaches a contract and refuses to purchase the goods can recover from the breaching buyer only the difference between the contract price and the price for which the seller ultimately sells the goods to another buyer (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages). Context_7 : A call option, often simply labeled a \"call\", is a financial contract between two parties, the buyer and the seller of this type of option. The buyer of the call option has the \"right, but not the obligation\", to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the strike price). The seller (or \"writer\") is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument to the buyer if the buyer so decides. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right. The term \"call\" comes from the fact that the owner has the right to \"call the stock away\" from the seller. Context_8 : Muraba\u1e25ah, muraba\u1e25a or mur\u00e2ba\u1e25ah (Arabic: \u0645\u0631\u0627\u0628\u062d\u0629\u200e \u200e , derived from \"ribh\" Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u062d\u200e \u200e , meaning profit) is a term of \"fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence) for a sales contract where the buyer and seller agree on the markup (profit) or \"cost-plus\" price for the item(s) being sold. In recent decades it has become a term for a very common form of Islamic (i.e. \"shariah compliant\") financing, where the price is marked-up in exchange for allowing the buyer to defer payment (a contract with deferred payment being known as \"bai-muajjal\"). \"Murabaha\" financing is similar to a rent-to-own arrangement in the non-Muslim world, with the intermediary (i.e. the lending bank) retaining ownership of the item being sold until the loan is paid in full. There are also Islamic investment funds and sukuk (Islamic bonds) that use \"murabahah\" contracts. Context_9 : Markup is the ratio between the cost of a good or service and its selling price. It is expressed as a percentage over the cost. A markup is added onto the total cost incurred by the producer of a good or service in order to cover the costs of doing business and create a profit. The total cost reflects the total amount of both fixed and variable expenses to produce and distribute a product. Markup can be expressed as a fixed amount or as a percentage of the total cost or selling price. Retail markup is commonly calculated as the difference between wholesale price and retail price, as a percentage of wholesale. Other methods are also used. Context_10 : As is is a legal term used to disclaim some implied warranties for an item being sold. Certain types of implied warranties must be specifically disclaimed, such as the implied warranty of title. \"As is\" denotes that the seller is selling, and the buyer is buying an item in whatever condition it presently exists, and that the buyer is accepting the item \"with all faults\", whether or not immediately apparent. This is the classic \"buyer beware\" situation, where the careful buyer should take the time to examine the item before accepting it, or obtain expert advice. fact_1 : Muraba\u1e25ah, muraba\u1e25a or mur\u00e2ba\u1e25ah (Arabic: \u0645\u0631\u0627\u0628\u062d\u0629\u200e \u200e , derived from \"ribh\" Arabic: \u0631\u0628\u062d\u200e \u200e , meaning profit) is a term of \"fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence) for a sales contract where the buyer and seller agree on the markup (profit) or \"cost-plus\" price for the item(s) being sold. fact_2 : Markup is the ratio between the cost of a good or service and its selling price. fact_3 :  A markup is added onto the total cost incurred by the producer of a good or service in order to cover the costs of doing business and create a profit.

It is set in \"chugging\" tempo and features heavy synths, \"contagious\" hooks and West Indian nuances. Lyrically, the song features Rihanna sexually seducing her lover, while revealing her \"nasty secrets\". Contemporary music critics were divided in their reviews of \"Roc Me Out\"; some of them labeled the song as a highlight on the album, while others criticized its similarity to Rihanna's previous singles.

Rock City were inspired by Bob Marley's 1973 song \"I Shot the Sheriff\" and set out to create a song which embodied the same feel, but from a female perspective. \"Man Down\" is a reggae murder ballad which incorporates elements of ragga and electronic music. Lyrically, Rihanna is a fugitive after she shoots a man, an action she later regrets. Several critics singled out \"Man Down\" as \"Loud\"' s highlight, while others commented on her prominent West Indian accent and vocal agility.

Timberlake who co-wrote \"Cold Case Love\" labeled the sound of Rihanna's new project as a step forward for the singer. In February 2010, Rihanna admitted that the song's lyrics are about her complicated relationship with Brown. Context_7 : \"Right Now\" is a song by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna from her seventh studio album, \"Unapologetic\" (2012). The song features French disc jockey David Guetta. Rihanna co-wrote the song with R&B singers Ne-Yo and The-Dream, while their longtime collaborators, Norwegian production duo StarGate, co-produced the track alongside Guetta and his own longtime collaborators Nicky Romero and Giorgio Tuinfort.

Context_5 : Two-dimensionalism is an approach to semantics in analytic philosophy. It is a theory of how to determine the sense and reference of a word and the truth-value of a sentence. It is intended to resolve the puzzle: How is it possible to discover empirically that a necessary truth is true? Two-dimensionalism provides an analysis of the semantics of words and sentences that makes sense of this possibility. The theory was first developed by Robert Stalnaker, but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since, including David Chalmers. Context_6 : Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA) is a semantic approach to grammatical representation. It is a cross-linguistically applicable semantic representation scheme, and has demonstrated support for rapid annotation. Context_7 : Alastair Hannay (born 1932) is Professor emeritus at the University of Oslo. Educated in Edinburgh, where his early interest in philosophy was roused by John Macmurray, and London, where he studied under A. J. Ayer and Bernard Williams. In his published doctoral dissertation \"Mental Images - A Defence\" (1971) Hannay argues that visual images, like physical portraits, resemble visible objects. As a kind of sensation a mental image has material properties of its own which allow it to picture. He thus contradicts Gilbert Ryle and Daniel Dennett. Hannay has translated S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, and written an intellectual biography and a monograph about his philosophy. Under Hannay's direction (managing editor 1962-71, editor 1971-2002), \"Inquiry\" grew into a widely read philosophical journal. In \"Human Consciousness\" (1990), Hannay reviews contemporary theories of human consciousness while maintaining a characteristic conservatism. Hannay argues that consciousness and the first-person point of view cannot be analysed or displaced by scientific materialism, nor can they be explained functionally, a view close to that of Thomas Reid, William Hamilton, and Ferrier. Hannay's book \"The Public\" (2004) brings several Kierkegaardian insights to bear on contemporary political life and examines the roles of the 'public' as audience as well as political participant. Hannay is also a member of a team translating Kierkegaard's complete journals and notebooks. Context_8 : In programming language semantics, normalisation by evaluation (NBE) is a style of obtaining the normal form of terms in the \u03bb calculus by appealing to their denotational semantics. A term is first \"interpreted\" into a denotational model of the \u03bb-term structure, and then a canonical (\u03b2-normal and \u03b7-long) representative is extracted by \"reifying\" the denotation. Such an essentially semantic approach differs from the more traditional syntactic description of normalisation as a reductions in a term rewrite system where \u03b2-reductions are allowed deep inside \u03bb-terms. Context_9 : Ismo Uskali M\u00e4ki (8 February 1951 Helsinki ) is a Finnish professor in the Department of Political and Economic Studies (Philosophy) at the University of Helsinki.

M\u00e4ki is currently serving as an Academy Professor for the Academy of Finland. Context_10 : Semantic holism is a theory in the philosophy of language to the effect that a certain part of language, be it a term or a complete sentence, can only be understood through its relations to a (previously understood) larger segment of language. There is substantial controversy, however, as to exactly what the larger segment of language in question consists of. In recent years, the debate surrounding semantic holism, which is one among the many forms of holism that are debated and discussed in contemporary philosophy, has tended to centre on the view that the \"whole\" in question consists of an entire language. fact_1 :  The theory was first developed by Robert Stalnaker, but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since, including David Chalmers. fact_2 :  He is Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Centre for Consciousness at the Australian National University.

Sam Abell's style of photography is documentary in the sense that his major avenue, the \"National Geographic\" magazine, is a publication of record. However, his best work is known for its transcendent qualities, starting at the documentary level yet open to interpretation on an aesthetic level. One of his favorite photographs (based on how often he mentions it when asked about his work) is of the tree viewed through a Japanese window, which graces the cover of his book \"Seeing Gardens\". It's a documentary photograph of a tree, but due to a combination of light and Abell's inclusion in his composition of roof tiles in the background, the photograph takes on the transcendent, illusory quality of a stained glass window. Abell rarely uses flash, preferring a pure relationship with light. He has said that he could be perfectly happy with his photography even if his only subject was light itself.

The second track \"Run\" Spears says originated from a conversation she had with some of her co-writers about how hot it was outside which eventually turned into a song. Spears says the song reminds her of \"being on the river, summertime, just being with the person you love, and just having a good time.\" The lead single from the EP \"How Could I Want More\" was inspired by Spears' husband and is what she describes as \"personal and special\". \"Mandolin Summer Sun\" is what Spears describes as a happy song and is about \"letting things go, not being so serious, enjoying life, and that innocence, and that fun time in the summer.\" The final track \"Big Bad World\" was written with Chris Tompkins. It was written when Spears was in a lonely time in her life and is meant to be encouraging to listeners.

As a founding member of one of Germany's original fighter squadrons, he was shot down and killed before he reached his twentieth birthday. Context_10 : Western Air Command was the part of the Royal Canadian Air Force's Home War Establishment responsible for air operations on the Pacific coast of Canada during the Second World War. When Canada declared war against Germany in September 1939 the command consisted of only five squadrons. Four of them equipped with obsolete aircraft including a bomber squadron with aircraft from the Great War and there were no fighter aircraft at all for its only fighter squadron (113 Fighter Squadron was thus disbanded). With the Japanese threat after Pearl Harbor it grew rapidly and played a critical role in fighter and anti-submarine operations in Canadian and American waters during the Aleutian Islands Campaign. It was there that Squadron Leader K.A. Boomer of No. 111 Squadron shot down a Rufe fighter, the RCAF's only kill in the Pacific Theatre. On 7 July 1942 a Bristol Bolingbroke pressed home an attack on the Japanese Submarine Ro 32 the pilot F/Sgt. P.M.G. Thomas of No. 115 Squadron RCAF then led American Destroyers to sink the damaged submarine. By January 1943 Western Air Command had expanded to include many bomber, fighter and operational units under its control. By the end of the war the command would involve some twenty squadrons when the last units to join were added in 1943. These were the 163 Army Cooperation Squadron in March flying Bristol Bolingbrokes and Hawker Hurricanes, in May the 160 Bomber-Reconnaissance Squadron was added flying Cansos from Sea Island BC (before moving to Yarmouth NS in July) and the 166 Communication Squadron formed in September flying various types. In addition to the new squadrons, new aircraft types came on line replacing the command's remaining Supermarine Stranraers and Blackburn Sharks with Canso's and the Bolingbrokes and Beauforts with the Lockheed Ventura. Countless training missions and operational patrols bolstered the air activity over the coastal areas but there was not much action until RCAF Western Command was on the look out for General Kusaba's Fire Balloons that the Japanese called the F\u016bsen Bakudan Campaign. In February and March 1945, P-40 fighter pilots from 133 Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force operating out of RCAF Patricia Bay (Victoria, British Columbia), intercepted and destroyed two fire balloons, On 21 February, Pilot Officer E. E. Maxwell While shot down a balloon, which landed on Sumas Mountain, in Washington State. On 10 March, Pilot Officer J. O. Patten destroyed a balloon near Saltspring Island, British Columbia. During another interception a Canso forced down a fire balloon which was examined at the army headquarters. Patrol activity was joined by the Operational Training Schools (OTS) operated by Number 4 Training Command of the BCATP. They were the No. 3 OTS flying the Canso and Catalina and No. 32 OTS with Ansons, Beauforts and Swordfish at Patricia Bay. In April, 1944 the No. 5 OTS Heavy Conversion unit stood up at Boundary Bay when 16 B-24 Liberators arrived fresh from American factories. By the end of September 1944 RCAF 5 O.T.U. had grown to sizeable force of some 87 aircraft including 38 B-24 Liberators, 35 B-25 Mitchells, 5 Bolingbrokes, 8 P-40 Kittyhawks and a single Norseman. With the end of the war in Europe these aircraft were joined by a number of Victory Aircraft Lancaster X bombers which were to be used to train the British Commonwealth's Very Long Range Bomber Tiger Force that would soon be sent to bomb the Japanese mainland from Okinawa. With the unconditional surrender of Japan the RCAF's Tiger Force bomber squadrons were disbanded before they flew overseas and the total draw down of the Western Air Command was suddenly undertaken. Within several months almost all the flying squadrons would be completely stood down. fact_1 :  Vorse served in early fighter squadrons with legendary figures like Butch O'Hare and Jimmy Thach. fact_2 : Lieutenant Commander Edward Henry \u201cButch\u201d O\u2019Hare (March 13, 1914 \u2013 November 26, 1943) was an American naval aviator of the United States Navy, who on February 20, 1942, became the Navy's first flying ace when he single-handedly attacked a formation of nine heavy bombers approaching his aircraft carrier.

It was captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy at the start of World War II and remained under Japanese control until the end of July 1944, when it was taken back by the USMC. The airfield itself, built on the Orote Peninsula, was one of many on Guam, and was closed for good in 1946, but still sees some use as a touch-and-go training strip used by C-130 Hercules crews located nearby on Andersen Air Force Base. Context_2 : The Japanese Occupation Site on Kiska island (along with Attu Island) in the Rat Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska is where the Japanese Navy attacked and occupied United States territory during World War II. The Japanese built defenses and other infrastructure on the island before abandoning it in 1943 after losing the Battle of Attu. American and Canadian forces reoccupied the abandoned island, and departed the island in 1946. Now a part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, the central portion of the island, where these military activities were concentrated, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985. Context_3 : The Battle of the Philippine Sea (June 19\u201320, 1944) was a major naval battle of World War II that eliminated the Imperial Japanese Navy's ability to conduct large-scale carrier actions. It took place during the United States' amphibious invasion of the Mariana Islands during the Pacific War. The battle was the last of five major \"carrier-versus-carrier\" engagements between American and Japanese naval forces, and pitted elements of the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet against ships and aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy's Mobile Fleet and nearby island garrisons. This was the largest carrier-to-carrier battle in history. Context_4 : The \"Gato\"-class were a class of submarines built for the United States Navy and launched in 1941\u20131943; they were the first mass-production U.S. submarine class of World War II. Together with their near-sisters the \"Balao\" and \"Tench\"\u00a0class es, their design formed the majority of the United States Navy's World War II submarine fleet. Named after the lead ship of the class, USS\u00a0\"Gato\" , the \"Gato\"s and their successors formed the core of the submarine service that was largely responsible for the destruction of the Japanese merchant marine and a large portion of the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II. \"Gato\"' s name comes from a species of small catshark. Like most other U.S. Navy submarines of the period, boats of the \"Gato\" class were given the names of marine creatures. In some references, the \"Gato\"s are combined with their successors, especially the \"Balao\" class. Context_5 : The Dungcas Beach Defense Guns are an old World War II Japanese fortification in the United States territory of Guam. It consists of a tunnel dug in the coral limestone of the cliffs overlooking the beach on the northeast east side of Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a Bay on the west side of the island. The tunnel has two guns mounted at openings facing the beach. This fortification was built by the 48th Independent Mixed Brigade of the 29th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, during its occupation of the island 1941-44. The guns from this position were probably fired on landing Allied forces during the 1944 Battle of Guam, in which the United States retook the island. Context_6 : Attu (Aleut: \"Atan\" ) is the westernmost and largest island in the Near Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and the westernmost point of land relative to Alaska, the United States, North America and the Americas. The island became uninhabited in 2010. Context_7 : A carrier battle group (CVBG) consists of an aircraft carrier (designated CV) and its large number of escorts, together defining the group. The first naval task forces built around carriers appeared just prior to and during World War II. The Imperial Japanese Navy, IJN, was the first to assemble a large number of carriers into a single task force, known as Kido Butai. This task force was used with devastating effect in the Imperial Japanese Navy's Attack on Pearl Harbor. Kido Butai operated as the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the Battle of Midway. In contrast, the United States Navy deployed its large carriers in separate formations, with each carrier assigned its own cruiser and destroyer escorts. These single-carrier formations would often be paired or grouped together for certain assignments, most notably the Battle of the Coral Sea and Midway. By 1943, however, large numbers of fleet and light carriers became available, which required larger formations of three or four carriers. These groups eventually formed the Fast Carrier Task Force, which became the primary battle unit of the U.S. Fifth and Third Fleets. Context_8 : The 23rd Infantry Division, more commonly known as the Americal Division, of the United States Army was activated 27 May 1942 on the island of New Caledonia. In the immediate emergency following Pearl Harbor, the United States had hurriedly sent three individual regiments to defend New Caledonia against a feared Japanese attack. This division was the only division formed outside of United States territory during World War II (a distinction it would repeat when reformed during the Vietnam War). At the suggestion of a subordinate, the division's commander, Major General Alexander Patch, requested that the new unit be known as the \"Americal Division\"\u2014the name being a contraction of \"American, New Caledonian Division\". This was unusual, as most U.S. divisions are known by a number. After World War II the Americal Division was officially re-designated as the 23rd Infantry Division. However, it was rarely referred to as such, even on official orders. Context_9 : Captain Eikichi Kato was a senior officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Kato was the senior officer of the Imperial Japanese Navy forces on the Bonis Peninsula and Buka Island during the latter stages of World War II. Context_10 : The Imperial Japanese Navy fielded naval paratroopers during World War II. The troops were officially part of the Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF or \"Rikusentai\"). They came from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Yokosuka SNLFs. The 2nd Yokosuka took no part in any airborne operations and became an island defensive base unit. They were under the operational control of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS or \"Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kaigun Koku Hombu\"). \"Rikusentai\" paratroopers should not be confused with the Imperial Japanese Army paratroopers, known as \"Teishin\". fact_1 : The Japanese Occupation Site on Kiska island (along with Attu Island) in the Rat Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska is where the Japanese Navy attacked and occupied United States territory during World War II. fact_2 :  The island became uninhabited in 2010.

Context_6 : Mormonism and Mormon adherents have been subjected to, as well as in a few instances themselves used, significant violence throughout much of the religion's history. In the early history of the United States, violence was used as a form of control. Many people of different faiths used violence in order to harass and persecute people who adhered to different religious beliefs. The members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, especially in its early history, were both the victims and sometimes the perpetrators of violence in much the same way as were the followers of other major religions. Mormons were violently persecuted and pushed from Ohio to Missouri, from Missouri to Illinois and from Illinois, they were pushed west to the Utah Territory. There were incidents of massacre, home burning and pillaging, followed by the murder of their founder, Joseph Smith. However, there were also a few notable incidents in which Latter-day Saints perpetrated violence, such as the Mountain Meadows massacre.

The massacre was wrongly blamed on the communists. For four decades the South Korean government concealed this massacre. Survivors were forbidden by the government from revealing it, under suspicion of being communist sympathizers. Public revelation carried with it the threat of torture and death. During the 1990s and onwards, several corpses were excavated from mass graves, resulting in public awareness of the massacre. Context_8 : Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances. Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure. Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's. Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed. Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion. Thus the birth of Modifications. It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance. FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence. Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal. Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash. Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them. Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s. During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions. The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices. During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization. Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow. The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'. that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow. Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead. This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder. The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally. The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally. Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions. Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason. Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification. Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds. While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008. The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate. It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders. Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned. Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public. Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification. Context_9 : The Niles Canyon ghost story is the Northern California variation on the vanishing hitchhiker archetype. There are many different variations of this story depending on whom you ask. All stories include a girl being involved in some sort of motorized vehicle accident on February 26 (year often changed). One variation of the story includes a girl being involved in a car crash on Niles Canyon road (off the 680 freeway in Sunol, California) on the way to her prom. The girl died on impact and to this day is said to haunt Niles Canyon road every February 26. The tale of the haunting goes that people traveling along Niles Canyon road (now Highway 84) on the night of February 26 will see a normal-looking high school-aged girl walking along the road in a prom dress (many people have said it is white). People traveling along the road (mostly those traveling alone) have said to have stopped and offered the girl a ride. She accepts the ride, giving the driver an address across the bridge (either Dumbarton or Bay Bridge depending on the storyteller). Once the driver gets to the beginning of the bridge, the girl will disappear. Sometimes people have gone to the address to find that a girl many years ago matching that description once lived there. Today, many people will travel along this treacherous pitch black road in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Niles Canyon ghost. Context_10 : The El Ayyat train disaster happened at 02:00 on the morning of 20 February 2002 in an eleven-carriage passenger train travelling from Cairo to Luxor. A cooking gas cylinder exploded in the fifth carriage, creating a fire which engulfed seven third-class carriages, reducing them almost to cinders. The initial number of dead given by officials at the time was 383, all Egyptians. However, considering that seven carriages were burnt to the ground, and each carriage was packed with at least double the maximum carrying capacity of 150, this number is considered by many people to be a great underestimate. The dubious nature of the given death toll lies with the absence of a full passenger list; accounting for those missing was almost impossible at the time. In addition, the fire was so intense and the carriages so badly burned that many corpses had been reduced to ash.

Rimsky-Korsakov wrote the libretto, which he based on the first act of the play \"The Maid of Pskov\" by Lev Alexandrovich Mey. The opera was composed in 1898 from material omitted from the second version of Rimsky-Korsakov's setting of the play as an opera. The first and third versions of the opera \"The Maid of Pskov\" omit the first act of the play. Context_6 : Sadko, Op. 5, is a \"musical tableau\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, written in 1867 and revised in 1869 and 1892. It is sometimes called the first symphonic poem written in Russia. It was first performed in 1867 at a concert of the Russian Musical Society (RMS), conducted by Mily Balakirev. Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote an opera of the same name which quotes freely from the earlier work. From the tone poem the composer quoted its most memorable passages in the opera, including the opening theme of the swelling sea, and other themes as leitmotives - he himself set out to \"utilize for this opera the material of my symphonic poem, and, in any event, to make use of its motives as leading motives for the opera\".

This research area and its name originated in a 1936 paper by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann, who were attempting to reconcile the apparent inconsistency of classical logic with the facts concerning the measurement of complementary variables in quantum mechanics, such as position and momentum. Context_2 : In mathematics, Jordan operator algebras are real or complex Jordan algebras with the compatible structure of a Banach space. When the coefficients are real numbers, the algebras are called Jordan Banach algebras. The theory has been extensively developed only for the subclass of JB algebras. The axioms for these algebras were devised by . Those that can be realised concretely as subalgebras of self-adjoint operators on a real or complex Hilbert space with the operator Jordan product and the operator norm are called JC algebras. The axioms for complex Jordan operator algebras, first suggested by Irving Kaplansky in 1976, require an involution and are called JB* algebras or Jordan C* algebras. By analogy with the abstract characterisation of von Neumann algebras as C* algebras for which the underlying Banach space is the dual of another, there is a corresponding definition of JBW algebras. Those that can be realised using ultraweakly closed Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators with the operator Jordan product are called JW algebras. The JBW algebras with trivial center, so-called JBW factors, are classified in terms of von Neumann factors: apart from the exceptional 27 dimensional Albert algebra and the spin factors, all other JBW factors are isomorphic either to the self-adjoint part of a von Neumann factor or to its fixed point algebra under a period two *-anti-automorphism. Jordan operator algebras have been applied in quantum mechanics and in complex geometry, where Koecher's description of bounded symmetric domains using Jordan algebras has been extended to infinite dimensions. Context_3 : The MANIAC (Mathematical Analyzer, Numerical Integrator, and Computer\" or Mathematical Analyzer, Numerator, Integrator, and Computer\") was an early computer built under the direction of Nicholas Metropolis at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. It was based on the von Neumann architecture of the IAS, developed by John von Neumann. As with all computers of its era, it was a one-of-a-kind machine that could not exchange programs with other computers (even other IAS machines). Metropolis chose the name MANIAC in the hope of stopping the rash of silly acronyms for machine names, although von Neumann may have suggested the name to him. Context_4 : Henry Pierce Stapp (born March 23, 1928 in Cleveland, Ohio) is an American mathematical physicist, known for his work in quantum mechanics, particularly the development of axiomatic S-matrix theory, the proofs of strong nonlocality properties, and the place of free will in the \"orthodox\" quantum mechanics of John von Neumann. Context_5 : The book Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics (1932) by John von Neumann is an important early work in the development of quantum theory. Context_6 : John von Neumann ( ; Hungarian: \"Neumann J\u00e1nos Lajos\" , ] ; December 28, 1903 \u2013 February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and computer scientist. He made major contributions to a number of fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics, functional analysis, ergodic theory, representation theory, operator algebras, geometry, topology, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, and quantum statistical mechanics), economics (game theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics. Context_7 : The John von Neumann Award, named after John von Neumann is given annually by the Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies (Budapest, Hungary), to an outstanding scholar in the exact social sciences, whose works have had substantial influence over a long period of time on the studies and intellectual activity of the students of the college. The award was established in 1994 and is given annually. In 2013, separately from the annual prize, Kenneth J. Arrow was given the Honorary John von Neumann Award. Context_8 : In mathematics and functional analysis a direct integral is a generalization of the concept of direct sum. The theory is most developed for direct integrals of Hilbert spaces and direct integrals of von Neumann algebras. The concept was introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann in one of the papers in the series \"On Rings of Operators\". One of von Neumann's goals in this paper was to reduce the classification of (what are now called) von Neumann algebras on separable Hilbert spaces to the classification of so-called factors. Factors are analogous to full matrix algebras over a field, and von Neumann wanted to prove a continuous analogue of the Artin\u2013Wedderburn theorem classifying semi-simple rings.

For a quantum-mechanical system described by a density matrix \u03c1 , the von Neumann entropy is Context_10 : Grete (Henry-)Hermann (March 2, 1901 \u2013 April 15, 1984) was a German mathematician and philosopher noted for her work in mathematics, physics, philosophy and education. She is noted for her early philosophical work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, and is now known most of all for an early, but long-ignored refutation of a \"no-hidden-variable theorem\" by John von Neumann. The disputed theorem and the fact that Hermann's critique of this theorem remained nearly unknown for decades are considered to have had a strong influence on the development of quantum mechanics. fact_1 : The book Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics (1932) by John von Neumann is an important early work in the development of quantum theory. fact_2 : John von Neumann ( ; Hungarian: \"Neumann J\u00e1nos Lajos\" , ] ; December 28, 1903 \u2013 February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and computer scientist.

Its first volume was published in 1952, under the name Journal of Rational Mechanics and Analysis and edited by V\u00e1clav Hlavat\u00fd and Clifford Truesdell. In 1957, Eberhard Hopf became editor, the journal name changed to the Journal of Mathematics and Mechanics, and Truesdell founded a separate successor journal, the \"Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis\", now published by Springer-Verlag. The \"Journal of Mathematics and Mechanics\" later changed its name again to the present name. s of 2013 , the managing editor is Chris Judge. Context_2 : Alexandru Froda (July 16, 1894, Bucharest, Romania \u2013 October 7, 1973, Bucharest, Romania) was a well-known Romanian mathematician with important contributions in the field of mathematical analysis, algebra, number theory and rational mechanics. In his 1929 thesis he proved what is now known as Froda's theorem. Context_3 : Some programming languages provide a built-in (primitive) rational data type to represent rational numbers like 1/3 and -11/17 without rounding, and to do arithmetic on them. Examples are the codice_1 type of Common Lisp, and analogous types provided by most languages for algebraic computation, such as Mathematica and Maple. Many languages that do not have a built-in rational type still provide it as a library-defined type. Context_4 : In mathematics, the rational points on the unit circle are those points (\"x\",\u00a0\"y\") such that both \"x\" and \"y\" are rational numbers (\"fractions\") and satisfy \"x\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"y\"\u00a0=\u00a01. The set of such points turns out to be closely related to primitive Pythagorean triples. Consider a primitive right triangle, that is, with integral side lengths \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", with \"c\" the hypotenuse, such that the sides have no common factor larger than\u00a01. Then on the unit circle there exists the rational point (\"a\"/\"c\",\u00a0\"b\"/\"c\"), which, in the complex plane, is just \"a\"/\"c\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"ib\"/\"c\", where \"i\" is the imaginary unit. Conversely, if (\"x\",\u00a0\"y\") is a rational point on the unit circle in the 1st quadrant of the coordinate system (i.e. \"x\"\u00a0>\u00a00, \"y\"\u00a0>\u00a00), then there exists a primitive right triangle with sides\u00a0\"xc\",\u00a0\"yc\",\u00a0\"c\", with \"c\" being the least common multiple of \"x\" and \"y\" denominators. There is a correspondence between points (\"x\",\"y\") in the \"x\"-\"y\" plane and points \"x\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"iy\" in the complex plane which will be used below, with (\"a\",\u00a0\"b\") taken as equal to\u00a0\"a\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"ib\". Context_5 : The .LBR file format was an archive file format used on CP/M and DOS operating systems during the early 1980s. .LBR files were created by the LU program; later programs like NULU arrived for .LBR creation, and many tools such as LT and QL were capable of extracting from .LBR archives. .LBR is an abbreviation of \"Library\", and, resembling the .tar file format, member files were only stored in the .LBR file, not compressed. As transfer of LBR files by modem was common, it was typical practice for archiving a collection of files to compress them using the SQ or CRUNCH programs then store them in an .LBR archive, or else (more rarely) store the files in the LBR archive, then use SQ or CRUNCH to compress the archive. A compressed LBR archive file was given the extension \".LQR\" (if squeezed) or \".LZR\" (if crunched); however, it was more common to compress the members of the archive than to compress the archive as a whole. Context_6 : Damage mechanics is concerned with the representation, or modeling, of damage of materials that is suitable for making engineering predictions about the initiation, propagation, and fracture of materials without resorting to a microscopic description that would be too complex for practical engineering analysis. Damage mechanics illustrates the typical engineering approach to model complex phenomena. To quote Dusan Krajcinovic, \"It is often argued that the ultimate task of engineering research is to provide not so much a better insight into the examined phenomenon but to supply a rational predictive tool applicable in design\". Damage mechanics is a topic of applied mechanics that relies heavily on continuum mechanics. Most of the work on damage mechanics uses state variables to represent the \"effects\" of damage on the stiffness and remaining life of the material that is damaging as a result of thermomechanical load and ageing. The state variables may be measurable, e.g., crack density, or inferred from the \"effect\" they have on some macroscopic property, such as stiffness, coefficient of thermal expansion, remaining life, etc. The state variables have conjugate thermodynamic forces that motivate further damage. Initially the material is pristine, or \"intact\". A damage activation criterion is needed to predict damage initiation. Damage evolution does not progresses spontaneously after initiation, thus requiring a damage evolution model. In plasticity like formulations, the damage evolution is controlled by a hardening function but this requires additional phenomenological parameters that must be found through experimentation, which is expensive, time consuming, and virtually no one does. On the other hand, micromechanics of damage formulations are able to predict both damage initiation and evolution without additional material properties. Context_7 : An integer triangle or integral triangle is a triangle all of whose sides have lengths that are integers. A rational triangle can be defined as one having all sides with rational length; any such rational triangle can be integrally rescaled (can have all sides multiplied by the same integer, namely a common multiple of their denominators) to obtain an integer triangle, so there is no substantive difference between integer triangles and rational triangles in this sense. Note however, that other definitions of the term \"rational triangle\" also exist: In 1914 Carmichael used the term in the sense that we today use the term Heronian triangle; Somos uses it to refer to triangles whose ratios of sides are rational; Conway and Guy define a rational triangle as one with rational sides and rational angles measured in degrees\u2014in which case the only rational triangle is the rational-sided equilateral triangle. Context_8 : Morton E. Gurtin is a mechanical engineer who became a mathematician and \"de facto\" mathematical physicist. He is an emeritus professor of mathematical sciences at Carnegie-Mellon University, where for many years he held an endowed chair as the Alumni Professor of Mathematical Science. His main work is in materials science, in the form of the mathematical, rational mechanics of non-linear continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, in the style of Clifford Truesdell and Walter Noll, a field also known under the combined name of \"continuum thermomechanics\". He has published over 250 papers, many among them in Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis, as well as a number of books. Context_9 : The Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis is a scientific journal that is devoted to research in mechanics as a deductive, mathematical science. The current editors in chief of the journal are John M. Ball and Richard D. James. It was founded in 1956 by Clifford Truesdell when he moved from Indiana University to Johns Hopkins and lost control of a similar journal he had founded a few years previously, the \"Journal of Rational Mechanics and Analysis\" (now the \"Indiana University Mathematics Journal\"). Context_10 : Lumped damage mechanics or LDM is a branch of structural mechanics that is concerned with the analysis of frame structures. It is based on continuum damage mechanics and fracture mechanics. It combines the ideas of these theories with the concept of plastic hinge LDM can be defined as the fracture mechanics of complex structural systems. In the models of LDM, cracking or local buckling as well as plasticity are lumped at the inelastic hinges. As in continuum damage mechanics, LDM uses state variables to represent the effects of damage on the remaining stiffness and strength of the frame structure. In reinforced concrete structures, the damage state variable quantifies the crack density in the plastic hinge zone; in unreinforced concrete components and steel beams, it is a dimensionless measure of the crack surface; in tubular steel elements, the damage variable measures the degree of local buckling The LDM evolution laws can be derived from continuum damage mechanics or fracture mechanics. In the latter case, concepts such as the energy release rate or the stress intensity factor of a plastic hinge are introduced. LDM allows for the numerical simulation of the collapse of complex structures with a fraction of the computational cost and human effort of its continuum mechanics counterparts. LDM is also a regularization procedure that eliminates the mesh-dependence phenomenon that is observed in structural analysis with local damage models fact_1 :  He is an emeritus professor of mathematical sciences at Carnegie-Mellon University, where for many years he held an endowed chair as the Alumni Professor of Mathematical Science. fact_2 : The Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis is a scientific journal that is devoted to research in mechanics as a deductive, mathematical science.

However, Notre Dame was selected as the National Champions by 10 other polls and the Oklahoma Sooners received first in 2 polls. However, despite the team receiving National Championship rings, the University of Notre Dame does not recognize this title due to their policy of only recognizing AP or coaches' poll titles during the polling era (1936-present). Maryland was also the first champion of the Atlantic Coast Conference, which had been formed earlier in 1953 by seven colleges formerly with the Southern Conference.

However, over the centuries its meaning and import have undergone considerable variations. In the earliest period, the term was used to denote Atma-vidya, the science of the soul, in contrast to Adhyatma-vidya, the spiritual science, or Brahma-vidya, the divine science. In Manu Smriti the term \u0100nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012b has been used as equivalent to Atma-vidya and it has been described as a branch of the Vedas. In the fourth century BCE, Kautilya in his Arthashastra recognised it as a distinct branch of learning different from Vedas and other disciplines. Kautilya classifies all disciplines into four categories: scripture (the three Vedas, \"trayi\"), agriculture and commerce (\"varta\"), politics and public administration (\"danda-niti\"), and \"\u0100nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012b\", the investigative reflective science. The distinction between Atma-vidya and \u0100nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012b is that while the former embodied certain dogmatic assertions about the nature of the soul, the latter contained reasons supporting those assertions. Thus \u0100nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012b dealt with two subjects, namely, \"atma\", soul, and \"hetu\", theory of reasons. The Samkhya, Yoga, and Lokayata, in so far as they treated of reasons affirming or denying the existence of soul, were included by Kautilya in the \u0100nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012b. Of the two subjects studied in the ambit of \u0100nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012b, the study of soul later developed and matured into a separate independent study described by the term \"Darsanas\" (meaning philosophy), and the theory of reasons was developed into an independent branch of study referred to as \"Nyaya\" or logic. This bifurcation of \u0100nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012b into philosophy and logic must have had its beginning in around 550 BCE with the exposition of the logical side of \u0100nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012b by Medhatithi Gautama. However the term \u0100nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012b has been in use in the general sense of a science embracing both the science of soul and the theory of reasons.

Context_7 : Peter Milo Shane (born 1952) is a law professor and writer. His best-known scholarly work focuses mainly on two subjects. The first is separation of powers law, especially law and the presidency. His work often explores what he calls an institutional conception of the rule of law in a separation of powers regime. See, e.g., Peter M, Shane, \"When Inter-branch Norms Break Down: Of Arms-for-Hostages, 'Orderly Shutdowns,' Presidential Impeachments, and Judicial 'Coups,' 12 Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy 503 (2004). \"Under Shane's antiformalist conception, the rule of law is sustained not only by formal legal rules, but perhaps most importantly, by informal norms and conventional behaviors designed to maintain interbranch accountability even when public officials could ignore formal rules with impunity. Peter M. Shane, \"Madison's Nightmare: How Executive Power Threatens American Democracy\" 116 (University of Chicago Press, 2009). Checks and balances in such a system likewise \u201cdepend on an assemblage of norms, cooperative arrangements, and informal coordination activities.\u201d Id.

Context_9 : The semantic feature comparison model is used \"to derive predictions about categorization times in a situation where a subject must rapidly decide whether a test item is a member of a particular target category\". In this semantic model, there is an assumption that certain occurrences are categorized using its features or attributes of the two subjects that represent the part and the group. A statement often used to explain this model is \"a robin is a bird\". The meaning of the words \"robin\" and \"bird\" are stored in the memory by virtue of a list of features which can be used to ultimately define their categories, although the extent of their association with a particular category varies. Context_10 : Rory Goes to Holyrood is a 2013 satirical documentary presented by Scottish impressionist and comedian Rory Bremner. Aired by BBC Two Scotland on 13 June 2013, the hour-long programme takes a satirical look at Scottish politics and the independence debate, two subjects that had largely seen an absence of humour up to that point. The film sees Bremner visit the Scottish Parliament and interview politicians and other senior public figures as he gets to grips with the issues of the Scottish political scene. Bremner recorded the programme after moving back to live in Scotland and realising he knew very little about the politics of that country. fact_1 :  His major research interests lie in the fields of Economics, Social Theory and Policy, and Women's Issues. fact_2 : Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (Bengali: \u0997\u09be\u09af\u09bc\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09c0 \u099a\u0995\u09cd\u09b0\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09c0 \u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09bf\u09ad\u09be\u0995 , born 24 February 1942) is an Indian scholar, literary theorist, and feminist critic.

Christine Wilson was installed as Dean on 22 October 2016. Context_2 : Lincoln Cathedral or the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Lincoln, and sometimes St. Mary's Cathedral in Lincoln, England is the seat of the Anglican bishop. Building commenced in 1088 and continued in several phases throughout the medieval period. It was the tallest building in the world for 238 years (1311\u20131549), and the first building to hold that title after the Great Pyramid of Giza. The central spire collapsed in 1549 and was not rebuilt. The cathedral is the third largest in Britain (in floor area) after St Paul's and York Minster, being 484 by . It is highly regarded by architectural scholars; the eminent Victorian writer John Ruskin declared: \"I have always held... that the cathedral of Lincoln is out and out the most precious piece of architecture in the British Isles and roughly speaking worth any two other cathedrals we have.\" Context_3 : The Lincoln Cathedral Library is a library of Lincoln Cathedral, Lincolnshire, England. Context_4 : Robert Bloet (sometimes Robert Bloett; died 1123) was Bishop of Lincoln 1093-1123 and Chancellor of England. Born into a noble Norman family, he became a royal clerk under King William I. Under William I's son and successor King William II, Bloet was first named chancellor then appointed to the See of Lincoln. Continuing to serve the king while bishop, Bloet remained a close royal councillor to William II's successor, King Henry I. He did much to embellish Lincoln Cathedral, and gave generously to his cathedral and other religious houses. He educated a number of noblemen, including illegitimate children of Henry I. He also was the patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, and was an early patron of Gilbert of Sempringham, the founder of the Gilbertine monastic order. Context_5 : William George (died 1756) was an English churchman and academic, Provost of King's College, Cambridge from 1743 and Dean of Lincoln from 1748. Context_6 : The Old Bishop's Palace is an historic visitor attraction in the city of Lincoln, Lincolnshire. When it was first built, in the late 12th century, it was at the centre of the vast Diocese of Lincoln, which stretched from the Humber to the Thames. The Palace was one of the most impressive buildings of medieval England, reflecting the power and wealth of Lincoln\u2019s bishops. It is situated on a spectacular hillside site, just below Lincoln cathedral, providing extensive views over the city. The site lies immediately to the south of the Roman wall which had become the medieval defensive wall of the \"Bail\", which enclosed both Lincoln Castle and Lincoln Cathedral. The palace was damaged during the Civil War and subsequently largely abandoned. During the period that followed the Bishop\u2019s main residence was Buckden Palace in Huntingdonshire. In 1841, following the reduction in size of the Diocese of Lincoln, the Bishop moved to Riseholme, to the north of Lincoln. This proved inconvenient and Riseholme was sold. In 1886 an older building on the western side of the Palace enclosure was substantially rebuilt and enlarged in a Tudor revival style by the architect Ewan Christian. A further change occurred in 1888 when the architects Bodley and Garner rebuilt and converted the southern portion of the medieval Great Hall into a chapel for the Bishop. Context_7 : Colin Walsh is an English organist, who has played many recitals in various religious venues in England as well as two at the Royal Festival Hall. He has also played in many European countries and New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the USA. Some of his work has been released on the Priory label. He has worked as an organist or assistant organist at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle; Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford; Salisbury Cathedral (1978-1985); St. Albans Cathedral (1985-1988); and Lincoln Cathedral. In July 2002 there were plans to sack Walsh, whom The Telegraph described as \"one of Europe's finest church organists\", after differences with the Precentor, Andrew Stokes; however this plan was dropped and he was given a new role. Since January 2003 he has been Organist Laureate of Lincoln Cathedral. Context_8 : Abraham Haywood (1692\u20131747) was an architect who was born at Whitchurch, Shropshire and is likely to have come to Lincoln around 1720 to work for Francis Smith of Warwick on the construction of St Peter at Arches Church, Lincoln. In 1736 he built the town house of the Disney family, Disney Place in Eastgate Street, Lincoln and in 1744 the Lincoln Assembly Rooms in the Bail, Lincoln. He also built a house for himself on the east side of St Peter at Arches\u2018 graveyard on the site of the Lincoln Taylor\u2019s Hall. Abraham Hayward\u2019s younger brother John Hayward(1708-78), a mason by trade, also accompanied him to Lincoln. After Abraham\u2019s death, he presumably continued the business and in 1753 rebuilt St Mary\u2019s bridge in Lincoln. John Hayward\u2019s grandson, William Hayward became surveyor to Lincoln Cathedral. Context_9 : The Nidaros Cathedral West Front (\"Nidarosdomens Vestfront\"), which includes multiple sculptures, was the final portion of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, Norway that was restored. This is the cathedral's main facade and one of the most beautiful and ornate portions of the church. The restoration of the west face structure took place from 1901 through 1969, and the last statue was erected in 1983. This part of the church is also the most recent of the original cathedral constructions; archbishop Sigurd Eindrideson laid the cornerstone for the west front in 1248. The construction was not yet complete when the church was burnt in 1328. The original design for the west face is not known, but one can assume that it was never built to those original plans; it is reasonable to assume that a screen front similar to that used elsewhere was planned on the west. Screen fronts were often rectangular and served as a cover to conceal the rest of the church. English cathedrals from the same period, among others Lincoln Cathedral, Wells Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral, had similar fronts. The west front had three entrances and is flanked by two smaller towers on each side of the fa\u00e7ade. Context_10 : William Haywood (died probably in 1823) was an architect who worked in Lincoln, England. His father John who died in 1817 was mayor of Lincoln twice and worked as a mason. Haywood succeeded his father as mayor after his death in 1817. His grandfather, John Hayward (1708\u201378) was also a mason in Lincoln. William Hayward's great grandfather was Abraham Haywood an architect of Whitchurch, Shropshire who came to Lincoln around 1720. William Haywood succeeded William Lumby as Surveyor to Lincoln Cathedral in 1799 and Edward James Willson followed him in this position in 1823.

It was created in 1549 by Spain in the area around the R\u00edo de la Plata. Context_3 : Argentina has had many different types of heads of state, as well as many different types of government. During Pre-Columbian times the territories that today form Argentina were inhabited by nomadic tribes, without any defined government. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the King of Spain retained the ultimate authority over the territories conquered in the New World, appointing viceroys for local government. The territories that would later become Argentina were first part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, and then the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. The May Revolution started the Argentine War of Independence by replacing the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros with the first national government. It was the Primera Junta, a junta of several members, which would grow into the Junta Grande with the incorporation of provincial deputies. The size of the Juntas gave room to internal political disputes among their members, so they were replaced by the First and Second Triumvirate, of three members. The Assembly of the Year XIII created a new executive authority, with attributions similar to that of a head of state, called the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata. A second Assembly, the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n, declared independence in 1816 and promulgated the Argentine Constitution of 1819. However, this constitution was repealed during armed conflicts between the central government and the \"Federal League\" Provinces. This started a period known as the \"Anarchy of the Year XX\", when Argentina lacked any type of head of state.

Context_3 : The 1985 New York Giants season was the 61st season for the club in the National Football League (NFL). The Giants entered the season looking to improve on their 9\u20137 record in 1984, which was enough to qualify the team for the playoffs as the second wild-card team, and to return to the playoffs for the second consecutive year under third-year head coach Bill Parcells. The Giants managed to do both, finishing with 10 victories for the first time since 1963 when the team won 11 games and finishing as the first wild-card team which earned the Giants a home playoff game at Giants Stadium. They defeated the San Francisco 49ers 17\u20133 in that game, avenging their loss to the 49ers in the previous year's divisional playoffs. However, it was as far as the Giants could get as they were defeated by the eventual Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears in the divisional round at Soldier Field 21\u20130.

Hagemeister Park was a park owned by the Hagemeister brewery; during games ropes were set-up around the field and attendees either walked up or parked their cars nearby and used them for seats. After the first season, a small grandstand was built and the field was fenced off. Green Bay East High School was built at the location of Hagemeister Park in 1922, which forced the Packers to move to Bellevue Park, a small minor league baseball stadium that seated 5,000.

However, the Jets struggled with their third consecutive 3-11 season. They won a major off the field court decision. As per the memorandum of understanding signed in late 1961 by team original owner (as the New York Titans) Harry Wismer, Shea Stadium's co-tenants, the New York Mets, would have exclusive use of the stadium until they had completed their season. The Jets were, in most years, required to open the season with several road games, a problem made worse in 1969 and 1973 when the Mets had long playoff runs. Feeling that this arrangement was a disadvantage, the team announced in 1977 that they would play two home games a year during the month of September at the Giants' new home in New Jersey, Giants Stadium. Litigation began between New York City and the Jets over the issue, and in the lawsuit's settlement, the city agreed to allow the Jets to play two September home games a season at Shea beginning in 1978 for the remaining six years in the Jets' lease. In 1977, the Jets were to play one September game at Giants Stadium and an October 2 game at Shea. From 1967 through this season\u2014a span of 11 seasons\u2014the Jets did not play a home game at Shea Stadium in the month of September.

Context_7 : The New York Cosmos (simply the Cosmos in 1977\u20131978) was an American professional soccer club based in New York City and its suburbs. The team played home games in three stadiums around New York before moving in 1977 to Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey, where it remained for the rest of its history. Founded in 1970, the team competed in the North American Soccer League (NASL) until 1984 and was the strongest franchise in that league, both competitively and financially\u00a0\u2013 based largely around its backing by Warner Communications President Steve Ross, which enabled it to sign internationally famous stars such as the Brazilian forward Pel\u00e9, Italian striker Giorgio Chinaglia and the West German sweeper Franz Beckenbauer. The acquisition of these foreign players, particularly Pel\u00e9, made the Cosmos into what Gavin Newsham called \"the most glamorous team in world football\", and contributed to the development of soccer across the United States, a country where it had previously been largely ignored. Context_8 : The 1984 New York Jets season was the 25th season for the team and the 15th in the National Football League. It began with the team trying to improve upon its 7\u20139 record from 1983 under head coach Joe Walton. After playing the previous 20 seasons at Shea Stadium in Queens, 1984 marked their first season of playing its home games at Giants Stadium in The Meadowlands, which was also the home of the NFC's New York Giants. Mark Gastineau made NFL history by recording 22 sacks, to establish a then new official single season record. The Jets finished the season with a record of 7\u20139. Context_9 : The Hartford Colonials, originally the New York Sentinels, were a professional American football team that played in the United Football League in its 2009 and 2010 seasons. A charter member of the UFL, the Sentinels began play in 2009 nominally representing New York City but playing its home games in three stadiums, none of which were in the city proper: Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Connecticut; Shuart Stadium in Hempstead, New York (on Long Island); and the now-demolished Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (The Sentinels had scheduled a game for Citi Field in Queens but relocated that game to Long Island.) As the Colonials, the team played all of its home games at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, representing the adjacent city of Hartford. League-wide financial problems and the high rate of rent at \"The Rent\" led to the league suspending the Colonials' operations in August 2011, a month before it would have begun play in its third season. The league had stated that the Colonials could be brought back for the 2012 UFL season, if it were to be played, but the announcement of the 2012 season removed Hartford's logo (which had remained on the site in 2011, with indication it had been suspended) from the UFL Web site and did not include the team in the league's 2012 schedule. Context_10 : The 1973 New York Giants season was the 49th season for the club in the National Football League. The season saw the Giants attempting to improve on their 8-6 record from 1972. However, the Giants suffered one of the worst seasons in franchise history, winning only 2 games, while losing 11, and tying a game. The 2 wins were against the Houston Oilers and the St. Louis Cardinals while the tie was against archrival Philadelphia, in what turned out to be the last game the Giants would ever play at Yankee Stadium before playing their final 5 home games at the Yale Bowl in Connecticut. They moved to Shea Stadium in 1975 and to Giants Stadium in 1976. The 2 wins by the Giants equalled the second fewest the team had ever posted in any season and it was their worst season since a 1-12-1 record in 1966. After the season, head coach Alex Webster was fired and replaced the following season by Bill Arnsparger. fact_1 :  In 1983, he became owner of the New Jersey Generals, he sold the team to Donald Trump after the 1983 USFL season. fact_2 :  Home games were played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which was called The Meadowlands for Generals games.

After the war, the German official historians of the \"Reichsarchiv\" and other writers, described the plan as a blueprint for victory. German historians claimed that the plan had been ruined by \"Generaloberst\" (Colonel-General) Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, the Commander-in-Chief of the German army after Schlieffen retired in 1906, who was dismissed after the First Battle of the Marne (5\u201312 September 1914). Context_2 : The Battle of Elchingen, fought on 14 October 1805, saw French forces under Michel Ney rout an Austrian corps led by Johann Sigismund Riesch.

During the Ulm Campaign, Murat led his horsemen in successfully hunting down many Austrian Empire units that escaped the Capitulation of Ulm. Murat's horsemen fought at Austerlitz in December 1805. Under Murat, the Cavalry Reserve played a prominent role in the destruction of the Kingdom of Prussia's armies after the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt in 1806. Five dragoon divisions of the corps were employed in the Peninsular War starting in 1808 and placed under the overall command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessi\u00e8res. The Cavalry Reserve was reassembled in 1809 to fight Austria with Bessi\u00e8res still in command.

Consequently, the Allies planned to engage and defeat the French Marshals and Generals separately, and thus weaken his army while they built up an overwhelming force even he could not defeat. It was decided upon after a series of defeats and near disasters by the Coalition at Napoleon's hands at the battles of L\u00fctzen, Bautzen and Dresden. The plan ultimately worked and at the Battle of Leipzig, where the Allies had a considerable numerical advantage, the Emperor was soundly defeated and driven out of Germany, across the Rhine back into France itself. The plan was an amalgam of two prior works: The Trachenberg Protocol and the Reichenbach Plan, authored by the Austrian chief of staff of the allied coalition, Radetzky and the Swedish Crown Prince Charles John (formerly Napoleon's marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte) whose experience with the tactics and methods of the French Army, as well as personal insight on the mind of Napoleon, proved invaluable.

Context_9 : The cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics, proposed by Anthony Aguirre and Max Tegmark, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that applies in the context of eternal cosmological inflation, which arguably predicts an infinite three-dimensional space with infinitely many planets and infinitely many copies of any quantum system. According to this interpretation, the wavefunction for a quantum system describes not some imaginary ensemble of possibilities for what the system might be doing, but rather the actual spatial collection of identical copies of the system that exist in our infinite space. Its collapse can be avoided.

A castle may have existed at Bourdeilles in the 9th century, but the oldest parts of the current castle date from the early 14th century. The castle consists of an octagonal keep, connected to a two story building of which only the outer walls remain. Next to the old castle, a Renaissance palace was built at the end of the 16th century. Much of the interior decoration has been preserved. The castle and the palace are surrounded by a wall. The entrance gate is protected by two round towers. Since 1919, the ch\u00e2teau has been listed as a \"monument historique\" by the French Ministry of Culture. Context_2 : Southampton Castle was located in the town of Southampton in Hampshire, England. Constructed after the Norman conquest of England, it was located in the north-west corner of the town overlooking the River Test, initially as a wooden motte and bailey design. By the late 12th century the royal castle had been largely converted to stone, playing an important part in the wine trade conducted through the Southampton docks. By the end of the 13th century the castle was in decline, but the threat of French raids in the 1370s led Richard II to undertake extensive rebuilding. The result was a powerfully defended castle, one of the first in England to be equipped with cannon. The castle declined again in the 16th century and was sold off to property speculators in 1618. After being used for various purposes, including the construction of a Gothic mansion in the early 19th century, the site was flattened and largely redeveloped. Only a few elements of the castle still remain visible in Southampton. Context_3 : The fortifications of Kingston upon Hull consisted of three major constructions: the brick built Hull town walls, first established in the early 14th\u00a0century (Edward I), with four main gates, several posterngates, and up to thirty towers at its maximum extent; Hull Castle, on the east bank of the River Hull, protecting Hull's river harbour, constructed in the mid 16th\u00a0century (Henry VIII) and consisting of two blockhouses and a castle connected by a curtain wall; and the later 17th\u00a0century Citadel, an irregular triangular, bastioned, primitive star fort replacing the castle on the east river bank. Context_4 : Rochlitz Castle or Rochlitz Palace (German: \"Schloss Rochlitz\" ) lies in the west of the town of Rochlitz in the county of Mittelsachsen in the Free State of Saxony. It was built on the site of an imperial castle, erected in the second half of the 10th century, which fell into the possession of the Wettin margraves in 1143. Its appearance, which includes several Romanesque wings, is considerably influenced by its remodelling into a margravial \"schloss\" in the fourth quarter of the 14th century. Further conversions and additions followed at the end of the 15th and in the 16th centuries, when the castle became a secondary \"residenz\", dower house and hunting lodge for the Wettin family. The castle or palace was the residence for members of the Saxon princely house eight times. From the 18th century the castle served as an administrative centre (justice department and district court); in 1852 it became a gaol, which necessitated considerable alteration. The museum founded in 1892 was gradually expanded and, today, takes up almost the entire castle. Context_5 : Craignethan Castle is a ruined castle in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is located above the River Nethan, a tributary of the River Clyde, at [ NS816464] . The castle is two miles west of the village of Crossford, and 4.5 miles north-west of Lanark. Built in the first half of the 16th century, Craignethan is recognised as an excellent early example of a sophisticated artillery fortification, although its defences were never fully tested. Context_6 : Intabulation, from the Italian word \"intavolatura\", refers to an arrangement of a vocal or ensemble piece for keyboard, lute, or other plucked string instrument, written in tablature. It was a common practice in 14th\u201316th century keyboard and lute music. A direct effect of intabulation was one of the early advantages of keyboards, the ability to render multiple instruments' music on one instrument. The earliest intabulation is from the mid-14th century Robertsbridge Codex, also one of the first sources of keyboard music still in existence. Some other early sources of intabulated music are the Faenza and Reina manuscripts (from the 14th century) and the Buxheim manuscript (from the 15th century). The Faenza manuscript,the largest of these early manuscripts, written circa 1400, contains pieces written or transcribed in the 14th century, such as those by Francesco Landini and Guillaume de Machaut. More than half of its pieces are intabulations. The large Buxheim manuscript is dominated by intabulations, mainly of prominent composers of the time, including John Dunstaple, Gilles Binchois, Walter Frye, and Guillaume Dufay. The term \"intabulation\" continued to be popular through the 16th century, but fell out of use in the early 17th century, though the practice continued. The exception is the 16th- and 17th-century Italian keyboard pieces which included both vocal and instrumental music. Intabulations contain all the vocal lines of a polyphonic piece, for the most part, although they are sometimes combined or redistributed in order to work better on the instrument the intabulation is intended for, and idiomatic ornaments are sometimes added. Context_7 : MacLellan's Castle in the town of Kirkcudbright, southwest Scotland, was built in the late 16th century. It stands in the centre of Kirkcudbright, on the south side of the River Dee which flows into the Solway Firth. The L-plan castle was the residence of the MacLellan family from whom it derived its name. The family sold the castle in 1752, and from 1782 to 1912 it was held by the Earls of Selkirk. Today, the site is curated by Historic Scotland. Context_8 : Castle Donovan (Irish: \"Caisle\u00e1n U\u00ed Dhonnabh\u00e1in\" ) or Castledonovan or O'Donovan's Castle refer to the remains of an Irish tower house or \"t\u00fartheach\", in a valley near Drimoleague, of medium size which was the so-called \"seat\" of the Clann Cathail sept of the O'Donovans for a period during the 16th century. The original name of the castle, and when the O'Donovans were actually living in it, was Sowagh (or Sooagh, Suagh) before the 17th century. The name of \"Castle Donovan\", after the \"Manor of the Castle of O'Donovan\", is associated with a regrant from James II of England in 1615. Approximately 60 feet in height, it sits on a large rock or outcropping, which forms the ground floor, close to the bank of the River Ilen. It is commonly believed to have been built, or at the very least augmented, by Donal of the Hides, Lord of Clancahill from about 1560 to his death 1584. His son Donal II O'Donovan then repaired or further altered the structure some decades later, but was not living in it by then. It is believed that his father had already relocated the family in the first decade of that century to the more profitable Rahine Manor on the seacoast to protect their maritime interests.

No matter the type of FFO they use, public companies are required to disclose their FFO on their income statement.

Pomade gives the user's hair a shiny, slick appearance, and does not dry it out. It lasts longer than most hair care products, often requiring multiple washes to completely remove. The original pomade of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries consisted mainly of bear fat or lard. Lanolin, beeswax, and petroleum jelly have been used extensively in the manufacture of modern pomades. Stiffening properties of pomades make sculptured hairstyles such as the pompadour or quiff possible; while long lasting moisturizing properties make it popular with individuals with Afro-textured hair. Context_2 : Greasy hair is a hair condition which is common in humans, one of four main four types of hair conditioning\u2014 normal, greasy, dry and greasy dry. It is primarily caused by build-up of the natural secretion from the sebaceous glands in the scalp and is characterised by the continuous development of natural grease on the scalp. A chronic condition of greasy hair may often accompany chronic greasy skin conditions on the face and body and oily skin and acne. Excessive carbohydrate, fat and starch consumption can increase the likelihood of developing greasy hair and also poor personal hygiene and not washing the hair for a long duration will lead to a buildup of sebum in the hair follicles. Hair conditioners can decrease the likelihood of developing greasy hair after shampooing. Some cosmetics companies produce shampoos and conditioners specifically to deal with greasy hair and for oily or dry hair problems. Massaging the scalp and exposure to the sun can reduce the problem of greasy hair. Context_3 : Good hair is a phrase used within the African-American community to generally describe African-American hair (or the hair texture belonging to those of other ethnicities who fit the same description) that most closely resembles the hair of non-Black people (straight or curly), especially those images of hair popularly presented in society, and as contrasted with the appearance of natural Afro-textured hair.

In Imperial Rome, women wore their hair in complicated styles. From the time of the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, most women grew their hair as long as it would naturally grow. During the Roman Empire as well as in the 16th century in the western world, women began to wear their hair in extremely ornate styles. In the later half of the 15th century and on into the 16th century a very high hairline on the forehead was considered attractive.

Coryell,\" 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (1823), freedom of movement has been judicially recognized as a fundamental Constitutional right. In \"Paul v. Virginia,\" 75 U.S. 168 (1869), the Court defined freedom of movement as \"right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them.\" However, the Supreme Court did not invest the federal government with the authority to protect freedom of movement. Under the \"privileges and immunities\" clause, this authority was given to the states, a position the Court held consistently through the years in cases such as \"Ward v. Maryland,\" 79 U.S. 418 (1871), the \"Slaughter-House Cases,\" 83 U.S. 36 (1873) and \"United States v. Harris,\" 106 U.S. 629 (1883). Context_2 : Same-sex marriage has been legally recognized in the U.S. state of Indiana since October 6, 2014. The state had previously restricted marriage to male-female couples by statute in 1986. By legislation passed in 1997, it denied recognition to same-sex relationships established in other jurisdictions. A lawsuit challenging the state's refusal to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples, \"Baskin v. Bogan\", won a favorable ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on June 25, 2014. Until the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted an emergency stay of the district court's ruling on June 27, most Indiana counties issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling in \"Baskin\" on September 4. A ruling in \"Bowling v. Pence\" stated that the state must recognize same-sex marriages performed out-of-state and the decision was stayed until the Circuit ruled on the merits in similar cases. It also stated that the ruling would remain stayed if the circuit court stayed its decision in the related cases. Context_3 : Prior to the landmark ruling \"United States v. Windsor\", the constitutionality of banning same-sex marriage was upheld by the Eighth Circuit in \"Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning\". After the \"Windsor\" ruling, many same-sex marriage bans were struck down by lower courts. The Tenth, Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth circuits all ruled that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional. The cases that made it to these circuit courts originated in district courts which for the most part also struck down same-sex marriage bans. When a circuit court struck down a state's same-sex marriage ban, it did not directly strike down same-sex marriage bans in other states within the circuit. However, it paved the way for same-sex marriage bans to be struck down in the entire circuit due to the precedent it set for district courts within the circuit to follow. In some states, same-sex marriage was already legal before a federal circuit court ruled on the matter. The Sixth Circuit ruled that same-sex marriage bans were not unconstitutional and reversed the district court rulings that struck down same-sex marriage bans. Since this was the only circuit court to rule this way post-\"Windsor\", this created a circuit split which ultimately led to the Supreme Court of the United States deciding to resolve the issue once and for all. They ruled that same-sex marriage bans violate the constitution in the landmark ruling \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" which was the consolidated case that covered each state in the Sixth Circuit. Some circuit courts have not ruled on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans at all. Many circuit courts had pending same-sex marriage cases, but decided to hold off on litigation until the Supreme Court ruled on the matter. Context_4 : LeRoy Harrison Carhart (born 1941) is an American physician from New Jersey best known for performing abortions late in pregnancy. He became famous for his participation in the Supreme Court cases \"Stenberg v. Carhart\" and \"Gonzales v. Carhart\", both of which dealt with intact dilation and extraction (colloquially known as \"partial-birth abortion\"). He was one of the four subjects of the 2013 documentary \"After Tiller\". Context_5 : The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 (Pub.L. 108\u2013105 , 117\u00a0Stat.\u00a01201 , enacted \u00a005, 2003 , , PBA Ban) is a United States law prohibiting a form of late termination of pregnancy called \"partial-birth abortion,\" referred to in medical literature by as intact dilation and extraction. Under this law, \"Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.\" The law was enacted in 2003, and in 2007 its constitutionality was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of \"Gonzales v. Carhart\". Context_6 : Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez (May 2, 1882 \u2013 June 11, 1971) was a Puerto Rican activist who helped pave the way for Puerto Ricans to be given United States citizenship. As a young unwed pregnant woman, Gonz\u00e1lez had her plans to find and marry the father of her unborn child derailed by the United States Treasury Department when she was excluded as an alien \"likely to become a public charge\" upon her arrival in New York City. Gonz\u00e1lez challenged the Government of the United States in the groundbreaking case \"Gonzales v. Williams\" (192 U.S. 1 (1904)). Officially the case was known as \"Isabella Gonzales, Appellant, v. William Williams, United States Commissioner of Immigration at the Port of New York\" No. 225, argued December 4, 7, 1903, and decided January 4, 1904. Her case was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, filed February 27, 1903, after also having her Writ of Habeas Corpus (HC. 1-187) dismissed. Her Supreme Court case is the first time that the Court confronted the citizenship status of inhabitants of territories acquired by the United States. Gonz\u00e1lez actively pursued the cause of U.S. citizenship for all Puerto Ricans by writing letters published in \"The New York Times\". Context_7 : Corfield v. Coryell (6 Fed. Cas. 546, no. 3,230 C.C.E.D.Pa. 1823) is a landmark 1823 federal circuit court case decided by Justice Bushrod Washington, sitting as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In it, he upheld a New Jersey regulation forbidding non-residents from gathering oysters and clams against a challenge that New Jersey's law violated the Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause and that the New Jersey law regulated interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause. The case is available in Thayer's Cases on Constitutional Law, Part 2 Context_8 : The Circuit Court (Irish: \"An Ch\u00fairt Chuarda\" ) of Ireland is an intermediate level court of local and limited jurisdiction in the which hears both civil and criminal matters. On the criminal side the Circuit Court hears criminal matters tried on indictment with a judge and jury, except for certain serious crimes which are tried in either the Central Criminal Court or the Special Criminal Court. On the civil side the Circuit Court has a considerable parallel jurisdiction \u2014 including equitable remedies \u2014 with the High Court but normally cannot award damages of more than \u20ac75,000. The Circuit Court also hears \"de novo\" appeals from the District Court in both civil and criminal matters. Context_9 : On April 28, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments for \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" (Ohio), which was consolidated with three other same-sex marriage cases from the other states in the Sixth Circuit: \"Tanco v. Haslam\" (Tennessee), \"DeBoer v. Snyder\" (Michigan), \"Bourke v. Beshear\" (Kentucky). On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's decision, paving the way for same-sex marriage to become legal in those states, and setting a precedent for the entire nation. All four states complied with the ruling the same day it was issued before the mandate was actually issued. Every state in the circuit had a district court ruling against their states' ban, but they were eventually stayed pending appeal. The Sixth Circuit consists of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. On August 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit heard oral arguments for same-sex marriage cases from each state within the circuit. On November 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit in a split 2-1 decision, upheld the states' same-sex marriage bans, reversing the district courts' rulings that struck them down. The Sixth Circuit was the first and only circuit court since the landmark ruling \"United States v. Windsor\" to uphold the constitutionality of states' same-sex marriage bans which caused a circuit split. Context_10 : Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007), is a United States Supreme Court case that upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. The case reached the high court after U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales appealed a ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in favor of LeRoy Carhart that struck down the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.

One of the leading coloratura sopranos of her generation, she possessed a large, resonant voice with a clear timbre. Her career took her to the stages of the best opera houses and concert halls in Europe during the first half of the 20th century.

Context_3 : In 1841, while Donizetti was in Paris waiting for the libretto to be completed for a commission by La Scala, he had a chance encounter with Gustave Va\u00ebz, who had co-written the libretti for two of his earlier operas, \"Lucie de Lammermoor\" (the French version of \"Lucia di Lammermoor\") and \"La favorite\". He asked Va\u00ebz if he could provide a libretto for a short opera to keep him busy while waiting for the La Scala project to advance. Va\u00ebz quickly created \"Deux hommes et une femme\" (\"Two Men and a Woman\"), a comic piece in one act consisting of eight musical numbers connected by spoken dialogue. According to Va\u00ebz, Donizetti completed the score in eight days. However, the Op\u00e9ra-Comique rejected it and Donizetti then had the libretto translated into Italian for an intended performance at the Teatro del Fondo in Naples. Following the death of the Teatro del Fondo's impresario, Domenico Barbaja, the Naples performance fell through. The score, still unperformed, was found in Donizetti's effects when he died in 1848.

The novel is set in the Lammermuir Hills of south-east Scotland, and tells of a tragic love affair between young Lucy Ashton and her family's enemy Edgar Ravenswood.

As with all the Waverley Novels, \"The Bride of Lammermuir\" was published anonymously. The novel claims that the story was an oral tradition, collected by one \"Peter Pattieson\", and subsequently published by \"Jedediah Cleishbotham\". The 1830 \"Waverley edition\" includes an introduction by Scott, discussing his actual sources. The later edition also changes the date of the events: the first edition sets the story in the 17th century; the 1830 edition sets it in the reign of Queen Anne, after the 1707 Acts of Union which joined Scotland and England. The story is the basis for Donizetti's 1835 opera \"Lucia di Lammermoor\".

It flows through a fertile valley devoted to grassland-based agriculture with limited arable cropping. The underlying geology is basalt and the water is slightly alkaline with magnesium making an unusually large contribution to total hardness.

According to C.Michael Hogan, the Bann River Valley is a settlement area for some of the first human arrivals in Ireland after the most recent glacial retreat. The river has played an important part in the industrialisation of the north of Ireland, especially in the linen industry. Today salmon and eel fisheries are the most important economic features of the river. The river is often used as a dividing line between the eastern and western areas of Northern Ireland, often labelled the \"Bann divide\". Towns, councils and businesses \"west of the Bann\" are often seen as having less investment and government spending than those to the east. It is also seen as a religious, economic and political divide, with Catholics and Irish nationalists being in the majority to the west, and Ulster Protestants and unionists in the majority to the east; and with the financial and industrial capital of Greater Belfast to the east with the west of the Bann being more agricultural and rural.

A cooking gas cylinder exploded in the fifth carriage, creating a fire which engulfed seven third-class carriages, reducing them almost to cinders. The initial number of dead given by officials at the time was 383, all Egyptians. However, considering that seven carriages were burnt to the ground, and each carriage was packed with at least double the maximum carrying capacity of 150, this number is considered by many people to be a great underestimate. The dubious nature of the given death toll lies with the absence of a full passenger list; accounting for those missing was almost impossible at the time. In addition, the fire was so intense and the carriages so badly burned that many corpses had been reduced to ash. As there was no means of communication between the driver and the rear carriages, the driver did not know of the fire until about two hours after it had begun, resulting in many people, attempting to flee from the overcrowded carriages, jumping to their death. Some important Egyptians have commentated that the official number of 383 dead is grossly inaccurate and was an attempt to lessen the damage done to the reputation of the government. Many people consider a number of about 1000 deaths to be more accurate. Context_2 : Although spinal cord injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have satisfying sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, which in turn has important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.

After meeting in a middle-school typing class, the two began playing music and immediately chose the name Ween as well as their Ramones-inspired pseudonyms. Ween performed as a duo backed by a Digital Audio Tape for the band's first ten years of existence before expanding to a four- (and later five-) piece act. The band's highest charting single is \"Push th' Little Daisies\", which was a hit in the United States and Australia. Context_3 : Symphony of Decay is a EP by American alternative rock band Third Eye Blind. The EP started off under the working title of Black as a companion EP to their platinum selling 1999 album \"Blue\". Its creation was a result of a compromise over the release method of the track \"Slow Motion\"; the band had wanted it on \"Blue\", while their record label, Elektra Records, opposed its inclusion on such a high-profile full-length album release due to its controversial lyrics. The EP would go through years of delays for a multitude of reasons, including extensive touring, prioritizing the completion of their third studio album \"Out of the Vein\", and complications arising from parting ways with Elektra in 2004. The EP itself was never collectively released, though many of the tracks were eventually released elsewhere.

The copy of the Leonard Cohen record that Ween used had purportedly belonged to Dean Ween's mother, Eileen Ween. \"The Pod\", according to Ween lore, was written under the influence of Scotchgard, but this was later refuted by Gene and Dean themselves as being \"the most slime-bag thing we could think of\". \"The Pod\" has since been remastered and reissued by Elektra Records, after the relative success of Ween albums such as \"Pure Guava\" (1992) and \"Chocolate and Cheese\" (1994).

One of the reasons that this particular live album might have been released on a more popular label is because the Greek Theatre (located in Los Angeles) is more of a bigger venue then some of Ringo's other concert locations. The album oddly removes many of the songs that were sung at the concert. On the filmed concert, also included with the CD, there are several more songs.

For Irish republicans this chose part of the membership of the Third D\u00e1il of the Irish Republic; under the provisions of the treaty it was a provisional parliament replacing the parliament of Southern Ireland. From 6 December 1922 it was the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the Irish Free State. Context_2 : The Irish Boundary Commission (Irish: \"Coimisi\u00fan na Teorainne\" ) met in 1924\u201325 to decide on the precise delineation of the border between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. The 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, which ended the War of Independence, provided for such a commission if Northern Ireland chose to secede from the Irish Free State, an event that occurred as expected two days after the Free State's inception on 6 December 1922. The governments of the United Kingdom, of the Irish Free State and of Northern Ireland were to nominate one member each to the commission. When the Northern government refused to cooperate, the British government assigned a Belfast newspaper editor to represent Northern Irish interests. Context_3 : The original Irish Republican Army (IRA) fought a guerrilla war against British rule in Ireland in the Irish War of Independence between 1919 and 1921. Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921, the IRA in the 26 counties that were to become the Irish Free State split between supporters and opponents of the Treaty. The anti-Treatyites, sometimes referred to by Free State forces as Irregulars, continued to use the name Irish Republican Army (IRA) or in Irish \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann, as did the organisation in Northern Ireland which originally supported the pro-Treaty side (if not the Treaty). \"\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann\" was also adopted as the name of the pro-Treaty National Army, and remains the official legal title of the Irish Defence Forces. This article deals with the anti-Treaty IRA that fought against the Irish Free State in the Irish Civil War, and with its successors up to 1969, when the IRA split again. Context_4 : Comhairle na dTeachta\u00ed was an Irish republican parliament established by opponents of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty and the resulting Irish Free State, and viewed by republican legitimatists as a successor to the Second D\u00e1il. Members were abstentionist from the Third D\u00e1il established by the pro-Treaty faction. Just as the First D\u00e1il established a parallel Irish Republic in opposition to the British Dublin Castle administration, so Comhairle na dTeachta\u00ed attempted to establish a legitimatist government in opposition to the Provisional Government and Government of the Irish Free State established by the Third D\u00e1il. This legitimatist government, called the Council of State, had \u00c9amon de Valera as President. In 1926 de Valera resigned as President, left the Sinn F\u00e9in party and founded Fianna F\u00e1il, which in 1927 entered the Fourth D\u00e1il. Comhairle na dTeachta\u00ed, never more than a symbolic body, was thereby rendered defunct. In 1930 Cumann na nGaedheal TDs alleged in the D\u00e1il that de Valera had addressed Comhairle na dTeachta\u00ed in December 1926, after the foundation of Fianna F\u00e1il; this was to cast aspersions on de Valera's commitment to the Constitution of the Irish Free State. Context_5 : The Irish Free State (Irish: \"Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann\" ] ; 6 December 192229 December 1937) was a state established in 1922 under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921. That treaty ended the three-year Irish War of Independence between the forces of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and British Crown forces. Context_6 : The Constitution of the Irish Free State (Irish: \"Bunreacht Shaorst\u00e1it Eireann\" ) was the second constitution of the independent Irish state. It was adopted by Act of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann sitting as a constituent assembly on 25 October 1922. In accordance with Article 83 of the Constitution, the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922 of the British Parliament, which came into effect upon receiving the royal assent on 5 December 1922, provided that the Constitution would come into effect upon the issue of a Royal Proclamation, which was done on 6 December 1922.

The IRA was deeply split over whether to accept the Treaty. Some accepted, whereas some rejected not only the Treaty but also the civilian authorities who had accepted it. This attitude eventually led to the outbreak of the Irish Civil War in late June 1922 between pro- and anti-Treaty factions. fact_1 :  That treaty ended the three-year Irish War of Independence between the forces of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and British Crown forces. fact_2 : The Irish Republic (Irish: \"Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann\" or \"Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann\" ) was a revolutionary state that declared its independence from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1919 (not to be confused with the proclamation of the Irish Republic that was a different Irish Republic or the Republic of Ireland Act 1948).

The club also reached the Second Round in both the FA Cup and League Cup, as well as the Northern Section Semi-Finals of the League Trophy. Rudge signing Andy Jones excelled to become the club's top-scorer, whilst Robbie Earle had another impressive season. However the promotion campaign was built on the strength of the Vale defence, and goalkeeper Jim Arnold was made Player of the Year. Context_2 : The 1934\u201335 season was Port Vale's 29th season of football in the Football League, and their fifth successive season (28th overall) in the Second Division. A positive start to the season raised hope of promotion; however, from October onwards the club performed so poorly as to finish fifth-from-bottom. One event of note was a six-week discussion over a possible change of name; the names Stoke Central, Stoke United, Stoke North End, and Hanley Port Vale were considered \u2013 however none of these names attracted enough support to institute a change.

They exited the competition at the next stage at the hands of Watford, following a replay. Vale's league form also improved, as they finished in eleventh place, helped by midfielders Ray Walker and Robbie Earle, defenders Phil Sproson and Bob Hazell, and goalkeeper Mark Grew.

In the FA Cup, Vale achieved a celebrated upset by knocking out holders Everton with a 2\u20131 win at Vale Park. They were then eliminated at the Fifth Round, after taking Leeds United to a replay. They reached the final of the Anglo-Italian Cup, where they were defeated 5\u20132 by Genoa. These successes did not translate to the League Cup, where Vale exited at the First Round. Key new signings were Lee Mills and Player of the Year Jon McCarthy, though it was established star Tony Naylor who was the club's top-scorer.

As a testament to the upheaval at the club, a club record 43 players turned out for the Vale in the league over the course of the season. The Vale just avoided relegation on goals scored, despite suffering a final day defeat to Bury, who were relegated having scored ten fewer goals. Liverpool knocked them out of the FA Cup at the Third Round, and Vale were also knocked out of the League Cup by fourth tier Chester City in the First Round. The sacking of Rudge spoiled what was supposed to be a happy season for Vale fans, as Vale competed in a division above rivals Stoke City for only the fourth time.

The piece is a reworking of the Manon Lescaut story, already adapted operatically by Auber, Massenet and Puccini, and here relocated to Paris after the Second World War where, as is noted in Grove, the focus of the story moves away from Manon and towards Armand des Grieux.

A 400cc, air-cooled, 2-cylinder, 30-hp engine was also developed in-house to power the vehicle, but due to delays in the engine development, the car was introduced with a 600cc engine and other mechanical parts of the Fiat 126 model. A 650cc Fiat engine was also used, in an improved version. The car was finally introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 1977, and for this reason received more publicity than most Greek vehicles, appearing in many international publications. All development work had been made in a factory intended for its production in Acharnes, while the company was advertised in the Greek press; plans were also made for more versions, including a sports coupe. However, the costs involved and the car's poor prospects in the Greek market (despite an effort to facelift the model) resulted in termination of production after only about ten had been produced. The whole project was abandoned in 1982, having been Georgios Dimitriadis' last venture in the automotive industry.

This gave it a great deal of power for its size, redlining at 10,000\u00a0RPM while delivering 50 horsepower. The 454 is considered a good starter bike for having a low seat height and light weight, as well as an efficient use of counterbalancing to limit vibration.

This engine is very similar to the 3-cylinder F8D 12-valve engine that was optional on the Maruti 800 at the time. The bore and stroke of F10D is the same as that of the smaller sibling and shares quite a few parts like pistons, rings, conrods and valves. The cast-iron engine block is very similar to that of the older F10A 970cc engine that powered the earlier Maruti Gypsy and Maruti 1000.

The AMB engine was used in a variety of Volkswagens and Audis, as well as being used by companies owned by Volkswagen, such as the Spanish car manufacturer, SEAT. The engine was available in a wide variety of configurations and was mounted longitudinally in most Audi applications, and horizontally in most other applications. The engine came coupled with a variety of transmissions including a 5- or 6-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic, and a CVT (continuously variable transmission) for front-wheel drive vehicles only. The engine was also coupled with Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive. In 2003 it was replaced by slightly higher powered versions such as the AUM.

Context_4 : The selection box is a boxed gift generally associated with Christmas.

Choice and variation of contents were the consumer's choice, and often the value of the selection box would exceed a week's wages. In more modern times the selection box as we know it has become a staple Christmas gift of chocolate. Each chocolate company mass produces these at Christmas time and they are often filling the spaces near supermarket checkouts. In the 60's and 70's the selection box took on a more commercialized approach with games printed on the reverse of the boxes such as snakes and ladders, adding to the desirability of each brand's selection box offering. Children expectantly received a selection box each year and regarded them as a main Christmas gift.

Context_5 : Happy Families is a traditional card game, usually with a specially made set of picture cards, featuring illustrations of fictional families of four, most often based on occupation types. The object of the game is to collect complete families. The player whose turn it is asks another player for a specific card from the same family as a card that the player already has. If the asked player has the card, he gives it to the requester and the requester can then ask any player for another card. If the asked player does not have the card, it becomes his turn and he asks another player for a specific card. Play continues in this way until no families are separated among different players. The player with the most cards wins. One of the rules states that a player cannot ask for a certain card to deceive any player if he does not have a card in the set he is asking for. The game can be adapted for use with an ordinary set of playing cards (see Go Fish). Context_6 : Mark Covert (born November 17, 1950) is an American runner.

Series writer B. J. Novak has said that the actual Creed Bratton is exactly like the character he plays, except that the real Creed is a good-hearted and likable person, while his fictional alter ego has a very dark side to him. His resourcefulness and duplicity are his defining traits along with his senile behavior and ignorance of the modern world.

Context_10 : Sgt. Slaughter is a fictional character from the toyline series. G.I. Joe used the persona of the professional wrestler of the same name as a model for their character. Though the original G.I. Joe was based on the real life Sgt. Alvin York, Sgt. Slaughter was the first G.I. Joe figure accurately based on a real person (Chicago Bears defensive tackle William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry was the second). Sgt.

Context_4 : George Spahn (February 11, 1889 \u2013 September 22, 1974) was a rancher who once owned the Spahn Ranch near Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California. Spahn (as did previous owner William S. Hart) rented the ranch to the movie industry to film Westerns. At the ranch, he housed Charles Manson and his followers. The 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and six others by Manson's devotees were allegedly hatched at the Spahn Ranch. Manson persuaded Spahn to permit \"the Family\" to live at his ranch. Manson ordered the Family women to have sex with the then nearly blind 80-year-old. The women also acted as seeing eye guides for Spahn. Spahn nicknamed all the Manson girls\u2014Squeaky, Sadie Mae, Ouisch, etc. According to Manson Family member Paul Watkins, notorious Mansonite Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme got her nickname because of the sound she made when Spahn ran his hand up her thigh.

Robert Page Anderson\", 493 P.2d 880, 6 Cal. 3d 628 (Cal. 1972). She was granted a new trial at which her defense to the charge of first degree murder was diminished responsibility, but the jury could not agree on a verdict. At a third trial, she was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, although with a possibility of parole. In relation to her case, high courts, parole boards, and the state governor have said that an inexplicable or racial motive for murder could merit exemplary punishment and outweigh any evidence of subsequent reform.

It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the last of his eight cenotaphs to be erected in England. Prior to Lutyens' involvement, several abandoned proposals had been made for commemorating Norwich's war dead, and by 1926 the newly elected lord mayor was determined to see the construction of a memorial before he left office. He established an appeal to raise funds for local hospitals in memory of the dead as well as a physical monument. He commissioned Lutyens, who designed an empty tomb (cenotaph) atop a low screen wall from which protrudes a Stone of Remembrance. Bronze flambeaux at either end can burn gas to emit a flame. Lutyens also designed a roll of honour, on which the names of the city's dead are listed, which was installed in Norwich Castle in 1931.

Context_6 : The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England. Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location. This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds. Context_7 : Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England. Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities\u2014the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922. The committee quickly raised \u00a310,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial. The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community. The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church. Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ. Context_8 : The Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and situated on the cathedral green in Exeter, the county town of Devon, in the south west of England. It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city. The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds. After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead. The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations. A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials\u2014the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens. Context_9 : The North Eastern Railway War Memorial is a First World War memorial in York in northern England. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens to commemorate employees of the North Eastern Railway (NER) who left to fight in the First World War and were killed while serving. The NER board voted in early 1920 to allocate \u00a320,000 for a memorial and commissioned Lutyens. The committee for the York City War Memorial followed suit and also appointed Lutyens, but both schemes became embroiled in controversy. Concerns were raised from within the community about the effect of the NER memorial on the city walls and its impact on the proposed scheme for the city's war memorial, given that the two memorials were planned to be 100 yd apart and the city's budget was a tenth of the NER's. The controversy was resolved after Lutyens modified his plans for the NER memorial to move it away from the walls and the city opted for a revised scheme on land just outside the walls; coincidentally the land was owned by the NER, whose board donated it to the city.

The rise in power and political support was gradual until Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a Dravidian party, formed the government in the state in 1967. Although since the 1970s the Dravidian parties have met with many break-aways and have taken rival stances against each other, the seat of power in Tamil Nadu has been with one or another Dravidian party. The increase in popularity of the Dravidian parties in the 1960s is attributed to several factors, including the fall of popularity of the Congress Government in the centre and the North-South disparity, as claimed by the Dravidian politics. The series of events climaxed with anti-Hindi agitation which led to the downfall of popularity of the then Indian National Congress government in the state and the eventual rise of Dravidian parties to power.

SMPDB is designed specifically to support pathway elucidation and pathway discovery in metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and systems biology. It is able to do so, in part, by providing colorful, detailed, fully searchable, hyperlinked diagrams of five types of small molecule pathways: 1) general human metabolic pathways; 2) human metabolic disease pathways; 3) human metabolite signaling pathways; 4) drug-action pathways and 5) drug metabolism pathways. SMPDB pathways may be navigated, viewed and zoomed interactively using a Google Maps-like interface. All SMPDB pathways include information on the relevant organs, subcellular compartments, protein cofactors, protein locations, metabolite locations, chemical structures and protein quaternary structures (Fig. 1). Each small molecule in SMPDB is hyperlinked to detailed descriptions contained in the HMDB or DrugBank and each protein or enzyme complex is hyperlinked to UniProt. Additionally, all SMPDB pathways are accompanied with detailed descriptions and references, providing an overview of the pathway, condition or processes depicted in each diagram. Users can browse the SMPDB (Fig. 2) or search its contents by text searching (Fig. 3), sequence searching, or chemical structure searching. More powerful queries are also possible including searching with lists of gene or protein names, drug names, metabolite names, GenBank IDs, Swiss-Prot IDs, Agilent or Affymetrix microarray IDs. These queries will produce lists of matching pathways and highlight the matching molecules on each of the pathway diagrams. Gene, metabolite and protein concentration data can also be visualized through SMPDB's mapping interface.

Both volumes provide valuable knowledge and information on the lands of New France from the perspective of a soldier in the French army as well as an explorer who explored the landscape, native peoples and developing economic, social, and political ties between the native peoples and French explorers. The importance of the book is expressed by Gordon Sayre: \u201cLahontan takes a secular perspective throughout his writing which differentiates his works from those of the Jesuits that published during the same time he did\u201d. This book is an exploration narrative that tells an explorer's stories but also serves as a historical source for examining the American Indians in the New France region and the connections between the explorers and native peoples.

Context_5 : The laconicum (i.e. Spartan, \"sc.\" \"balneum\", bath) was the dry sweating room of the Roman \"thermae\", contiguous to the \"caldarium\" or hot room. The name was given to it as being the only form of warm bath that the Spartans admitted. The \"laconicum\" was usually a circular room with niches in the axes of the diagonals and was covered by a conical roof with a circular opening at the top, according to Vitruvius (v. 10), from which a brazen shield is suspended by chains, capable of being so lowered and raised as to regulate the temperature. The walls of the \"laconicum\" were plastered with marble stucco and painted blue with gold stars. Context_6 : Petrography is a branch of petrology that focuses on detailed descriptions of rocks. Someone who studies petrography is called a petrographer. The mineral content and the textural relationships within the rock are described in detail. The classification of rocks is based on the information acquired during the petrographic analysis. Petrographic descriptions start with the field notes at the outcrop and include macroscopic description of hand specimens. However, the most important tool for the petrographer is the petrographic microscope. The detailed analysis of minerals by optical mineralogy in thin section and the micro-texture and structure are critical to understanding the origin of the rock. Electron microprobe analysis of individual grains as well as whole rock chemical analysis by atomic absorption, X-ray fluorescence, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy are used in a modern petrographic lab. Individual mineral grains from a rock sample may also be analyzed by X-ray diffraction when optical means are insufficient. Analysis of microscopic fluid inclusions within mineral grains with a heating stage on a petrographic microscope provides clues to the temperature and pressure conditions existent during the mineral formation.

Context_7 : Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \"binomial\"), a binomen, binominal name or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \"Homo\" and within this genus to the species \"Homo sapiens\". The \"formal\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753.

As NCSIST's previous experience with anti-ship missile development was limited to experimentally fitting warheads onto MQM-33B drones, the decision was made to base the weapon on the Israeli Gabriel Mk I with necessary modifications added in order to remain competitive against the SY-1 missile, making it essentially a Taiwanese interpretation of the Gabriel Mk II (and since the Republic of China Navy did also import several sets of Gabriel Mk II system to rehabilitate three of their Allen M. Sumner class destroyers, they also stipulated the HF-I to be made interchangeable with the Israeli-made ordnance). Prior to the service entry of the Hsiung Feng II missile, it was the primary anti-ship weapon on all of the ROC Navy's frontline surface combatants, including the majority of the service's Gearing class and Allen M. Sumner class destroyers. It is currently deployed on the ROCN's littoral combatants, most notably the \"Hai Ou\" class missile boats, as well as some land based facilities. Due to it being superseded by the Hsiung Feng II on larger patrol craft and in coastal batteries, the HF-1 is being phased out of service (along with \"Hai Ou\" class FACs).

It can also be used as a high speed anti-ship missile. The missile uses the airframe of the earlier SM-2ER Block IV (RIM-156A) missile, adding the active radar homing seeker from the AIM-120C AMRAAM in place of the semi-active seeker of the previous design. This will improve the capability of the Standard missile against highly agile targets, and targets beyond the effective range of the launching vessels' target illumination radars. Initial operating capability was planned for 2013 and was achieved on November 27, 2013. The SM-6 is not meant to replace the SM-2 series of missiles, but will serve alongside and provide extended range and increased firepower. It was approved for export in January 2017.

It is the earliest still running popular science magazine of the country. Context_2 : The mutilated chessboard problem is a tiling puzzle proposed by philosopher Max Black in his book \"Critical Thinking\" (1946). It was later discussed by Solomon W. Golomb (1954), and by Martin Gardner in his \"Scientific American\" column \"Mathematical Games\". The problem is as follows: Context_3 : Scientific American (informally abbreviated SciAm) is an American popular science magazine. Many famous scientists, including Albert Einstein, have contributed articles in the past 170 years. It is the oldest continuously published monthly magazine in the United States(though it only became monthly in 1921). Context_4 : Graham's number is an enormous number that arises as an upper bound on the answer of a problem in the mathematical field of Ramsey theory. It is named after mathematician Ronald Graham, who used the number as a simplified explanation of the upper bounds of the problem he was working on in conversations with popular science writer Martin Gardner. Gardner later described the number in \"Scientific American\" in 1977, introducing it to the general public. At the time of its introduction, it was the largest specific positive integer ever to have been used in a published mathematical proof. The number was published in the 1980 \"Guinness Book of World Records\", adding to its popular interest. Other specific integers (such as TREE(3)) known to be far larger than Graham's number have since appeared in many serious mathematical proofs, for example in connection with Harvey Friedman's various finite forms of Kruskal's theorem. Additionally, smaller upper bounds on the Ramsey theory problem from which Graham's number derived have since been proven to be valid. Context_5 : In the geometry of tessellations, a rep-tile or reptile is a shape that can be dissected into smaller copies of the same shape. The term was coined as a pun on animal reptiles by the American mathematician Solomon W. Golomb, who used it to describe self-replicating tilings. In 2012 a generalization of rep-tiles called self-tiling tile sets was introduced by Lee Sallows in \"Mathematics Magazine\". Context_6 : Martin Gardner (October 21, 1914May 22, 2010) was an American popular mathematics and popular science writer, with interests also encompassing scientific skepticism, micromagic, philosophy, religion, and literature\u2014especially the writings of Lewis Carroll, L. Frank Baum, and G. K. Chesterton.

Butler in various parts of the country. Context_8 : Golomb coding is a lossless data compression method using a family of data compression codes invented by Solomon W. Golomb in the 1960s. Alphabets following a geometric distribution will have a Golomb code as an optimal prefix code, making Golomb coding highly suitable for situations in which the occurrence of small values in the input stream is significantly more likely than large values. Context_9 : In mathematics, the Golomb sequence, named after Solomon W. Golomb (but also called Silverman's sequence), is a non-decreasing integer sequence where \"a\" is the number of times that \"n\" occurs in the sequence, starting with \"a\" = 1, and with the property that for \"n\" > 1 each \"a\" is the unique integer which makes it possible to satisfy the condition. For example, \"a\" = 1 says that 1 only occurs once in the sequence, so \"a\" cannot be 1 too, but it can be, and therefore must be, 2. The first few values are Context_10 : A powerful number is a positive integer \"m\" such that for every prime number \"p\" dividing \"m\", \"p\" also divides \"m\". Equivalently, a powerful number is the product of a square and a cube, that is, a number \"m\" of the form \"m\" = \"a\"\"b\", where \"a\" and \"b\" are positive integers. Powerful numbers are also known as squareful, square-full, or 2-full. Paul Erd\u0151s and George Szekeres studied such numbers and Solomon W. Golomb named such numbers \"powerful\". fact_1 : The mutilated chessboard problem is a tiling puzzle proposed by philosopher Max Black in his book \"Critical Thinking\" (1946). fact_2 :  It was later discussed by Solomon W.

Axtell received the Alexander von Humboldt Award in 1975, the Crop Science Research Award from the Crop Science Society of America in 1976, and the International Award for Distinguished Service to Agriculture in 1984. Axtell was widely noted for his research on sorghum(Sorghum bicolor L.). \"The New York Times\" and other sources reported that Axtell had been one of discoverers of high-lysine sorghum, and that the discovery was crucial to the fight against world hunger. Context_2 : This article is a list of diseases of sorghum (\"Sorghum bicolor\"). Context_3 : Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium of the genus \"Herbaspirillum\" found in roots and stems of sugarcane (\"Saccharum officinarum\"), sorghum (\"Sorghum bicolor\"), and rice (\"Oryza sativa\"). \"H. rubrisubalbicans\" can cause symptoms of the mottled stripe disease in sugarcane and sorghum. Leaves inoculated with \"H. rubrisubalbicans\" show red stripes along the secondary veins of the leaf blade. Context_4 : Striga hermonthica, commonly known as purple witchweed or giant witchweed, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the family Orobanchaceae.

In sub-Saharan Africa, apart from sorghum and rice, it also infests maize (\"Zea mays\"), pearl millet (\"Pennisetum glaucum\"), and sugar cane (\"Saccharum officinarum\"). Context_5 : Dhurrin is a cyanogenic glycoside produced in many plants. Discovered in multiple sorghum varieties in 1906 as the culprit of cattle poisoning by hydrogen cyanide, dhurrin is most typically associated with \"Sorghum bicolor\", the organism used for mapping the biosynthesis of dhurrin from tyrosine. Dhurrin's name is derived form the Arabic word for sorghum, transliterated to \"Dhura.\" Context_6 : Sweet sorghum is any of the many varieties of the sorghum grass whose stalks have a high sugar content. Sweet sorghum thrives better under drier and warmer conditions than many other crops and is grown primarily for forage, silage, and syrup production.

Ohwi and Ohashi, previously \"Phaseolus calcaratus\", is a warm-season annual vine legume with yellow flowers and small edible beans. It is commonly called ricebean or rice bean. To date, it is little known, little researched and little exploited. It is regarded as a minor food and fodder crop and is often grown as intercrop or mixed crop with maize (\"Zea mays\"), sorghum (\"Sorghum bicolor\") or cowpea (\"V. unguiculata\"), as well as a sole crop in the uplands, on a very limited area. Like the other Asiatic \"Vigna\" species, ricebean is a fairly short-lived warm-season annual. Grown mainly as a dried pulse, it is also important as a fodder, a green manure and a vegetable. Ricebean is most widely grown as an intercrop, particularly of maize, throughout Indo-China and extending into southern China, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In the past it was widely grown as lowland crop on residual soil water after the harvest of long-season rice, but it has been displaced to a great extent where shorter duration rice varieties are grown. Ricebean grows well on a range of soils. It establishes rapidly and has the potential to produce large amounts of nutritious animal fodder and high quality grain. Context_8 : Sporisorium sorghi is a species of fungus in the Ustilaginaceae family. It is a plant pathogen, causing covered smut of \"sorghum\" spp. such as \"Sorghum bicolor\" (\"S. vulgare\") (sorghum), \"S. sudanense\" (Sudan grass), \"S. halepense\" (Johnson grass) and \"Sorghum\" \"vulgare\" var. \"technichum\" (broomcorn).

During the early 1970s, Pakistan was the world's fourth largest producer of feature films.

Kolmogorov's three-series theorem, combined with Kronecker's lemma, can be used to give a relatively easy proof of the Strong Law of Large Numbers. Context_2 : In mathematics, the integral test for convergence is a method used to test infinite series of non-negative terms for convergence. It was developed by Colin Maclaurin and Augustin-Louis Cauchy and is sometimes known as the Maclaurin\u2013Cauchy test. Context_3 : In mathematics, the root test is a criterion for the convergence (a convergence test) of an infinite series. It depends on the quantity Context_4 : The Cauchy convergence test is a method used to test infinite series for convergence. It relies on bounding sums of terms in the series. This convergence criterion is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy who published it in his textbook Cours d'Analyse 1821. Context_5 : Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy FRS FRSE (] ; 21 August 1789 \u2013 23 May 1857) was a French mathematician and physicist who made pioneering contributions to analysis. He was one of the first to state and prove theorems of calculus rigorously, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors. He almost singlehandedly founded complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra. A profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors. His writings range widely in mathematics and mathematical physics. Context_6 : In the analytic theory of continued fractions, Euler's continued fraction formula is an identity connecting a certain very general infinite series with an infinite continued fraction. First published in 1748, it was at first regarded as a simple identity connecting a finite sum with a finite continued fraction in such a way that the extension to the infinite case was immediately apparent. Today it is more fully appreciated as a useful tool in analytic attacks on the general convergence problem for infinite continued fractions with complex elements. Context_7 : In mathematics, convergence tests are methods of testing for the convergence, conditional convergence, absolute convergence, interval of convergence or divergence of an infinite series formula_1. Context_8 : In mathematics, the Cauchy condensation test, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a standard convergence test for infinite series. For a non-negative, non-increasing sequence formula_1 of real numbers, the series formula_2 converges if and only if the \"condensed\" series formula_3 converges. Moreover, if they converge, the sum of the condensed series is no more than twice as large as the sum of the original. Context_9 : In mathematics, Abel's test (also known as Abel's criterion) is a method of testing for the convergence of an infinite series. The test is named after mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. There are two slightly different versions of Abel's test \u2013 one is used with series of real numbers, and the other is used with power series in complex analysis. Abel's uniform convergence test is a criterion for the uniform convergence of a series of functions dependent on parameters. Context_10 : In mathematics, the comparison test, sometimes called the direct comparison test to distinguish it from similar related tests (especially the limit comparison test), provides a way of deducing the convergence or divergence of an infinite series or an improper integral. In both cases, the test works by comparing the given series or integral to one whose convergence properties are known. fact_1 : In mathematics, the Cauchy condensation test, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a standard convergence test for infinite series. fact_2 : Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy FRS FRSE (] ; 21 August 1789 \u2013 23 May 1857) was a French mathematician and physicist who made pioneering contributions to analysis.

The mill is a timber-frame structure, octagonal in shape, and about 30 ft tall, with a rotating cap powered by eight vanes with canvas sheets. The grindstones in the middle of the mill are Fall River granite; the upper one, which is connected to the power mechanisms, rotates six times for each turn of the mill's main shaft. In 1916 Benjamin Boyd removed the original vanes and powered the mill using a gasoline engine.

Produced by Gil Norton, it was released through Capitol Records and the group's own Roswell Records on May 20, 1997. The record is the debut of the Foo Fighters as a group, as the band's previous record, \"Foo Fighters\" (1995), was primarily recorded by frontman Dave Grohl and friend Barrett Jones as a demo. After the project ballooned and became an international success, the group convened for pre-production in the fall of 1996 and brought in producer Norton to establish a pop sensibility for the tracks. The band strived to create a full-fledged rock record, although the music press predicted another grunge offshoot. Context_2 : One by One is the fourth studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, released on October 22, 2002 by RCA. The album is the first to feature guitarist Chris Shiflett. Production on the album was troubled, with initial recording sessions considered unsatisfying and raising tensions between the band members. They eventually decided to redo the album from scratch during a two-week period at frontman Dave Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, Virginia. The songs on the album, which include the successful singles \"All My Life\" and \"Times Like These\", have been noted for their introspective lyrics and a heavier and more aggressive sound compared to the band's earlier work, which Grohl said was intended to translate the energy of the Foo Fighters' live performances into a recording. Context_3 : \"These Days\" is the third single, (fourth in the UK), from the American rock band Foo Fighters' seventh studio album \"Wasting Light\". It was written by Dave Grohl and co-produced by Butch Vig. Dave Grohl has stated that it is his favourite song that he has ever written. On August 18, 2012, the Foo Fighters performed \"These Days\" at Pukkelpop, as a tribute to the people who died or were injured there a year earlier, due to a violent thunderstorm that raged over the festival grounds. Context_4 : In Your Honor is the fifth studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, released on June 14, 2005 by RCA Records. It is a double album, with one disc containing heavy rock songs and a second disc with mellower acoustic songs. Frontman Dave Grohl decided to do a diverse blend of songs as he felt that after ten years of existence, the band had to break new ground with their music. The album was recorded at a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics deal with both resonating and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. Context_5 : Nirvana was an American rock band formed by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987.

Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture. Context_6 : Wasting Light is the seventh studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters. It was released on April 12, 2011 on RCA Records, and is the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Pat Smear since \"The Colour and the Shape\" (1997), making the band a five piece with the album. Wishing to capture the essence of the group's earlier work and avoid the artificiality of digital recording, frontman Dave Grohl arranged for the band to record in his garage in Encino, California using only analog equipment. The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's \"Nevermind\". Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques. The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments from their previous albums, and most of the lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future. Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffe and Fee Waybill.

He repeated the feat in 2006 and by that point, five cars had been built, all of them race winners in the hands of the Dynamics drivers, before being passed into the hands of various independent teams. The cars remained in the championship until 2011, in the hands of Lea Wood, even finishing 7th at Oulton Park in that final season - an impressive result for a car that had been built 6 years previously.

Written between 1835 and 1836, \"The Nose\" tells the story of a St. Petersburg official whose nose leaves his face and develops a life of its own. \"The Nose\" was originally published in \"The Contemporary\", a literary journal owned by Alexander Pushkin. The use of a nose as the main source of conflict in the story could have been due to Gogol's own experience with an oddly shaped nose, which was often the subject of self-deprecating jokes in letters.

Context_8 : The Airedale Terrier (often shortened to \"Airedale\"), also called Bingley Terrier and Waterside Terrier, is a dog breed of the terrier type that originated in the valley (\"dale\") of the River Aire, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is traditionally called the \"King of Terriers\" because it is the largest of the terrier breeds. The Airedale was bred from the Old English Black and Tan Terrier (now extinct), the Bull Terrier, the Otterhound and probably some other Terrier breeds, originally to serve as an all around working farm dog. In Britain this breed has also been used as a war dog, guide dog and police dog. In the United States, this breed has been used to hunt big game, upland birds, and water fowl, and serve in many other working capacities. Context_9 : The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier. Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier. There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier. It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry. These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.

If there was no oral tradition, there would be no story telling; therefore, no one would know these creation stories today. Often, these stories were used for amusement in the tribes or to learn the origin of his or her clan.

Context_2 : Colin de Verdi\u00e8re's invariant is a graph parameter formula_1 for any graph \"G,\" introduced by Yves Colin de Verdi\u00e8re in 1990. It was motivated by the study of the maximum multiplicity of the second eigenvalue of certain Schr\u00f6dinger operators. Context_3 : In thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy (IUPAC recommended name: Gibbs energy or Gibbs function; also known as free enthalpy to distinguish it from Helmholtz free energy) is a thermodynamic potential that can be used to calculate the maximum of reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure (isothermal, isobaric). The Gibbs free energy (J in SI units) is the \"maximum\" amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a thermodynamically closed system (one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings, but not matter); this maximum can be attained only in a completely reversible process. When a system transforms reversibly from an initial state to a final state, the decrease in Gibbs free energy equals the work done by the system to its surroundings, minus the work of the pressure forces. Context_4 : Friedrich Hermann Hund (4 February 1896 \u2013 31 March 1997) was a German physicist from Karlsruhe known for his work on atoms and molecules. Context_5 : William P. Bengen is a retired financial adviser who first articulated the 4% withdrawal rate (\"Four percent rule\") as a rule of thumb for withdrawal rates from retirement savings in ; it is often known as the \"Bengen rule\" in his honor. The rule was later further popularized by the Trinity study (1998), based on the same data and similar analysis. Bengen later called this rate the SAFEMAX rate, for \"the maximum 'safe' historical withdrawal rate\", and revised it in to 4.5% if tax-free and 4.1% for taxable. Context_6 : Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity is a rule based on observation of atomic spectra, which is used to predict the ground state of an atom or molecule with one or more open electronic shells. The rule states that for a given electron configuration, the lowest energy term is the one with the greatest value of spin multiplicity. This implies that if two or more orbitals of equal energy are available, electrons will occupy them singly before filling them in pairs. The rule, discovered by Friedrich Hund in 1925, is of important use in atomic chemistry, spectroscopy, and quantum chemistry, and is often abbreviated to Hund's rule, ignoring Hund's other two rules. Context_7 : In mathematics, Newton's identities, also known as the Newton\u2013Girard formulae, give relations between two types of symmetric polynomials, namely between power sums and elementary symmetric polynomials. Evaluated at the roots of a monic polynomial \"P\" in one variable, they allow expressing the sums of the \"k\"-th powers of all roots of \"P\" (counted with their multiplicity) in terms of the coefficients of \"P\", without actually finding those roots. These identities were found by Isaac Newton around 1666, apparently in ignorance of earlier work (1629) by Albert Girard. They have applications in many areas of mathematics, including Galois theory, invariant theory, group theory, combinatorics, as well as further applications outside mathematics, including general relativity. Context_8 : Cope's rule, named after American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, postulates that population lineages tend to increase in body size over evolutionary time. It was never actually stated by Cope, although he favoured the occurrence of linear evolutionary trends. It is sometimes also known as the Cope-Dep\u00e9ret rule, because Charles Dep\u00e9ret explicitly advocated the idea. Theodor Eimer had also done so earlier. The term \"Cope's rule\" was apparently coined by Bernhard Rensch, based on the fact that Dep\u00e9ret had \"lionized Cope\" in his book. While the rule has been demonstrated in many instances, it does not hold true at all taxonomic levels, or in all clades. Larger body size is associated with increased fitness for a number of reasons, although there are also some disadvantages both on an individual and on a clade level: clades comprising larger individuals are more prone to extinction, which may act to limit the maximum size of organisms. Context_9 : 5-Dehydro-\"m\"-xylylene (DMX) is an aromatic organic triradical and the first known organic molecule to violate Hund's Rule. Context_10 : In atomic physics, Hund's rules refers to a set of rules that German physicist Friedrich Hund formulated around 1927, which are used to determine the term symbol that corresponds to the ground state of a multi-electron atom.

This site was first visited by Marshall Williams in 1968 at the suggestion of the site\u2019s landowner, Joe Bell, who had discovered various artifacts while the site was being regularly plowed. Because of Interstate construction, Marshall Williams and Mark Williams discovered this site during surface surveys and excavations of the plowed areas.

In Areas 1-3 various five foot square units were excavated. No excavations were done in Area 4 in 1969. Large quantities of small potsherds were discovered during these excavations, and they ranged from the Duvall Phase in Area 1 to Bell Phase in Areas 2-4. As part of the 1969 excavations, a road grading machine took off the topsoil of twelve strips on the site. This uncovered Features 1 and 2, and they were completely excavated. In 1977, the site was revisited by Marshall Williams and Mark Williams. Since various plans threatened this site, major excavations took place from June 15, 1977 until September 16, 1977 by Mark Williams. Most of the work centered on Area 2 or the Bell Phase portion of the site. The Bell Phase portion of this site was probably no more the 1.5 acres .

Orphaned at an early age, she spent her childhood in the court of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III. As one of the three surviving grandchildren of Emperor Sigismund, she had a strong claim to the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia. That made her an attractive bride for a Polish prince. The Polish nobility, seeking to increase Polish influence in Hungary and Bohemia, pursued marriage with Elizabeth since she was born and finally succeeded in 1454. Her marriage to Casimir was one of the most exemplary royal marriages in Poland. She gave birth to thirteen children, eleven of whom survived to adulthood. Four of her sons were crowned as kings.

Her husband's death sparked renewed hostilities but Sultan Suleiman established her as a regent of the eastern regions of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary on behalf of her infant son. The region developed as a semi-independent buffer state noted for its freedom of religion. Ferdinand, however, never renounced his claims to reunite Hungary and conspired with Bishop George Martinuzzi who forced Isabella to abdicate in 1551. She returned to her native Poland to live with her family. Sultan Suleiman retaliated and threatened to invade Hungary in 1555\u201356 forcing nobles to invite Isabella back to Transylvania.

The Bond movies were filmed all across the world and by different directors each time, with some of the old directors collaborating with the new ones. The success of each Bond film lead to bigger budget prices for the following films adapted to the big screen.

The original books and early adaptations had only relatively minimal pieces like the modified attache case in \"From Russia, with Love\". However, the gadgets took on a more spectacular profile in the film version of \"Goldfinger\", and its tremendous success encouraged the following films to have Bond supplied with still more equipment. For instance, it became an expected scene in each film where Q would present and demonstrate Bond's assigned tools for the mission, and it was a near guarantee that each and every piece would be invaluable to Bond in the field. In this sense, Bond gadgets became a prime example of the literary technique of Chekhov's gun.

Harrison was inspired to write the song while in the Hindu holy city of Vrindavan, in northern India, with his friend Ravi Shankar. The composition originated on a day that Harrison describes in his autobiography as \"my most fantastic experience\", during which his party and their ascetic guide toured the city's temples. The song's choruses were adapted from the Sanskrit chant they sang before visiting Seva Kunj, a park dedicated to Krishna's childhood.

Inspired by Gaudiya Vaishnava teacher A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the song promotes the need to recognise the illusory nature of human existence and escape the constant cycle of reincarnation, and thereby attain moksha in the Hindu faith.

On January\u00a012, it developed into a subtropical cyclone well south of the Azores, becoming the first tropical or subtropical system during January in the North Atlantic since an unnamed storm in 1978. As it turned north-northeast, Alex transitioned into a full-fledged tropical cyclone on January\u00a014 and became a hurricane. The storm peaked as a Category\u00a01 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 981\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.97\u00a0inHg). After weakening slightly, Alex made landfall on Terceira Island as a tropical storm the next day. Concurrently, Alex began transitioning back into an extratropical cyclone; it completed this cycle hours after moving away from the Azores. The system ultimately merged with another extratropical cyclone over the Labrador Sea on January\u00a017.

Context_9 : Hollywood on Television was a five-and-a-half-hour, six-day-a-week live television talk show starring newcomer Betty White and radio disc jockey Al Jarvis that ran from 1949 to 1953. When Jarvis left the show in 1951, film star Eddie Albert took his place and co-hosted with White for six months until thirty-three and a half hours of live ad-lib television per week, featuring just the two of them, took its toll and he also resigned. White was then hosting the show alone, and is believed to have been the first female television talk show host as a result. After a period of White talking directly into the camera lens for hours at a stretch, the show began accepting guests to interact with her as well as gradually incorporating scripts and sketches. Similarly to Jackie Gleason's \"Honeymooners\" sketches on the Dumont Network during the same era, recurring sketches involving White as a housewife named Elizabeth caught on with the viewers to the point that expanding the sketches into a half-hour sitcom appeared to be the obvious next step. Series pianist George Tibbles began writing the sketches. Studio producer Don Fedderson, Tibbles and White formed a production company called \"Bandy Productions,\" named after Betty White's dog Bandit, and White changed over to a half hour sitcom format based on the Elizabeth sketches entitled \"Life With Elizabeth\", which ran in syndication for two years and sixty-five episodes. Across the decades, White would use the skills she had honed on \"Hollywood on Television\" by hosting her own talk show in 1954 and subsequent variety series as well as starring in numerous sitcoms, including \"Date with the Angels\", \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"The Betty White Show\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"The Golden Palace\" and \"Hot in Cleveland\", as well as hosting the 2012 prank show \"Betty White's Off Their Rockers\", which began airing 63 years after the premiere of \"Hollywood on Television\".

During the era of Westward Expansion in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Crow were pushed north to Montana, where there was already a significant population of their tribe, and the Cheyenne were split between Montana and Oklahoma. Only the Shoshone and Arapaho remained in Wyoming, with some of both sent to the Wind River Indian Reservation, and others of both pushed to other western states and Oklahoma, respectively. As such, in total, there are two Native American languages currently spoken in Wyoming: Shoshone and Arapaho.

Native American identity is a complex and contested issue rooted in political sovereignty that pre-dates the creation of colonial nation states like the U.S. and Canada and persists into the 21st century recognized under international law by treaty. The Bureau of Indian Affairs defines Native American as having American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry. Legally, being Native American is defined as being enrolled in a federally recognized tribe or Alaskan village. Ethnologically, factors such as culture, history, language, religion, and familial kinships can influence Native American identity. All individuals on this list should have Native American ancestry. Historical figures might predate tribal enrollment practices and would be included based on ethnological tribal membership, while any contemporary individuals should either be enrolled members of federally recognized tribes or have cited Native American ancestry and be recognized as being Native American by their respective tribes(s). Contemporary unenrolled individuals are listed as being of descent from a tribe.

There are disputes concerning tribal sovereignty, negative effects of gaming, and a loss of Native American culture. In the United States the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was passed in 1988 in order to secure collaboration between the states and tribes and also in order for the federal government to oversee gaming operations. Native American gaming has proven to be extremely lucrative for several tribes, but it has also been unsuccessful in some instances.

It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (\"Ursus arctos middendorffi\"). A boar (adult male) weighs around 350 \u2013 , while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means \"maritime bear\" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.

Context_8 : Juvenilia; or, a Collection of Poems Written between the ages of Twelve and Sixteen by J. H. L. Hunt, Late of the Grammar School of Christ's Hospital, commonly known as Juvenilia, was a collection of poems written by James Henry Leigh Hunt at a young age and published in March 1801. As an unknown author, Hunt's work was not accepted by any professional publishers, and his father Isaac Hunt instead entered into an agreement with the printer James Whiting to have the collection printed privately. The collection had over 800 subscribers, including important academics, politicians and lawyers, and even people from the United States. The critical and public response to Hunt's work was positive; by 1803 the collection had run into four volumes. The \"Monthly Mirror\" declared the collection to show \"proofs of poetic genius, and literary ability\", and Edmund Blunden held that the collection acted as a predictor of Hunt's later success. Hunt himself came to despise the collection as \"a heap of imitations, all but absolutely worthless\", but critics have argued that without this early success to bolster his confidence Hunt's later career could have been far less successful.

Black Stallion started out as a stock 1982 Ford F350 back in 1982, owned and modified by Michael Vaters.

Mike then later added two sunroofs, an Alpine stereo system, a Ford 460 Engine, Rockwell 5 ton toploaders, Clark 20 ton planetaries, 66\" terra tires, a 9\" television and later on, a 1988 Ford F series front end. Between 1990 and 1991, Mike realized the future of monster trucks, which was racing. To be competitive, Mike replaced the leaf springs with airbags, the old heavy split ring rims with lightweight one piece rims, fiberglass body pieces, cutting the tires, gutting the interior out, 4 linking the truck and putting in a bigger engine. The modifications proved to be beneficial to Mike, with close races with First Blood, and competing in some Pendaliner Special Events racing events. After a violent rollover in Bloomsburg Pennsylvania in 1991, Mike decided to put King shocks on the truck, which he later added coil springs in 1992. Along with the coil springs, Mike also removed the airbags. Mike is credited as the first owner to use bypass shocks. Also for 1992, Mike changed the front clip to a 1992 Ford F-series front end.

His large oeuvre of works is extremely varied in style, having been influenced by serialism, atonality, Stravinsky, Italian music, Arabic music and jazz, as well as traditional schools of German composition. In particular, his stage works reflect \"his consistent cultivation of music for the theatre throughout his life\". Context_2 : We Come to the River \u2013 Wir erreichen den Fluss is an opera by Hans Werner Henze to an English-language libretto by Edward Bond. Henze and Bond described this work as \"Actions for music\", rather than an opera. It was Henze's 7th opera, written originally for the The Royal Opera in London, and takes as its focus the horrors of war. The opera was first performed at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London on 12 July 1976, with the composer as producer, J\u00fcrgen Henze as director, and David Atherton conducting. It was subsequently staged at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, and received its first American performance at Santa Fe Opera in 1984, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. Context_3 : Antonio Salieri (] ; 18 August 17507 May 1825) was an Italian classical composer, conductor, and teacher. He was born in Legnago, south of Verona, in the Republic of Venice, and spent his adult life and career as a subject of the Habsburg Monarchy. Context_4 : Hans Werner Henze's Symphony No. 1 was premiered in Darmstadt in 1947. The premiere was hit by Henze\u2019s accustomed bad luck. The orchestral parts, handwritten by the composer himself, had become illegible during photocopying in Schott\u2019s offices and despite the young composer\u2019s best efforts to ink in the parts throughout the night, only the slow movement was performed. The whole symphony was eventually premiered a year later, although Henze himself conducted the work only after comprehensive revision. Context_5 : El Cimarr\u00f3n (The Runaway Slave) is a composition by the German composer Hans Werner Henze, written when the composer lived in Cuba in 1969-1970.

Ashton originally produced Ondine for the Royal Ballet in 1958, with Henze commissioned to produce the original score, published as \"Undine\", which has since been restaged by other choreographers. The ballet was adapted from a novella called \"Undine\" by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9 and it tells the tale of a water nymph who is the object of desire of a young prince named Palemon. The premi\u00e8re of the ballet took place at the Royal Opera House, London, on 27 October 1958, with the composer as guest conductor. The first major revival of this Ashton/Henze production took place in 1988.

The piece is a reworking of the Manon Lescaut story, already adapted operatically by Auber, Massenet and Puccini, and here relocated to Paris after the Second World War where, as is noted in Grove, the focus of the story moves away from Manon and towards Armand des Grieux. It became Henze\u2019s first fully-fledged opera. The work stands out for its strong jazz influences, from a composer who had hitherto been associated with twelve tone technique.

Normally, a primate city must be at least twice as populous as the second largest city in the country. The presence of a primate city in a country usually indicates an imbalance in development \u2014 usually a progressive core, and a lagging periphery, on which the primate city depends for labor and other resources. Not all countries have primate cities (United States, Germany, India, and the People's Republic of China, for example), but in those that do, the rest of the country depends on it for cultural, economic, political, and major transportation needs. Among the best known examples of primate cities are the alpha world cities of London and Paris.

The vast majority of Liberian Muslims are Malikite Sunni, with sizeable Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities. The primary Muslim ethnic groups are the Vai and Mandingo but also Gbandi, Kpelle and other ethnic groups. Historically, Liberian Muslims have followed a relaxed and liberal form of Islam that is heavily influenced by indigenous religions that were integrated into Islam when it came to Liberia in the 16th century with the collapse of the Songhai Empire in Mali. Islamic religious practices vary in cities and towns across the country. Younger Liberian Muslims, particularly in the cities along the coast, tend to be more secular but still practice Islam in everyday life. In rural areas, Liberian Muslims are more conservative in dressing modestly, performing prayers and attending religious studies. The practice of Islam in Liberia has been compared to Sufi Islam common in Senegal and Gambia. The major Islamic holidays, Eid el Fitr, Ramadan and Eid al Adha, called Tabaski Day, are celebrated annually in Liberia. People have begun to go on Hajj to Mecca in recent years. Joint English-Arabic language, Quranic, and Muslim universities and Islamic studies schools have opened and been rebuilt in the capital Monrovia, rural towns and other cities.

The electroweak epoch began when the strong force separated from the electroweak interaction. Some cosmologists place this event at the start of the inflationary epoch, approximately 10\u00a0seconds after the Big Bang. Others place it at approximately 10\u00a0seconds after the Big Bang when the potential energy of the inflaton field that had driven the inflation of the universe during the inflationary epoch was released, filling the universe with a dense, hot quark\u2013gluon plasma. Particle interactions in this phase were energetic enough to create large numbers of exotic particles, including W and Z bosons and Higgs bosons. As the universe expanded and cooled, interactions became less energetic and when the universe was about 10\u00a0seconds old, W and Z bosons ceased to be created. The remaining W and Z bosons decayed quickly, and the weak interaction became a short-range force in the following quark epoch.

Context_5 : A nuclear isomer is a metastable state of an atomic nucleus caused by the excitation of one or more of its nucleons (protons or neutrons). \"Metastable\" refers to the property of these nuclei whose excited states have half-lives longer than 100 to 1000 times the half-lives of the excited nuclear states that decay with a \"prompt\" half life (ordinarily on the order of 10 seconds). As a result, the term \"metastable\" is usually restricted to isomers with half-lives of 10 seconds or longer. Some references recommend 5 \u00d7 10 seconds to distinguish the metastable half life from the normal \"prompt\" gamma emission half life. Occasionally the half-lives are far longer than this, lasting minutes, hours, or years.

Therefore, transmisogyny includes negative attitudes, hate, and discrimination of transgender or transsexual individuals who fall on the feminine side of the gender spectrum. The term was coined by Julia Serano in her 2007 book \"Whipping Girl\" and used to describe the unique discrimination faced by trans women because of \"the assumption that femaleness and femininity are inferior to, and exist primarily for the benefit of, maleness and masculinity\", and the way that transphobia intensifies the misogyny faced by trans women (and vice versa). The term discusses how many trans women experience an additional layer of misogyny in the form of fetishization; Serano talks about how society views trans women in certain ways that sexualize them, such as them transitioning for sexual reasons, or ways where they\u2019re seen as sexually promiscuous.Transmisogyny is a central concept in transfeminism and is commonly seen in intersectional feminist theory.

Context_5 : The mustang is a free-roaming horse of the American west that first descended from horses brought to the Americas by the Spanish. Mustangs are often referred to as wild horses, but because they are descended from once-domesticated horses, they are properly defined as feral horses. The original mustangs were Colonial Spanish horses, but many other breeds and types of horses contributed to the modern mustang, resulting in varying phenotypes. In the 21st century, mustang herds vary in the degree to which they can be traced to original Iberian horses. Some contain a greater genetic mixture of ranch stock and more recent breed releases, while others are relatively unchanged from the original Iberian stock, most strongly represented in the most isolated populations. Context_6 : The horse (\"Equus ferus caballus\") is one of two extant subspecies of \"Equus ferus\". It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae.

Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies \"caballus\" are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.

As such, a feral horse is not a wild animal in the sense of an animal without domesticated ancestors. However, some populations of feral horses are managed as wildlife, and these horses often are popularly called \"wild\" horses. Feral horses are descended from domestic horses that strayed, escaped, or were deliberately released into the wild and remained to survive and reproduce there. Away from humans, over time, these animals' patterns of behavior revert to behavior more closely resembling that of wild horses.
