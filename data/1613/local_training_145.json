After determining if I\u2019m the Asshole, I may post additional details in Change My View in order to get more viewpoints. Feel free to attempt to change my view as well.\n\n\nBack story:\nGrew up in Middle Class America. My parents worked from nothing and earned everything they have, stellar examples. I was instilled with a hard work ethic and told that YOU determine YOUR quality of life. Prior to settling into my career, I\u2019ve lived in a second/third world country for three years, lived across the country for a seasonal job, and lived pay check to paycheck. I\u2019ve had as little as $15.00 in my account at times, I understand that feeling.\n\nThrough researching and deliberation with my parents, I decided to attend a community college. Got a two year degree with no school debt.\n\nFollowed my Father\u2019s footsteps and joined the Blue Collar Company that he works for. I have full benefits, pension, and a salary that increases every year. Here\u2019s the kicker, the company allows me to move horizontally or vertically. The higher I go, this Blue Collar job turns into a White Collar job. Oh, and they\u2019ll pay for my bachelors. \n\nI\u2019ve gone from living paycheck to paycheck, to having an account that continues to grow. I budget and live within my means. I also got married and bought a house that we\u2019ll be in for the next 5-10 years. Retirement? My pension will max out at around 80% of my salary by the time I\u2019m done. I\u2019ve also got some little side investments.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more details I could share, but the point I\u2019m getting at is that I earned what I currently have. Heaven forbid I lose my job tomorrow, I could support my families lifestyle and find another job within 1-3 months. \n\nDisclaimer - I may come off as a douche, but that\u2019s not my intention. I am not intentionally bragging, I simply want to illustrate where I came from and what I\u2019ve done. I am not a trust fund baby.

People now complain about \u201cthe system\u201d when I feel that they forged their own fate.\n\n Did you really think you could get a degree in under water basketweaving and then waltz into some big wig corporate job? Why do you feel like a company owes you a entry level job or internship?\n\n You complain about your student loans, but YOU decided to live above your means and pay anywhere from $20,000-$80,000 for a university? Why?? Where does that make sense?\n\nYou work a low paying job, but drive an expensive vehicle. WHAT!? \n\nRight now, I do not have empathy for you. Your choices have forged your fate. Now, your fate is not SEALED (you can change it if you want), and yes you are now at a disadvantage, but it\u2019s due to your own choices. \n\n\nWith all sincerity, help me determine, see, and possibly change if I am The Asshole", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : \\*names have been changed\\* , TL;DR at bottom \n\n**Background:** \n\nI am a sophomore, almost junior, in college. During my first semester of freshman year, my good friend from high school, Veronica, (we attend the same university) and I became good friends with two girls, Rose and Tara, who are roommates. We all decided to room together the following semester. We chose a place in the on-campus dorms that had two shared rooms and a connecting bathroom. Things went super well for the first month and a half. Then, the drama started. \n\nTara has had some issues with her mental health. We supported her by providing a shoulder to cry on, fun distractions, a listening ear, and also by trying to get her to get some professional help. None of these were problematic at first, but things started getting much worse. Basically, a guy she went on a few dates with told her that he didn't see things moving forward with them, and it devastated her. For the next three days, she was catatonic and crying all the time. She was basically on self-harm and suicide watch. It got to the point where Veronica, Rose, and I had to drop whatever we were doing to go help her.\n\nNear the end of the semester, I started dating one of our good guy friends. He and I were happy. Rose was so happy for us when she heard, but Tara immediately was like, \"Oh, now I need to find a boyfriend so that I will not be alone forever!\" It often seemed like she was trying to compete with me due to some of our similar struggles with mental health issues. Things became so stressful to the point that Rose was losing hair, and the drama with Tara was starting to affect my relationship with my boyfriend (we are still happily together :D ), and Veronica had basically started living with her boyfriend because of the hate that Tara gave her for the smallest things. It was a huge mess. One night when Rose, Veronica, and I were at the store, I received a text from Tara asking if I had an ice pack. I said I didn't and I thought that was that. When we got home, Tara had (what was obviously make up) smeared around her eye in an effort to look like a black-eye. She was like lol it's a joke, but I thought it was really weird and messed up. \n\nThings kind of died down a little, and then the semester ended. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Issue**\n\nBefore the semester ended, Veronica, Tara, and I had decided to room together the following semester (Rose would be doing an internship that semester). But the more Veronica and I thought about it, the more we realized that rooming with Tara would be a problem and that we needed to focus on our own sanity. We confirmed with the apartment complex that we would be able to switch rooms, and then we called Tara together. We talked to her a bit and asked how she was doing. We then brought up rooming. I said something along the lines that I think it would be a good idea if we didn't room together because of the drama last year, and that it would be better for our friendship. Tara was like ok yeah I get that, then she had to go. \n\nThe next day, Veronica and I saw that she had unfollowed us on Instagram and told Rose that she was no longer on speaking terms with us, and that we betrayed her. \n\nA little after Fall semester started, Veronica and I contacted Tara to see if she wanted to meet up. We met up at Starbucks and caught up. Veronica and I thought things went well, and we had talked about meeting up again later. Turns out that Tara had just wanted to see us for closure and that she was done with us. She removed us from social media and basically shut us out of her life. This really hurt me because I didn't think I had done anything wrong, and it made me feel like an awful person. She ignored my texts, so I stopped trying. Are Veronica and I the assholes here or is Tara just overreacting? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMy friend and I changed our minds and decided to not room with our other friend who had caused a lot of drama that had started to affect our own health. She cut us out of her life after. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : AITA or is he? \n\nContext: \nmy bf's friend's mom is organizing a trip to Amsterdam for her sons friends because she lives there. She is paying for their flights and he is unsure of the boarding situation. \n\nWhen he was invited last year we talked about me going with him and paying my own way, flight, lodging,  and food.\n\n This is because our jobs, we have very little PTO which vacation, sick, and personal are all in one, and a very strict attendance policy at our jobs we cant really do much with vacation time. It's really easy to get fired because of attendance. \n\nHence we wont be able to take a real vacation together because of these trips if he goes solo. \n\nYesterday he admitted that he never told them about me coming a long because he didnt want to have the awkward conversation of asking if I could come, and didnt tell me i shouldn't come because he didnt want to hurt my feelings.\n\nThis is AFTER i used up all of my PTO and scheduled it for these trips.\n\nSome context:\n\nHe is also a groomsman in a wedding in FL that we planned on going to together. Last year he was also a groomsman for a wedding we planned on going to together but he never sent the plus 1 and by the time I grabbed it and mailed it in, it was too late and he told me he was going to stay with the guys (lengthy car ride so we were going to get a hotel together originally) so I stayed home alone, and btw it was our first anniversary, he left friday, our anniversary was Saturday (day of the wedding, which would have been ok if we were there together) sent me anniversary flowers and a bear-never did this before, and came back Sunday.\n\nThis upcoming wedding invitation did not have a plus 1 option so he was supposed to confirm with his friend that I can come.\nWhich he hasn't done. PTO already put in for this too.\n\nFor Amsterdam and Europe, for months I have been asking him to confirm dates, details, and to tell them I'm coming but paying for myself. We agreed that we were going together no matter what unless PTO got declined for me, or if I cant afford it. -which is not the case.\n\nLast night he got communication from his friends mom that she is going to order his flight ticket and confirm with him that he is coming. he failed to tell her or his friend that I am coming. \n\nLast night was when he finally admitted after I got upset that he hasn't told them I'm coming, that he felt bad and weird asking them if I can come when I wasnt invited\n ( I do not know them, he has never introduced me to his friends, we only hang out with his family, our mutual work friends, and my friends- which me hanging out with my friends without him makes him feel uncomfortable so if hes with his friends I'm alone at home ) \n\ni have one day a week when one girl-friend sleeps over on mondays because a group of friends/co workers come over for D&amp;D and she lives too far to go home later. \n\nHes been trying to get me to not have her sleepover because \"our bed\" at my place is his bed too and he doesnt like her.\n\nWe have been together for over a year, work together, and he stays at my house fri-sunday nights every week. Our weekends are always spent together unless he hangs out with his friends (not often, they live pretty far) and we hangout at work mon-thursday. \n\nI am not only upset, furious, and hurt, but this is something I have been considering breaking up over. We talked it over but reached no resolution as to if I'm going on either trip. \n\nI'm so hurt that he would rather lead me on and hurt me later and completely putting something off because he doesnt want to have an \"awkward conversation\". \n\nHe did this last year too. He went to a bachelor party in Vegas for several days with a group of guys I dont know-which I was okay with, but because he was saving up for vegas, we didnt get to go an a big trip together for vacation and i settled for a weekend camping trip a couple hours away and another weekend trip to a beach in the winter a few hours away, both trips I had to pay for just to get him to come.\n\nI am his first GF ever, hes never been in a serious relationship until me.

We planned for me(F 29) to go and pay for myself, but turns out he never told the people who invited him that I am going, I dont know them, and I was officially uninvited by him, because of never actually being invited by them to begin with.

POST : Throw away account, sorry I\u2019m on mobile.\n\nSo this happened sometime ago, during Christmas. My husband and I are not well off. We both came together at a point in our lives So this happened sometime ago, during Christmas. My husband and I are not well off. We both came together at a point in our lives where we had nothing or very little, but we were full of love and acceptance. We have gotten help from friends and family for things like an old couch that no one wants and is quite frankly uncomfortable. We accepted a used mattress because it was literally all we could get. I\u2019m not kidding you, people came together to help us with so much, but a lot of stuff was just old, broken unwanted things that we could make do with. Silverware,  nightstands, cups, clothes, you name it! We graciously accepted whatever we could in those first few months so that we didn\u2019t have to sit, sleep, and eat off the floor.\n\nFast forward a few years and yeah, we\u2019re still poor but hey! We make do, save money to buy what we can (we got a new mattress!!) and live with what we have (still have the awful couch). We know what we NEED and we know what we want, and we make it very clear that we don\u2019t want frivolous expenditures as gifts when that money could be better spent. Obviously we are always grateful for gifts, like my husband was given a google pixel xl from his brother (who at the time was extremely well to do) some 2 years ago after his current phone died that he still uses. My MIL upgraded her phone and let me have her old one, just in time since my previous phone screen SHATTERED. What I\u2019m trying to say is I never ask for anything that would not help our situation and don\u2019t go asking for support unless we are in dire straits. Much of the time, people ask us if we could use an item that they no longer want which can be extremely helpful. We make miracles happen and pull through. \n\nSO! Christmas! We get little for each other since we\u2019re often strapped for cash, and do what we can for family and friends. Sometimes it\u2019s just a card with a lotto ticket. Sometimes we make food and gift that. Once my husband made personal drawn cards for our friends and they loved it. We always let people know that we don\u2019t expect gifts, especially because we can\u2019t afford to give back every time. One year his brother goes on a last minute spending spree and gets everyone something pricey. It was wonderful seeing their mother enjoy her beautiful present, and although the nieces and nephews weren\u2019t there that year I\u2019m sure they loved theirs as well. BIL then brings ours, which looks like a tv. Now, we already have a tv. It\u2019s by no means huge, I think it\u2019s maybe 38, 42 inches and it\u2019s either plasma or lcd (whatever, it\u2019s thin ok?). But this tv works great, just peachy keen. We got this one technically from BIL because he had given it to their father, who then passed away. So he let us have it since he had a 50 inch smart tv and had no use. \nCue me looking at this new smart tv, same size, same thickness, same everything except it\u2019s smart I guess. This tv was expensive, needlessly so, and he grabbed it as a last thought not as a planned gift. I awkwardly laugh and say \u201cBut we already have a tv?\u201d and of course \u201cThank you!\u201d, and \u201cIt\u2019s really cool, I\u2019m just not sure what to do with it\u201d which is true, what do you need two TVs for? Yes, I know that some people have one in their bedroom but that\u2019s not gonna happen since A: no plug outlet for it in there B: I don\u2019t watch tv in bed and I don\u2019t wanna start C: we don\u2019t even have cable, we just watch a few movies here and there using the computer we hook up. There are some awkward laughs and some awkward thank you\u2019s. Leaving the house and coming home I start in about how husband\u2019s brother is bad with money so often. How he could have used that money for anything else, not even just for us but for himself. I get beggy-choosey (I know that\u2019s what it is, no delusions there) about how if he really wanted to spend that much on a gift for us BIL could have asked what we needed. I\u2019d say a couch, or husbands glasses, or if he\u2019d offered, a bed frame since we actually still don\u2019t have a real one. These hypothetical gift ideas don\u2019t matter to me, I\u2019m just upset at this much money being thrown at nothing.\nHusband say something to MIL, like how we don\u2019t know what to do but sell the old tv so we don\u2019t have an extra for no reason. MIL decides to talk to BIL (without us knowing, this was NOT our idea) into returning the tv and just giving us the money. He is vehemently against this, which although I never wanted him to do this it rubs me the wrong way. We tell MIL don\u2019t worry about it, we\u2019re sorry we said anything, tell BIL the same. Months go by and before I get to selling it a friend says they need one (that\u2019s a whole other story) so I let them have it for free in a pay it forward manner. We use the smart tv, which has admittedly a better picture but is abysmally slow to turn on, and for some reason won\u2019t connect to anything anyway. Whatever, it\u2019s still a tv.\n\nWhat I want to know is, was I the asshole for being practical and realistic during Christmas? Everyone knows our situation and knows I don\u2019t want to be read as entitled just because of unnecessary spending.

POST : AITA for how I reacted \nI feel like my boyfriend will put everything before me.\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years, we work shift work and live about 45 minutes away so we have limited time to spend together. He came over to stay the night after work on Tuesday, knowing I would have to be at work at 11:30am on Wednesday. I asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind coming to my place as I had 2 double shifts in a row. \nUnfortunately on Tuesday night I was up all night with the flu, barely slept in the same bed, taking up residence on the couch not wanting to wake him when I ran to the bathroom to vomit. \nEventually he woke up and found me on the couch and sat with me for a bit, then went and got me some fluids, and went home. He had the next two days off and I know he needed to get some work done (he is doing an online course). I asked him at that time can he come over on Thursday if I\u2019m feeling better \u201che said maybe if it will make you feel better\u201d, so he spends the day doing work then goes out for wings with some friends and they play board games at night. \nHe messages me at 11:30pm when he is about to sleep and again I ask if he can come over the next day. Again he says maybe he can do it. \nFlash toward to today, I\u2019m feeling a bit better but not 100% so I ask him if when he is done his school work if he will come over.\nHe says he wants to watch baseball at 3pm, I tell him he can watch that at my house with me! And he can bring his work over for after(I have class work I need to do as well) he says he won\u2019t get any work done. And his whole plan was to do school work and watch baseball. At this point I\u2019m a little upset and I ask him, where was this plan when I was asking you yesterday, if you\u2019d come over.\nHis response was \u201cit was his plan and he didn\u2019t communicate that to me like he should have\u201d \nNow I\u2019m pretty upset, I feel like baseball, is taking priority over me. I rarely ask him to put other things before myself, and I know school work is important. But it feels like he is willing to sacrifice his schoolwork for things he wants. I am also frustrated because when I asked him why he didn\u2019t tell me this was his plan from the get go if it was \u201call along\u201d and he said it\u2019s cause I would have been mad at him yesterday. \nHe is known to be horrible at communicating about things and he have run into this problem numerous times. In the messages he tells me to leave him alone numerous times, and swears at me.\nI do not reciprocate swearing or telling him to leave me alone.\nNow he is trying to back track saying I don\u2019t want him to do his work, when I initially asked him to come over when he was done his work, and he was the one saying he was watching baseball.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened.\nAm I the Asshole for feeling upset about being a priority and lack of communication? \n", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : So first thing's first, I'm a 16yo \"gifted\" high school student and I've lived with my mom all my life. Since I was a kid, my mom has always been highly critical of me. My weight, my grades, my shyness, everything. She loves comparing me to her when she was a kid, how she got straight A's all the time, how she was a model when she was my age, how she graduated High school when she was 15, etc. I've never heard her say a single nice thing about me. Even when I'd come home with straight A's, she wouldn't congratulate me she'd just ask why they aren't 100s. When I developed bad allergies a few years ago and had constant congestion, she'd always call me annoying and ask if my peers found me annoying as well. I distinctly remember her telling me that I should never tell my friends about my feelings cause then they'll get annoyed with me. This isn't even bringing up her racism, homophobia and transphobia, and the physical abuse I went through as a kid.\n\nMy breaking point kinda came a year ago, when she let my useless brother come down to live with us again... and bring 4 other people including a baby. I won't get into too much about them (read 1st post on here if you want to know), but me and my brother's girlfriend, Gertrude, don't exactly get along. \n\nEverytime me and Gertrude would fight, she'd take her side. Even in cases when I'd do nothing wrong. (Ex. A TV repair man came to the house one day and asked if he was at the right place, I asked Gertrude's daughter (13) if she knew, and her mom got mad that I didn't ask her, then proceeded to gossip about me in the next room. She's 35 btw) I'm sick of it.\n\nLately her newest kick has been telling me to give up in my dream of becoming a vet, or even going to college for that matter. Just yesterday she told me that I wasn't going to be able to make it to my dream Uni because no one would want to room with me in an apartment, on account of how lazy, nasty and annoying I am. \n\nI've told her months ago that I plan on leaving her forever and cutting off all contact with them once I go to college, she and my useless brother called me a selfish and manipulative asshole for it. Even my very supportive Aunt told me not to do it. I want them out of my life and I don't know what else to do.

AN and I hit it off, we start a FWB thing. He introduces me to his friends, one of them, TT, talks to me quite often over insta. Now, AN and I were spending quite a bit of time together and it was clear we were developing feelings. I told him how often TT and I talked and he told me TT was just trying to sleep with me. AN told me that TT had literally asked AN if he could ask me out. I message TT, clarify that I have no interest in \"homie hopping\" and that we're just friends. TT acquiesced, but a few weeks later blows up on me for something random, says some rude shit in front of our friends. Eventually apologized but it was clear why he was upset. \n\nTT and I were friends for a while (about 6 months) while AN and I navigated our increasingly complicated relationship.  We had lots of meaningful conversations. \n\nEventually shit between AN and I reaches a boiling point &amp; things are ended. Shortly after things are ended, TT and I hang out. I joke that I need some rebound sex. TT literally says to me, \"You're trying to get laid, I'm trying to get laid...\" I cut him off there- him and AN are still friends, I know AN had feelings for me, I'm not comfortable getting between two good friends. Besides, I told him we were never going to be more than friends. He agrees. The next day he texts me and tells me he was an idiot for suggesting it; I tell him it's alright, I understand why you brought it up. \n\nSuddenly we stop talking as much. Days go by without communication, when previously we would at least share memes or music daily. \n\nAnd again, out of nowhere he BLOWS UP on me over messenger. He said some unbelievably hurtful things. He used insecurities I've confided in him against me. My self esteem took a massive blow; I cried myself to sleep several times (which is very out of character, I'm not a crier) and I even relapse into self harm. \n\nIt took a lot of work to get over what he said, I was already in a very delicate state because of AN's treatment of me. My current boyfriend helped me trust men again because after those two, I felt like I was worthless aside from my looks. \n\nI've avoided TT since, and generally moved on. Despite my best efforts, he's always around my other friends and I ran into him; he asked if we could talk. He \"apologized,\" by saying he \"was very stressed out about being in the middle of AN and I's 'break-up'\" (which, to be fair, we did put him in the middle of) and I happened to be who he blew up on. I told him I have moved on but I want nothing to do with him. \n\nNow some of our friends think I'm being an asshole, while to me it's clear TT was just waiting for good chance to get in my pants, and never really valued my friendship.

K is the sister of one of B, who is one of my decently good friends, certainly not best, but we hang out every week or two, used to do so a lot more, and have always been very friendly and open. He very rarely mentions his sister so I don't know the feelings he might harbor towards her or how protective he is. That being said, within that friend group there is an ongoing joke about them wanting to hook up with my sister, wanting to make moves on her, and even going so far as to slide into her DM's. B has participated fairly minimally in this, but still has made the extremely occasional comment and laughed at the jokes.\n\nI'm currently talking to/hanging out with a few girls, and just kinda taking things as they go after getting hurt by numerous girls after catching feelings too soon a few times last semester, and certainly do not think K is looking for anything super serious and is doing the same thing somewhat.

Sorry, on mobile. \n\nSo, I've seen quite a few posts by men who want their girlfriends to lose weight. They tend to end up the asshole, usually because there's some element of \"lose weight to get hot.\" This makes me wonder if I'm also an asshole. \n\nAs long as I've known my husband, from the best friend days to the dating days to marriage, he's always had a little extra chub around his middle &amp; thighs. We joke that with our genes combined, our children are going to have unstoppable booty.\n\nFor a year-plus now, he's been working a job that sucks the life out of him to make ends meet. A side effect (or perhaps correlative) especially over the last few months has been a bit of a ballooning in his weight. He's now currently at the heaviest he's ever been and still gaining. \n\nHe comes home with swollen ankles and feet, back pain, and he's accidentally ripped his uniform pants twice recently (they went from ill-fitting loose to ill-fitting tight). Obviously I hate how much pain he's in, and give him massages when I can, hot pads, etc.\n\nFor bonus context, I'm hitting 8 months pregnant and have also been gaining weight like it's my job. We tell each other that we're chubby pretty frequently and there's a lot of fat fondling in our relationship. \n\nSometimes I crave shit I shouldn't eat and will say stuff like, \"I want (diabetes inducing processed food), but I'm just gonna get fatter.\" He'll reply with hugs and something like, \"That's okay. You're my cute, chubby (embarrassing pet name) and you're pregnant. Let's get (McNasty YumYums).\"\n\nSo, I get enabled almost unconditionally to have whatever I crave, but I still try to reel in my cravings so I don't actually eat shit every day. BUT when it comes to grocery shopping trips or my husband's snack cravings, I have found myself much more worried about what he's eating and will try to talk him out of certain purchases sometimes. It's not 100% black and white, but he's basically the perfect support and I'm maybe accepting 50% of the time. \n\nMost recent example, from last night: We went out to grab donuts because I was craving donuts. As we grab that and milk, my husband asks, \"Should we get ice cream too?\" (This store sells lactose free ice cream in his favorite flavor.) and I immediately said, \"Nah that's going overboard.\" (We always get enough of my craving food to share fifty-fifty.) He didn't protest and we left. \n\nI also bring up his weight gain fairly routinely as a point of concern because of his chronic joint pains. While he doesn't seem to mind, I don't know if I'm actually just an asshole and he's got thick skin.\n\nSo, given the context, AITA?\n\nTl;dr: Hubs's got a booty that won't quit, getting thiccer by the day. I'm becoming a veritable baby blimp myself. We both acknowledge our mutual fatness, but only one of us tries to stop the other from eating abject shit.

POST : posting this from a new account because I'm kind of trying to start over on reddit after the last week...\n\nMaybe a month ago I met this guy on Tinder. It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

However, all the security guards are men, and won\u2019t lay their hands on her and are letting her run a rampage in the crowd waiting for the one female guard to come from a stage somewhere else at the festival. Security eventually does talk her into coming to the side of the pit on the gate, right behind us, where they try to talk sense to her, but she keeps screaming and running back into the crowd and returning a couple minutes later. We are about at the 7th song in the set now. She keeps bumping into my girlfriend really rough when she runs in and out of he crowd and my girlfriend can\u2019t reason with her to stop.\n\nThe next time she runs over to us the security have her top that she dropped by them before and ask her to put it on. She\u2019s clearly capable, but for whatever reason asks my girlfriend who\u2019s facing away from her for help putting it on. My gf is pissed, and ignores her, and the girl immediately reacts to being ignored by jumping on her back and pushing her to the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t have time to think about my reaction. I stepped into her and grabbed her wrists, I pinned them to her shoulders, and pinned her to the barricade. I make some kind of speech I can\u2019t remember about her needing to chill out because she isn\u2019t being cool. She freezes. I look around for anybody to come and help me. A friend of hers. Security standing just feet away still watching. The longest 10-15 seconds of my life pass and a security guy plays down what she did as something stupid and they are trying to get help with, let her go. \n\nI took a step back, gave her space, let go of her hands, and security had about 5 seconds to try and talk to her before she began screaming and throwing her arms in the air and running into the crowd barreling through people like the last minute didn\u2019t just happen.\n\nPeople came up to me on the barrier a handful of times. Telling me that they saw what happened but I need to keep my cool because it would be dumb for me to get kicked out. It sounds like they say it in a way that they sound to me like they are saying I was wrong. I had a couple people come all the way through the crowd, get my attention, and flip me off and fuck myself for putting my hands on her.\n\nThe girl eventually makes her way to the front of the crowd where security pulls her over the rail and out of the concert. The performer sees the naked girl and is impressed by the streaker at her show, and dedicates the next song to her. I feel like a victim in the situation where the person who just knocked over my girlfriend is praised for being a class A jackass... from my perspective obviously.\n\nI\u2019m still not over how angry that day made me.", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

I have tried many times to reason with her regarding her bigotry, but she always sees it as an attack and shouts me down.\n\nHowever, we were very close for many years. I knew she was troubled and as the older sibling was thinking that in talking it through with her, being there for her, just generally showing her love, that she would slowly start growing out of it. She has always been possessive and controlling of me, but I know it is because she doesn't know better, she can't handle her emotions and withdrawing from her would reinforce her feelings of being all alone against the world.\n\nShe is also smart, talented, can be very charming, and has been my emotional support quite a few times. For a period of a few months we were working together through our childhood issues by talking about it, retelling memories, etc. We were pretty tight.\n\nLast year I entered a new relationship. My sister immediately wanted all of us to \"hang out\". There were a few instances where she acted overly jealous but most of it was underhanded slights and just general talking over my GF and dominating the conversation. My GF was very patient but after a few months snapped back at her. This resulted in my sister exploding in a storm of verbal assault, calling my GF \"a b\\*tch\", \"crazy\", \"Nobody wants you here\", \"I can see right through you\", and finally she slammed her against a wall.\n\nAfter this I told her that her behavior crossed a line,  and that for the time being I need my distance.\n\nHer reply was very angry, she said my GF brainwashed me, clearly my GF wanted to pull me away from the family, and that she will never forget or forgive how I abandoned my sister. She accepted zero responsibility for her own actions. She said she did her best to accept my GF without even knowing her, always inviting her or us to hang out together, and basically had an open heart. She said my whole view of the events is misconstrued.\n\nThis happened 3 months ago. We haven't spoken or interacted since.

POST : My girlfriend and I met a year and a half ago through a dating app and at he time she joked that I had just made the cutoff in regards to what she is looking for in height since she set 6\u20190\u201d as her minimum and I happen to be 6\u20191\u201d. She also happens to be fairly tall (5\u201910\u201d). \n\nSince we have been dating she would periodically say how she wishes that the height difference between us was larger because she feels that because of her height and stature that she doesn\u2019t feel womanly enough when standing next to me. She does has self esteem issues that relate to how she thinks she is perceived because of her height/weight. I always tell her how much I love her and how beautiful she is which is absolutely true in my eyes.\n\nFlash forward to last night where we are hanging out at a bar and she is sitting down and I am standing up next to her. The stool she is sitting on is fairly low so her head is probably about 5\u20195\u201d-ish from the floor. She jokes that she wishes that she was that y\u2019all compared to me. I then proceed to ask her the hypothetical question of \u201cIf I were to magically become 5\u20195\u201d tomorrow would you still date me?\u201d. She responds with \u201cI don\u2019t think it would work out.\u201d\n\nI got a bit upset since I thought that at this point in the relationship that regardless of the fact that we now live together and I treat her with kindness and love that it isn\u2019t enough if I were to suddenly become shorter (in this hypothetical line of questioning). I know that she has issues on her self esteem but I always try to make her feel better and make her feel like the beautiful woman she is. She said that if I were to be shorter that she would feel \u201clike a big gargantuan person and not feel like the woman in the relationship\u201d. \n\nI think her answer also hurt me because I took it as \u201cin the end of the day no matter if I give her the most amount of love or care in the world my height will always be the underlying factor of what keeps the relationship afloat\u201d. I also have some self esteem issues where I wonder if I am good enough for anyone. Since me started dating I\u2019ve been so happy knowing that someone actually does care for me but now it stings knowing that my height is a fairly large contributor to that. \n\nWe went to bed that night where she could tell that I was a bit upset over the situation and as a result was making her a bit emotional about the situation. I hate seeing her sad in any way but I too was feeling sad about it. I ended the night by saying \u201cWell hopefully you don\u2019t meet anyone taller than me because I may be replaced\u201d.\n\nAITA for being a upset that my girlfriend holds my height above everything else about me as a critical trait to our relationship?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

I told him I did not want to do that, that it made me feel sick and uncomfortable and reopened stuff I just wanted to forget about. He then started calling me selfish, that he was emotionally affected by it too and that he needed the evidence to get the time as the two days he spent with me were on the week everything was taught for his essays. We sort of left it last night with me agreeing to call them, even though I still really didn\u2019t want to, then this morning I asked if he was going to apologise for shouting at me and calling me selfish. He point blank refused. He said that he stood by every word he said and that I was being selfish and not thinking about him. He then said \u2018are we done? Cos I need to go sort my life out\u2019 and we hung up. I\u2019ve spoken to my housemate and she said I was well within my right to refuse to do something I didn\u2019t want to. I\u2019m glad she is sticking with me because otherwise I would probably feel like I had done something wrong. I love this guy and understand that he truly believes he needs this evidence and that he will fail if he doesn\u2019t - I just don\u2019t know how to feel, am I really being so ridiculously selfish? \n\n", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : Yesterday was my little brother's birthday, so my mom organized a little party only including our direct family and her brother's. My sister has been very distant from the family ever since she left home for university. However, whenever she does come home for someone's birthday or Christmas, she always drops off a couple of lottery tickets as presents before she heads off on her way.\n\nMy brother scratched off one of his tickets, and got a match. He wasn't too excited because we have won a few times over the years, but only actually got $5 max. He asked me to go out and redeem it because he wasn't 18 yet, and I was initially reluctant because we live out of town and the closest lotto is 30 minutes away. I told him I would go if he gave me half of what he won, and he agreed.\n\nI left to redeem the ticket, and I ended up winning $500, cash in hand. I was fucking stoked and rushed back home. When I told him and showed him the money, he was ecstatic. I handed $250, then he looked at me and said \"What the fuck.\" I asked him what was wrong and he told me to hand over the rest. After I tried to explained to him that we made a deal, he started getting mad and throwing a little tantrum. I tried reminding him that I spent almost $200 getting him one of those authentic football jersey of his favourite player, Neymar, but he was having none of it.\n\nThe rest of the family came over to find out what all of the ruckus was about, and my brother told our mom that I stole his money. I tried again to explain the situation, but he kept interrupting me and screaming that it was his lottery ticket, and his money. Our mom, stepped in and said that said that if we can't sort it out then she'll just take it, as she snatched it out of my brother's hands before attempting to do the same to me. I dodged her attempt and told her again that we made a deal, before she told me to give it. I yelled \"fuck this\" as I left and drove back to my college dorm a couple hours from home.\n\nAfter I got to my dorm was getting texts from my mom, brother, and a couple cousins telling me to come back home, or just saying that I was acting like a dick. I ignored everyone, but when I got a text from my sister (who I haven't really talked to for almost a year) which said \"I heard you won some money from my ticket\", I just replied with \"lmao, fuck off\".\n\nSo, am I really in the wrong for keeping half the money?\n\nTLDR: My brother won $500 off his lottery ticket after we agreed that we would split it 50/50.

After that i begin to not trust her anymore.She swears in everything that she hasn't done anything with anyone but still i was not sure and even though i stayed with her for 2 months never was the same.Anyhow she breaks up with me and i almost felt into depression .'Funny thing \" i went to a second doctor at that time to get a second opinion and told me something completely different.That this STD could be inactive in a woman for more that 2 years and that meant that she was probably right and i was wrong. \n\nI tried to get her back for almost 1 month until she agrees to meet me for a coffee.We get there and she was distant and cold.She told me that i should have trust her i agree with that.I was worried though that she was so cold so i asked what is going on and she tells me that she slept with someone else.I was upset and left not answering her messages for a week until she stopped.\n\n**10 years later** \n\nNo more that a few happy birthday SMS all this time.She gets FB account and i have a friend request from her.Nothing more than  smalltalk for 3 months until she starts talking more and more about us and what a good time we had and what a fool she was to left me .A few days later she announces me that she took a seminar job (she is a dancer ) in my island hoping that we would meet and catch up .I had a really hard time getting over her so i wasn't willing to meet up  since i knew our chemistry would overpower my brain easily. I declined her suggestions to meet and then i go to camping trip in a remote beach to fish and get her out of my head.That didn't happen though because we kept talking and ended up  telling her where i am  and she just took the last bus to come and find me.The bus stops like 30km away and she hitchhiked the rest of the way to the beach.I was astonished and flattered.She really wanted to see me..\n\nThings escalated quickly and we hit it of once again like nothing had happened.She finished her seminar after 2 weeks and stays with me for 1 week .While talking she said that she was sorry about the way we broke up but  i should have tried more.I explain that i tried until i learned that she had slept with someone else.Says sorry multiple times and i have no bad feeling about it ,it has been 10 years since then.Everything was like the first time.\n\nShe left and went back home to the capital while i stayed in my hometown since i had jobs planned for the next 10 days.After that i was going to meet her and stay together for 2 weeks before i returned.We were talking through skype every night until we went to sleep and planning what we were gonna do while i was there,planning what shall we do to the future.Until 3 nights before i travel to find her she disappears.Called her twice no answer .

We didn\u2019t get too and because the ground was carpet, but we were annoyed nonetheless. \n\nThen later in the night, he kept opening his beers on my WOODEN furniture. He def dented my table and some other things. I was not ok with this. I mean, the table wasn\u2019t really mine, it was a house mates, and the same for the other furniture, so I called him out. \n\nDespite that, he kept doing it, so inicie decided to take the beers away from the party and just leave the canned ones to avoid confrontation. \n\nLater, he was talking about how some beers he brought sucked, and then I jokingly replied, \u201cyeah they suck\u201d and he got extremely defensive about it.

In the past we had no issue with them, but our neighbours have allowed their dogs to bark all day for HOURS ON END. Naturally due to the neighbours' deafness, they cannot hear their dogs barking and it simply continues....\n\nWhen the issue first occured, we left a note in their mailbox politely explaining that my brother and father work jobs that require them to wake up early in the mornings and the incessant barking was becoming an issue. A week went by and we received no response, yet the barking continued. Eventually my mother contacted the father of the deaf-mute husband and explained the situation, his only response was to laugh and tell my mother \"your husband and son should just use ear plugs or sleep in different rooms\".\n\nMy mother decided to contact the local council about the issue. After about two months, the council issued a formal warning. The barking continued....\n\nMy mother contacted the father again abd explained our situation, the father explained in an irritated manner that \"the dogs are there to help his deaf-mute son and wife with their daily activities due to their conditiod, and that we should just put up with it\". We were confued, surely there is no need for their dogs to incessantly bark like that though? \n\nEventually we sought mediation from the council, and the council ruled that one of the dogs be separated and live at the father's property. The neighbours were not happy but complied for a while.\n\nThis brings me to the present. I am starting to get fed up with the fact that the neighbours seem to pay no regard to us or the official warnings issued by the council.\n\nSo I took matters into my own hands.\n\nUnhappy with the fact that the father neighbours are so inconsiderate and seemingly thinking that this issue is a big joke by laughing at us whenever they see us, I contacted the father myself this time. I explained to him that the barking has continued for months now despite our complaints, and how his son laughs whenever he sees us, I gave him an ultimatum.\n\nThey either adhere to the official orders ruled by the council, or I take the matter to the court. This did not sit well with the father, as he decided to abuse me over the phone calling, my family horrible people, stripping his disabled son and wife of their right to have dogs.\n\nI filed for the court proceeding and the magistrate ruled both dogs off the premises as it was quite clear to her that the dogs were merely pets, rather than aids, as there was no paper-work to prove such a thing.\n\nWhile we are happy with this outcome, we still cop abuse from the husband and dead-mute neighbours occassionally....\n\nAITA for having the dogs removed?", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : This happened two years ago I had just turned Eighteen as my birthday is within two weeks of Christmas.\nSo, my family live nowhere near eachother and it's often hard for my side of the family to travel up north to see my Aunt and her family every year so we often go every other year, or sometimes once every three years.\nAnyway, this was the first Christmas since my sister had left for university and I didn't have any money and I was still in college so I hadn't seen her all year.\nWell Christmas dinner comes around and there's my Aunt, Uncle, my cousin and his wife alongside their two kids and my other cousin's son alongside me and my parents and sister, my dad didn't sit at the table as he was actually really sick at the time and the drive up the day before had really exhausted him so my aunt let him eat in the living room, now, you'd think as I'm legally an adult now my aunt would start thinking of as one, like she did to my sister. Nope. Didn't you read the title? Of course not, this stays true to this day, for my birthday last year my mum and dad got me a really nice bottle of black spiced rum and my aunt sent them a message saying \"That's an inappropriate gift for him!\" \nAnyway I've got off track. So I go to sit with my dad since, I knew if I didn't I'd have to sit with the children and I am not really a fan of children and these kids, are just little goblins, the oldest one always uses big words to sound smart and will often say he's smarter than me, I normally just ignore him, The second eldest kicks and punches me and will do so given any opportunity, the youngest I don't really have a problem with since he's so young and doesn't do much.\nMy aunt tells me I have to sit at the table so I do, don't wanna cause any arguments, it's Christmas,  I sat next to my sister, and my cousin's wife, says \"Oh, can you sit at the end with the rest of the children I wanna sit and chat with your sister.\"\nI just sit there in a stunned silence for a second and go \"Okay sure.\" And move, again, Christmas.\nSo the meal goes on great, my sister knowing I'm a little bit upset keeps looking at me and asking if I'm alright. \nNow, this is the height of vine, when things like bottle flip, 9+10=21 and Damn Daniel are still popular and these kids start screaming these at the top of their lungs and the second eldest, my cousin's oldest grabs a handful of vegetables and throws them at me and laughs with a mouthful of chewed food.\nAfter that lovely little event I pick up my plate and go sit with my dad, where it's silent but we can still hear what's going on in the other room.\nMy aunt asks me to come sit back at the table and when I say no, she gets my mother involved, my poor easily stressed mother who could tell I was stressed already because I got that from her. My mum wanted me to do what I wanted to do but to stay on good terms with Aunt got me to come back with my aunt saying \"Your mother who has a hard time getting around got up to get you back so don't be rude and come sit back at the table please.\" I see my dad roll his eyes because he knows what she's done, I am really easy to guilt trip especially when it comes to my mum and dad since they're getting old, they're both in their fifties.\nI reluctantly return to the table and endure the mess that is my cousin's children.\n\nWhat do you think people of Reddit?

We sold our last home and moved to this area last spring. We originally tried to buy here but there was nothing on the market we liked so we signed a lease and decided to wait. We used a great, very knowledgeable agent back then. Really nice, competent guy, who has been in the business awhile and helped a family member close on a home a couple yrs ago. \n\nWell, last summer my sister-in-law's bff Ann Perkins (not real name) got her real estate license. I have always really liked this girl. She's vivacious, bubbly, all around sweet woman. She is working full time as something else, and just wants to do real estate part time. She closed on her first home just last week so she's very new to the business.\n\nI shot her a question a few weeks ago about a property, and we texted some about that and another. She said she'd check in on a property and get back with me and then never did. \n\nWe felt uneasy going with her since she has no experience (and we watched the buyer of our last home fumble and bumble with a brand new agent and were not eager to live that again). A few days after she didn't get back with me, I reached out to our old agent and he immediately got on the ball (because this is his full-time job) and got us connected with a lender. A week and a half later, he rode around with us and we toured some properties with him. Literally while we're at one of the houses--which was one I texted with Ann Perkins about--I get a picture text from Ann Perkins asking if that was the property I was wondering about. Weird coincidence or small town talk? Hmmm.\n\nI never texted her back (this was last week) and just yesterday she texted me again asking if I got her text. I told her I did and chatted some about the property and apologetically explained that we'd gone with our original agent. I think she's upset and my husband is positive his mom and sister told her and the original text wasn't a coincidence.\n\nI feel guilty, but my parents even warned us to choose our agent wisely and I felt like going with Ann Perkins wouldn't have been the wisest choice (she gave us some bad advice about pre-approval, for example, that I only caught because we've bought a home before). My husband thinks we're assholes and now regrets going with our old agent (even though he prefers him and 100% shares my concerns about Ann Perkins). He says sometimes it's worth taking a hit or not getting the best possible deal for the sake of our social circle and to help a family friend out.\n\nTLDR: We kind of snubbed a family friend who recently got her real estate license to go with an experienced agent.

So I'll be leaving out a lot. \n\nI've never had a great relationship with my mother, she belongs somewhere in r/entitledparents. But that's a story for another day. \n\nEither way, my son is autistic. He'll be 6 this year. Back in Sept of 2016, I was struggling with my own mental illness, and I reached out for some help. Up to that point, I'd been using the ignore it and it'll go away method. It was not working. So after some fighting, my mom agreed to take care of my son for a few weeks, so I could figure shit out.\n\nA few weeks went by, and *insert long list of reasons*, she pitched this idea to give her custody of him on paper. It was all about the money for her, I see that now. But at the time, I thought she was trying to help me. \n\nFast forward a few more weeks, and I was starting to do better. My son would spend weekends at my house, and weekdays at my moms house.\n\nThen she stopped picking him up, weeks went by, medication not taken. I started to go back down, and in Aug I went to the psyc ward for 7 weeks to get help. \n\nWhen I got out, she refused to let me see my son. Dec rolled around and I still hadn't seen him. I get a message from her saying that she had applied for disability for him, and it was approved with back pay. She asked me to check if I was getting it.\n\nThat's weird I thought, considering it was 13 months since I legally had him, and she did all the leg work. But I checked and sure enough, I was getting just shy of 4 grand. \n\nWe talked about it, and I was under the impression that it was all of the back pay, and I agreed to split it with her. Upon looking into it further later, I realized that the amount was wrong. She had given me the date from where the back pay started, as well as the monthly amount, and it was short. 13 months short. \n\nRealizing what she did, I messaged her again. Knowing from her history that it was intentional, but not wanting to upset her, I said something to effect of \"Oh hey, mines short, you should check your account, there should be another ~1700 dollars you're getting, isn't that great!\".\n\nDoes she take the out? No, she doubles down.

She said I was disrespectful and selfish for not giving it to her, and questioning her about it. And how dare I accuse her of lying, she never lied to me. \n\nTo make a long story short, I didn't give her the money. She tells friends and family that I abandoned my son, and I don't want him back, when she's refusing to let me see him because I wouldn't give her the money.

I guess let me give you guys some backstory. I am a 25-year old first year electrical apprentice and really enjoy what I do. I love physical work, buying new tools, and most of all fulfilling customer\u2019s electrical needs. Doing good work and learning as much as I can is certainly my number one priority.\n\nWithin the last month the company I work for hired a new journeyman. Let\u2019s call him J. J is old school and has been an electrician for longer than I have been alive. Needless to say he is very knowledgeable and experienced in the electrical field. Problem is I recently found out J is a long time meth user and has no intention to quit. \n\nThe first day working with J was pretty straight forward. I finished a couple jobs in the morning and then met him at customer\u2019s house to replace a couple of high ceiling chandeliers. It was an easy job and only took about an hour. Afterwards we went back to the cars and while putting away some tools in his van I noticed a blowtorch, some hash, and a little hash pipe. I rationalize this as, \u201cWhatever I can get over that the guy just smokes a little, we live in a legal state, I couldn\u2019t tell he was high, and we got the job done.\u201d That day he tries to get me to smoke with him before our next job and I decline. I explain to him I don\u2019t smoke, but I\u2019m certainly not going to stop him. Although I think it is totally irresponsible to work with electricity high, I am the first year so I keep my mouth shut. \n\nNow a couple of weeks go by, J and I have done several jobs together. I realize he is a really valuable resource and I am learning a whole lot. So one day we go to an office building to bid out a job for the boss. Everything is going fine until we are in the electrical room and he sees a pack of sawzall blades a recommend I go steal them so I don\u2019t have to buy new ones for my sawzall. I look at him like he\u2019s nuts and tell I don\u2019t steal tools. He mocks me, but eventually we just resume the job and that was the end of it.\n\nAbout a week goes by and at this point J and I are getting along well and are completing jobs efficiently. So last Friday we went to a customer\u2019s house. The customer is terminally ill and has a bunch of medical equipment plugged into a power strip and needs a 20amp dedicated circuit to run all of this stuff. Sounds really easy, but I messed up. I cut the 2-gang box right up against the vent pipe for the sink. Of course the box isn\u2019t going to fit. I let J know and tell him the I\u2019ll tell the homeowner and even pay to have a drywall guy come fix it. All we have to do is move the box. He is totally against this idea and tells me to go get a 2-gang low volt remodel box from the van. I was relieved when I couldn\u2019t find one knowing what he was trying to do. So he then proceeds to cut the 2-gang remodel down so it would fit flush against the drywall. He finishes and tells me to wire it. I could tell he is getting pissed off so I did. Needless to say I left that job sick to my stomach and feeling extremely guilty knowing that we put the box in the wall like that.\n\nLater in the day we meet up with the owner of the company to go bid a commercial job. Before we leave he tells me he needs to review the prints on the way so I should drive. I say okay I\u2019ll drive. On the way there he\u2019s reading he blueprints and all of a sudden I glance over and see him casually pull out an opaque silver jar and there he is with what looks like a lot of meth. Like a lot more than just personal use. He is crushing it up and I am dumbfounded. I just say, \u201cIs that crystal meth?\u201d He replies, \u201cYeah and I guess if (owner) finds out about it I\u2019ll know who to kill. You want some?\u201d In my head I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOh **** this guy\u2019s a crazy tweaker. I should call the cops. Maybe I should just tell (owner), but I don\u2019t want this guy to lose his mind and try to kill me.\u201d I just say, \u201cNo way I don\u2019t want any of that.\u201d We went and bid the job and I went home for the weekend\n\nNow today is Sunday and I have to go to work tomorrow and deal with this. I guess this is AITA, but ultimately this is situation that I would like some sort of advice on.\n\nTL;DR: My supervisor railed some meth in the passenger seat while I was driving the company vehicle. Proceeded to threaten me and offer me some.\n\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

In the past when I was still sharing a household with him until I was 21, he has been constantly annoying me. I have told him countless times that what he does, annoys me tremendously.

To be honest, there is not a single positive memory I share with him. None whatsoever. \n\nNowadays, I live alone in my own apartment trying to interact with him as little as possible. Some years have passed since I lived with him together. I think if you had asked me whether or not I hate him a few years ago I would have responded with a resounding and immediate yes. Now I just dislike him and ignore him. \n\nNow to current day. Occasionally I visit my parents over the weekend and whenever he is there as well, he tries to talk to me. I usually ignore it. I have heard from my mother that he has been telling her that he tries to get close to me again and that I have been ignoring all of his attempts and that it breaks his heart a little bit. \n\nAm I the asshole for having 0 interest in trying to bond with him?

So i am 21 yet i feel like i take care of Lewis who prior 8 months i had no idea he existed so its not as if we have a history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen i moved in Lewis was a chef and did crazy hours from 6 am till 10 pm so when he came home he never cleaned or anything but it was understandable because of his hours so i accepted this.

But no, he is messy, lazy and every time i tell him to do something he will come with something to say to not do it. For example, our landlord was coming and we agreed we had to clean the place and he said why should he, and said its like \"me shitting on his doorstep and asking him to clean it up\" he probably hasn't cleaned the bathroom or kitchen in over 4 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe broke his iPhone charger and then asked me to fix it (as i am a bit of a techy) but i couldn't so i gave him a spare phone to use until he got a new charger which is only like 10 pounds. This lasted a month and he still didn't get a charger but i wanted my spare phone back so i had to go out of my way to get a charger so i could get my phone back. he didn't even thank me or pay me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe never buys oil, toilet paper or any necessities and steals mine but every time i bring it up he says i'm being a tight f\\*\\*\\* and that he never uses them which me and my other house mate know he does and its resulted in us hiding our stuff. He also never takes his house key and always expect us to open the door for him every night.

I've thought about maybe putting a sign on it saying take if you want for people passing by but then i feel he could report me for theft or something. So ive decided to just leave it and let it be.

My teacher likes group projects, and this time he assigned the groups himself because he wanted us to learn how to work with others we may not like. However, my group has not been cooperating with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis project is supposed to be a 5 minute film. It's composed of me and 2 sophomores: S &amp; K. I was the one who reached out to them first, got their numbers, started a groupchat, and asked them on Tuesday when a good time to work would be. We have Friday/the weekend off and I was planning to work then because I'm very busy with other classes next week. S asks the groupchat if we can start planning this Monday, which gives us only 2 days to film and edit the video if we did just the whole script that day. She also doesn't want to meet after school and asks if we can do it during the 30 minute study hall we have each day. She wants to film in a single classroom, but explaining the project is a long story, so I'll just say that filming in a classroom wouldn't work well because we're supposed to be giving a \"tour\" of several rooms. K seems ok with meeting outside of school, but he also doesn't seem to care what happens either way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth of them stopped responding after we exchanged like 5 text messages on Tuesday, and today I texted them again asking if they were free on Friday/the weekend. S asks again if we can wait until Monday, and I told her that it wouldn't be enough time but we could start the script this weekend and film then. K agrees and says we can plan the script this weekend. S proceeds to ask if we can do it over facetime. I don't have an iPhone. She asks if I have Skype, but I have no webcam. I sense that S doesn't really want to get out of the house, so I ask her if she's busy this weekend. She tells me she has sports practice on Friday and a race on Saturday. Then K comes in and says he's going with his family to Niagara Falls the entire weekend. I asked them if I can make a google doc for the script and share it with them so we can all work on it while being apart. They said that's fine, but I doubt the script would be coordinated since none of us are talking to each other and expressing ideas while writing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI explained the situation to my parents and they're pretty livid, suggesting I email my teacher and do the project on my own, leaving S and K in their own group.

Due to her brother being 6 years older, he was already out of the home when I came around, living in a different state, so I saw him infrequently. When my wife and I married, we moved to the same state as BIL and started seeing each other much more often.\n\nIn the 20+ years I've been with my wife, I've learned a lot about her family, not just from what I've observed, but from what she has shared with me. All in all, they're good people, I love them and consider them family, I'd do for them as I would my own biological family. But they have their quirks, the main one being that they do everything possible to make sure they look \"perfect\" to all outsiders - quotes because that word gets used perhaps more than any other in their family. Unfortunately, as my wife has so humbly pointed out to me (and her therapist), this means any indication that something is not perfect triggers insecurities that leads to tension, which of course is always the responsibility of the perfection questioner. This goes pretty deep, so for the sake of brevity, I'll cut to the chase.\n\nMy BIL and I got to know each other fairly well and, despite some differences, were cool with each other. A few years ago, we decide to do a strenuous all day hike together. The day was great, to the point I felt we'd actually gotten closer. With 2 miles left, we're only an hour from our car, my BIL suddenly says something that catches me completely off guard:\n\nWhat is it about my family that you hate some much?\n\nI ask him what the fuck he means and he says he knows I think his parents were shit and that I \"don't know what the fuck I'm talking about,\" then tells a few anecdotal stories that were clearly fed to him by his other sister and mom. Then he said:\n\n&gt; Think what you want, my parents were perfect, they couldn't have done any better.\n\nIt clicked, and I responded:\n\n&gt; That's the issue, you're all so caught up in looking perfect that you fail to see reality. Believe it or not, all the things you just accused me of came from your sister (my wife), not me. I'm the one who has spent hours reminding her how great you all are and how terrible it would be to cut off communication with you. But no, she's perfect, just like all of you, so this is all on me. I'm used to it, your sister spent the first few years of our marriage blaming me for her insecurities, and thankfully, she had the courage to look inside herself. I love you, I love your parents, and I love my wife... despite all of the imperfections.\n\nThe rest of the hike was quiet, then I put on comedy on our 90 minute drive home, which lightened things up a bit. This was a few years ago, and since then, my BIL has kept his distance from me. When I told my wife about the whole incident, she completely sided with me and even said, \"Now imagine being raised with that your whole life.\"\n\nStill, I've waffled between feeling like I did the right thing and feeling like a complete asshole.

POST : **The Context:**   \nIf you have ever planned a wedding, you will understand that deciding on the guest list is an unpleasant but necessary undertaking. My SO and I drafted a comprehensive list of who should be invited-- starting with immediate family, venturing into relatives, childhood and current friends, and finishing with a smattering of other meaningful people. It's not like we were merciless in our selection, but it's not as if former next-door neighbours, or even well-liked colleagues were making the cut. The final count was somewhere in the area of 100.   \n\n\nThis 100 invitees don't include two classic wedding demographics: Plus-ones and Children/babies. The wedding won't be until next year, so who knows if cousin Doug will still be with his girlfriend in six months (last I heard things were not looking good), and its anyone's guess if Janyssa will finally find her soul mate between now and the wedding. Babies and children are currently at a minimum of 7, but we are at that age where this could easily turn to 12 (I'm looking at you, Chris). Let's pencil in 25, for a total of 125 prospective attendees.   \n\n\nWith guest list in hand, venues are the next thing to look at, and many of our top choices seem to fit 80 to 100 guests. The thing is though, 125 invitees doesn't mean 125 guests. There are a dozen reasons people may decide not to attend-- can't take time off work, can't afford the trip-- whatever the reason, it is a fact of life. For obvious reasons though, we can't book a venue with a capacity of 80 and then find out 105 people want to show up. Heck, we might not even be able to book a venue for 100 if everybody shows up.   \n\n\n**The Choice:**  \nWe both have some issues with not allowing plus ones or kids. I'm not judging anybody who chose not to do this at their wedding, it just doesn't work for us personally.   \n\n\nThis leaves us with a moral dilemma -- WIBTA (we be the assholes?) if we created a wedding \"A\" list, and a wedding \"B\" list? With this option we send out staggered wedding invites-- the first to our \"A list\" (including A list plus ones and children), and then based on acceptance rate, we send out a B list (including plus ones and kids). This way if our A listers are attending but not bringing kids or plus ones, we can safely know the B listers will be fine to bring their plus ones and kids. \n\n  \nObviously we would not tell people we are doing this.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:** WIBTA if I stagger wedding invitations to an \"A list\" and \"B list\" in order to fit a hypothetical venue.

I told her no because they were a gift, and I still planned on using them. She got mad, and it turned into a pretty big argument, that ended when I asked for one of her gifts back so I could return it and get my money back if she was going to sell the tickets. She didn\u2019t like that idea, told me to keep them, and just go to the show.

POST : Alright, a quick summary of the events that led to this.    \n\n\nI dated this girl for a year in total, but after our first month long break up about 8 consecutive months.  We got in a few fights and eventually the week before Christmas her mother was diagnosed with Lymphoma.  Due to the stress of that and our pre-existing issues, she broke up with me.  We then had a random run in two days later and began talking and hanging out again.  Effectively the same as we were before, only without being in a \"committed relationship\".  I was sort of under the impression we would work things out and get back together.  I wanted to be there for this difficult time regardless of our issues.   \n\n\nFast forward to a week later.  We were back to staying together and having sex like we did when we were together.  I had told her that despite our issues I wanted to be there for her so I was.   It was effectively the same as we'd been before we broke up without an \"official\" title.  After a week or so of this we got in another fight, on a Saturday morning about me hitting the snooze on her alarm and making her 10 minutes late to work.  This then caused her to \"break up\" with me again, and say \"you can't even fix your issues when we're not even in a relationship\".  I apologized and said I was sorry.  She then told me we were totally done, with absolutely no chance of ever getting back together.  She said I'd blown all of my chances and there wouldn't be any more.  This was a Saturday afternoon.    \n\n\nI went no contact and on the following Wednesday she called me hysterical, having found out some negative info about her mother's cancer.  She wanted to come to my house and decompress since it's close to her work and she had a key.  I had conveniently called in that day so I was there.  I agreed anyway and she came over, cried on my shoulder, the whole nine.  I then bought her dinner and ended up staying at her house again.  The next day we went back to more limited contact, but still texting a bit throughout the day.  She then got sick over the following weekend (last Sunday).  I ended up taking her to the ER and then taking care of her that night and staying again.  The next night (Monday), she was asleep on the couch while I was there taking care of her and she did some talking in her sleep that sounded like \"Fuck me Charles\".  Now, Charles is the best friend of her absolutely toxic and awful best friend.  When she woke up I asked her what that was about, and she admitted that she had been having sex with him, had done it multiple times, with the first time being the Sunday night after she  \"broke up\" with me the day before, for hitting the snooze.  I asked her how many times she'd done it and if she was going to continue doing that.  She said she had done it a  few times and could do whatever she wanted since we weren't together.  Now, I know we aren't together so there technically isn't anything wrong with that, but it hurt me because I still love her and wanted to be with her and try to fix things, despite her obvious lack of interest in doing so.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here's the part that brings me to this sub and asks Am I The Asshole?  Once I found out she was already having sex with someone, not two days after we had slept together.  I told her that I loved her and wanted to be with her and be there for her, but couldn't stick around and hear about her having sex with someone else.   It's just too hard for me to do that.   I then told her that I know she's having a hard time, but I think our issues were really aggravated by her sick mother and that she's been unraveling a bit and this sex with the other guy seemed like a reach for something to fill that hole.  She went off of me and said I was being hurtful on purpose and was even \"gas-lighting\" her.  She then said she doesn't ever want to talk to me and doesn't want me to be able to talk to her so she blocked my number.

POST : Before we got married (4.5 years ago) we agreed to take care of each other\u2019s parents when the time came. Unfortunately we did not discuss grandparents and great-grandparents, and that is what we are running into. \n\nWe had our first kid almost a year ago, and I\u2019ve struggled with some PPD. My husband works full time in a high stress job, and I work part time at an hourly job. \n\nMy MIL watches our son two days a week for five-six hours a day. She does it for free. When she\u2019s not watching our son, she\u2019s taking care of her grandma (93) or helping FIL with his farm (they\u2019re divorced but back together). She does have other seasonal work, though that is done for now. FIL has helped with some projects around the house and has even paid for some smaller projects completely (usually as a Christmas or anniversary gift). Both of FIL\u2019s parents are alive (83 and 85) and are starting to have some problems. \n\nALL of these people love my husband, are (mostly) kind to me, and absolutely adore my son. They do not want bad things for any of us, but none of them have boundaries with each other so that is what they expect of us. I also do not want to cut off ties with any of them- I just want healthy boundaries and some breathing room. \n\nBecause of all the things they have done/do, my MIL and FIL expect and now somewhat rely on my husband to help with their respective parents/grandparent on a regular (though random) basis. This has greatly effected mine and husband\u2019s relationship, which is already going through normal new parent ups and downs. \n\nIf we didn\u2019t have our son, I wouldn\u2019t care as much, but now it\u2019s taken my husband away from us on his days off, eaten up his time in the evening, and even used up some of my husband\u2019s limited sick/vacation days- that I feel should be saved for sick baby days or other things like that. Also, my husband\u2019s physical health has been negatively effected by this. \n\nIf it was once a week or a couple times a month that we could plan around/prepare for, I\u2019d be much less upset about it but his parents are so last minute and don\u2019t communicate well so this is really not an option unless my husband really sticks to his guns about boundaries. To be fair, husband has gotten better from when we first got married, but since we\u2019ve had our son and his grandparents health issues have increased, it\u2019s gotten out of control again (or at least that\u2019s how I feel)\n\nTwo weeks ago, we made a rule together that we will not answer calls/texts from 5:00PM-7:00PM because that\u2019s \u201cfamily time\u201d. Husband gets home around 4:30 and baby goes to bed around 7:00, and we go to bed around 10:00, so there are plenty of other times to talk to whomever. \n\nAbout every other evening, a family member of his has called in this two-hour time period, and EVERY SINGLE TIME husband asks me if he can answer it. I HATE that I have to tell him no- so I don\u2019t, but I do get mad about it and tell him that it hurts me that he can\u2019t just be \u201cours\u201d for two hours a day, and that I have to be the bad guy even though we both agreed to this. \n\nSo not only are our evenings CONSTANTLY interrupted, all of his free time is being used up by grandparent appointments, or helping his parents with something or other, or being on the phone with one of them OFTEN (more than daily). There is NOT a day that goes by that is not in some way effected by his family. I am overwhelmed. \n\nThis is just the shortened version of it, so there is more at play here but I\u2019m really trying to stick to facts and be fair. \n\nIt\u2019s driving me crazy and really hurting me for me and my son. I just want to move far away from his family at this point. But I don\u2019t want to be the wedge between my husband and his family in an unhealthy way, so If I\u2019m in the wrong and not being sensitive enough or fair enough, please tell me! AITA???

He even went as far to say that we should not be doing anything to help the mother of his children in any way.\n\nI fully disagree with his reaction, what I\u2019m doing is for the benefit of the children only. Asking me to get his permission serves only as a way for him to limit any benefit the mother would get from  me spending time with the kids. For example, we are watching the kids today so that she can work an extra shift at her second job. Her picking up an extra shift will be good for the kids, plus instead of being left home alone they can spend the day having fun with my wife and I.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for planning to spend time with my nieces and nephews without asking for my brothers permission?\n\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : The past two months have been pretty drama-filled among me and my various friend groups, sides have been taken, all that petty bs. All of it stemmed from my actions coming out of a relationship. This girl (19f) and I (20m) were together for about a year and a half. Things were great for the first year or so, but then we started to have some issues that ultimately ended in her breaking it off with me. Both of us knew it's probably what was best, but she was the one to make the final decision, and we ended things rather amicably.\n\nThat being said, I struggled initially as I had grown quite accustomed to the relationship and was at a loss now that it wasn't there anymore. My emotional state was probably the worst it's ever been, and my doctor put me on Xanax when needed for about a week and a half immediately following the initial onset. After the first week of having my emotions regulated and viewing the situation from mostly a logical standpoint, I came to grips with the fact that we had a *very* unhealthy relationship. My life improved, I had more motivation to do things for myself, etc. I made a tinder a few weeks after we broke up, and matched with this girl I had had an English class with a year or so ago. On our first date, it turns out that this new girl (NG) had recently met with my ex through a mutual friend, and they were now part of a friend group. They weren't really friends, more like acquaintances, at least according to what NG told me. I figured it wasn't a big deal since my ex broke up with me, and they weren't good friends. We continued going on dates periodically, and we eventually decided that neither of us really wanted to get into a *serious* relationship right now as we were both fresh out of long-term relationships. And then it got out that we were \"seeing\" each other, and that's when things went south.\n\nMy ex refused to talk to me for a few days, and was very upset with me, claiming that what I did was disrespectful to our relationship, and proved to her that the time I spent with her meant nothing. This obviously isn't the case; I loved this girl so much, but things just didn't work out and I was okay with that. This led into a few weeks of drama consisting of their friend group telling NG to just stop talking with me, and them eventually just straight up not talking with NG anymore. \n\nJump ahead about two weeks, and it gets out that NG and I had made out w each other after one of our dates a few weeks prior. Everything had started to calm down, but this really just made everything flare up again. It's something I regret as I think it was something I did just because I missed the physical intimacy of a relationship, and wouldn't do it again if I was given the chance. \n\nThat being said, I believe that my actions weren't asshole-y as she was the one to end the relationship.

We had gotten along quite well and grew close, but I have graduated recently and moved away 2 and a half hours away. Well we had planned for me to pick him up, and him come down and our mutual friends would come later and we'd go to the beach. \n\n  Well we get here, and he's alright we shoot the shit and get along. A few day passes and everyone else shows up to my house, and we go to the beach. We have a party there for 12 hours during the last 5 hours sober up and come home. At the beach he started to punch himself hard \\*he's slightly bipolar\\* and he's doing this in front of kids who then scream and run away. I go to help him, but I'm kind of fucked up, so when I approached I was going to be friendly. But when I got to him I was just like this is ridiculous. I know he has slight problems, but I knew him and couldn't seem to justify that self harm and making a scene in front of kids.\n\n  Things are now tense and we go home. I try to lighten the mood, but we would just start arguing. We are now home, and I lie in the bath to chill. While I'm chilling he comes in the bathroom without knocking and goes \"hey I'm going to mcdonald's you want anything?\" This causes my ears to perk up because he is broke. His dad gave him 40 for money to give me for gas and to buy him food over the week. At that time I was like \"where did you find the money?\" to which he informs me my wallet. He then ask if it's his. At the time I was like no it's my money for bringing you here and taking care of you. I'll need the money for gas to take him back. It wasn't till afterwards I realized that that meant he went through my wallet and took money on the hunch it was his.\n\nThis annoys me, but he's a bit of a airhead so I roll my eyes and try to carry on. Later in the night he makes himself a mixed drink by himself. I was sure that day to make sure no one got too messed up, so I saw he had one drink and thought that was ok. No after 10 mins he couldn't even stand up without falling almost knocking over the tv. He must have added 6 shots to his mixed drink. I smelt what was left, and it was bad. Then the rest of the night he was throwing his body around, talking in whispers saying how he should kill himself, and being really touchy feely with other people at the party who were uncomfortable about him. Me and my girlfriend try to get him to go to sleep because he was knocking shit over at our apartment and breaking shit.\n\n   After getting him in the room he would come out every 5 mins almost knock something down be anxious, and say that me and everyone else was over reacting. We finally get him to go to sleep, and we end the bad day. Things got worse the next day once people lead me on what they had to deal with.\n\nOne of my friends go hey you know how we didn't want to share a room with him it was because he seemed rapey. All the girls said they got that vibe which I did too, but then I was informed by one of them that at the start of the day he was hoping once one of these girls got drunk they would finally sleep with him. He had been trying to get with this girl, but every time she had given him a hard hard hard no. But he was hoping that she would get drunk then he would try really hard to sleep with her. This didn't feel right with me especially after the night where he tried to get close to any girl at the party. \n\n I was then informed that they walked into on him just hitting her vape and hide it. This is after she hit this one guys vape because he saw it on the ground, and he said that that's not cool because it's expensive. To which once he said that he took one more hit and tried to hit it as hard and as long as he could. This made this guy made, but he ignored it. \n\n  Everyone wants him to leave early , but no one wanted to have him in the car. No one really wanted to do anything for him. Me and my girlfriend were the only one who would. Now that we aren't friends I see that he's just a moocher. He would try to drink any booze you have, try to get all of my unmentionables. All this without a thank you. I put up with him, and he stays the rest of the time there's still fighting he tries to drink more alcohol to which I said no because he said he didn't even remember anything from the last time he got drunk. We take him home, and I informed him he'll be welcome back if he gets help and stops being dependent on drugs and alcohol to stay happy and actually go get help for his bipolarity. \n\nToday he messages our group chat barging about how he has a job and such. Then he starts to say he's got some freshmen hoes to which he tells me are 13 14, and he's 17 and a half. He basically goes hey want to smoke weed in hopes of them sleeping him. He then brags about how the 13 year old then gave him a blow job. I inform him that in this state that is statutory rape and said \"she's too young to know what she wants and only wants to do that so you keep giving her drugs.\" He shrugs it off going he doesn't know that that was considered rape, so \"It's whatever.\". I bring up about the basic rape claim at the party to which he said he wouldn't consider that as rape if he got her drunk enough and got her to say yes. He was just being very scummy. I refuse to let him make me drop it, and he gets mad I say that's kinda what a rapist would say because he said he just wants to get laid doesn't matter how. He leaves the group chat and tells me that \"I'm just going to be on my own now.\" I then go oh fine then go ahead. He then says \"wow you're going to throw our friendship away like that.\" Then he blocked me and here we are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short I had a greedy friend who did some creepy rapey things. I confront him he gets mad. Says \"I'm just going to be on my own now.\" I say ok he accuses that as throwing away our friendship.

We weren't exactly close and when he left it was kind of a relief for me to get some space from him.

No answer.\n\nI had never looked in the box before this, but mum wanted it gone and Mark apparently didn't care anymore. Inside was some photos of buildings in NY from a trip we did, a drawing another friend of ours did for Mark, some sketches, tarot cards, a silver bracelet with his birthday engraved and a broken silver watch.\n\nFast forward 3 years and John messaged me last week via facebook. We hadn't caught up in ages so we had a great chat with our usual jokes. He asks me if I still have Marks box, he wants it for Marks birthday. I tell him I don't have it anymore.

I have been working full time, as well as working a 2nd job part time a few nights a week to get ahead on my finances. My life at the moment is basically stretched between work and sport, while hers has been netflix and helping around the house while her family work. However I have been trying my best to visit, and over the last few months have been visiting fortnightly to every 3 weeks or so, while due to her financial situation she's only come down a couple times, one of which was she hitched a ride with a family member who was coming down to visit some family friends, but only stayed the night. I understand her lack of visits due to her finances, but I have offered quite a few times to pay for fuel so she can come and visit, which she declines because she doesn't want to take my money.\n\n\nShe is coming back to my town for 3 weeks to be paid to housesit for a family friend of hers, which is only feasible due to her lack of work. We will ideally be spending a fair bit of time together while she is in town, but she is only coming for the housesitting job, she wouldn't of come otherwise.  \n\n\nThe last time I went to visit was 2 weekends ago, when I was in the city for a work function, which she was my +1 for. I haven't visited since as I knew she was coming to my town anyway, and I plan to make the most of having her around so I thought I would use the weekends before to get stuff done.

POST : First of all, my family is pretty notable because my dad is a somewhat famous politician. I hate talking or telling people about it and usually don't even tell people so they don't judge me. I actually think I am pretty humble about it and am actually making a name for myself through basketball. But anyway my families been campaigning pretty hard to get my dad back in office and, one day, my family holds a raffle for an event, and that morning my mom wakes me up and tells me to wake my girlfriend up to sign a couple raffles on her way out the door. Me being super groggy, thinks why wake my girlfriend? I'll just quickly sign this with MY name and crash back out instead of waking her up. And what do you know, I win the Grand Prize of a signed guitar by my dad lol! It's funny and badass that it's signed by my dad, but my older brother who's actually been working pretty hard on the campaign aswell, texts me saying everyone agrees he should keep it because he's been one of the hardest workers, and I'm thinking 'Fuck that, if they thought that, why don't they just pitch in and grab him one?' And also, i was a little pissed they just gave it away right off the bat without saying anything to me. So they get back, and we're all checkin it out, and I just straight up say it, 'it's my guitar, I won it man.', and he goes 'we already agreed dude' and 'it's not even supposed to be yours, mom said tell *girlfriend* to sign it. It doesn't look good having his son participate in the family raffle, it's for the people.' I understood that last part, but completely spaced it out when I was filling them out that morning. But to be fair, I won it under MY name. He gives it to me kinda pissed. Then I tell my girlfriend, now she says it should be hers and she can give it to her brother who plays guitar. But then again, it was won under MY name. I was just as hopeful as any other raffle and genuinely felt pretty ecstatic to win the GRAND PRIZE. I definitely wasn't gonna give it up that easy. Tbf, I don't play guitar, but it's signed by my pops which is pretty dope, and sure as hell don't wanna give it up.\n\n\"money won, is a lot sweeter, than money earned..\" -Dodgeball, 2004", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : This was a while ago but I will still omit details for anonymity.\n\nFrom the title many of you would immediately answer yes, but now for the context.  \n\nI was with an on and off relationship with this person for about 2 years, I had previous relationships, never had trust issues with any of them.  The girl in question had even told me on several occasions that I was the most trusting boyfriend she had ever had and that it was one of her favorite things about me.  After about one month of dating she broke up with me and told me she wasnt ready for a relationship, about a few days later she was dating a man who she had told me was just a friend while we were dating, I had convinced myself with her help (reasons why she broke up with me) that I just wasn't being a good enough boyfriend.  I went back to dating other people but remaining single.  A few months later they had broken up and she came back to me telling me he was so awful etc and we gave it another shot.  As you would imagine my friends and family were now very skeptical of her, I had to defend her to them saying how I wasn't very good to her etc.  Anywho we end up dating for another 8 months and I suddenly was dumped again for weak reasons that seemed made up since she hadn't mentioned them before (turns out he had \"leverage\" over her), well what do you know another guy that was just a friend while we were dating is her new boyfriend a week later, I was able to win her back a week later (I feel pathetic writing this out I know).  My friends and family of course saw her for who she was and hated her but yet again naive gaslighted me had to defend her.  The relationship survived until we lived together for a period of time when I slowly realized how I had been played, idk it was some kind of slow forming epiphany.  I even had a doctor appointment for experiencing weird health symptoms which the doctor suggested was a physical manifestation of psychological stress.  I denied this but in retrospect he was a genius since the symptoms disappeared after I dumped her a few months later.  In my heart I still loved her but my brain had had enough clearly, I was literally destroying myself inside.  A week after dumping her I was on my laptop and noticed her chrome account was still logged into the browser, the entire past 2 years I had spent wondering whether my trust issues were just paranoia and if I was just another one of those crazy boyfriends but I could have the answers at my fingertips, I honestly couldn't resist.  I know what you're thinking (the truth will only be more pain, dont do it) to which I would disagree with you because in retrospect I could know that it wasn't my fault, the truth set me free.  I logged in and found proof of her cheating, not just on me, on her previous bf too, and that she was lying to the guy she was currently seeing about the fact she was also still sleeping with the guy she cheated on me with.  The guy she cheated on me with told her about how he wished I knew about what they did together.  Waves of rage overcame me, but the illusion had been shattered, I knew now what happened, that I wasn't crazy, and that the people in front of me were just truly despicable people, this was a guy that I shook hands with, that I let hang out with my gf because I was trusting.  I screencapped everything, I wasn't going to let this happen to another dude.  I sent the logs to the new guy she was seeing, explained who I was, and that was that, I wasn't interested in being with her again, maybe I wanted vengeance partially, but most of all if I could've had someone send me that and avoid the past 2 years of my life I would've given anything to have that.  In the end I got a title XI complaint from the university and was scared shitless but I would still do it all over again, there was no contact following the sent pictures and a thank you from the guy.

We live near my family but about an hour away from my husbands family, so we usually see them on holidays or weekends stopovers. I used to have a good relationship with my mother in law, she has 5 sons and I was her \u201cfirst daughter\u201d. Things got slightly frosty after she took offence to something I said innocently and she called my husband to complain about it. We are nice enough to each other now and she would dote on my children whenever we came over. 2 years ago, her youngest (favourite) son met a girl. After just 2 months she moved into the family home with them. A month later she was pregnant but unfortunately lost the baby. A few months later they bought a house together around the corner from my mil and became pregnant again. They have since become engaged. Since my sister in law came on the scene, I don\u2019t really have much contact with my mother in law anymore, but I am subjected to daily photos on social media of them doing things together. My BIL\u2019s baby is 1 and is at my mother in laws most days (from what I can see on social media). When we stayed there for Christmas, my BIL &amp; SIL stayed over too, even though they live around the corner, meaning we had no time quality with my husbands parents and my children hardly saw their grandmother as she was always fussing over the 1 year old. Even if we were in one room and my SIL &amp; baby were in another, my MIL would stay with my SIL, ignoring my children. During the weekend, we asked if she would be able to look after our children (since she hardly sees them) so we could have a weekend away (our first in 10 years) but was told she couldn\u2019t handle our 5 year old for a full weekend but would happily mind our 10 year old as they\u2019re no bother. She then went on to say how much she looks after the 1 year old during the week so she was tired at the weekends. In the end, both myself and my husband felt uncomfortable with the exclusion and left a day early. Since then i feel I am bombarded with constant stories &amp; pictures of the fun things they do together. They even came to our home town to pick a wedding dress but didn\u2019t come to see us. She no long FaceTimes my children &amp; whenever i get them to FaceTime her she brings my SIL or the 1 year old into the call with her. I have told my husband I will not force my children upon her if she so obviously has favourited the 1 year old, and therefore will not be visiting over Easter as we usually do. My husband thinks I\u2019m being the a-hole and should let it go, even though he hardly ever wants to visit home and it\u2019s usually me that pushes the visits. \nTL;DR AITA for feeling pushed out by my MIL to make way for my new SIL &amp; her baby ", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

I\u2019ll spare you the details but I had an issue that was rather embarrassing. \n\nA few days ago I had reason to go to go to the hospital at about 10pm. A lady who worked at my hostel (that I hardly knew) left her dinner with a friend and met me at the hospital to translate and evidently protect me from scamming doctors. \n\nAfter the all clear and my shitty hospital experience I went for a walk with this lady to calm down. We had a long chat and bonded over our very first lengthy conversation. We spent a handful of hours walking around and talking about each other.\n\nThe next day she booked me in for a appointment with a doctor she trusted. When I got to the appointment, I found out she was on loud speaker translating...despite the fact the doctor spoke English. I found it very weird as she is not a medical professional, practically a stranger and as I said before, I had embarrassing symptoms.\n\nThe doctor had me do some tests and the results would be given to me within 24 hours via email.\n\nWhen I returned to the hostel I had a conversation with the lady. I told her that I didn\u2019t like how indirect and vague the doctor was with his answers. To which she explained that she told the doctor to be indirect with his answers because she \u201cknows that I would worry\u201d.\n\nTrying to keep my cool I went for a walk. When I returned to the hostel she sat me down in a rather open are and told me the doctor called and she has the results for one of my tests. The doctor told THE LADY THAT WORKS AT MY HOSTLE my results. She then loudly announced what the results were.\n\nThe results and how they were delivered to me were quite shocking to me, so I stormed off. \n\nThe next day I left and accidentally did without saying good bye to the lady. Who did have my best interests at heart.\n\nWhen I arrived in the next city many hours later I noticed my results had not been emailed to me despite it being hours past the ETA. Coincidently I got a Facebook message from the hostel lady ten minutes later.\n\nShe explained that the doctor couldn\u2019t get ahold of my email and SHE HAS THE RESULTS. She then proceeds to tell me that the results are negative and that I should be happy.\n\nIn response I asked her why did he not just ask her for my email, why I was once again the second person to know my results and stating that I think the doctor is unprofessional.\n\nTo this she went ballistic.

Let\u2019s call her Kate. \n\nKate met this guy on bumble, who after a couple dates or hangouts, they both mutually agreed they were better as friends more than anything. Since he\u2019s new to town and doesn\u2019t know a lot of people, she wanted to keep hanging out as friends and even take him out and introduce him to people, which is really nice and thoughtful of her. \n\nWhen I was going to her place to have a girls night this past Monday, she was telling me about how she wanted to take her friend somewhere to give him a fun night. She didn\u2019t have any of it planned. Like I said, it was Monday evening and she had already told him she would be taking him out the very next night, Tuesday. She was saying how she also wanted to invite a bunch of people. Mainly we were trying to come up with a place to go to make sure there\u2019s even a plan. She was trying to figure out a place where I would be able to join as well. My options are limited. Even though I\u2019m 22, I can\u2019t go into places where they check your ID at the door. I had my license suspended for a DUI (I have a brief post about it if you\u2019re interested) and haven\u2019t had an ID in years. Thanks to the government shut down here in the US, DMV is booked until May, and thanks to school, I haven\u2019t had a chance to go to the DMV yet for a walk in. \n\nThere are actually a lot of options by my college campus for where they don\u2019t card at the door and everyone else but me can drink. I kept trying to suggest a place near my college campus for that reason and because i go to a school in a big city in the heart of downtown with so many places to check out, and from there, I could easily take the train home. In our small town, the only places that serve alcohol and are remotely cool require ID. On the particular day of this hangout, I was going to be on campus for hours already and i figured I\u2019d walk to wherever we chose. This area is about a half hour from where we live but Kate was already looking into that area just because it has a better nightlife. But it felt like every time I made a suggestion, there was something wrong with it and she had weird expectations for what this guy\u2019s outing should look like, which I think would only lead to her disappointment. Anyway, she finally settled on a bar near our houses. A place that cards at the door. I reminded her that I couldn\u2019t go in and she just got frustrated. So feeling slightly annoyed myself since I didn\u2019t feel like she heard any of my suggestions, I just told her to have fun and I don\u2019t want to stand in the way of her plans, and I meant it. I made peace with the fact that she\u2019d go somewhere where I couldn\u2019t join anyway and that was fine.\n\nNext night comes and goes. I\u2019m on the heaviest of my period so I was more than happy to stay home. I look on Snapchat and see Kate\u2019s FWB posted a picture with her. She initially wasn\u2019t going to invite him to this little hang out, so I figured because she didn\u2019t really have a solid plan, it fell through and she just decided to spend time with her FWB. No biggie. \n\nWednesday comes (day after supposed hangout), I\u2019m again chilling at home and I\u2019m on Snapchat again. I check out the story of this girl I haven\u2019t hung out with in a while; let\u2019s call her Madison. In Madison\u2019s story, I see Kate with her FWB sitting at a table of a really swanky restaurant/bar near my college campus. Kate knows Madison, but they haven\u2019t talked in over a year, partly because Madison didn\u2019t like some of Kate\u2019s behavior or absentmindedness (whole other story). So my first thought was \u201cWTF, I can\u2019t believe Madison knows FWB, how cool!\u201d I figured that FWB had plans of his own and invited people to this restaurant and I thought that it made more sense that it was a coincidence that he happened to know Madison as well. So I message Madison on Snapchat as well as FWB, sending them a similar message that \u201cwhoa, I can\u2019t believe you two know each other!\u201d Then they both explained \u201cwell now we do. Kate invited us all out, it was cool.\u201d \n\nThis honestly bugged me for a few reasons. First off, this place was not only right by my campus, but it was more a restaurant than a bar, something she was super against when I was helping with suggestions. I could have easily joined them if I wanted to. Second, it was not so much about me going or not. I had a nice night home alone. It was more so the fact that Kate never just messaged me saying \u201chey, so this is what I ended up planning. Come join us if you\u2019d like to.\u201d But she didn\u2019t mention this to me at all. The way I found out, through the Snapchat of a girl Kate hadn\u2019t talked to in over a year, was the most hurtful part.\n\nI messaged Kate telling her about this and how it made me feel. Her response was that she was trying to stay in our town to make it easier on me but how that didn\u2019t work for me.... she obviously wasn\u2019t listening if she\u2019s being honest because I kept telling her how it would just be easier if we stuck to the area near my campus.  When I told her that her not telling me made me feel excluded, she just said \u201cWell when you left you seemed kinda pissed about me trying to work around that so I didn't wanna stress you out anymore.\u201d I kept trying to explain how she could\u2019ve just asked and whether I said yes or no didn\u2019t matter, just the fact that she didn\u2019t think of me, especially when it was a place that I would\u2019ve been able to go to. She gave a half assed apology with an excuse. When i told her that it\u2019s not that i was mad, but more hurt than anything, she just said \u201cok.\u201d \n\nI was really irritated with how she handled all this more than anything. I get that it was a misunderstanding but in the end, what I\u2019m most annoyed about is that she just continued to make excuses and stay on the defense when I just wanted her to own up and say she was sorry for making me feel left out. I don\u2019t really know what to say to her. This isn\u2019t the first time that when she showed lack of thought to something, she didn\u2019t apologize and stayed on the defense. If this wasn\u2019t already a habit of sorts, I would\u2019ve let this go, but I think I deserved more thought in this case. Today she messaged me saying she wants to talk about this in person, but I don\u2019t really know what to say to her. On one hand, I feel like i deserve way better than what happened, but I still can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m being too harsh on her. Am I the one actually being the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR: best friend tried inviting me to a hangout and wanted my help planning it. She shot down all of my ideas and Settled on a place I couldn\u2019t go to. I told her to just have fun and go without me (i wasn\u2019t being passive aggressive, i meant it), but still felt a little annoyed. Day came and went, I was fine, I heard nothing from her. Next day, I realize she had a huge event with a bunch of our old friends at a place that was very easily accessible to me and she didn\u2019t even notify me of it. I found out from an acquaintance\u2019s Snapchat. Best friend just kept making shitty excuses when I tried addressing this. Since she\u2019s done similar stuff before, I don\u2019t know how much more I can tolerate. I feel like I deserve better.

POST : tl;dr cock blocked and cucked by two cats.\n\n\nSo we got these cats a bit ago when they were kittens.  She wore me down and I agreed to getting one cat; as they are not allowed where we live and we already have a dog.  I asked her to not go without me to pick them up or to see them, because I know all too well that we're going to get two if she had.\n\nWell she went without me anyway, and lo and behold we had two kittens reserved for us when they got weened.  I should have spoken up - me going with her was to help ensure we wouldn't had gotten in a situation where I'd have to break her heart and telling her to choose just one.  But she went without me, and started fantasizing how they'd be brother/sister and friends and so on.. So hey, guess that sucks for me.\n\nI had only a few reservations I outlined in a couple rules: No cats on the dinner table or counters, and no pets, including the dog, in the bedroom.  I don't like the cats digging in their litter and then jumping up on food surfaces, and I don't like pet hair in the bed.  I felt that reasonable.\n\nWe live in a small 2bed/1bath home.  We share one bedroom, and the other room has my music equipment, the computer, other expensive stuff.  It's the office, and I do bills and school work in here as well.  She used to have art stuff in here but since moved that to the bedroom. It isn't a man-cave or anything; moving in, was supposed to be a hobby room/office for both of us.  \n\nThe dog's a puppy still, and played rough with the cats, so my fiance said they should stay in the hobby room until they're big enough.  Okay fine, I said \"Once they're big enough though we're moving the cat box to the bathroom, I don't want the room to be a cat room\".\n\nThe room I am in is known now as the cat room.  I've tried to diplomatically say 'hey, c'mon now, they're old enough let's move them out'.  It's particularly important because my music equipment is in here.  They've knocked over amps, damaging them.  They've eaten two power cables.  They completely destroyed my computer chair, the window blinds.  Knocked over my guitar and chipped it.  Shredded my sheet music, and chewed holes in my piano pedal cable, and the cables of my expensive mixing headset.  My school work gets batted off the desk, they knock things off that my dog eventually thinks is cool to eat.  So on so forth.  I try to express my frustration of it, but it falls on deaf ears because I feel it just doesn't affect her.  The only way I can see me getting them out of the room is making a huge thing of it and moving everything out.  I feel really claustrophobic.\n\nNot to mention the cat box is 2 feet from me.  One of them just took a shit.\n\nA lot more goes into saying it, but it really feels she cares more about the cats than me.  The rule of no pets in bedroom? Broken.  Cats on table? Broken.  The side room becoming a cat room? Broken.\n\nWe have a strained relationship already, and suffice it to say sexy time happens like seasons change.  Last night I finally got fed up because we finally got to have a little sexy time before bed, and this cat was shut out of the room and wouldn't stop meowing, because she allows them in the bedroom. \"Aww she just wants some lovin, poor thing\" she'd say.  \"Aww she just wants to be with us,\" \"Can you get up to see if the cat room's door is open?  Completely obliterated any mood I had.  Came back, and after laying there for a few moments took my pillow and thought \"Fine, you can sleep with your cats instead\", and slept on the couch.\n\nAITA for being upset about any of this?

Also on mobile, so it might contain some errors. \n\nSome back story: my brother is the youngest of 7 and he\u2019s spoiled. Like really bad. My parents kinda let him do whatever he wants. They were super strict on all of us, and eventually got easier with each kid, so I feel like they kind of stop the disciplining by the time they got to him. \n\nHe\u2019s currently 20 and an hour away for college. My mom always want him to go home when he\u2019s free or on weekends but he always makes excuses, like I\u2019m busy with school or I have work. If he does go home, he would go hang out with his friends. He\u2019s also quite a  liar. He always uses the excuse for school when he\u2019s really not doing stuff for school. \n\nNow my brother has a spending habit and it\u2019s fueled by my parents! He has a job and should be able to support himself but he doesn\u2019t. Parents give him weekly \u201cgas\u201d money (100 a week I think). He lives with my other two sibling in my parents house that they bought for us. Everyone pays rent but my mom doesn\u2019t make him pay, saying he doesn\u2019t have money (idk where she gets this idea). My sibling that lives with him makes him pay like 100 a month for utilities and most of the time, he can\u2019t even cover it! My siblings are pretty much done with him. They don\u2019t really care to talk to him bc of this. \n\nHe goes out a lot and does college kid stuff, which is fine, but he can never pay his bills. (He doesn\u2019t really have any, just the rent and his phone bill, which is 30 a month). \n\nWell during this time, he gets into some trouble and basically my mom had to put out 2800 to cover this expense. I told him he has to pay for it and he agreed, but my mom wouldn\u2019t allow it. So I told him he will give me the money and I\u2019ll give my mom the money back when he\u2019s done with the payment. I told him he can\u2019t take any vacations until he\u2019s done paying it off, and he agreed. It\u2019s been over a month and he hasn\u2019t mentioned it or attempt to give me anything for it. \n\nFew days ago, he text me and ask if he can go Disney Land for his birthday. I told him I\u2019ll think about it and text him next week. I\u2019m livid bc we talked about this but he still has the audacity to ask me if he can go. I know he\u2019s of adult age but he doesn\u2019t act like one and is very irresponsible. We\u2019ve had so many talks with him about how he needs to grow up and support himself and show some accountability. He tells us he\u2019s sorry and that he\u2019ll change but nothing has change. \n\nI\u2019m torn bc I want to tell him no and that he needs to hold up his deal but at the same time, it\u2019ll be his 21st birthday and I feel bad that he won\u2019t be able to do what he wants. \n\nSo AITA for this? \n\nSorry if I\u2019m babbling!

A few months ago I proposed, and my Fianc\u00e9e and her mother both wanted a specific family member who is in the clergy of our shared religion to perform the ceremony. I was ambivalent about the idea but kept that to myself and said that\u2019s great. We contact him and let him know are date and he says no, that doesn\u2019t work, in fact that whole month doesn\u2019t work try December (the following month). We pick a date in December and confirm with him. Great!  Two weeks later, her mom lets us know he can\u2019t do that date either, but can do the following week. Ok, we can do that, getting a little close to Christmas but that\u2019s fine. Two months later we get another call from her mom, he can\u2019t do our second date but can do ____ date in November. She says she\u2019s already talked to the church and venue and we just have to say yes. I don\u2019t get a chance to talk to my Fianc\u00e9e without her mom on speakerphone before it is agreed that we will move to the November date. It\u2019s moved, venue is confirmed as is the church, and we are getting quotes from vendors as I type this (no deposits yet).\n\nHere\u2019s the twist. After moving the date my Fianc\u00e9e informed me we are 1 week after my old roommates wedding. Very close friend from college with a guest list overlap of ~15 people. Roommate won\u2019t be able to come if we do this new date, some of our out of state guests will for sure not come (as in have already told us).

They are providing a significant (read majority) contribution to the wedding and (reasonably IMO) feel they can make this call, though they did not explicitly mention it.\n\nI\u2019m very upset by this.

POST : Hello fellow proctologists, thank you for your time and your help in figuring this one out. I\u2019ve thought through it from a few different angles and can\u2019t seem to find a satisfactory approach. \n\nSome backstory: A few years ago, on my birthday, I was targeted in a club and had my drink spiked. I was abducted by a pimp and delivered to two men who had paid for a prostitute. They raped me all night in their hotel room, and in the morning I stole some cash from one of them (my phone, wallet, etc were all missing at this point) and managed to pay for a cab ride home. I have not been back to this hotel since, except with police to identify the location. My birthday is the same week as Valentine\u2019s Day, and I have just recently started \u201creclaiming\u201d my birthday and celebrating again, so my boyfriend and I usually do a few fun things that weekend for the combined occasions. My boyfriend works in the entertainment industry, and in 2018 he started a small production company and produced his first short film. I am incredibly proud of him and excited to support him in his career aspirations. \n\nThe situation at hand: My boyfriend\u2019s film has been accepted to a festival screening that happens to be on Valentine\u2019s Day. I\u2019m thrilled for him, and excited to attend the screening with him. There is a networking event afterwards, which is a very big deal for his industry and would greatly benefit him career-wise. He is a little shy, and I am much better at schmoozy networking party conversation, so I was planning to attend this with him afterwards for moral support and to encourage him to be bold and really go for it. I just checked the afterparty information, and it is being held at the hotel where I was raped. I do not want to go there, ever, and I especially don\u2019t want to go there so close to the anniversary of my trauma. He knows what happened to me, but he doesn\u2019t know that this hotel is where it occurred. I\u2019ve asked him if he would be okay with me going to the screening with him and then heading home while he goes to the afterparty with his director, but he said he really wants me to be with him the whole night. To me, it seems like there is no way to avoid being an asshole here. \n\nOption A: I refuse to go without giving any specific reason why -- \u201cI just don\u2019t want to.\u201d In this case, I show a clear lack of support for him and his career goals. I also run the risk of him trying to skip the afterparty in favor of doing something else with me for Valentine\u2019s Day, which I think would be a big mistake. \n\nOption B: I refuse to go but explain why, and tell him I really want him to go without me. In this case, I\u2019m worried that he will not really take advantage of the networking opportunities and will be worrying about me instead. After I initially told him about my rape, he had trouble sleeping and was upset for weeks. He is deeply empathetic, and I don\u2019t want to put any negative, distracting thoughts and images into his head during the event. I don\u2019t want him thinking about what happened to me and getting the wind knocked out of his sails. \n\nOption C: I just suck it up and go to both the screening and the afterparty and do my best to act totally normal. I\u2019m worried that even if I try my hardest to be my normal self, my boyfriend will be able to tell that something is \u201coff,\u201d and will get distracted trying to comfort me. Alternatively, I could pull off the facade and everything goes great. Then we go home, and it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, and he wants to have sex while I\u2019m on edge from re-living my trauma all night. He would have no idea why I wouldn\u2019t want to be intimate and I would ruin our Valentine\u2019s Day. \n\nSo reddit, please help. Would I be the asshole if I pick any of the options above?\n\nTL;DR Boyfriend has an important networking event at the hotel where I was raped, I want to support him but I also don\u2019t want to go. \n", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : I (23 F) own a condo that I currently rent as I have moved in with my boyfriend somewhere else. In May of 2018, I had a friend/old coworker (40 F) who was down on her luck and needed a place to live. So she signed a 6 month lease because she said it was temporary. \n\nEverything has been fine and she had been a good tenant. It started coming to the 6 month mark when my HOA sent out an email asking for a copy of everyone\u2019s leases. As I am a new landlord, I didn\u2019t realize that when a lease expires, it turns into a month-to-month situation so I stupidly made her a new 6 month lease (ending May 2019) to get all the paperwork in order to send to them and she signed it. \n\nMy mom is a realtor and has a really good eye at finding investment properties. She makes about $10k a month on Airbnbs. I\u2019m really interested in getting an investment property that I can Airbnb in as well so I can hopefully start making money like her. A property came up that she wanted to go in on with me but we needed to sell my condo first so I\u2019d have the funds.\n\nTo be considerate, I decided to call and tell my friend that we were considering selling the condo and I wanted to give her a heads up so she wouldn\u2019t be surprised.That way she could decide if she wanted to move somewhere else or have new landlords that she wouldn\u2019t know. I told her that since living there was temporary that maybe she could please think about moving out in the next month or two because it would make it easier for me to sell.\n\nShe flipped out and hung up on me. I was really surprised that she acted this way considering she is twice my age. I sent her a really nice text telling her I\u2019d help her look for a new place to live and I was sorry that she was put in this situation. She left me on read. I called her the next day and she was really cold and responding in hostile one word responses. She even hung up after saying \u201cwell I guess I\u2019ll have to since I\u2019ll be homeless soon!\u201d \n\nThis was really surprising as I have been friends with her for 3 years and have never seen her act like this. The investment property with my Mom didn\u2019t work out but I still wanted to sell so I sent her a nice text telling her she could stay until her lease is up in May. \n\nAfter ignoring me for 3 days, she calls me and acts like everything is fine admitting that she needed time to think about the situation. But by this point, I realized that those were her true colors and it made me not want to be friends with her anymore because of the way she acted. I really want nothing to do with her anymore but I have to be nice until she leaves my place. So AITA for not wanting to be friends with her and for asking her to move out? I thought I handled it really nicely but maybe not? \n\nTLDR: I asked my friend/tenant to move out before her lease so I could sell and she reacted badly making me not want to be friends with her anymore.

So I grabbed the tape measure and mocked up a measurement and compared it to my tape measure to show him he was off a 1/4\" every time. I tell him he may want to get it calibrated, and to go talk to our supervisor to have it checked using our \"tape recalibrater.\" So he does, and comes back and tells me the supervisor will get him a new one.\n\nI go to the supervisor and asked him \"so you're not going to calibrate his tape?\" He says, \"there...is...no such thing, ill get him a new tape! If he asks again I'll go grab my \"recalibrator\" and fix his fucking tape!\" Supervisor comes back a bit later with an 18\" ruler and checks it out using the \"bad\" tape measure and turns out the tape measure was perfectly fine. He says \"here you go sir, you're tape measure is perfectly calibrated and is working fine\" -holds out tape measure before kid grabs it- \"there is nothing wrong with this tape measure, if you are having consistant problems with where your measurement lands, it is completely an operator error, and i think someone is playing a joke on you.\"\n\n-Kid points at me across aisle- I shout out \"GOT EEEM\" everyone laughs, who witnessed this calibration fiasco.

We were very close, to the point that I considered her my best friend, and platonic soulmate. We supported each other through some very tough times. She suffered from severe depression and family issues; there were times when I stayed on the phone with her all night for fear that she would do something drastic otherwise. She in turn supported me through an intense battle with an eating disorder. But I don't want to make it seem like our friendship revolved around our issues. Most of the time we had normal conversations, we'd go out drinking, karaoke, etc. She was my best friend and I loved her to pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, she stopped responding to my texts, and blocked me on all social media. I was afraid something had happened to her but I saw she was still commenting on mutual friends' posts. I had no idea what I'd done - I reached out to her to ask if I had done something wrong, and to let me know so I can apologize for whatever it was, but no reply. It really hurt me to not know what had happened. I went over it again and again in my mind, trying to figure out what I had done. I felt wretched, like I was going through a breakup. I had a recurring dream that she would reach out and explain what had happened. It was not a fun time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime passed.... almost a year later she reached out and asked if we could meet up. I agreed and we had lunch. I've always been scared of confrontation, so I was too afraid to ask her what had happened, and she didn't offer an explanation. But things went back to normal, and I had my best friend back, so that was all that mattered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, maybe a year or so later, she ghosted me again. I went through the same process, but began to realize, you know what, fuck that. I tried my best to be a good friend and I don't deserve any of this. I didn't hear from her for two years after that. I never really got over it, but in time I think I realized that it wasn't my fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis year on my birthday, she sent me a message on Instagram to wish me happy birthday, and said she wanted to meet up for coffee.

Yet my parents could see that he genuinely made me happy and he really needed help, so they allowed him to move in with us to allow him an oppourtunity to prove himself and a man and adult. \n\nAfter a month it was agreed by both parties that he would pay 100$ a week for rent. About 400$ a month. \n\n However, He cannot keep a job, he worked his last job for exactly 7 shifts before cursing out his manager for calling him out when he No Call / No Showed. Let it be said that he does have ADHD and other issues with mental illness. But....\nHe also cannot seem to manage his own money.

PLEASE DO NOT UPVOTE TOO MUCH, I DO NOT WANT HER TO SEE THIS. \n\nSo recently, my gf and I went to visit my grandmother and great grandmother down South for our spring break. We are both 19 year old college students and we go to school in New England (USA). They really loved her. They spoiled her throughout the week, and she was so grateful, and so was I. We were both so happy that they took to her so nicely. I had definitely been nervous about it. We stayed in my great grandmother's home (she lives directly across the street from my grandma, they live very close to each other) for 7 days. It was a blast.\n\nNow that we are back at school and continuing the semester, my gf keeps asking for my great grandmother's address. Both my great grandmother and my grandmother were English Lit teachers, and my gf keeps saying she wants to write a letter to each of them to thank them for everything they did for her during our stay.\n\nHere's the thing: I get where she's coming from. I do. I just don't want to give her the address. She did not know it while we were staying there (purely because she never asked and never paid attention and I was driving everywhere in my grandma's car). I think it's kind of creepy and stalker-ish to do. I told her I could give her their phone numbers to text them, but she said that she thought they would really appreciate a hand-written letter, and she said she'd rather do that because it seems more personal. I told her I think it's creepy and that I think they'd find it creepy, and she got upset at me. She said that I blew it out of proportion and it's how people communicated earlier anyway, and she just thought it was a thoughtful thing to do. I am not budging on this, don't worry. I'm not gonna let her force me into it. But she is upset at me and hasn't spoken to me properly since our fight (last night). So I want to know: who is the asshole here?\n\nThere's more to it, though. My grandmother was married to a really vile man (my grandfather-- I don't talk to him) and he was abusive towards her physically and verbally. She left him and they divorced. For years after the divorce, he continued to stalk her and send her threatening letters. She and I are very close, and she confided in me that she still gets nervous opening letters from people she doesn't know. She had a restraining order against him, but it does not matter now, because he is in hospice care a few states away.

We've broken up briefly a couple of times. The first time he mentioned that part of his issue is that I have a son, not so much that he doesn't like him, just that he's there. He's not mean to him or anything. He has a grown son who lives in another state who he adores and he sees his greatest role in life as being a father to his son. The boyfriend came into my son's life when he was 10 years old, he's turning 14 tomorrow. My boyfriend makes a lot more money than I do and he has a big nice 5 bedroom house that he lives in alone, although he usually sleeps at my house. I, being poor, have a house that has a lot of damage from when I had a leaking roof and we had unprecedented rainfall a couple of years back. The plaster on the ceiling has fallen down and the plaster walls are crumbling. It's really in rough shape. My homeowners insurance wouldn't cover it and I have not yet had the money to repair it. I've tried to do some repairs myself but I have no idea what I'm doing so I've just given up until I can hire someone to do the work. My son is embarrassed by our current living conditions and he doesn't want to have friends over.\n\nWhen I first started seeing this man he wanted us to stay at his house more. My son would get bored there because he didn't have TV service and the internet reception was crappy, so my boyfriend bought an xbox and said it had to stay at his house. He would let him have friends stay over and things were good for awhile, until one day he just didn't want him there anymore and brought the xbox to my house, which was fine. He would still let him have friends stay over from time to time. So my son's birthday is tomorrow and I asked my boyfriend if he could have a couple of friends over. He said he wanted to think about it. I asked him again yesterday and he said, \"why does he have to have a birthday party? I never got to have a birthday party. I would just go out for pizza with my family.\" So basically he said no.\n\nSo the problem that I have is not so much that he can't have his friends over, it's the feeling of rejection that I'm feeling for my son. My boyfriend tries to be all spiritual and says stuff like, \"I've been blessed, the things I have aren't mine. I need to share them with other people.\" He has said that specifically about his house.\n\nAnd I'm not saying he's a bad guy. He's nice and he has helped me financially from time to time with a few hundred dollars when I've been broke broke or really needed something. The thing is though, that he takes no interest in my son or in wanting to spend time with him. He buys him food sometimes when he comes over and he's always polite and never mean.\n\nTL:DR: Boyfriend used to let my son stay at his house with friends sometimes but won't let him for his birthday. My house has a lot of damage that needs to be repaired and we can't have people over.Bigger issue is that he takes no interest in my son.

The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

(Names changed for privacy)\n___________\n- Me and best friend(Bill) belong to an outfit of friends, important ones that'll come up later will be Pablo, Wilson, Tony, and Ike. Just like every other friend group we like to make fun of eachother, brutally. Over race, weight, social skills, etc.  \n\n- Bill and I are playing something on Xbox when I leave to go grab something and take a bit longer than expected.   \n\n- I come back to find Bill has left the game and is now in a party and playing with Tony and Ike. Tony's okay, but Ike is someone both of us dont like tbh, we tolerate him cos he's Pablo and Wilson's friend.   \n\n- Sent a message to Bill \"You ditched me for a Mexican and a wannabe fuckboi?\". Got a message back \"At least Tony and this bitch aren't breathing all heavy in my ear, ya fatass\" Laugh it off, continue life.  \n\n**2 WEEKS LATER**   \n\n- Some shit goes down and me and Bill are excommunicated from the group.   \n\n**4 MONTHS LATER**   \n\n- Get text from Wilson \"That sneak dis tho\", ask for clarification, he sends a screencap of the aforementioned messages between me and Bill. Text back \"Well, Tony IS Mexican and not really, cos I've called Ike that plenty of times\" also \"Why do you have access to a private convo between me and Bill?\", says he used to watch Netflix with Bill's account.    \n\n- Text Bill and tell him the situation and that maybe he should change his password.  \n\n**2 WEEKS LATER**   \n\n- Go out on the town with Bill, he drops me off and I get a text from Pablo (in the Xbox App) \"That sneak dis tho\", text back \"what? The Mexican, wannabe fuckboi thing\" get a text back \"Sorry, you must have the wrong account\". Realized I got baited for a vulgarity report.  \n\n- Not long after I get a text from Ike, \"fuck you u fat stupid bitch dont be talkin shit bout me cuz I have friends that u dont. Fuck u fatboy\"  \n\n- Microsoft must've been hungry cos they jumped on that shit within hours, like it was the last piece of pizza on the pan. I get a 2 week suspension for racial insensitivity and cyberbullying.  \n\n- Call support and explain that these people used to be my friends and we did this all the time, and they just baited me for a report out of context. They tell me a suspension needs to be on record for this but for some unknown reason it gets knocked down to a 2 day suspension. Feeling a bit sour I also whisper in their ear shout a truly vulgar message I got from somebody just a few hours ago. I know they aren't gonna do anything about it, buy I felt better telling them and imagining that they would. Finally, text Bill the situation and go to bed.  \n\n- Next day Bill comes over with something I left in his car, and pulls me into the hall, he says \"lose my number and dont talk to me anymore, I dont want to be friends with someone like you\"  \n\n- break down in the hall as my mom texts Bill and asks him why. Bill says he thinks I'm a bad person, and an asshole. I text Bill and ask for an explanation, Bill says I'm a shitty person, I should've just let it go, and I should've never talked shit about them behind their backs. Even though he did too all the time, when we were all friends and we weren't. Because we all knew we did, and none of us gave a shit. And none of us ever said anything we wouldnt say to their face.  \n\n**A WEEK LATER**   \n\n- Text Wilson about the whole situation cos me and him, out of everyone, are still kinda \"good\" or neutral at least, and come to learn that Bill went behind my back about a month after our excommunication and made amends with all them and started hanging out in secret. I wouldnt have given a shit, but I at least would've liked to be told that he was tryna make things right with them.    \n\n___________\n\nSo....AITA?\n\n\nTL;DR best friend broke up friendship for something I said about some ex friends of ours, after also saying things but then making up with them without telling me.

The cat was treated for UTI, but the peeing has continued.\n\n#### Issue\n\nThe cat odor is insufferable.\n\nAt this point, the entire apartment smells.

So the symptoms of his illness are paranoia, dissociation, agitation, and \"fidgeting\". Fidgeting is in quotes because he would pace, and just not be still but I'm not sure what to properly call it. His paranoia was extreme. He once thought that I had been replaced while we were dating because \"my hair color looked different\" and \"my tattoos were more vivid\". He thought that there were people keeping me captive in my own home and forcing me to make drugs. Among other things. His dissociation was pretty bad too. He thought he was untouchable, and even told me to call him a God because in his mind he was. \n\nRecently, as in last week, he went missing. From Monday to late Tuesday no one knew where he was. In a dissociatiated state, he wandered around town near his apartment building before finding his way back to his apartment. We live in the mid-west and he claims the diesel fuel in his truck froze or something? So he had to walk and instead of walking home, he began wandering town. He claims that all of what he did was because he had \"low blood sugar\" and was so bad he couldn't even order a cup of coffee. \n\nHere's where it gets.... Not good. Very not good. He eventually found his way back to his apartment complex. And if I'm understanding correctly, he was shirtless and shoeless in the dead of mid-west winter at this point. This is what he told me over video call (for whatever reason he likes video calling). He took the license plate off a woman's car while she was still in it. When she asked what he was doing all he said was that he needed it, before sprinting away with it. He made it to the apartment complex's club house, and pulled a handicapped sign out of the ground then used it to break into the club house. Once inside the club house, still with the licence plate he stole, he called 911 on two different phones. The police show up to arrest him, duh, and he then resisted arrest. He showed me all the scrapes and bruises he has. They had to have multiple cops help put him into the back of the car. At some point his hand got twisted and badly hurt, he can not move his hand properly at this time. So because he wasn't (and possibly still isn't) in his right mind he thought that the police turning his head to try and force him into the car, was them trying to kill him to \"cover up\" .... Something? \n\nSo after arresting Ex, they took him to a mental hospital and not jail or anything like that. He is now out of the hospital as his parents took him out. Throughout our relationship and the \"friendship\"/coworker relationship after, I had been insisting he got professional mental help but his narcissism wouldn't have it. He is still showing signs of mental instability. Tomorrow will be his first day back at work and I'm concerned about working near him again. I've already decided to talk to associate resources about being uncomfortable and feeling unsafe working near him. Am I the asshole for hoping he gets either moved by associate resources or fired for having 2 no-call-no-shows?\n\nTL;DR - am I the asshole for wanting my mentally unstable ex boyfriend to get moved at our job so that I don't have to work with him as he makes me feel unsafe?", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

I mean one day it\u2019s all good the next day she makes me feel guilty for not hanging out with her.  A little backstory I\u2019ve been dating this girl for about a year and a half, we\u2019ve had our off and ons, we\u2019ve even had breaks in between.  And while I love her I\u2019m worried I\u2019m getting love blind or whatever it\u2019s called.  Frankly she does shitty things, for the longest time if we fought she\u2019d insult me and accuse me of so many things culminating in her insulting me in public but when we talked she cried and apologized and it felt so heart felt.  She said her mental health isn\u2019t good and she\u2019s feeling weird etc.  and I believed her but then a week later she did the same thing when we got in a disagreement and idk it just broke all trust when she promised she\u2019d never do it again.  \n\nFast forward to last week, we\u2019re out drinking and we had a really good night out we go back to my place and I go to get up to get something from the fridge and she gets super upset with me.  She starts yelling as loud as she could screaming at me, then at one point she just dropped to the ground failed everywhere screaming and crying and I just went and hide in the bathroom.  I hated being such a wimp and not facing up but my roommates were home and it was 2 am I was drunk and just wanted it to end.  I still haven\u2019t asked them if they were woken up by the screaming.  We talk about it the next day while cuddling and she cries saying everything\u2019s been so hard her depression is flaring up and I sit and talk with her about everything she\u2019s feeling reassure her it\u2019s alright.  We did this a bit through out the week and I thought everything was improving.  \n\nThen this weekend happened, it started normal.  She worked Friday night and I had a busy day and just wanted to be home so she was stuck at her place and she wanted to drink, so I went drove her to Walgreens she got some stuff even surprised me with some stuff then I went home.  But Sunday happened and it ruined the weekend.  I have a research paper due today which I had to finish up citations for Sunday night as well as work which since is retail we\u2019re super busy then I had to go to see family afterwards which I haven\u2019t seen.  She messages me at work and I get a chance to respond and she wants to make plans to eat I tell her I can\u2019t but she could come to my house and get food although she\u2019d have to meet my family.  She doesn\u2019t want to so I just think alright then that\u2019s fine.  But she keeps guilting me over and over about how I can\u2019t hang out with her, and after I finally finish my paper I go to see her for a bit but it was horrible.  No attention was enough I felt like I couldn\u2019t do anything right if I checked my phone which I do a lot when we normally hang out she just guilts me and says \u201cOh I\u2019ll shut up and let you use your phone\u201d. And it feels like I\u2019ve been gone for like war or some shit when it\u2019s been two days.   She just keeps getting worse and worse kinda throwing low key insults then we just sit there not really talking awkward as hell and I just say I\u2019m gonna leave then.  Of course she cries but I just didn\u2019t want to stay I finished my paper and felt really good but that killed it and I just wanted to salvage the feeling a bit.  So I went and got Ben and Jerry\u2019s, like truffle something and that was good shit let me tell you. \n\nAnyways I know this is a shitty rant and obviously this is biased from my point of view but I just don\u2019t know if I can take it anymore.  Plus I\u2019m planning on doing a job that will require me to be really far from home a lot during summer so if we can\u2019t make it two days without seeing each other what am I supposed to do then?  And while I still love her I just don\u2019t know, I feel so shitty sometimes and it tears me apart.

She was nice to me and we hanged out a bit. Like I said earlier she was super smart. She didn\u2019t need to take any notes or do any studying to get A\u2019s. This eventually lead to her annoying me everyday asking for me to ignore class and to play games and talk. At first I didn\u2019t care too much because we were in an easy spot in the semester and I was cruising along, so I agreed to. But eventually the classes got harder(duh) and I needed to pay attention but she wouldn\u2019t let me. I could tell her to screw off from time to time, but I always felt like a dick doing so.  She even convinced me to stay after school to do \u2018studying\u2019 which just ended up to be more of her playing video games and me either playing with her or trying to study while she again nagged and annoyed me.

POST : So I've known a majority of the people in this group from middle school, so roughly almost 8/9 years. However, we are all growing apart as it tends to happen when people split up for college and move all around. The thing is though, is that for years around Christmas we have consistently done secret santa and hung out. More or less everyone is in town for the break and we all coordinate something. And every single year it's been held at my house.\n\nThis past year though, I had a really bad falling out with one of the girls within the group. She became part of the group during high school, but we had become close before we went off to college. She was the one person that remained close by and we were \"best friends\". The reason why I cut off communication with her was because she kept trying to get me back with my ex, and consistently was rude to my new boyfriend. My ex had pushed to remain friend shortly after we had broken up and had claimed they could handle it but ultimately wasn't moving on. They ended up throwing a big fit when I got in my current relationship over a year after and just was getting crazy drunk and blaming me for them finally leaving the group. My ex-friend was by their side constantly, and I understood her reasons for it, but months after and she was still trying to push us together was taking its toll. I had explained to her why I broke up with my ex to begin with but apparently that was never respected. We tried working through it, but she kept bringing my ex into the picture so I finally was done dealing with all the drama and told her to have fun with my ex. \n\nWith a majority of the rest of the group, who were aware of my new partner during the last Christmas meeting and a couple know the ex-friend disliked him, they don't know about all the drama that took place after because we don't all keep in touch. And many aren't aware that we don't speak anymore as far as I know. Only one friend knows all that occurred and I still keep in more consistent contact with her. \n\nWe had spring break come up after we had the falling out and I did make plans with this group of friends and we hung out for an afternoon before I had to leave for work and such. The ex-friend didn't take part for whatever reason, but I also made it clear to the mutual friend who planned it that I did not want to accidently run in to her whatsoever. And that I would be fine seeing them another time if she was to join them. This mutual friend also acknowledged that for these group hangouts it would probably be better if it was held at another house besides mine. Which I completely agreed with. \n\nMore recently though, I recently talked with the mutual friend and asked if there were any plans in motion for this Christmas break, and I wanted to speak up about my desire to not be part of the secret santa and also reiterate that I would not be comfortable having anything at my house if the other person was to come. As for secret santa, I didn't want to put either me or my ex-friend in the awkward position of getting each other, and then further having the gift exchange primarily be with one person over another. \n\nThe mutual friend misunderstood what I was saying though and thought that I completely didn't want to meet up with anyone if they were in town. I clarified it with her that I was referring to specifically secret santa and she understood and actually didn't want to do that regardless since the group has grown apart. But she first had been arguing about how everyone would be willing to work with the fact that I just don't want to see my ex-friend.\n\nIn thinking about it however, I almost just don't want to do anything they may plan. I know that they would all be willing to work to accommodate me and want to not choose sides in the matter. But I honestly haven't talked with a majority of them directly since that last break where we met up. And I would hate to impose restrictions on what is supposed to be a light hearted gathering. \n\nAnd they all just don't understand the issue that occurred. Even the friend that I have kept in contact with has more or less written off all that has occurred in regards to my ex-friend even though she can acknowledge that I was always trying my best to be respectful and the ex-friend was the one crossing the line over and over. \n\nI was even having an open conversation with her about how horrible the situation was because it tanked my happiness and confidence for months when it happened. Because when my ex was blaming me for everything, my \"best friend\" and the mutual friends I stayed in contact with were all by their side because they felt that I was strong enough and didn't need support. The mutual friends only changed their behavior after my boyfriend went and explained that they didn't have the whole story. Ultimately, I explained to my friend that from my point of view none of the drama was worth it because I lost a person who was supposed to be a good friend, and I had to deal with my ex blaming me for everything when I had made it clear we were over for more than a year before I got into a new relationship. And the mutual friend basically just said that all the drama was unfortunate but there was a silver lining because she was able to meet my ex and become friends with them. \n\nI told her that it's all fine and dandy for her to not be bothered by all that occurred and be happy cause she got a friend out of it. But for me personally it wasn't worth it. I left it at that in terms of the conversation with her. But it just basically confirmed for me that she excuses all of my ex's and my ex-friend's behavior. I never asked any of them to pick sides and still never have and never wish to do that, but I always question how they could be okay with the way they were acting. Because both of them were explicitly badmouthing me and my boyfriend, either to our face or to the mutual friends. \n\nAt this point, I'm really am questioning whether I even want to try and hang out with this group of friends from high school when I barely talk to any of them and the one I more consistently talked to I am unsure of if I want to remain friends with. I feel like it would almost be better if I just remove myself from the picture and not even worry about hanging out with them. If they all hear the story from my ex-friend later on and believe that I am the asshole, well then I guess that's their opinion of me and it's unfortunate. \n\nI've talked with my family about it, but they don't see why I just don't want to deal with it anymore and they don't understand why I need to \"give up\" my friends cause of the drama with the other girl. I've just explained that it's a normal part of moving on. \n\nHowever, I would like to hear a more unbiased opinion. I still feel overall that they are good people. But it's all just a lot of stress that I don't want to deal with, and I barely keep in contact with them. Would I be the asshole if I just left the group and didn't join in on any plans, even if they were willing to find times where I wouldn't  run into my ex-friend? And would I be the asshole to discuss more specifically why I don't want to take part with the one friend that knows everything?\n\nTL;DR: My group of friends that I barely keep in touch with typically do plans around Christmas. I want to bail out on any plans cause I don't want to deal with the stress of coordinating with an ex-friend that prioritized my ex when we were supposed to be \"best friends\". My other friends in the group aren't aware of all the drama that happened and the one that is more or less excuses all the stuff my old friend and ex did. Would I be the asshole for completely removing myself from the situation and not committing to any plans?

My house is about 35 miles from where i live. So the idea was to move out. That's what i did. I live in my universities city now.

When he said that i said no, you need to tell me before you come to my house each time.

If they have a key and come to my house as they please I will never feel comfortable. Imagine me going at it with my girlfriend and they come for a random visit. \n\nSo the thing I worked out was to give them a fake key, and give the real second key to a friend.

POST : *TL;DR: I can get annoying from the intensity of my interests and how much I talk about them, I got put in my place, but felt attacked and don't know if that's a reasonable reaction or what to do about it.* \n\nThis is a pretty small issue, but here goes.\n\nI have a group of good friends ranging in age from older teen to young adult. We have a couple group chats (various circles of people) that we chat on. My friends and I have ADHD and/or autism, which means we struggle with social cues and sarcasm. We also tend to get really, *really* into things and talk about them a lot. It can be difficult to shut up, but I try and I at least make sure that other, especially less assertive, people have space to talk too. We also all have anxiety. All of us are aware of each other's quirks and struggles and are supportive.\n\nI really like my original characters, and I talk about them a lot. Like, a *lot*. But they get why I'm so interested and they love to discuss their own characters with me and we go back and forth. My friends jokingly hate two of my characters because they're villains, and they make fun of me sometimes because I defend the characters and my love for them. This is almost always funny for everyone involved and it's a nonissue.\n\nYesterday, I compared one of my characters to a different, video game, character that they really like. This offended my friends (longer story, but yeah it was insulting, I get why they're unhappy) and they started teasing me and making memes about my mistake and about me being so obsessed with the character that I can't not reference him everywhere. When I got embarrassed and asked them to stop, they just posted the memes in a different chat so more people can see. I don't think they realized I was serious, I didn't make it super clear (again, we suck at social cues) and that's my own fault. They've talked about unrelated stuff since, I felt too ashamed to participate.

POST : My husband and I just got into (another) fight because his best friend who comes over every Wednesday is (again) staying the night. \n\nMy husband and this friend have had a Wednesday night \u201cdate\u201d where the guy comes over to our house to \u201cjam\u201d every week for the last two years, and I\u2019m getting to the point that I want to hit the guy over the head with whatever is closest at hand every time he is around. \n\nBuckle up. This is probably going to be a long one.... if you make it through all of this you are my hero. \n\nAt first he was supposed to come over just for a few hours on Wednesday nights to play guitar with my husband while I was at work. Over time I have stopped working late Wednesday\u2019s but the jam session continues. Which was fine. However, for the last year they have barely touched the guitars and instead the guy just comes over to get high (on pot). Neither my husband or I get high with him (I don\u2019t enjoy pot and my husband isn\u2019t much into it either, but we aren\u2019t morally against it so we didn\u2019t say anything early on when we should have). \n\nNow that he is always high here, he NEVER leaves at the end of the night. Just expects to sleep over. But he doesn\u2019t have a regular sleep schedule so instead of sleeping while we are, he is wandering around our house all night (in his boxers) making noises, watching tv, getting nonstop text alerts from other friends and ect. This always wakes me up and I have to pass by him on the way to the bathroom. At these points he always has demands. Like: \u201cI want to watch this random movie your husband said you had. Find it for me.\u201d Or \u201cyou need to change your litter box right now, because your cat just pooped and I can\u2019t stand the smell.\u201d He always says he\u2019ll leave when my husband goes for work at 8am, but then complains that he couldn\u2019t sleep until 6am, so he ends up sleeping until mid day. At which point he just decides to stay until my husband gets home from work and then the whole thing starts over again. What\u2019s supposed to be one night a week often turns into at least two every week. \n\nOn top of never leaving, he has started showing up HOURS before my husband gets off work on Wednesday\u2019s. My husband has told him \u201cmy home is your home\u201d so he just comes right in. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if he could self entertain. But no. He comes in and will just walk into our bedroom (where I\u2019m hiding) sit down on the bed, take a hit of his shit, and start talking to me through whatever I\u2019m doing/watching on tv. \n\nEvery time he is here he eats A LOT of our food (gets the munchies, plus regular meals) but never once has had the courtesy to bring anything of his own, or to share, or to replace what he is eating here. He just goes into our fridge and pantry and eats whatever he wants because my husband told him our home was his. \n\nMy husband is always begging me to be nice and not say anything while he is here because he is lonely and needs friends.... except he has his other best friend living with him, and is constantly going on weekend trips all over the country to visit his other friends.  Not to mention those nonstop text message alerts all night. \n\nDealing with this guy is like hanging out with a 17 year old stoner non stop. He farts and burps as loud as possible wherever. Whenever. Is demanding and needy, but completely rude at the same time. Saying things like \u201cdude! You actually made your house look SORTA nice this week.\u201d (As I was prepping for Christmas), and \u201cso you do sometimes make an effort on your looks\u201d (when I had gone somewhere nice and come home with makeup on). He also complains non stop about the food I make (yet eats it all anyway). \n\nThis year for my birthday we couldn\u2019t afford to get any gifts, so I asked my husband instead to line up his days off so we could spend four days just us together...... then this guy broke up with his girlfriend and my husband begged me to let him come over just for a bit on the first evening. Que TWO full weeks of him not going home, and demanding all of my husband\u2019s time. I spent \u201cour time\u201d and my birthday, holed up in our room alone. \n\nThen, Christmas comes. I had invited my whole family to our house and tried to make things extra special because it was the first time I got to see my parents on Christmas in more than ten years. This guy\u2019s mom had just moved to another state BUT this guy has plenty of money and no job to work around so he could have easily made the trip to her for Christmas. But he didn\u2019t. Then his other friend/housemate also went out of town and he threw a \u201cwoe is me, I\u2019m all alone one Christmas Eve, no one loves me\u201d tantrum until my husband invited him to our house. He shows up. Gets high. And is a complete ass to everyone. Then throws a fit when he decides to sleep over because he has to sleep on the couch in a sleeping bag (my family were in the other beds.) the next morning we sit down to breakfast and he lets out this HUGE stinky fart right at the table like it\u2019s nothing, then proceeds to dish himself up 90% of the food and just generally be a douche. My family was flat out disgusted by him and his behavior and couldn\u2019t wait to leave. He stayed for three days. \n\nI feel like an ass hole because he is my husband\u2019s best friend and I don\u2019t want to make them not hang out, and honestly he hasn\u2019t done anything truly terrible. He\u2019s just annoying as shit. I fucking dread every Wednesday, and then I\u2019m super irritated the whole time he\u2019s here. Which I hide from him, at my husband\u2019s request, but then my husband and I always end up fighting over him not leaving at the end of the night. \n\nI\u2019m honestly one or two Wednesday\u2019s away from homicide with this guy, and all this I\u2019ve told you is just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, please tell me AITA for being upset at my husband for letting this guy stay over again tonight, and wanting a substantial break from his best friend? \n\n\n\nTL;DR My husband\u2019s best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. AITA for not wanting him to come over for a LONG time?

He invited me (through my mother) since I was in town last weekend. I am 22 and everyone else at the party ranged in age from 25-65. \n\nI didn\u2019t really know anyone there and my mom\u2019s (new) co-worker\u2019s date didn\u2019t either. The co-worker/girlfriend, who is in her early 30s, had been drinking a bit but was having a good time, talking and dancing with her co-workers. \n\nHer date, who wasn\u2019t dancing, started talking to me. He asked me about college, what my are plans after graduation, etc. It turns out that he had a lot of friends who went to my high school so we chatted about that. I think the conversation lasted about 10-15 minutes. To note, he was drinking a beer and I don\u2019t drink at all.\n\nThis evening, my mother told me how inappropriate I was with her co-worker\u2019s date. I had no idea what she was talking about. We were simply talking about mutual people we knew and my college life. She told me that her co-worker had just started dating him and he broke it off with her sometime after the party. My mother said something about how pretty I am (I\u2019m average), I can get any guy I want (pfft), why pick this guy (I didn\u2019t?), etc. I had no intention of stealing someone\u2019s guy from them, especially a guy who is in his early 30s, when I am in my early 20s. (I\u2019ve never dated anyone more than two years older than me so more than ten would be a lot!) \n\nFor some background, I am a very nice and friendly person which, I guess, could be misconstrued as me being flirty. I can be pretty shy in situations where I don\u2019t know anyone so when her date started talking to me (we happened to be sitting near each other, alone), I was excited to have someone to talk to. We didn\u2019t go into another room or anything, and his date was within eyesight of us, only about 20 feet away. I was talking to other people throughout the evening but they were much older than me.\n\nAnyway, did I do something wrong or are my mom and her co-worker overreacting?

The problem then was that we don't work near each other and I would have no chance during the day to return them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called him when I got into the house and offered to hide the keys in a pile of stuff he has in the porch ready to go to a charity shop and he said no (understandable). When I was on the bus I called him again to discuss what to do, and he said I should put them in a taxi to his job. I work in the City Centre and he works out in a suburb and the total cost would be around \u20ac25-\u20ac30 so I said no. I offered three alternatives:\n\n1) I meet him during his commute home, he wouldn't even need to step off the train.\n\n2) I could take the bus out to where he works and give them to him if he's staying in the area late.\n\n3) I could go to his house when he needs to get in, then go home to my own place from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach of these options would take 2+ hours out of my evening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe refused all of these saying they were too much hassle.

He won't be home until 6:45 at the absolute earliest yet he's still demanding I get the keys to him by 5:30. This would mean me leaving work early to bring them, or footing that taxi bill. I ended up scoffing about how big of a deal he was making this and calling him unreasonable before hanging up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was thinking about it then, and rang him back offering to compromise and pay half of the taxi fare, he could pay whatever was left when the keys arrived.

POST : Long story, and my first post.\nLiterally made the account so I could get some advice.\n\nI'm 21M studying and doing a \"part time\" job side by side. Why I quote? Because that was my intention an year back when I applied/joined.\n\nI applied to my boss for a part-time/internship an year back to earn some bucks and use my wasted time to learn something new. The offer made was as below:\n\n INR 15,000 a month (around US $215).\n5 days a week\nTiming was flexible as long as the work was being done\nWill work for 2 months, max 3.\n\nAnd this was how my first day went.\n\nWas asked to report at 9am (which i did) and was asked to sit till 6pm so that my boss could come back and review my work.\n\nDay 2, same. 9am to 6pm. But overall, first month went okay.\n\nComes in the second month and I started getting called in at work on Saturdays because \"the client needs the entire project finished by March (it still is going on)\"\n\nI complied.\n\nStarted getting calls after reaching home that xyz needs to be handed over tomorrow so if i could work overnight.\n\nI complied.\n\nSo now, I was working 6 days week, and overnight (till 3-4am) every week for next 2 months.\n\nSo my work-stats have been -\n6 days a week\n9am - 7pm (and 11pm - 3/4am)\nNo increment in compensation.\n\nAll this aside, we had 1 more full timer guy working alongside and he was kicked out in July for being ineffecient (because i was building more at much lower salary). So july onwards, I am the only one working and he has been relient on me for everything.\n\nComing back, comes my college exams and I ask not to work 20 days and told I won't be taking any salary for the 20 days. He agreed.\n\nGuess what happens? I get called after each and every exam if I can give 4-5 hours to the project before I start studying for the next exam. And i wasn't paid for it.\n\nOn my return after exams, i was offered a one-time bonus of INR 30,000 ($430) for the amount of time and effort I have put in (it's 6 months working now)\n\nSince it's my college breaks, i get called on Sundays to office now and been working 7 days a week. At this point, i started getting irritated and giving excuses that I am sick or blah blah so I want a day off.\n\nComes the month of August, I tell my boss that it's my final year of college and that he should get a new person as I'm getting tired and need to focus on studies. I get a mild \"okay, will see\" from him.\n\nThis goes on the entire August, September and October. October end, I've my college mid-sem exams going on and I get 30 calls a day from him and his assistant that something broke needs to be fixed. I had told him I won't work no matter what during exams but this is how I'm being treated. And finally, i submitted my resignation on November 2nd.\n\nI get called and he starts crying (not literally but trying to manipulate me by saying kind words and motivating me to work for him for just a couple of month). I being the nice guy who couldn't say no for an answer just complied and went back.\n\nThe moment I stepped in, i felt the same old feeling. Like I was a slave in the prison. Things went the same entire November.\n\nSince I didn't work for 10 days in October and 10 days due to festivals and exams in November, I get a combined salary of 1 month (15k) for the 2 months (Oct/Nov).\n\nCome December, my sister's marriage was fixed and announced. Plus, I had my end-semester exams so I told him I won't work for 20 days in december. Guess what happens? If you can't, i get called between exams to work again. What's more, listen to his plans. So we have exams with 1 day gap in between. So if one exam is on 1st, other would be on 3rd.\n\nSo his plan? \"Study for your exam after you come back giving one and come to office the next day.\" What this means? If I've given an exam on 1st, i study for the next at night of the 1st and go to office on 2nd and give exam on 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't noticed, i never got a single day's time during the semester to study so i used to study a day before exam. Plus, I'm pursuing engineering so it's not an easy course.\n\nI've omitted so many things in between that I now realize and need you guys to know. He claims to have supported me and allowed me to attend college whenever I said I had to.\n\nWhat this means is, whenever there was some work in college, i had told him a day or two prior and he would always allow me to. But his response has always been like \"oh shit, i had planned for us to achieve this this and this. Can't you skip? Or can you come after college. No? Then work overnight and get this done. We're nearing our deadline and need to deliver ASAP.\"\n\nNow, as mentioned somewhere above. My sister's marriage was announced and we have this ceremony (not engagement) where both the family claims to like each other, exchange gifts and kind-off promise to let their child marry (roka ceremony).\n\nThis ceremony was in between my exams in december. So it was like, I had an exam on 11th, 12th was this ceremony, 13th another exam.\n\nDuring the exams, I don't stay at home so my parents had no clue that I was working/getting called to work during exams as well. But he called me 10 times on the ceremony day and my dad got to know and talked to him. My boss told my dad that it's just 2 days of work left, my dad asked me if it was and we agreed to finishing his last requirement. I worked 10am - 4am non stop for 2 days to pull off a lot of work.\n\nAaand, he got another reason to want me. As soon as my exams ended, I get called again and again to be at office because if I work like this for just 10 more days, we'll be done with the project and he will let me leave.\n\nThis is true, it's only 10 days of work if I work 18 hours a day, but let's do some review.\n\n1) I've been working at 15k inr ($215) a day for 6 days a week. Have worked at least 10 Sundays.\n2) I've been telling him to get a new guy since End July/Early August.\n3) I submitted my resignation 1.5 months back that had immediate resignation.\n4) I haven't met any of my friends or been out anywhere. If i had a plan, \"boss, i want 7 days off, i wish to go out with my friends to xyz place. I've been working hard and need a mental break.\" His response has always been \"it's just a matter of a month at most, just finish this up, and you and me can enjoy out vacations. So delay your plans this time\"\n5) I have worked in between my exams\n6) My last year has been - Work, exams and work, college and work. Basically anything and work.\n\nWhen I submitted my resignation, I started ignoring him and did not deliver an application that  they wanted and he had the first let-down from me (part of the reason why I got 1 month's salary for Oct/Nov)\n\nAt this point, i told him that I'll finish the remaining bits but won't start anything new to which he agreed. And later, (mid Nov) he comes to me and says \"dude, the client needs this app before beginning of Dec, I don't have any other developer so you've to do this.\" I wasn't given an option if I wish to take up this work, I was ordered that I've to do this work when i had clearly told i won't start a new app, because it'll hinder my exams and I don't want any pressure at that time.\n\nI know this is going all over the place, but I'm just typing out as things are coming to my mind.\n\nSo, now my exams ended on 24th Dec, and I get called to office on 24th. I refused so he asked for 25th. I reminded him of Christmas and he was like \"we can work and celebrate together.\" I refused and then it become 26th.\n\nEnd of day, Christmas. Me and my girlfriend broke up. It's a story for another time, but she was the only one (other than my family and 1 friend) who had supported me all this time. Now that she's gone, i told my boss that I'm not in a mentally right state and wouldn't work for sometime.\n\nAnd what I get told? \"This is the final leg, we do this and we both have a break. I respect your fatigue but do respect my image and commitment. Just work like you did on those 2 days (10am to 4am) and we'll be done in 2 weeks. We're just left with a,b,c,d application and I estimate the following timelines\n\nA - 2 days\nB - 4 days\nC - 3.5 days\nD - 4.5 days\n\nDo it last time and we will have a long break.\"\n\nThere is some truth and some lies here. The lies are all his estimations. All his estimations are so pointless. \"It's just doing this and this, make a table and store data and show here. Should be done in an hour.\"\n\nAnyway, now I'm seriously tired and have gone to fuck you mode. I've started disconnecting his calls (i used to let them ring earlier and later tell him that I wasn't near my phone) so that he knows I'm not entertaining his requests. I've told him that I WILL NOT work a single day. I am mentally so frustrated that I just wont.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for completely letting him on his own in this final leg? Should I go back and help him finish the project? I just want to say that I don't want to work. I feel depressed working for him now. I've burnt out.\n\nAdd-on: I usually sleep late, so I wake up late (10am minimum) and he knows. So, to get me to office early, he would ask his assistant to call me until I pickup my phone starting 7.30am. I always message him before I sleep with the update of the work and the time (which is always after 3am).\n\nNo matter how deep my sleep is, i always wake up from my phone vibrating, so I've had so many half-sleeps. And his assistant would call me 20 times. I would wake up, curse everyone, mute the call, try to sleep for 20 times every morning.\n\nI mean, fuck off. Fuck. Off.\nI don't want to work with him, no matter how much money I need.\n\nI wish to post some chat screenshots. I'll see if i get the option to. Have a good day, and let me know how I should proceed. And if you've made it so far, thank you for listening to me.

We haven\u2019t had fun money, so our days are usually spent caring for our son, watching Netflix and Hulu, eating, and going to bed.

For the last 5 days I have been sick with a bad head cold with the real symptoms coming out the last 2 days. One of my roommates (I live with 3 others) has interviews this week and has repeatedly said \"just don't get me sick\" when the subject of my illness has come up. To be mindful of them I have done the following:\n-Stayed in my room as much as possible\n-Washed my hands as much as possible\n-Not leave any tissues or anything behind that could have germs\n-Overall isolate myself besides an hour or two in the common area when no one was there\n\nI ran out of tissues half a day in and instead have used a few paper towels and mostly toilet paper as either does not impact my skin. Half the time I needed to blow my nose I would go into the bathroom, blow my nose using toilet paper, flush it down the toilet, and wash my hands and go back to my room. Often I would take some toilet paper with me and then keep that in my room as well.\n\nToday is where the big fight happened. My roommate said that I was not doing everything I could to ensure he doesn't get sick and if I was being more clean I would buy tissues, store it all in my room and use the restroom only as needed. He made some logical/statistical argument as to if I reduced the amount of trips to the bathroom, he statistically has less of a chance to get sick and therefore I am not doing everything I could. He also brought up the fact that I am the messy roommate (this is true but I have done my best to be better) and that my overall understanding of cleanliness is flawed based upon examples of previous messes.He also mentioned that I should of sprayed disinfectant and wiped the counters as I used them.\n\nI told him I felt he was being incredible insensitive and unreasonable in expectations. I told him that I felt I was doing everything a reasonable person would to not get other sick and have been isolating myself in my room and washing my hands as often as possible. I told him my process of using the toilet paper and immediately washing my hands was in my opinion fine and not increasing his chance of getting sick. While this did increase the numbers of trips to the bathroom, the only thing I touched after blowing my nose was the flush and then washed my hands. He wanted me to \"dissect\" his argument and logically disprove his statement and when I said I have nothing more to say as I feel I am being respectful already to everyone in the apartment he cursed me out.\n\nAITA?\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

I've met many of his friends, but not this particular girl irl (lets call her Sarah).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince we live fairly far away (especially for high school students + neither of us have a car), we don't get to see each other in person very often (about 2 times a month). As a result, he hangs out with his friends himself a lot, which I have zero problem with.

She drinks, she smokes weed, juuls, and my bf only ends up doing the same when she's there at a party (she brings it).

I was kinda mad, and decided that this was the last straw, and that I really disliked Sarah, since I personally really really dislike people who cheat. I just think its really ethically wrong to do. Also, although my bf told me this is the first time she's done anything like this, usually cheaters don't start cheating with taking photos (kinda need guts to do that), so she's probably cheated like this before (just an assumption though).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, he told me that he was hanging out with some friends later in the week, which included Sarah.

POST : My friend (we'll call him Jeff) recently celebrated his 20th birthday and I drove 250 miles to see him. Before I left his girlfriend (let's call her Liz) was asking if the gift she had bought for him, a copy of Super Mario Party for the Switch, would be a good gift. I already had a copy of the game so I offered to play using my copy before she presented the gift to him so he would be familiar with the game.\n\nFast forward to his birthday, the first issue arises. I asked if he was interested in joining us playing the game and he was immediately not interested. Jeff insisted that it was his birthday so he should get to choose what we play. Not wanting to create an argument we conceded and played his choice of Smash Ultimate. We still had fun it just put a wrench in the original plan.\n\nAfter we wrap up Liz gives his gift to him. Second issue. Jeff is underwhelmed at receiving it and remarks that it's nice, but not what he was hoping for. Since we had wrapped up playing Smash Jeff asked if we wanted to go to the mall. It's a short drive away and we needed to do a little shopping anyway so we agreed.\n\nI didn't realize until we got to the mall that Jeff had brought Mario Party with him. He was driving and had parked us at the entrance closest to GameStop. As soon as we enter the mall he makes a pretty direct route to GameStop. By this time Liz has also realized what is going to happen and she is just barely holding back tears.\n\nHe returns the brand new unopened copy of Mario Party for Let's Go Eevee. We leave GameStop for another store and I go shopping with Liz. Jeff remained outside with a third friend, Monty. While talking to Monty, Jeff tried to rationalize returning his gift for another game. He claimed he knew Liz was interested in Eevee and they would never really appreciate Mario Party.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I tried to explain to him that his decision to immediately return his gift in front of his girlfriend who got it for him?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no'", "input": "CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : My wife (K) and I are both professionals working in a big city. I never really wanted children, but K was very insistent about wanting a child, and I decided to put her needs above mine on this issue, given how important it is to her. \n\nSo we had a son 2 years ago, and I've thrown myself into it completely - the kid is great, and I put in a ton of effort trying to be a good dad. Essentially I work a full day every day, spend \\~3 hours hanging out with my son after I come home, then jump back on my laptop to do more work after he goes down to bed. I carry my weight in terms of diaper changing, putting him to bed, feeding him, playing with him, daycare drop-off, etc.\n\nThe issue that's arisen is my wife's work travel schedule. She's in a really demanding job, and in 2015 - 16 (before our son was born), she was put on a project that required her to be away from home / out of state quite frequently. At the time it was happening, she assured me that this was a pretty atypical project, and that I shouldn't expect her to be away from home so frequently in the future.\n\nFast forward to 2018, and another project related to the 2015 - 2016 one arises, so she ends up traveling quite a bit. This is in addition to a decent amount of social travel, as she has 3 separate friend groups she goes on out-of-town trips with once or twice a year. In total, between work and social, she's been gone about \\~60 days total in the past year. On those days, I've been left to fend for myself with our son. I love him, but it's a ton of work taking care of him 1:1 for long stretches, and it's started to really bother me from the standpoint that I've already stuck my neck out / completely rearranged my life to make K happy by having a kid (even though it's not something I'd have wanted on my own), I've fully embraced the role of being a dad, and now on top of that I feel like I'm having my goodwill exploited by her leaving me as a solo parent for 2 months out of the year. Full disclosure: I'm away for work \\~30 days out of the year, so I do this to her sometimes, but 1) that's a full month less than she's gone; 2) I've significantly cut down on discretionary social travel since our son was born; and 3) again, despite how much I adore our son, we had a child specifically to make her happy, and specifically at the expense of a life I was completely happy with.\n\nSo things came to a head a few days back, when she (on one day's notice) told me she had to go on another 2-day work trip. I told her we needed to talk about this, as I was unhappy about how frequently she's been gone, and I didn't want the rest of my life to be like this. She alternated between 1) getting super upset with me and saying stuff to the effect of \"fine, I'll just find another job\" in a pissed-off, passive-aggressive manner; 2) arguing with me that her travel schedule won't be as bad once this project ends this spring; and 3) insisting that she hadn't been away from home much more than I had in 2018.\n\nWith regard to 1), I'd honestly be thrilled if she found another job, and I told her that. The problem is she absolutely loves her current job and is good at it. There are other, related jobs she could move into that would have better work-life balance and fewer travel requirements. The downside is that they'd pay less and be less personally fulfilling to K. My sense is that she thinks my desire for her to change jobs is tantamount to my wanting her to be barefoot and in the kitchen, which is a little ridiculous - if she were to change jobs, she'd still be in a role that is very well respected (certainly more well respected than mine) and would still be paid quite well (albeit not as well as she currently is). \n\nWith regard to 2), it's possible that her travel schedule will normalize after this project is over, but that's what she told me in 2015 - 16 as well, and here we are in the present. So I don't have a ton of faith that this situation won't repeat itself in the coming years, and I'll be solo-dadding for large chunks of time on a semi-regular basis. \n\nWith regard to 3), I know she's wrong about this, as I've gone back through our calendar for 2018 and counted the days. It's a bit frustrating that she won't even fully engage with the idea that there has been a large imbalance in time away from home, and that it's unduly burdened me in terms of child care.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for hanging in there. As it stands, I've made my dissatisfaction clear, and I've left it in her court to decide whether to start considering other job opportunities. (While I think that would be what's best, it's ultimately her decision.) Meanwhile, she's taken this to mean that I'm strong-arming her into finding a new job, and so she's started putting out feelers while also acting incredibly pissed off toward me (snapping at me occasionally, sleeping in the guest bedroom) for the last several days. I'm debating whether I'm going to cave in and just tell her to stay at her current job (since I'm kind of a softie and really do care about her happiness), even if it potentially causes me to be miserable for the rest of my life, or whether I'm going to stay silent on the issue and see how it plays out.\n\nIn any case, I know the point here is not to ask for advice.

POST : This scenario isn't as nearly as dramatic as a lot of others I've read, but I can't stop thinking about it and feeling guilty.\n\nBack info:\n\nFirst of all, I'm 23 and still live at home- don't judge please, it's not unusual here in Germany since our education system is a little different and a lot of us including me still go to job training at that age, which, in my case, doesn't pay you any money, so I can't afford my own place yet and my parents often times said they love having me around and don't even really want me to move out yet. For real, I would actually LOVE to have my own place and I'm saving up for it. Not sure if that's too important to the story, I just want you to know that I didn't act like this because I'm \"going through puberty and my hormones are going crazy and mothers and daughters always argue at that age\". Sadly I can't use the hormones excuse anymore lol.\n\nThis is where the story begins:\n\nTwo days ago, my mom and I went grocery shopping together; no big deal for others, but for us, it's kind of a mother-daughter-bonding thing, where we talk about anything and everything and I just love it. After we had everything we needed, she asked me if we should go to my favourite shopping center.\n\nShe had actually had other plans on this day, so it was really sweet of her to offer it and I sincerely appreciated it. When we were there, I saw some watches in the store we were in. I don't own a phone anymore and thought it would be a good idea to buy one of them. I picked one, my mom saw it and looked at me like I was crazy. In case anyone is wondering, I was gonna pay for it and my mom knew that too, I wasn't asking or expecting her to buy it for me, but she just started ranting about how ugly that watch was and asked if I was actually serious and told me to put it back. My mom is a great person and she's always there for me, but when I wear or buy something she doesn't like, she and my dad both get extremely obnoxious and judgmental and scornful about it, sometimes I feel like they're laughing at me, and it has always made me feel terrible about myself.\n\nSo even though my mom took some time out of her day to take her adult daughter to the shopping center, and even though she clearly did this to spend time with me, I snapped at her with an equally condescending tone while starting to walk away from her: \"You really could have said this in a different way.\" She walked after me and apologized, but I was still angry because this has been building up inside of me for a while, so I yet again snapped: \"You ALWAYS do this. ALWAYS. You and dad make fun of me for everything that I like and it makes me feel like shit.\"\n\nShe said \"You know we don't mean it like that, we didn't want to hurt you\", and I responded \"No, I really don't. I don't care how you mean it, all I know is that it feels god awful to me and it hurts like hell every single time. You ruin everything that I like, there are so many things that I used to love that I can't wear anymore because I know you'll ridicule me for it.\" I walked away from her without looking back.\n\nWhat I said may have been an exaggeration because it doesn't really happen that often; it's just that it leaves an impact every time it happens. My parents' opinion of me really, REALLY matters to me even as an adult, so seeing them judge me the way my bullies used to really hurts. I don't know, I have pretty thin skin in general, something that I should probably work on.\n\nShe got really quiet after I said this and stopped walking after me and I could tell she felt terrible. Needless to say, our shopping trip was cut short; we wordlessly left the store and got back into the car. After a long silence, she started to talk and tried to justify her talking to me like this as \"I understand you're upset, but I just want to give you feedback, how else am I supposed to do that?\"\n\nI yet again snapped: \"Just tell me that you don't like it, but that I'm free to wear it, that's literally all you have to say.\" After that, we were silent again. At home, she tried to make light of the situation and said \"Tomorrow you'll be thankful about me preventing you from buying that watch\", but I wasn't having it and said \"I may not be angry anymore by tomorrow, but I sure as hell won't be thankful for it\", then I disappeared into my room.\n\nAbout half an hour later my mom came into my room and gave me a speech about how she's sorry and that she's only like this because she sometimes forgets that I'm a young woman now and not her little girl anymore and that I can make my own decisions, and she also said she feels awful for making me feel this way and that hurting someone you love is a terrible feeling. Usually my mom never apologizes like this, so I could tell this truly must have been a big thing to her. It made me cry and we hugged and made up, so this should have been the end of it, but I just can't stop thinking about the fact that I made my wonderful mom feel so bad about herself, and that I made this whole thing that is so special to me so awkward. I legit want to cry when I think about all of this, but since she already apologized and the whole thing is resolved, I don't know what I can do to fix it, or if there's even a need for me to fix anything, because I don't know if I was the asshole in this situation or if my reaction was understandable...\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : I know that sounds so bad, but let me explain!!\nPlease keep in mind that through out this story I\u2019m 19 at the time and she in her 30s. \nWhile I was working at my old job, I met a woman who immediately took a liking to me. Obviously I was extremely nice because that\u2019s what\u2019s expected of me and she took that as me wanting to become friends. She eventually memorized my work schedule and would come in to see me and monopolize my time for hours. She would just talk to me and ask me questions and I had to stay because I didn\u2019t want to be mean and I was generally not busy. She started asking for my contact info and I turned her down several times but she ended up wearing me down so I agreed to give her my number and that we would meet for coffee. I understand that was my first mistake. I should not have given in and sent the wrong message. \nNow, I don\u2019t have a problem with autistic people and actually enjoyed some of our conversations. I understand that for her everything is black and white. There are rules that you have to follow and no gray area. The problem was that we had absolutely nothing in common and we could never have a good casual conversation because she would condemn a lot of things I did like drink or befriend people who smoked. I started to hide a lot of aspects of my life because I didn\u2019t want a lecture. I never told her I dropped out of school or that I was gay or that I didn\u2019t have a religion.  It became a chore to answer her phone calls (she would call all the time just to talk) and I never wanted to go out because I never had fun. \nNow for the current predicament!! \nI recently just got out of a very toxic abusive relationship and was dealing with a lot. This woman would still call me and ask way too many questions about why I couldn\u2019t talk or hang out. I just told her I was busy. I didn\u2019t want to tell her about my life because #1 that\u2019s private and #2 I wasn\u2019t exactly in a mental place where I could explain what was happening in my life to a stranger. \nPush came to shove and I decided to move to a new province and try to restart my life and I told her that. She was very very upset and told me I was running away from my problems and being selfish towards everyone I was leaving in my home city. That really hurt because this was the first thing I had done for myself since I got into my horrible relationship.  \nI left but she still messaged me everyday asking how I am and when I\u2019m coming home. Right now I\u2019m just ignoring her and trying to live my life. \nWould I be the asshole if I just ghosted and blamed it on the drama of moving and starting a new life? \n\nI\u2019m also looking for advice on what to do because I know ghosting isn\u2019t the nicest but neither is saying I just don\u2019t like you. \n\nTLDR: I met a women with autism while at work (I\u2019m F19 and she\u2019s F30) and she forced me into a friendship. We don\u2019t have anything in common and it\u2019s a very one sided friendship. Now I\u2019ve just gotten out of an abusive relationship and I want to move on with my life. Should I ghost?

My friend says that I need to get off of my high horse. I like to go to the public library in my city to check out books and also do some work in their computer area. As is the case with many libraries in urban areas, there are a ton of homeless people there who come to spend time and take shelter.\n\nNow, I understand why they come there. It's one of the only places (maybe the only place) besides a shelter where they are allowed to come in, get warm, be treated civilly. And the library allows it, so as long as they're not being disruptive there's a mutual understanding. \n\nHowever I find that I just do not like being around so many of them. I know this makes me sound like a sheltered, elitist asshole. But I'll be sitting there and actually will have to cover my nose because someone sitting next to me smells so bad. Someone a little ways in front of me is watching porn in full view. Someone a few seats down is constantly making noise. It's just not a conducive atmosphere for working/relaxing/studying. \n\nI am fully aware that I have the choice to go elsewhere, like coffee shops or home, to do my work. And I understand that it would be very unfair of me to expect the library to not allow homeless people to come. That is their prerogative and I get that the library can be a sanctuary of sorts for the homeless. But, it turns into the opposite of a sanctuary for others.\n\nI made the mistake of casually commenting to my friend about the number of homeless at given times of the day at this library and she got very offended and said I was being elitist and needed to show empathy. I explained that I do have empathy for the plight of the homeless, and that I don't expect them to be banished from the library, but I simply **do not** want to be in that atmosphere. \n\nAITA?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : This may be a long one...\n\nThings to have in mind before you read:\n\n\\-My girfriend comes from a very toxic household. She\u00b4s the youngest of all her brothers and sisters, the only one with no children, at this point in her life her only responsibility should be studying or working.\n\n\\-Her family seems envious of her because they are not exactly wealthy, and her youngest daughter has a boyfriend who lives in the rich part of the city (that\u00b4s me). She reminds me of Mikaela from Transformers, really hot and educated but poor. All joking aside, her family can be very nasty towards her sometimes. There was this one time there were two rats in my girfriend\u00b4s bedroom. Her family didn\u00b4t want to help her because it was \"her problem\" untill I managed to convince them about the dangers of having rats in a home, specially when there are children. And even after that, my girfriend had to pay for most of the service required, wich is not cheap. So, as you can tell, my girfriend is obviously more comfortable at my house than her own.\n\n\\-I wanted to clarify this to tell you, she\u00b4s NOT a gold digger. When I met her I wasn\u00b4t in the best economic possition and she helped me to get through it, untill I stabelized again.\n\nI\u00b4ve been with her since May 2018. I\u00b4m 32, she\u00b4s 20. Yeah, I know. Nothing you say is something I haven\u00b4t heard before. She\u00b4s cute, funny, ironic, loves food. On the other hand, she has serious self-confidence issues, wich brings a lot of other problems but that kinda sums it up. I stay with her because I know what\u00b4s like being in that possition and I want to help her. Also I love her, obviously.\n\nSo this past Thursday we had a really big (and loud) fight about this issue. She came home the other Thursday. She was supposed to go home on Sunday. She stayed because I always let her stay an extra day or two. I miss her, you know. So we said Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday morning before I wake her up and say \"You should get up so you get ready and I take you home\" (She lives 3 hours away and it takes her at least two hours to get ready. I know, girls.) She doesn\u00b4t take it well. She gets kinda sad because she feels like I don\u00b4t want her to be here. I explain to her for the millionth time that it\u00b4s not that, but couples do need a little space, I need time for my own, missing each other for a few days is necessary for a healthy relationship. She\u00b4s still sad. Long story short, I let her stay one more day.\n\nWednesday: She\u00b4s ill. I knew she wasn\u00b4t liying, although it kinda bugs me that by the time she got better it was already too late for her to go home. Now I\u00b4m getting a bit annoyed. I really wish I was alone at that moment.\n\nThursday comes. Same story as Tuesday, I wake her up gently, tell her she should start getting ready. She\u00b4s sad again. I won\u00b4t take it this time. When she sees I\u00b4m not giving any sigs of letting her stay, she starts packing her bag angrily. I try to ignore her in the most polite way I can, offering a glass of watter, etc., you know just trying to act normal. It was getting late again so I say, politely, \"You should hurry, it\u00b4s getting late and I don\u00b4t want you walking home alone at night\". Oh yeah, on sunday I could have taken her myself because I don\u00b4t work, but any other day my shift is split in two periods, meaning I could not go with her. And she says \"I know you want me to leave, you don\u00b4t have to be so obvious about it\".\n\nThat is when I explode. I turn around and say \"WHAT?\" She gives me the stare of death and I say \"How can you not yet understand that it\u00b4s not I don\u00b4t WANT you here, but I NEED time for myself. Just ONE day. That\u00b4s all I need, you can come back on Saturday if you like.\" She goes \"What do you think I am? A dog that you can call when you want?\" At this point I\u00b4m about to go berzerk. I start telling her all the things I put up with to stay with her (wich actually should be a story on it\u00b4s own but TL/DR, she can be very needy and demanding sometimes). I tell her that because at this point it\u00b4s the only way I can maybe make her understand how much I care about her. She says that I want to make her feel bad, I tell her sorry but it\u00b4s the truth, it\u00b4s not my problem she can\u00b4t see it. From that point on, it was going round and round on the same point: I need time, she SAYS she knows that but still doesn\u00b4t want to leave, I ask her if she plans to stay forever, she says \"No\" so I say \"Then please go home so I can have a little Me Time\", and here we are at the beggining of the loop.\n\nShe finaly went home, by the time she got there she was already in a better mood, but she was still throwing comments like wanting to guilt trip me about not letting her stay. Very subtle, but I notice the manipulation.  \nSo what do you think? Am I the asshole?\n\nTL/DR: Girlfriend who has a very toxic family wants to basically live with me but I tell her I need a day or two on my own to enjoy myself. She gets sad and angry and it leads to fights.\n\nSorry for any spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : Before telling this story a little background:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad and mom separated when I was 10 or so and I'm now 23 and in this time both of my parents have had several boyfriends and girlfriends throughout the years. I've never cared or really gave my opinion unless asked of said bfs and gfs unless asked and even then was always polite.  My father's now wife is a nice enough woman, but tends to give unsolicited advice and will at times get mad when you don't take said advice. I smile and walk away a lot since at the end of the day I'm not dating her my dad is.\n\nAnother important note is that my father and I have always had a pretty crappy relationship that is mostly due to him being unemotional in ALL circumstances. Hugs are awkward and he is more concerned about perception that his actual children. After years of being resentful of this I've finally come to just accept it as how his own father raised him to be, and he doesn't know any other way to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk now to actually get into the story!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile there were many times my now step-mom butt into my father's and I relationship to tell me how wrong I am one time in particular stands out.  Sorry it's a long one....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were going to an event where my father was accepting an award and we all had to dress to the nine's since we would be photographed for the newspaper(if wanted I might be able to find the picture that was featured) as a family as it was her first real event as his new wife.\n\nShe decided to call me up and invite me out dress shopping which my dad was nice enough to say he would cover the bill since I was sure that any shop she took me to would be out of my price range. (He is kinda rich and now she is too and I am a broke college kid)\n\nSo we go to a posh dress shop where she instantly gets an shop assistant to help us. She starts telling the assistant all these details about the dress that it just \"had to be\" like no cleavage shown, long dress, subtle color.\n\nI'm thinking ok cool she is talking about her dress I'll wait my turn as I browse dresses around the shop. Five minutes or so go by then she finds me and tells me to go to the dressing room and while I'm confused to why I listen and go since I have no reason to not.  As I walk in the dressing room the attendant is there with a bunch of dresses that fit my step-mom's bill and I think oh she wants my opinion on a dress for her makes sense since lots of girls do this. Nope, they were for me.  In the wrong size which when I pointed this out step-mom comments \"Oh I thought you would lose some weight for this event\" I am a curvy girl.  Have been since puberty and pretty damn good with it. But I'm not going to argue about it so I just tell the attendant that these dresses weren't what I'm looking for and would like to grab some from the front to try on.\n\nAs I turn to do just that my step-mom grabs my arm and tells me \"Don't be ungrateful, your dad is paying so I'm telling you that you have to look decent in front of all these people who are going.  I doubt you want to embarrass your dad in front of them.\"\n\nI am pissed.  I've been to these type of events since I was a kid I know how to dress to them, and I also know what looks good on my body and what is appropriate for my age. So because I didn't appreciate her tone or her \"help\"  I take her hand off my arm and tell her \"Don't worry I don't care at all about embarrassing him what so ever.\"\n\nShe tries to push the issue as I'm walking to the front of the store \"I'm not paying for something I don't approve of!\"\n\nMy reply? \"You wouldn't anyway it's my dad's money not yours.\"\n\nStep-mom \"How dare you! Your father and I have a joint account so I'm equally paying for everything.\"\n\nMe \"If you believe that the blond dye is really getting to you\"\n\nStep-mom \\*GASP\\* \"How dare you!!! See if you get a dress now!\"\n\nMe \"Maybe not from this over priced store (500$ for a dress o.o for one night!)\"\n\nShe once again gasped and said \"wait till your father hears about this!\"\n\nAfter that dramatic ass line I left. Like I said they are not my problem they are my parent's problem.\n\nLater my dad called me in a huff yelling at me for treating his wife so horrible and blah blah blah don't expect me to pay for your trashy dress now. I can't begin to know what she told him, but I don't care.\n\nI get a nice dress from Macy's that was perfect and I got many compliments throughout the night including from my step-mom and my dad.

I just hate sitting there worrying, more so when I call him before I head to pick him up and get no reply and its been hours since he left.\n\nSo Am in the wrong  for asking for a mid walk check in to aleavate my fear and worry?  I don't feel like Im asking much in a quick txt, He feels like Im cutting in to his freedom. \n\nP.s. He has been hastled by cops a number of times for being in the parks along the bike path where he walks, generally for just stopping to use the bathrooms along his way. And he does not fallow a set route so I wouldnt be able to even look for him if some thing did happen to him.\n\nThanks for the help!", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : TL;DR at the bottom!  \n  \n  \nI have had a rough upbringing with several traumatic experiences including emotional, physical and sexual abuse. I am always upfront about it with friends since some can\u2019t \u201dtake it\u201d when I talk about my feelings. I respect that fully and never try to push my bad feelings onto someone else. But as pretty much any other person, I need to talk about my emotions.  \n  \nI recently went through a bad breakup. Got thrown out of my apartment and had to endure a lot of emotional abuse from my ex. I wasn\u2019t in a stable emotional situation at that time, and had recently started on anti-depressants due to my suicide thoughts/plans.  \n  \nI had one friend I pretty much all the time turned to just to empty my chest. It was what I felt I needed. At the same time I tried seeking professional help. In my country the healthcare is free, but the wait is long. I have been waiting since 2017 for a psychiatrist and it was only yesterday I had my first appointment. So I have had to rely on close friends for comfort.  \n  \nI noticed how a friend group started drifting away. They didn\u2019t answer my messages anymore and when I ran into them after a concert they pretended like I wasn\u2019t there.  It was super embarrassing since I was there with another friend who they hadn\u2019t met yet, and the tension was awkard..\n  \nYesterday (it has now been months since we last spoke) I asked my \u201dbest friend\u201d of the group if I had done something wrong and if I hurt any of them in any way, so that I could apologize which I though was fair to do to them.\nShe told me that she was tired of me always being sad, telling her about my self harm thoughts, and complaining about my ex. She felt used and manipulated.  \n\nReading that made my stomach drop. I never knew that I had made her feel that way and now I feel *awful*. She told me she didn\u2019t want me as a friend and I understand that. So I apologized. She then told me that more people deserve to have my apology but she didn\u2019t tell me who or why so now I am anxious and can\u2019t sleep. Was I that big of an asshole? What could I have done differently? I have severe abandonment issues, and always have the feeling that people secretly hate me, because of my background and now all my \u201dbad thoughts\u201d are coming true. How can I apologize the best way?\n\nTL;DR: I was sad and talked to my friend about it. She got sick of it and stopped inviting me to gatherings and stopped talking to me.

She\u2019s obviously extremely busy\u201d.  And that\u2019s 100% true.  Here\u2019s the full story.  \n\nI\u2019m getting older, almost 30.  I\u2019ve been divorced, I\u2019ve shacked up with a long term girlfriend, I\u2019ve dated women of different moral values, and now I\u2019ve finally met someone with similar views, who is awesome, and sweet, and I\u2019m attracted to her.  The new part, is that she\u2019s a single mother.  This was always a no-go for me in the past because it was just luggage I wasn\u2019t willing to take on in my life but I\u2019ve accepted that at this stage, a lot of women have had kids and I just love this girl.  \n\nAnyway, we only get to see each other maybe once a week and usually her son is with us.  If the dad takes him, then we might have 3 or 4 hours together and it\u2019s often just chilling out and catching up from a busy school/work week.  The same is true when we go on camping trips, or road trips, or theme park visits. \n\nI\u2019ve really had to adjust to not seeing my girlfriend every day or 2.  It\u2019s been tough not being able to spend the night with each other or plan to spend every weekend together, but I\u2019ve learned because I\u2019m playing the long game for this girl.  \n\nLast week, she had some time to come over in the middle of the day and she was totally alone.  We had been texting recently about how we had not had sex in several weeks and we were both looking forward to our next chance in the beginning of December.  With this visit, I brought it up and mentioned that we could fool around a little bit.  She jokes that she likes the idea but it\u2019s not going to happen because my house is too bright.  She is insecure about her body and sex must always happen at night in pitch black.  I constantly tel her how beautiful I think she is and that I am attracted to her but it\u2019s just one of her hang ups.  \n\nLong story short, she cane over and we sat around and talked for a few hours until she had to get back to the grind.  \n\nMy thoughts were initially that I have made so many concessions for her and been so supportive and understanding of her tough schedule that maybe she would be supportive of the one time I bring up an interest in sex with her.  I usually feel guilty bringing up sex, like it\u2019s asking somebody for money or something.  I know I\u2019m not entitled to sex.  I\u2019m not owed sex.  But it was something that we had discussed, we enjoy doing with eachother, we wish we could do more, and we wasted a perfectly good and exceedingly rare opportunity.  \n\nI don\u2019t dare discuss this with her because the last thing she needs is to be stressed out with my stupid brain baggage on top of her full plate.  \n\nAre my feelings wrong?

POST : My (34f) husband (44m) got in a huge fight last night and he just doesn't get it.\n\nI've been wanting a dog for awhile now and he's aware. We have 2 cats and 2 ferrets. We had 3 ferrets but 1 was really old with multiple health problems, which he had when we adopted him. He passed away. A week ago. My husband wants to get another one, but I don't. I do all the work for all the animals. The only thing I don't do is the cat litter box because of a health issue I have, my doctor says I'm not allowed to clean it. \n\nSo I brought up the issue about the dog. Before I could get a full sentence out, he cut me off and said, \"We're not getting a dog, that's final!\" He was extremely rude, belittling, and treated me like a child. I was just trying to have a discussion with him about this and he completely shut me down. This isn't the first time. He does this whenever he decides he's right and I'm wrong. But whenever he wants something (like the $1000 lightsaber he complains about) I always listen to him and then explain to him why we can't afford it at the time. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells because there have been times where I day something direct, like - \"Hey, do you think you could clean up after yourself in the kitchen? Thanks!\" He gets upset! I'm direct (but tactful) and I can't say things in a direct manner because he flips out and accuses me of \"blaming\" him and of being \"overly critical\". He also does this when it comes to the kids. He has a 15 year old son from a previous relationship and I have a 5 year old son. My son has chores and does more things around the house than my husband or my stepson. My stepson has no chores, constantly has issues at school for not turning in homework, and spends all of his time sleeping or playing video games. When I bring up the issue of my stepson doing some chores or helping out around the house, he accuses me of being lazy and foisting my housework off on the kids.\n\nI'm not upset about him saying no about the dog. I'm upset that he seems to think his word is law and rules our house like a patriarchy. Our relationship is very unequal. He acts like I'm a child - what he says goes and I'm not supposed to argue about it. \n\nThis morning (the fight happened last night) I tried to explain to him why I was upset, and he thinks it's all about the dog. He doesn't get that it's not the dog, it's his behavior! He thinks he had no choice in the ways he treated me and refuses to acknowledge any other alternative, though I gave him several. \n\nHe even texted my friend last night and blamed the entire thing on her, because it's \"her fault for making (me) want a dog\". She's done a lot for us, more than anyone else, but he says he has no respect for her. He refuses to see that this isn't about the dog. He thinks if it weren't for the dog thing, this never would've happened. Yes, it would, it would just be about something else because you repeatedly treat me like a child.

My friend FakeName and I, two poor college kids, are hanging out without anything to do. He just learned to play Texas Hold Em poker so we decided to sit down and play for a bit. At the beginning, we didn\u2019t play any stakes, just for fun. \n\nNow I don\u2019t want to toot my horn or anything, but I know what I\u2019m doing when I play poker. I\u2019ve studied the statistics, game theory strategy, and played a lot online and live. I\u2019m not like a god or anything but I really enjoy it and have put a decent amount of time into improving my play. \n\nSo when FakeName suggested put some skin in the game, I happily agreed. It wasn\u2019t anything crazy, just whoever wins gets a drink from the loser. He won the first game, and we upped the prize pool to two drinks. We went back and forth like this for a few games (1 on 1 they lasted 10-20 minutes each). \n\nEventually I started to pull away. FakeName is very new to the game, and he was making all the amateur mistakes. He only bet when he felt good about his hand, and he called my bets way too much when he was \u201cjust hoping for that one card to come out!\u201d He had some physical tells too- big eyes when his card came, fingering his chips when he just couldn\u2019t wait to bet. In other words- very easy to exploit. \n\nThis is where I feel bad. Instead of stopping while I was marginally ahead (2-3 drinks), I said yes when he asked the chance to go double or nothing. I won. I said I was willing to let him go double or nothing until he won or we was ready to stop; before we know it, an hour has gone by and he\u2019s down 40 drinks. Yeah, 40. That\u2019s like $200 and waaay more than we should have been wagering given our stations in life. \n\nWhat makes it worse is that we had joked earlier that we were both the kind of people who couldn\u2019t give up on a bad thing- that if we found ourselves in a hole we had the tendency to dig ourselves deeper trying to get out. Then two hours later the exact thing has happened to him, with me knowingly profiting off of his bad decisions. \n\nI know FakeName is a grown adult and he hopefully learned a good lesson, but I can\u2019t help but feel like I should have kept it from getting to where it did. He\u2019s definitely going to want to pay me what he technically owes even though I don\u2019t really care enough to try and enforce a dumb debt like that. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

I introduced her to my friend (who will be called Bob) who introduced her to his boyfriend (who will be called Jim,), everyone got along well. One day I get a text from Bob  saying that Ann and Jim are over at his and asking if I want to come up as well. I reject the offer as I was pretty ill that day, he sent me a few images of them having fun together, she texted me a few times. I had gotten a text later from Bob showing a picture of her T-shirt pulled downed a bit showing her bra, I texted her asking if she was alright and she replied that Jim and Bob were poking her breasts and ass and that she felt a little uncomfortable (in case anyone asks, they were bisexual).\n\nFast forward a few months, Jim and Bob have broken up and we all, more or less, cut off contact with Bob and Jim and Ann are best of friends. Now Jim personality is very flirty and that can make me a bit jealous at times, though Ann never flirts back.

We eventually got to the town centre and I told them that I was gonna run home quickly to get a coat as it was a bit chilly and for them to wait there. When I returned we continued walking around. Fast forward to the end of the night, I got into a small argument with Ann about drinking, she felt like I was a bit too restrictive with it (I don\u2019t drink) and basically didn\u2019t want her drinking because she doesn\u2019t handle it well. I stormed off back home.

She revealed to me that after I went to get my coat, they had talked about me (he had basically said that I seemed a bit insensitive), and after the argument over alcohol he had encouraged her to break up with me (she didn\u2019t, luckily), and I have grown to have a big disliking of him.

So, she leads the cat in her car with the food, gets it to her house and sets it up with food and water.\n\nShe starts sending me picture after picture, this cat, she thinks is a boy, is actually really nice, rubbing up to her, butting his head against her, and is really calm.

POST : (Cross-posted from r/relationships)\n\nSome background: my partner (43F) and I (34F) have an excellent, mutually supportive relationship. Her parents are great as well, and have really embraced me as family, which is nice as I'm estranged from my homophobic, controlling parents. Partner and I have been together for four years. We have an adorable five month old baby. Life is pretty damn great.\n\nThe only black spot in our relationship is her sister, my sister in law (40F). I simply hate her. I find her so detestable that it is difficult for me to make eye contact and smile when I see her.\n\nTO be entirely fair to SIL, I can be a grumpy introvert who takes a while to warm up to people. She is high-functioning ASD, what used to be called Asperger's, and isn't good at reading social cues - so she steps over my boundaries without meaning to.\n\nBut here are the things I hate about her:\n\n\\- She is completely dependent on her parents: she lived with them a year ago until they bought her a house and moved her into it. She is 40 years old. She calls her mother at least twice a day, for an hour each time, because she can't stand being alone. They drive her everywhere and go to all of her appointments with her etc. She gets a small disability allowance, and apart from that they pay all her bills. This is reasonable - after all, she has a disability - but she is SO RUDE to them. She treats them like crap and just takes for granted everything they do for her. For me, coming from parents who never nurtured or cared for me, it is really frustrating to see her not appreciate any of the many, many things they do for her.\n\n\\- She completely lacks self-awareness. She thinks she is really calm and chill and self-aware. SHE'S NOT. She's anxious AF and makes everyone else around her jumpy with her annoying behaviour.\n\nCase in point: We went out for lunch today for my partner's birthday; me, my partner, our baby, my MIL and FIL and SIL.  It was a pretty fancy schmancy restaurant, which she doesn't cope well with anyway - she gets loud, makes stupid jokes and does her nervous hysterical cackle at the drop of a hat. However, today she decided she didn't like anything on the menu and sulked. My partner asked her not to make alterations (because in the past she's been really rude to waiters, to the point of making a childish face when she doesn't like what they offer). When my partner requested this, she burst into tears and ran off to the toilet. When she came back she sulked and refused to talk to the waiter, meaning that my MIL had to order for her. She ended up getting an alteration anyway. \n\nArgh. There are a million other things that I could list that irritate me about her, but the TL;DR is that she's rude, ungrateful, and lacks self-awareness.\n\nSo, Reddit: Am i the asshole? Should I be more considerate of her limitations and more understanding of her disability?\n\n&amp;#x200B; I saw SIL today and managed to have a pleasant conversation with her! It turns out she\u2019s not too bad one-on-one, which I never realised because I\u2019d always avoided her. Thanks Reddit!

During that time I tried earplugs (so many different brands and materials). None of them blocked the sound of him snoring.

POST : For a bit of background, I'm 25M and work in IT, my girlfriend of 2 years is 24F and works at a museum. We have lived together for the past year-ish and since I make more than her, we split shared bills proportionately by income, which comes out to about 70-30. We have been living below our means and both putting aside $x per month to buy a condo or townhouse together.\n\nMy girlfriend has a male coworker (\"Mark\") that she knew in college, they worked together on their semester-long capstone project for Anthropology and then both ended up getting a job at the same place after graduating, so they are pretty close. I will state for the record that I have no problem with my girlfriend having male friends. She has a lot of friends, both male and female, and is quite the extrovert. About six months ago my girlfriend told me that Mark had told her that he and an archaeologist buddy of his were tossing around the idea of going to Turkey and asked her if she wanted to come. It didn't sound like a very solid plan, so I just said \"Oh yeah, that would be fun if we had the money. Maybe we can save up and go on a vacation next year.\"\n\nWell, fast forward to now, my girlfriend comes to me and tells me that the Turkey trip is really happening, it's in two months, Mark invited her again and she had saved up enough money to go so she wanted to do it. Now that this is suddenly \\*real\\*, I am a little caught off guard and also pretty sure I don't want my girlfriend going on an international vacation with two men.\n\nI'm thinking of telling her not to go based off of how I feel, which is this:\n\n\\- I don't know these guys very well. I trust her, but have no reason to trust them.\n\n\\- Turkey is a volatile country and not safe to visit, especially for a woman. Maybe someday, but not now.\n\n\\- The money would be much better spent going towards the house. The only reason she has that much \"fun money\" saved up is because I am paying 70% of the living expenses.\n\n\\- She doesn't have to go all the way overseas to visit archaeological sites and museums, especially because her career focus is on the Americas.\n\n\\- I just don't think it's appropriate for a girl in a relationship to spend 2 weeks abroad with two guys while her boyfriend sits at home.\n\nI really don't want her to do this and I also feel like she went behind my back planning to go on this trip all this time.

I'll usually tell him that I don't like to compare results regardless of whether I did well or not. However, he would normally persist and say stuff like \"Cmon dude, no one's gonna judge you\" or \"Its just a score, just tell me dude\". Prior to today, I would sheepishly smile and say no thanks and get on with my day. However, I was in a particularly bad mood today. When he persisted with the 'Cmon let me see your grade' I retorted by telling him to fuck off. He was shocked at my reply and didn't talk to me for the rest of the class.

I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son\u2026 serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said\u2026 \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

My roommate and I have been friends since high school and are now in our second year of college together. We\u2019ve got a group of friends up at our school and we were all pretty cool with one another until September. \n\nSo my roommate, I\u2019ll use A to identify her from here on out, had been on again off again seeing this guy for the better part of our freshman year. He was an absolute creep that made everyone uncomfortable, yet A always brought him around even when we told her we didn\u2019t like him.  He strung her along for many, many months, despite the friend group urging her to cut him loose as he was causing her substantial amounts of anxiety. \n\nThen in October of the same year she held a party at our apartment, without asking if I was okay with it. To be honest I\u2019d be fine with her hosting one, but I found out that she\u2019d told one of my friends that I\u2019d said it was okay to host one when I didn\u2019t even know that it was a plan in motion???

It was a total accident, so I can\u2019t be mad at him for breaking the bong because shit happens, it was just pretty disappointing. My boyfriend and I continued to act normal so that we wouldn\u2019t ruin the night, and smoked out of a pipe instead.\n\nJeff never offered to pay to replace the bong even though he broke it, and I was thinking about whether or not I should ask him for the money.

He's a single dad to a 5 year old boy, doesn't have any family support, works full time at a shitty fastfood chain and studies part-time to try and better his situation. I know he struggles with anxiety at times and can get overwhelmed, which in the past I've come over with some wine or beer and have lended an ear and a shoulder. Recently his son was diagnosed with autism and I suspected that he was feeling stressed out dealing with this by himself. His partner passed away in an accident when their son was 2 and he hasn't bothered with dating or relationships since.\nWe've been close friends since high school, I was there when his son was born, and he met and approved of my boyfriend when we started dating 6 years ago. We've helped each other move, plan parties, studied together, I've babysat for him, he's literally like my brother.\n\n\nLast week he set set up a group chat, explaining that he has been having daily panic attacks and seeing his therapist weekly. The last time he saw his therapist, he opened up that he has been feeling suicidal for 2 years and has actually started planning \"a way out\" since he found out his son is autistic. He already feels inadequate as a father and feels he's failed/failing his son. That his son would be better off without him.\nHis therapist suggested seeing him at least twice a week and to set up a support system that he can message when he begins having those thoughts.\nSo he added me, another close friend of his (who I'm not close to), and 2 others who he's close to but don't live in the same city.\nHe explained everything I mentioned above and said that he would only use this chat when he feels he can't go on anymore. \n\n\nNow I'm empathetic but this year has been awful for me also, I don't feel like I can take on his struggles as well. I'm finishing my phd, there's been 5 deaths this year which have hit my boyfriend and I particularly hard, one suicide of a mutual friend, my dog died, I'm not working and there's the financial stress that goes with that and my partner has just started a new 6 figure job but is high stress and I've been dealing with that. I also suffer from anxiety which has been hard to manage this year because of all these stresses which I feel is important to mention here.\n\n\nSo I sent him a message separately, saying that I was sorry that he's going through this difficult time but because there are 3 other people he can rely on and that I'm not in a great place myself, if he could remove me from the group chat because just hearing that I could lose him stresses me out which with everything else going on is terrible for my anxiety. \nHe apologised saying that it wasn't his intention to do that to me and that he'll remove me.\n\n\nYesterday I received a message from his other close friend (same city, but not my close friend) calling me selfish. \nI asked what he was talking about. Our mutual friend had a bad day yesterday and wanted someone to talk to, and messaged this other guy. He was in a meeting and physically couldn't be with him but said he'd be over as soon as he could and to message me until he was there. That's when our suicidal friend told him that I couldn't be there because of my anxiety and what I told him.\n\n\nHe explained to this to his other friend that he was hurt and that he didn't he didn't want to \"burden\" me with this as I can't support him and that he didn't know if we'd ever be as close as we were.\nI feel pretty upset by this, because I still want to be his close friend but I just can't support him right now. I didn't mean to hurt him and sent him a message explaining that but he hasn't replied yet. So what do you think?

It used to be fine but I\u2019m burned out by the time he gets home now.\n\nI\u2019m having an issue with the fact that he will come home and unload his whole day on me within minutes of walking through the door.

I need some time and space. \n\nThe main problem is that what he has to say is mostly complaints. About whatever may have happened that day. Sometimes he\u2019s doing a frustrating job and it gets worse. It\u2019s too much to listen to when I don\u2019t have the mental capacity for it. And because it\u2019s business related, and his business is our livelihood, it starts giving me anxiety hearing about the issues. Sometimes he\u2019ll take work calls in front of me, for what seems like no reason. Like he\u2019ll be in the kitchen, get a phone call, come to the living room in the middle of my show just so I have to hear the call?\n\nI bring this up, voice my concerns, and it goes right back the next day.

Actually, now that you\u2019re home and you can watch the kids, I\u2019d like to be alone for a couple minutes. That\u2019s why I came to our bedroom and closed the door...and you followed me in here...\u201d Sometimes when what he has to say is really complaining I just say flat out I\u2019m not interested in hearing about it at all.\n\nEven if he stops the venting stuff, it annoys the fuck out of me how he wants to hang out as soon as he gets home. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to casually chat either, not right away. Again, I\u2019ve been with toddlers all day. I want thirty minutes where no one is speaking to me, asking me something, even making noise around me. \n\nHe ALWAYS takes offense.

He ALWAYS brings it back to me not caring about his day or wanting to talk to him.

He finally talked to me and said he was paying off a ring (turned out to be a small lie, he was saving money to pay it all at once. I guess he lied so it would seem further along or something). This back info is just to explain that he knew it was very important to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally over the weekend we went up to the finger lakes in NY and he asked me. I am excited but I'm also really hurt by how he did it. The little get away was really nice but that was the only thing he really thought about... And he didnt really come up with that idea - his brother was there the weekend before. The spot he proposed to me was on snapchat days before (which is when i discovered another lie because when i was crying in the fall he told me he had it planned).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was a little drunk because we had been hitting wineries all day. We walked to the waterfall and he said, \"I don't want to take advantage of a drunk girl, but will you marry me?\" got down on one knee with the ring. That was it. No nice things about how much he loves me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said yes and we started walking back to the car and I asked what my parents said because I had told him before that I wanted him to ask them. He didn't. He said he chickened out.  \n\n\nLater I was really looking at the ring and lost it. Started to bawl. We had looked at rings together a few months ago and he got me exactly what I said I didn't like. I told him I love him very much and wanted to marry him but felt unimportant to him and like this isn't what he really wanted so I didn't want to wear the ring that night. Cried A LOT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided the next day to just exchange the ring and I just picked it - which I hated to do because I wanted him to pick it but I thought I had done a better job of explaining my style.. He said that he loves me more than anything and wants to re-proposal when the ring comes back (just for us, people already know we are engaged so we aren't going to start telling a different story. Just leave out the crying.) I REALLY want him to do this for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not focusing on the happiness and the future rather than the disappointment?

I'm not going to try and put the person in a negative light because I don't want to make this bias, which will be hard.\n\nI think I was 13 and I used to take the bus to school. I was one of two girls on the bus and the others were boys. The girl, let's call her Susie, usually sat in front of or beside me.\n\nI don't really know Susie, (she's in the year below me) but she's quite stand-offish (is that even a word?) and can be fairly rude. That's all I know about her as a person really. Anyway, we I was minding my own buisness listening to music as I usually did on the bus and she was talking with the others.\n\nThe bus driver stopped the bus at one of the stops to get off (this is because one of the boys on the bus was in the junior school and the bus driver had to make sure someone was there to pick the boy up or the bus driver had to walk the boy to his front door. The bus driver walked the boy to the door this time) and I was alone on the bus with the others.\n\nI like sitting on my own and not talking to anyone on the bus at the end of the day because I get tiared from a lot of social interaction and can find it difficult. I struggle socially sometimes and don't understand some social interactions or why some people do somethings. This is just how I am and have always been. I can't help this.\n\nI can't remember what Susie said, but she went over to where I was sitting and took my phone out of my hands. I don't like my stuff being randomly taken from me and makes me anxious when that happens.\n\nThe next thing that happened was her threatening to throw my phone out of the bus, I didn't know what to do in the moment, so I acted on impulse, punching her in the eye. I don't think I punched hard, but even so, I still punched her and should't've done that.\n\nI did have her number and texted her over and over again saying I'm sorry and I regret what I did.

A small confession, this isn't really worrying me or anything, but when I found out about this sub a couple of days ago I LOVED the idea.  (Am I the asshole for not posting a serious situation?  Lol.)    So anyway, I finally came up with a situation which I could share.  Happened about a year ago.\n\nI live in Spain now and my first year here I met a young Spanish guy about my age in a club that we both attended.  I was visiting from another town.  We became quick friends and used to have deep life discussions and stuff.  Before each of us had girlfriends, we would hang out every 3-4 months.  I would always hop on a bus or whatever and go meet him where he lives (Seville), he would put me up in his house and I would pay for our meals.  \n\nWell, once we got girlfriends, things started to peter out, but we maintained contact more or less.  One day, we had planned to meet up, and I made my usual travel arrangements.  At the last minute he bails on me because he \"isn't in a good space mentally\" (to my knowledge he has no diagnosed mental health issues, he was just feeling down or whatever).  I tried convincing him but hey, whatever, he doesn't feel well.  Fine.  I cancelled all my travel arrangements and didn't think too much about it.\n\nAbout 6 months later we tried again.  When we agreed upon my visit I asked him, are you SURE this is what you want?  Because last time you bailed.  He said yes.  I confirmed with him, AGAIN, 1 week before my visit - again making SURE he wanted me to visit.  He says yes.  And finally, a couple days later, he calls and I already know what it's about.  He says, can I please NOT come because it turns out this is the only weekend he can be at his flat alone with his girlfriend.  I made a big deal about it this time, like, dude, you've done this TWICE now and I confirmed with you two times before making my arrangements.  You're gonna make me do this again?  And, he did.  I had to cancel all my arrangements, losing time, energy, and a bit of money.\n\nAfter that moment I pretty much decided, hey, this guy has no respect for what's going on with me and is too wrapped up in his own crap to be a good friend for me.  So I was sad at \"losing him\" but I stopped talking to him.  Just didn't feel like he had anything to add to my life.  \n\nIt's not like we were super close, and this is totally platonic BTW, but we definitely had a strong friendship.  Not my BFF but probably (one of my) BFF(s) in this new country.\n\nFor whatever reason I finally called him today, told him that what he did wasn't OK with me, but that I didn't want to argue and just hoped he was well and all.  And that we should stay in touch.\n\nSo, AITA / WITA for pretty much cutting him out of my life for a whole year over this?\n\nNote: He also did not try to re-establish contact with me in this period.", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : Me and a couple of close friends (4 guys and 5 girls) where hanging out at our friend's house over the weekend. After dinner we all sat down, had a couple of beers and talked with each other, just like we usually do. I noticed that one of my friends (let's call her Kelly) wasn't drinking and it then struck me that I couldn't remember the last time I've seen her drink alcohol. I absolutely don't have anything against people who choose to stay sober, but Kelly had told us stories about her recently getting drunk so I knew that she wasn't fully abstaining from it. I asked her about this and also reaffirmed that I didn't mind it at all and was just being curious. She told me that for the last year or so she had refrained from getting drunk among men since she didn't feel safe doing so. This of course made me concerned. I asked her if there was any specific incident that had made her come to this conclusion, but she assured me that it wasn't. She said it was a decision that grew forth over time from reading the news, hearing stories and things like men groping her at the club.\n\nNow this is where the potential assholery begins. In the group we have all known each other for at least five years and I've known Kelly since grade school. The house we stayed in was out in the forrest, far away from anyone else so we weren't going to meet any other people that night. When she said this I therefore interpreted it as that she didn't trust us guys not to take advantage of her if she got drunk. As far as I can tell none of us has ever shown any tendencies that would support this. We've all gotten drunk together plenty of times and I've never seen any of them make unwanted advances or anything like that. I told Kelly that I understood where she was coming from, but that I felt hurt that she choose to apply this rule even when it was just us guys from the friend group there. During my explanation two other friends, one guy and one girl, joined the conversation and asked us what we were talking about. I let Kelly tell them the story whereupon the other guy reacted basically the same way as I did. The girl however told us both that it was non of our business and that Kelly didn't have to motivate her decisions to us. I handled this the same way I always do when a confrontation is imminent: I told a joke at my own expense and changed the subject.

For awhile Bob wasn't friends with this other guy because of what was going on between me and the other guy. Bob knows everything about this guy and the severity to which it has impacted my life (it has completely changed it). \n\nNow this guy came back into my life after some time when we were both in college, and he seems like he has actually changed for the better. He admitted to his incredibly shitty behavior and tried to talk through things with me. After all of us trying to be friends for over a year, I wasn't able to make the friendship work with the other guy. Sure, I no longer thought he was going to hit me or rape me, but I still had a hard time dealing with the other issues of our old friendship. I felt a lot of pressure though from Bob and other mutual friends for that matter; Bob's a really simple guy and for the past year he's seen the other guy be a really good friend/decent person to me, so Bob was having a hard time understanding why It's taking me so long to let everything go.\n\nWell things with the other guy weren't getting better, so for a lot of reasons I decided to stop being his friend. I also decided that it would cruel of me to ask Bob to stop being his friend, but I couldn't stand the thought that they would be talking about me behind my back...and honestly I couldn't stand the thought that maybe Bob would end up liking him more as a friend. It was really getting to me, so I told Bob everything and tried to explain to him why I felt it was necessary that I end my friendships with both of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths later I decided that I really missed Bob and even though I'm no longer the other guys friend I'm still suffering from it so there really was no point to me ending my friendships. Bob was always there for me and even though I really need to get this other guy out of my life maybe I could just ignore their friendship. \n\nIt turns out during those months while I was gone Bob felt as if I abandoned him. The other guy hated me because he also says I abandoned Bob, which hurt tremendously. Bob got ghosted by a girl he really liked and he says it was the hardest moment in his life.... but apparently he got another girlfriend and they are really happy together and his life is much better than the first part of those months when we weren't talking. After talking he said he finally understood my reasoning and no longer feels as if I abandoned him; he's still hurt, but he forgives me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been three months since we reconnected and I still cannot stand the fact that he's friends with the guy. I feel like knowing everything the guy did to me, he shouldn't want to be his friend, even if the guys a better person and if I kinda arranged for them to talk again when he came back into my life......But I can't stand it.

I told her that sounded great and I would meet her at the bar when I got off work. \n\nFast forward, I get to the bar and shes pretty drunk hanging out with some girl friends she just met.

At this point I should tell you we are just friends and I wasn't expecting anything more than just talk, but we have fooled around in the past so I knew it wasn't off the table.\n\nAfter a while she tells me she wants me to take her home so we can smoke.

POST : So what happened was me and my friend got out of class and I had another class on the other side of campus. I decided to drive over there and my friend was asking for a ride and after I said no he opened the door anyways and got in. I drove him to his car, it wasn't that out of the way. I was waiting for him to get off and he just sat and talked and I said you gotta go I got to get to class. Now this friend is pretty handsy and loves to poke you and tickle you. He started messing with me pretty vigorously. Its important to note that the car is not in park and I am pushing the brake pedal. I get pushed and lose my footing of the pedal and my car starts rolling towards the concrete barrier. I press what I think is the brake pedal, but it is not and we hit the concrete barrier. \n\nI have insurance, however it does not cover my car. So all the expenses are coming out of pocket. The reason why my insurance is not normal is because this car is a 2005 Infinity G35 and any accident will be ruled a total loss. Ive fixed cars in the past, but this is far and away above my knowledge and expertise. I took it to a mechanic that says he can fix it up and that it doesn't look nearly as bad as it is. He said I can expect the price to be 1.5-2.5 thousand. \n\nNow would be important to talk about our financial backgrounds. I am from a well off family that has been very supportive. My parents let me know that they will give me a no interest loan, but they will not give me any money. Which I am very thankful for, and do not expect any money from them. My parents never have given an allowance or any type of free money. This does not mean that they don't occasionally buy me clothes or food. As a full time college student it is hard to maintain a full time job. I would usually have 2 part time jobs, now I am down to one job that pays around $450 a month. It's not a lot but its what I can manage as a full time student. Now my friend is not as fortunate as I am. His parents do give him some spending money though. Which he routinely blows on alcohol or weed. That's as far as I know about his financial background. After the accident I realized if I should not push him away or break the friendship because of this accident. Especially if I were to ask for some money. So my question to you is if I should ask for his help in paying a mistake that I think is 75% his fault.

I usually live with my mom on the weekdays and go to my dad's on the weekend. \n\nHowever, over the past couple of months or so, I've been living with my dad and doing occasional visits to my mom's house to reset my room so we can get new flooring.

POST : A while back I was part of a writing forum that became pretty toxic with some cliques going after random people and harrassing them, using slurs, and degrading people not just because of their writing but inane things like their slang. \n\nI got sick of it and left and decided to make my own forum and discord that had stricter anti-bullying rules.\n\nA couple friends joined me and helped me create the idea of it. I created the forum, the discord, did 90% of the work for it, domain name, and even paid someone for a custom theme(which if you know web design, you know cost me a good couple hundred $'s) and made them admins and mods with me. We then began inviting other people to the discord first (particularly people who were upset with the other forum) expressing it was a much healthier place to write, and any bullying would be strictly enacted upon.\n\nEverything was great, until I noticed people were\u00a0 only joining the discord server, not the forum, and were only doing so to vent about the old forum. \n\nI let it go at first because it made sense for people to vent out their frustrations and get rid of their baggage before starting fresh at the new forum. But nobody was doing that. There were even a few people who joined the discord that hadn't even been part of the old forum, and after hearing of all the drama, decided to join that one instead of the one I'd created.\n\nAt this point I was getting pretty upset with the matter of things, especially since I was expected to listen to people's problems (not just forum related) without complaint, but when it came to me wanting to vent people would express their discomfort or just make jokes at my expense.\n\nMy depression and anxiety was already getting pretty bad in its own, but adding to the fact that I went through the, time, effort and financial expense of making a new forum, only for people to just brush it off like \"oh cool new.forum but I like this place that makes me miserable better\"\u00a0 made me feel really unappreciated. My roommate had already noticed I was doing badly, and suggested I take a break from discord and forums in general and, so I announced my hiatus, and logged out for about a couple of weeks. In those weeks I realized I wasn't getting anything out of the new discord and that it had just become an extension of the old toxic forum. \n\nI announced I was leaving for good and giving up the discord, and gave the discord not to one of the people who had \"helped\" me make it, but to the admin that I had known the longest and knew would be the most unbiased and fair, then left.. \n\nImmediately, one of my friends who had \"started the discord with me\" started dm-ing me and yelling that I was a bitch and a disgusting person and that I should have given the forum to then or the other person that I typically wrote with. I was shocked but I told them I didn't think I had anything to apologize for, and that I'd chosen the most temporate person in the discord to take over.\n\nAnother friend came at me, implied I didn't care about the friendship and insisted I apologize to everyone even after I explained myself and why I'd left. Later they admitted they'd been emotional at the time, but didn't apologize. I admitted that I still wanted to be friends but it would be hard for me to trust them after they had turned on me so easily at my lowest moment. They then implied I was similar to a toxic friend of theirs and said they weren't going to beg for friendship.\n\nTLDR= left a toxic forum with a couple friends. Made a new forum and discord, spent time and money on it. People started using it as a complaint area instead of what the discord was for, so I gave discord ownership to someone who wasn't those friends but I believe was a better fit for owner. Said friends then yelled and accused me of being a bad friend. \n\nSo the question is: Am I the asshole for starting a forum and discord with some friends, doing most of the work, and when I stopped enjoying it, giving ownership of the discord to someone else?", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

We have been together for over a year, and that year has been one of the best years of my life. That being said, recently, there have been more and more issues with our relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur relationship started off on the wrong foot, as we started talking immediately after she got out of a bad relationship with her ex and had no time to process the breakup before we started dating. After that, the relationship was doing fine until we quasi-moved in together about eight months ago. I say it's only quasi-moving in because we both still have our own places, but we trade off where we stay every night or so. With this came all of the normal growing pains of moving in together. Getting a new live-in roommate is never easy, but we have handled that fairly gracefully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to the heart of the issue. Approximately 6 months ago, her mental health issues started to show up/I started to notice them. She hasn't been diagnosed, but clearly shows signs of anxiety and depression. On multiple occasions, I have sat with her and tried to console her as she had a depressive episode, and have calmed her down during a panic attack. I truly have no problem doing this, but the frequency has begun to take a toll on me. I have tried to get her to attend counseling, which she tried. She only made it to two or three sessions before she decided that it \"wasn't for her\" and that she \"didn't need it.\" Since then, her depression and anxiety has just gotten worse, and the episodes have gotten more frequent. Now, it seems like she is always mildly depressed, and is always gloomy. It has gotten to the point where she does not want to do things that she has to, like go to the store to get food because we are both out or get up off of the couch to turn the lights off. When I bring these up, she asks me to do them, always giving an excuse for why she can't do it. I try to be as understanding as I can, and help out, but like I said, I'm getting tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add to this mess, she has major trust issues that are taking a toll on our relationship. The aforementioned ex cheated on her multiple times and now she has a problem trusting anyone. Not to help that issue, there has been one incident in our relationship that has stoked the fires or jealousy. I have an ex that was on-again off-again during high school that came to the same university as I did. We have not dated in almost four years, but have remained platonic friends. Early in our relationship, I went out to eat with a group of friends and my ex was there as well. Nothing happened, but my ex did give me a ride home. I admit, this was not the best decision in the scenario, and have admitted this to my girlfriend as well. My girlfriend was very hurt by this, and we have talked about it over and over. Always with me apologizing and admitting my actions were wrong. Since then, I have cut off all communication with my ex, but my girlfriend is still jealous, and constantly thinks I am talking to her, or some other girl. Trust is a major need for me in a relationship, and I don't know if I can keep this relationship alive without her trusting me 100%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo summarize, my girlfriend and I are having issues getting along, and seem to be constantly fighting over little stuff. The core of the argument always comes down to either her being jealous of someone else, or me not loving her enough. I am always in the wrong, and there is always something wrong with what I am doing or how I am doing it. I have made mistakes in the past, but have apologized and changed my actions, but that has not changed her stance on the issues. I am tired of constantly fighting, and even though we have talked about it, nothing seems to ever be resolved because we just bring it up later in another fight. But, she loves me very much, and I believe she honestly wants the best for us, and would be absolutely devastated if we broke up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWITBTA if I broke up with her because of the above issues?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST :  I know the title makes me sound like a jerk but hear me out (also I do think I was being kind of a jerk). Around the seventh grade I met this kid in my History class. We talked and at first I thought he was a pretty cool dude to hang out with. He was nice to me, never really made fun of me unlike almost everyone else at my school. So the year goes on and I'm sitting with this kid every single day. We talked about normal idiotic seventh grader stuff and had a bunch of fun. But over time, I started to realize that this kid was not what I thought him to be at first. I started to realize that he was kind of a jerk. And I also realized that he was slowly  ruining my friendships with the very few friends I had. Of course, it took me about a year and a half to finally realize this. He would always act like it was the biggest deal ever when I left him for another class I had to go to and did not spend an extra thirty seconds to talk to him. And then when I came back to him at lunch, he would proceed to get mad at me for leaving him, and then make fun of me and humiliate me the entire lunch. Rinse and repeat. For the next one and a half years. I felt trapped in a never ending cycle that I was now too scared to try to get out of. Anytime I was talking with someone else, he would walk up to me, trying to hold back his anger and act normal (because there was someone else there too) and tell me nicely \"Hey, lets go to lunch\" (or something along those lines) which was code for, \"Get away from him and come sit with me, idiot.\" So my life sucked and I was feeling pretty depressed because of it (or because it was middle school, I couldn't tell). Anyways, that was my life for the entire seventh grade and half of eighth grade. I should also mention that during that time I was sitting with him at lunch, I sat with no one else. There was no one else at our table. Just me and him and it sucked. Finally, I managed to leave him. For once, I didn't sit at that table and I sat with people I actually enjoyed being with. And then I continued doing that and I felt happy again. But the reason I think I was being kind of an asshole was because I never confronted him about it. I was basically too scared to talk to him face to face and say that I hated everything that he did to me and to never talk to me again. But he never did talk to me again so I'm pretty happy.

Neither of us drive - myself for medical reason and my son dad just never got their licence. I had been taking the bus with my son  down to my home town on long weekends and my son dad would pick him up from there this cost $300 for me and $25 for my son\u00b4s dad. My son\u00b4s dad very rarely came to pick him up and when he did there was a 6 hour delay between the bus getting in and the bus going back during which time my son\u00b4s dad would stay at my place, very uncomfortable for me, but I put up with it from my son.  \n\n\nThe issue is that my son\u00b4s dad rents a room in an apartment, this was supposed to be a temporary setup and they were supposed to move out within a few months - it is now going on 6 years.

First, I will try to give some backstory to fill in some information. I(26m) have been dating my (20f) girlfriend for around 4 months now, but we have known each other for just under a year. We have had our fair share of complications in these past 4 months, mainly dealing with trauma from both of our pasts but we we're always able to come to a conclusion and move forward. This bonding and the progress we made through conquering our own demons has brought us very close and I would like to clarify that I am not worried about her leaving me for the ex in question. This person is someone who emotionally and probably physically abused my gf (I was told that it came very close to being physical but I have not heard all of the details so this part is unclear. Was also told he would beat his mother...). My gf's mother told me in private that their family was very worried about my gf's safety and they thought they were going to lose her to this person. The entire family seems to feel the same way towards this ex.\n\nThis Monday my gf and some friends went on a vacation and on the first night got quite drunk/high. The whole night we were texting/calling. All of our conversations were very lovey dovey (lol) and very light hearted. On Tuesday she told me that she texted her ex because she wanted to check in on him, which I told her that I didn't think that this was a good idea because 1) why feel the need to text and ex and 2) a person who has caused so much harm to herself and her family. After some back and forth she told me she would tell him they can't talk anymore and \"fix things.\" Last night we talked on the phone and she told me they were texting all day and she told him they can't talk but he said no and that she can't just end things with someone who was such a large part of her life. I basically said that this is driving a wedge in our relationship and will cause things to fall a part, which she agreed. Not much else was said except that we would discuss things further tonight but it seems like things have come to an end.\n\nAfter speaking with some women in my life the census seems to be that I have not done anything wrong but I want your outside opinions. I feel, for lack of better words, that these decisions she is making are plain stupid and causing unnecessary collateral damage. Am I not being understanding of her past trauma?

She\u2019s been very sad, and I really do feel for her and his family, but at the same time I find myself some what emotionally distant from her. Not that I feel insecure that she had feelings for him, but that ultimately I hated this guy and can\u2019t match her feelings. \n\nI never knew him personally. The first time I ever heard about him was early on in our relationship when my fianc\u00e9 showed me messages he had sent her of him and his friend talking shit about me and trying to get her to hangout with them. I brushed it off as a jealous ex. Why wouldn\u2019t he feel anything but dislike for me?  The feeling was mutual.\n\nI fell quickly for my fianc\u00e9 and in the first year took her on a trip she had been wanting to go on for her birthday. In the middle of conversation at dinner, he calls and she answers. I felt extremely disrespected and we had a discussion about him. She told me all about how there were no feelings for him, that he used to hit her and pull her hair and threaten to come to her school and beat her up. I took her word and moved passed it, but not without new disdain for him. As time went by in our relationship, more details about him would come up here and there, none of them flattering.\n\nThen came the news of his OD. I\u2019ve been trying to be as supportive as possible of my fianc\u00e9, but I also feel torn and guilty. Deep down, I felt like if it had to happen to someone, who better than the druggie who put hands on my fianc\u00e9. I\u2019m not angry at her for feeling sad, but I do feel slightly confused and slightly distant. \n\nI never heard a single positive word from her or her family about him until his passing. She\u2019s been telling me and her friends about how he was a good guy. I do understand he must have had some great pain in his life, as I don\u2019t believe well adjusted people just casually get in to heroin, but I also feel a lack of sympathy and empathy from the way he\u2019s been framed for me all these years. \n\nLast night she was telling me again about how good of a guy he was and randomly mentioned how he never tried to get between us. I had finally had enough, not in an angry way, but I calmly reminded her of how that wasn\u2019t true and that this was the man who hit her and threatened her. She told me that wasn\u2019t true and that he had only ever pulled her hair and started explaining that by saying she had made him angry. Lies of him hitting her aside, I still said that\u2019s no excuse for him putting his hands on you. I told her I didn\u2019t care for him and it made her even more upset. \n\nAITA for being distant and not feeling anything from his passing?", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\n\nSome background on the situation:\n\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\n\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\n\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\n\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\n\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\n\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit?

It's their money after all. \n\nAnyways, I find that the flight itself is quite miserable; delayed (of course, so w/e), I catch the flu, sleep for about 4 hours out of the 15 hour flight, and found that the airline has Australian power outlets that I don't have an adapter for, etc. Minor stuff I suppose, but I complain about it with my mother and step dad as they're picking me up.\n\nThe step-dad tells me that I'm acting like a 2 year old, that I'm making my mother feel guilty about the flight, and that if I hated it here so much I can grab a hotel nearby and fly back to CA tomorrow.

For context, we are both currently 22, and have been together for almost 3 months.\n\nI met my girlfriend summer of 2014, when we were in our second year of uni. We've been good friends since, and really close in 2018. Eventually, that closeness gave way to feelings and we became official in August. Now in my eyes, the honeymoon phase lasted all of about 18 hours, when we had our first 'dealbreaker' argument. From then on, it's been periods of really high highs, and extremely low lows. We fought on average once every other day, and fights always went like this: she berates me relentlessly for 2 hours (insults, swears, the whole shebang), and after that point, she'll either calm down enough that I can finally talk her through it, or she'll decide she doesn't care enough anymore and just leave me feeling attacked and unresolved. Either way, not a great feeling. Anyways, I stuck it out because I was trying to see the big picture and I thought that we could have a really strong future together. \n\nA month in, I went off for vacation with my buddies (without her, cause we planned it way in advance) and that was our first real time apart. I, in another country in the Caribbeans, still did my dutiful role of keeping in touch, reporting what I was doing, etc., so she wouldn't worry. I know this behavior isn't normal of a trusting relationship but she has intense trust issues from past periods, and I told myself it'd be worth it. When I got back, we got a little reckless because of how much we missed each other and decided that it would be okay to go unprotected. It obviously wasn't, and she ended up getting pregnant. Except I didn't know that. I know I'm an asshole for this stuff so far, not practicing safe sex, being neglectful of her condition, emotions, etc., but we fought relentlessly for the next few weeks. I thought she was just stressed because she had certification exams and that she was just lashing out at me, but it was the conception and the emotional swings that follow. Since I didn't know, I took it out as her unreasonably lashing out at me, and I just dealt with her mood swings while slowly losing feelings. I had my own exam and full-time job to worry about and honestly I just didn't know what to do.\n\nSo after 3 weeks, I broke it off on a Friday. No contact on the weekend. I gotta admit. I missed her like crazy and that slight time apart made me realize how much of a mistake I made and that I wanted to try again, if she'll have me. On Monday, she tells me she's pregnant and sends me pictures of the pregnancy tests. And I can tell she's panicking. So I do everything I can to let her know whatever she needs, I'll be there for. and I didn't mean just clinic visits, appointments, consultations, whatever. I meant everything. Emotional needs, etc.\n\nWe ended up getting back together a week later and the abortion happened the following week. After having broken up, obviously our relationship was on shakey ground but I was determined to try and get back to what we had before, or something better/stronger. She continued to lash out at me nightly, because of her pregnancy mood swings, or following the procedure. And I took all of it like a sponge and always bounced back and continued being that stoic, steadfast guy she can rely on. It wasn't enough though; it didn't meet what she was expecting out of me, saying I was acting too much like it wasn't even happening but honestly, I didn't want to ask her \"How are you feeling emotionally?\" about the pregnancy or the abortion because I didn't want to bring her mind back to it, or I thought I could lift her up by just talking about things like normal.\n\nRegardless, here's my life outside of her:\n\n* I work a full-time job, 9-5, that is quite stressful due to understaffed, underpaid, and just poor leadership.\n* I commute 3 hours in a day. 1.5 each way.\n* I have a major certification exam December 1st, which I am really behind on\n* My parents are going through medical issues, and I am almost never there for them cause when I'm not studying, I have to be with my girlfriend.\n\nI say when I'm not studying, I have to be with her, but lately, I haven't even been able to study because the time I allot to studying (9pm - 12:30am at night before I sleep and get ready to wake up at 6:30am for work) is always filled with trying to talk her out of whatever twisted plot she thought up in her emotional state. I've been dealing with this since before she got pregnant. PMSing, just general fights over the smallest things, they always happened at night and she'd EXPECT me to stay up until we resolve it (if you recall, us resolving it relies on how long it takes for her to become rational again). and honestly, she says she feels guilty cause she knows I have to study. but what can I do? I tell her not to feel guilty, cause I do care, I do have feelings, I don't want her to be alone, the situation is 100% my responsibility, and I'm the one asking her how she's doing, etc, offering to drive to her on the weekend when I should be non-stop cramming. I don't know how much longer I can do that for. I have 21 days left until my exam. I lost 4 nights of studying this week because she always starts going off at me at 10 PM, when I just settle down and start trying to study. My mom went in for a cancer screening appointment (I think), and I have no idea how that's going cause I'm so occupied with other things that I feel like I'm losing sight of things I shouldn't.\n\nI have no idea what to do. I started smoking again, I'm not studying enough, I'm losing my sense of self and am just generally depressed all the time unless I'm with friends or at the gym. I lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks despite not changing how much I eat or lift.\n\nThis morning, she fell and twisted her ankle and had to go to the hospital instead of work. I just don't feel like I can do anything to hurt her emotionally right now, but I'm really suffering too. I'm not equating my problems and emotions to hers. But I don't like feeling like I have to pretend my problems or emotions don't exist.\n\nI don't complain about a single thing she asks of me. I don't complain when she gets emotional with me. I don't complain about any of my unhealthy coping mechanisms. But she lashes out saying I created a space where she feels like she can't share how she feels with me. That I act uninvolved.\n\nTo everybody that read all that, thank you so much. I know there may be controversy because of abortion, but for context again, we are 22 years old, freshly graduated young professionals with conservative parents. We made a mistake. Extremely preventable if I had been more responsible, but the responsibility isn't all mine.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I just left her in the middle of everything she's going through?

However, i think about this from time to time and wonder if i was the asshole in this situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family's cat is an outdoor cat and has been living peacefully, albeit a few skirmishes with the cat across the street now and then, in the neighborhood for as long as i can remember. Our new neighbors had just moved in from the countryside and brought with them their own cat which is a pretty big cat, slightly bigger than mine, but much younger and more territorial.  At first, it was okay and thought it would be another situation with the other cat across the street, but it turned much worse than i could have imagined. My cat is old and has been through some stuff, a stitched up stomach due to it being cut open after him being stuck under a fence and an almost lost ear from his glory days along with other small tweaks but still has some fight in him. After a few weeks, i start hearing cat fights almost nightly and i would go out and pick up my cat and clear up the fights since i was a light sleeper and my family doesn't hear it that often. I lost sleep but whatever, cats gotta cat. However, one night, there was a louder than normal cat fight and i could hear my cat moaning very distinctly. i rush out and he's on the ground with the other cat circling him and runs off once i rush at him and i take my cat back inside. There's blood all around my cat's stomach and my cat doesn't look good so i do my best to patch him up and my dad takes him in the first thing in the morning to the vet for emergency and he's all stitched up but he's pretty weak when he returns so we keep him inside. The other cat got more and more confident and would stalk outside my house and patio and would get in a face-off with my cat through the windows. We started limiting my cat's outside hours for when we're home and shut him in when it's night. The other cat gets wise to this and sneaks in through my kitty door even when we're home or when the person watching the house runs off for errands and they to get in catfights indoors, whilst scratching up our floors and furniture and eating his food. One night I forgot to close it up and again, another ensuring catfight inside my house, and my cat is hurt badly again. At that moment I suggested to my dad we take the cat and move him away. He agrees, and throughout the week, we tried to lure the cat into our house and finally got him. We took the cat to an affluent neighborhood and let him loose. Few days later, little girl comes to our door and asks if we've seen their cat lately and we say no. That cat cost us thousands in vet bills and I switch from feeling like an asshole to being justified in the decision even today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Neighborhood cat is way territorial and my cat can't compete.

I've been lurking on this sub for a while and have been wanting to ask this for a while because I still feel bad about it.\n\nSo, context. I (22F) had been dating my boyfriend (28M) for about 3 years, basically since I started college. We got to know each other and were flirting back when I was still in high school, before making it official when I was a bit into college. It was long distance; I went to college about 2.5 hours away from his home. Despite seeing each other only once a week, it was a pretty great relationship. We were really built on trust and communication, and it was perhaps the first time I was really in love.\n\nFast forward to this past December. He came to visit my family, and while he was here, was talking about a big YouTube animation project he was working on. He was very excited about it, telling my parents about it, even showing us a few episodes. One of the things he said was that he was a voice actor for this project, and played a specific character. After he left, my sister made a comment that it didn\u2019t sound like his voice. I listened a few times. Sure enough, it wasn\u2019t. Cue spiraling, \u201cwas any of it real\u201d questioning myself, and a depression nap. I knew he was dealing with something at home, so I waited until he was done and sent him a message like \u201cWe need to talk\u201d or something. We had a Skype call that was very tearful on both ends where I explained what\u2019d happened and why it\u2019d upset me. He told me that it was a mistake, he really had thought he\u2019d gotten the part, and when he realized that he didn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t correct himself. I told him I needed a couple days to think about it and our relationship.\n\nSo I realized a few things: he\u2019d met my parents several times but I still hadn\u2019t met his (though in fairness they live in Australia right now), most of our mutual friends were my friends (I had met his friends once for a D&amp;D game), and that both of those things are probably because we live so far apart. In the Skype call I told him I was breaking up with him because I couldn\u2019t do long distance anymore. He was really shocked. Our relationship had been going so amazing and this was the first big problem we\u2019d had, and it was because of one dumb little mistake it had fallen apart. I assured him it wasn\u2019t because of the lie but the distance.\n\nApparently, he has an anxiety problem where he thinks one little mistake will make everything come crashing down, and me breaking up with him will just contribute to that. Right after our breakup he was really depressed and had to seek a counselor again. So, I\u2019m here to ask: AITA for leaving my boyfriend after our first big problem? (Sidenote: I probably won\u2019t change my decision since our breakup is three months out, I just want to know if I\u2019m the asshole.)\n\nTL;DR: Bf of 3 years accidentally lied about a project he worked on, I broke up with him after this even though it was our first real argument \u201cbecause of the distance,\u201d AITA?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

She had just come out of a relationship when we started talking and the guys she dated dumped her for another girl. We eventually hooked up and decided to start dating, but it was really low key. I began to notice she was acting much more distant two weeks ago and I talked to her about it. She basically came out to me and said she still had feelings for her ex. I honestly did not want to make her feel bad and told her that I was sorry and if she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with this relationship it was fine. The thing is after she broke up with me and she said she wanted to remain as friends. I tried to accept this and did not want to make her feel bad so I still talked to her as a friend. I eventually couldn\u2019t deal with the emotional pain and I told her that and I said I couldn\u2019t keep talking to her because of the emotional strain I felt when I talked to her. I honestly really fell for her and talking to her knowing that she was not looking for a relationship hurt me a lot. She became really angry after I told her this and called me out on her story to which i told her I still loved her, but it was too hard for me to deal with the relationship. She still sent me a message afterward asking if I was snap chatting one of her friends who I had a streak with and I told her that it was just a streak. She said ok and I didn\u2019t want to make her jealous or feel uncomfortable, so I ended the streak with her friend. Today, she messaged me saying that her \u201cfriend\u201d said that I asked her out, I told her that it was completely false and we had not talked in two days. I even showed her our chat history, she then told me that she needed to tell me something. She told me she started to talk to her ex again who had dumped her. I was obviously conflicted and just said \u201cWhatever floats your boat\u201d and then I removed her as a friend on Snapchat because I felt like shit.

POST : So first time posting to this subreddit, hope I do it right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been friends with this one girl for a good year at least now. Me and her are pretty close, we talk a lot in the lessons we share together, but we aren't exactly the type of friends who are close enough to share our deepest secrets. From what I can tell, she doesn't really know what a lot of common slang used here on the internet means, and I usually end up explaining to her what certain words/phrases that I use mean, which I'm okay with.\n\nSo earlier today I was in a hallway with her, just chatting about random things, when she brings up that she is really popular with one of the classes of students, students that just so happen to be 2 years younger than us. Now, that's fine, there's literally nothing wrong with that, so I jokingly said something along the lines of: \"Ha, you absolute nonce.\"\n\nShe kinda just looks at me with a confused expression on her face. Turns out she didn't actually know what it meant. She asked me what it meant but I wasn't really sure how to put it into words without sounding really weird, and because I'm awkward when it comes to social interactions I didn't want to ruin the conversation, so I told her to go and ask someone else. \n\nShe went to go and ask someone else about it, and I just stood there waiting for her to get back, cause I didn't really have anything better to do. After about 3 minutes she comes back, but doesn't even look at me.\n\nShe then grabs her pencil case and hit me over the head. Hard. \n\nI'm just kinda stood there, completely in shock and trying to process what just happened, since it seemed to out-of-character for her. She then says something along the lines of \"Don't call me that. Ever.\"\n\nWe kinda just stood at separate ends of the hallway for a while, until we could go to our lessons.\n\nIt wasn't until later in the day when I saw her again did I try asking her about it. Our conversation lasted a while and was a little long, before she just decided to simply stop talking to me, so I'll try to summarise it: she didn't like me using the word nonce because it shouldn't be something you should joke about.\n\nI get that you shouldn't joke about paedophiles, but I've never seen the term nonce used in an unironic way. I struggled to try and explain to her what I was going for, while trying to apologise, but she hardly seemed to listen.\n\nNow, I'm the type of person who hates it when they hurt someone, or do something that gets someone in trouble, it keeps me up all night. She knows this, but she's still refusing to talk to me. I also really don't want to lose her as a friend, since I don't really have very many, and I try my best to stay close the ones I have.\n\nI didn't want to hurt anybody, but was I still a jerk?

A few weeks ago we had to call the police to make a mental health arrest because she was screaming hysterically about her husband that died three years ago. While she was in the hospital she kept saying she wanted to kill herself. I talked to her for an hour about how important she is to me, our family. How impactful her life was to others. Still, she kept saying her life wasn't worth living. I notified my chain of command (in the army btw). I was ready to take emergency leave from work to support her in court. Then my sister calls me and tells me she was drunk the entire time. She 'snapped out of it' and didn't remember anything that happen. Ok fine, we wrote it off as a drunken rage. She promised not to do it again. \n\nShe did it again not even a week later. She calls me, asks me how my day is and says in this childish voice 'I don't want to live anymore'. We go through the same thing. An hour passes, I tell her how important she is to so many people, and how valuable life is. I go through all of this just for her to say 'thats alright, I still don't want to live anymore' and she hangs up. I was livid. I called her the next day to tell her that she needed to stop drinking and to see a psychiatrist. She promised to do both. As of my writing this post, she has not.\n\nToday, she starts questioning me about whether or not America is safe. Whether or not we would go to war with Russia. Literally the weirdest, most random possible shit. She says 'if you tell me right now America is safe I will be fine with that'. I tell her the truth. I don't know. It's not really my job to think about things like that. I'm not a big picture policy person, I literally fix computers and go home. She gets upset and says 'Well, that's fine, I guess I'll just go to sleep knowing we could be nuked tomorrow'. And she hangs up.

She's my org mate and I tried to understand she couldn't help with the Valentine's sale because she's ill and I actually wanted her to rest and feel better, so I took over all her work yesterday.

It was empty, totally warm, and had nothing on it to indicate  ownership. Usually people leave things out to give them away for free, usually clothes, canned food, and college textbooks. Sometimes furniture (large objects are removed after 24h if left in public.)  In orientation we're warned to lock our rooms, and never leave things out, because there's no enforcement for lost goods, so you should keep them in your dorm. Every semester there's tons of theft at the beginning of the semester, there are also no cameras at all in the dorms except for the exit and entrance. So imagine my surprise when at 10:00 pm housing and police are going door to door searching for the refrigerator I'd taken.\n\n At 12:30pmish when I got back from lunch it was in that lobby. At  8:30pm I put it in my room. Just before ten people are going door to door  knocking, no one in my hall answered the door except me, so I didn't  know what it was about til they mentioned a fridge. I explained it was  left out, apologize for the confusion and carry it back to the other guy, and even apologize to him in person. He nods, and says not to worry about it at all.  I told my RA if I saw anything left out  that might be valuable I'd ask him to take custody of it, and if he is  able to find out if it was intended to be given away, then I could claim  it. Everyone is happy that the situation is resolved so easily, I feel  bad as I know how it can feel to feel like a victim of a crime. Housing  RA had told me that the guy said he was rearranging his room, and needed  to clear the space up, and that it'd sounded wierd to him too. Director of housing then gives me information about renting a fridge through the campus, cool! \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the police knock on my door again. They then ask me privately if I'm sure it was out that long, as the other student had claimed he put it out at 6pm sharp, and that it was gone when he checked soon after. They stress that it doesn't matter anymore, because I'd returned the item and the other student had left happily, but that it was bothering them. I repeat my version of events and the officer leaves thanking me for my cooperation.  \n\n\n First of all, why'd you wait 3 and a half hours to report it if it disappeared at 6 pm.   Secondly,  Why are the housing reps, and police relaying different stories to me, last it feels like he wanted  the police to feel that  was a malicious theft, based on the short time window.  He then told  the police he it was \"for his buddy\" and indicated he'd  immediately leave the campus with it in his vehicle. I told the police that it at least makes sense  he left it out because he was giving it away, it was on a trolley in a  public walkway right by the elevators for hours. He had just planned to  give it away to someone specific, and left it ready for several hours apparently.\n\nI On the bright side, the guy  was very happy after he got his refrigerator back and dropped the issue  entirely, so there won't be any official repercussions.

TLDR at the bottom. \n\n     So about 5 years ago, I got a dog. She is a pit mix. Superrr well behaved, and super friendly to everyone and everything. At the time, I was living at my parents house. I ended up moving away for about a year. And in that time, my parents  let my little sister get a rottweiler. My dad was super against it. Because he knew my sister would end up just not taking care of it. But my mom let her get it anyways. And of course, that's exactly what ended up happening.  She pretty much moved out a year later. All her stuff if still here, but she only stays here like one or two nights a month, and it's been that way for years. She does absolutely nothing to take cars of this dog, and never really has. My parents do.\n\n      I moved back about a year later. And at first? The dogs were fine. We also had one more little dog, a martese. As well as two cats. As time went on, my sister dog became more and more aggressive towards the other animals in the house. I said from the very beginning that if her dog starts trying to hurt all the other animals? It needs to go. Because it's not fair to all the other animals. I went on a 2 week vacation, to come home and find out that my parents rehomed MY two cats, because apparently my sisters dog had gotten violent with them, and tried to kill both of them. I was fucking livid. But there was nothing I could do about it..\n\n     About a month later? My sisters dog starts straight attacking my dog at every chance she can get. To the point where they absolutely cannot have any contact whatsoever. My sisters dog is a lot bigger , and could easily kill mine. Especially because my dog doesn't fight back. She is not aggressive at alllll. She has never been the instigator. We have to have a huge gate in the middle of our house to seperate them. And it's just a huge pain in the ass. All it will take it one person leaving the gate open, or mindlessly letting one of the dogs in the back without checking to make sure the other one is inside, to start a fight. That's either going to end in my dog dead, or a huge vet bill I will be responsible for. And ever sense my sisters dog started attacking mine, it has caused her to be so scared of other dogs. When she used to love other dogs. I can tell it's really had an effect on my dog. Any time she starts to run around and play, my sisters dog goes into instant attack mode, growling and trying to break down the gate. So now my dog is scared of playing in her own damn house. \n\n      The last stray just happened. Last week, while I was staying the night at a friends house, apperently my sisters dog attacked and KILLED our other maltese. So obviously, I told my family, that this is fucking bullshit. My sisters dog is really sweet when it comes to humans, but not animals. Obviously she is a danger to my dog. And it's not fair that my dog has to live in terror. It's not fair that both of our cats had to be ripped from their home because of her. It's not fair that our other dog just got KILLED for no fucking reason. I reccomend rehoming her to sombody who doesn't have any animals. And my sister FLIPPED the fuck out on me. Saying it's my dog that should go. And its \"not fair\" that my dog would get to stay.  My parents don't really have much to say about it. They try to avoid confrontation. But now my sister is super mad at me. Am I the asshole? \n\n\nTLDR- I got a dog, &amp; moved out of my parents house. When I moved back a yr later my sister had got a dog. She doesn't take care of the dog. She doesn't even live at home anymore w/ the dog. The dog is VERY aggressive to my dog. To the point of them needing to be separated at all times. My parents got rid of my 2 cats because her dog tried to kill them, instead of getting rid of her dog. Then her dog killed our maltese. I said we should re home her dog to sombody who dosent have any other animals. And my sister flipped out on me.

Back during Christmas she left me while we visited my dad's side of my family. A week later we made up and she announced our engagement. She had been feeling unwell and we found out she was pregnant. I'm nervous and unsure about wanting to be a father buy I've told her I will support her. I've been struggling with depression a lot, I think as a result of her leaving me back in December and my medication no longer working for me. I've started hanging put with friends 4 times a week because seeing my fiancee stresses me out. \n\nLately I have not been able to care about us as much as I want to. She's repeatedly bossed me around and told me that I should sleep early or eat better because it will help me. She has tried repeatedly to make me see my psychiatrist, but I'm busy. She struggles from depression and she functions differently. I just wish to be alone right now, so I traveled out to see my mom and I've been staying at her place for a week. Last night my fiancee called to say she felt very depressed and she was afraid she would hurt herself. I was angry and told my mom how I felt. She said that my fiancee was being selfish and needed to back off because she was trying to manipulate me. I decided to call her and see what was wrong. She pretty much told me that she was very depressed and needed me to come back home. I told her I needed to think about it some more. \n\nThis morning she texted me and told me that I needed me to come home and start doing things to fix our relationship or she would leave. I told her she was being selfish and she was only pushing me farther away. About an hour later she called me and I  was ignoring her because I was out getting dinner with my mom. She called my mom thirty minutes later and I told my mom to ignore her too. Eventually she messaged my mom and asked her to tell me to please give her a call. My mom was mad at my fiancee and she told her I needed some time to be alone and I would come home when I was stronger and such.\n\n My mom also told her that she was making this all about herself and being selfish because I have a right to spend time away from her if I need it. Because my mom has been supportive of me seeking time away from my fiancee, my fiancee accused her of \"setting me up to fail\". When I lived with my mother I had a history of sleeping in during the day and going out at night. My mother was the same, it is how I was raised and I trust her because she also suffers from depression. I know my mother would never do that and she was outraged that my fiancee would accuse her of being a poor parent. She told my fiancee to fuck off and that she would make a terrible mother to our child. I was also outraged that my fiancee would accuse my mother of being a bad mother. I've decided that I will ignore her for the time being. I'm very depressed and I do not want to talk to her or even think about her. Tonight I'm spending the night watching a movie with my mom.

We share common areas (kitchen, living room) but have our own individual rooms and two separate bathrooms (roommate A shares a bathroom with roommate B, and roommates C and D share a bathroom).\n\nI keep my individual room somewhat clean. It gets messy every now and then, but I always make a point to pick up and not let it get too far, especially since when I\u2019m home, my room is my chosen place to hang out.\n\nRoommates C and D spend all of their time in the living room, and it shows. The coffee table is constantly covered in their items/things that they\u2019ve used, and the couches often have their various clothing items on them.\n\nLast semester, myself and Roommate B always made it a habit to clean at least twice a month. Everyone is supposed to help out with the common areas, and the bathrooms are by discretion of those sharing them. Roommate C has always made it a point to do the least amount possible, if anything at all. Halfway through the semester, it became clear that only myself and Roommate B were doing the cleaning, for areas that, though common, were rarely used by us.\n\nOnce this semester started, I talked to both Roommates C &amp; D individually, and asked them to help out more, especially since it was primarily their mess. Plus, I\u2019ve lived with them before without Roommate B, so I thought it\u2019d be more effective coming from me. They said they would, but have not at all.\n\nSince then, I have made it a point to only clean up after myself and Roommate B if she hasn\u2019t done so already. That means that I only do my or Roommate B\u2019s dishes (or clean items that belong to me). I only pick up trash that may have been left by me or roommate B. This unfortunately means that we live in a garbage heap. The coffee table was covered in old takeout containers, food that was made last week is still sitting in a pot on the kitchen table, and there were at least 5 bags of garbage sitting by the door waiting to be taken out.\n\nRoommates C and D have stopped talking to me or even acknowledging me ever since it\u2019s been clear I\u2019ve only really been cleaning up after myself. They only started talking to me again when I broke down and deep cleaned the shared areas of the apartment because people were coming over and it\u2019s honestly embarrassing (to me) to live like that, and especially to have new friends see that.\n\nAm I in the wrong here for only cleaning mine and occasionally Roommate B\u2019s stuff? I didn\u2019t sign up to parent my friends, or be their maid, but I also don\u2019t feel like I should have to live like this, and we all live here so there should be some shared responsibility. I choose not to use the common areas as much as the others, so I don\u2019t mind cleaning it occasionally, but repeatedly cleaning up after the people who use it the most only to have them turn around and make it messy again less than a day later also doesn\u2019t seem right.", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

So he's talking whilst chewing and smacking his lips and pausing to swallow and take another bite, etc. He *never* does this in-person, but for some reason he does it a lot via Marco Polo.\n\nI think I'm a good communicator, so we've talked about it. I've let him know that it irks me. He's heard me, but he keeps doing it. I've gone from politely explaining that it's a personal pet peeve of mine and asking him to stop as a favour/compromise for a friend - to straight up yelling at him to stop being gross.\n\nI finally snapped the other day when we were in a group chat with him and my wife and he was doing it again. So when I finished his message, I responded by stating that I refuse to acknowledge or respond to anything he says while he's eating. I'd *previously* sent a much harsher message but I deleted it, and I'm pretty sure he didn't see it - but my wife did and she thought it was way overboard, and thought my altered version wasn't much better. Which led to this post.\n\nI get that it's a personal pet peeve of mine. I get that it's my problem and not his.

I used to be good at asking people how we will split up the work and trusting them to do their share of the work but now it's getting harder for me to do that and not just go ahead and do some of the work everyday and chip away at the project as a whole.\nThere have been too many partners that wait till the last minute (sometimes this is literal). For example I had a paper due monday that was assigned on Friday. One of my partners said he'll set up the doc that day so we could work on it but the next day, nothing. So I set up the doc. I asked one of my partners if it was cool if I did a certain section and when he said yes I did it pronto. I waited till nighttime for someone to do another (this was Saturday btw) and when there was nothing I did a bit more and a bit more in the morning (Sunday) when there was still nothing added by my partners. At this point a good chunk of the paper was done by me and it was only in the afternoon did I get a text saying how I did a lot. A part of me wanted to say you never told me what you were gonna do so I figured I would do a bit more since I had time to do it. A part of me wanted to apologise.\nI don't tell the teachers about me doing a lot of the project because my partners may have legitimate reasons they didn't work on it. I just don't want to risk hurting my grade when I know I can work on the project. So am I the asshole for not trusting my partners to do their share and eventually doing some (or a lot) of the work for them?\nTldr: I chip away at group projects when none of my partners have worked on it and eventually most of the work is mine.

POST : This is very fresh and something I've been pining all over all day long because I honestly feel like shit how I acted. Thursday night is the big \"party\" night in our college town so a group of friends (all girls and our gay friend) went out to a club. We managed to secure a table in the back which is awesome because we had a place to sit down between dancing as well as set down our drinks.\n\nWe'd been sitting down for about an hour when the most obnoxious group of five or six guys sat down next to us. I can't even describe them because they didn't neatly fit into any one stereotype but they started getting super crude with us the moment they sat down. Some of the \"greatest hits\" of the night were telling our gay friend \"don't stare at my ass or you'll lose teeth,\" telling me \"you'd be fuckable if you smiled\" and finally openly groping on of my other friends. Of course this stretched on for about an hour and they spilled several drinks, screamed, fist pumped, wrestled around like children and were just generally obnoxious. When they groped my friend, I went and got the bouncers who also got the police and kicked all of them out. \n\nAs they were leaving one of the guys came over and literally passed me a hand written note. I told him to go fuck himself. He said \"please read it\" and turned to walk away. I told him again to go fuck himself and threw the note on the floor. He told me that he was sorry for the whole night and turned to leave. I tapped him on the shoulder as the bouncer was behind him and told him once again what shit I thought he was. At that point he left. \n\nAs a joke one of my friends picked up the note and we thought we'd have a big laugh reading it. When we unfolded it, it had two $20 bills also folded on the inside. The handwriting was hard to read but best I can make out it says:\n\n\"Hey I'm so sorry for the way my cousin and his friends acted tonight. I am embarrassed beyond words. I am new to town and don't have many friends so I decided to see what the town is like. I will never make this mistake again. Please treat your friends to a couple drinks on me. PS. I think you have a great smile.\" \n\nHe didn't leave a number or anything so this wasn't some lame attempt to neg or hit on me and I truly think he was just trying to be nice and make up for his \"friends.\" I feel like shit for not only telling him to fuck off but not letting him leave with his dignity intact but also throwing his note on the ground. \n\nAm I the asshole here or did I just react to what I thought the situation was?", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

Growing up, I saw GG once every few months and never enjoyed the visits.

POST : My sister and I went to an arcade where all your tickets for prizes and gaming credits are loaded onto a card. The problem was that each new card that is created has a $5 activation fee and so my sister suggested that we share a card so we only have to pay one activation fee. That made sense since we were going to stick around each other anyways, so we got one card and loaded it with gaming credits and started to play games in the arcade. Most of the games my sister played were games that did not give tickets such as Dance Dance Revolution while I solely played games that gave tickets. Once all our gaming credits were gone we had 2000 tickets to spend on prizes. My sister and I couldn\u2019t find a prize we both wanted so I said since she paid for half of the card and I paid for the other half, she can spend 1000 tickets while I spend the other 1000. I decided to get a rock salt lamp for 950 tickets but my sister wanted to spend 1,500 tickets on a giant llama plushie. She wanted to use some of my tickets and argued she wanted the llama plushie a lot more than I wanted the rock salt lamp, which is probably true since she made a big deal about how much she loved the llama while I just got the rock salt lamp cause I thought it was cool. That being said, that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t want the rock salt lamp. I told her no we\u2019re not getting the llama and that we were going to split the tickets in half evenly. Plus, she could get a normal sized llama plushie for 700 tickets and still have some leftover for something else. She didn\u2019t like that I said no so she then brought an employee over and asked them whether or not we should get her the giant llama (thank goodness the employee didn\u2019t view it as a nuisance, he was very kind and just laughing at the whole situation). The employee asked for my side of the problem and I told him my sister and I should split the tickets in half evenly so it\u2019s fair but my sister told the employee to think of the emotional aspect of it: a giant llama is going to make her a lot happier than rock salt lamp is going to make me. The employee then said he agreed with me and so I started walking to the cashier to redeem my prizes. My sister kept trying to block me from getting to the cashier and then said \u201cYou\u2019d get me the giant llama if you loved me,\u201d so I said \u201cI guess I don\u2019t love you then\u201d \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af since I definitely was not getting her the giant llama.

POST : Throwaway because people at work are reddit fiends. \n\nPrologue:\nI live at the corner unit of a town home building that has pretty thin walls. Thin enough to sometimes hear a neighbor snoring when he is sleeping in another room, which is not the master bedroom. I soundproofed the whole downstairs, just did not get to the 2nd floor yet. This is how the layout works in our building so atleast the master bedrooms don't share the same wall. Recently got a new neighbor. Guy that is around my age: late 20s or early 30s. Super nice guy that says hello and smiles everyday. He is a pretty good neighbor only had 2 parties in the 3 months he has lived here and he is pretty respectful about ending the party around midnight. \n\nLet's jump in. \n\nSaturday 11:30pm.\nMe and my wife are getting back after a night out. Pulling into our street we see around 5-7 German cars parked all around the street. We know already based on the past our boy is having a party. Cool. We love it, as we like to host many parties in the summer ourselves and are pretty cool with a younger neighbor that will not mind us when we turn up the music, ect. \n\nLike always the party ended around 12:15. Respect. I can tell the guests were pretty hammered due to constantly falling on the walls, shutting the door loud as fuck, ect. That's cool. I get it. We stay up till around 2am watching Netflix. I fall asleep. \n\n4AM:\n\"Wake up, I think I'm going to call the cops.\" My wife wakes me up with this phrase all of a sudden and I right away think somebody is trying to break in. Not a cool line to wake somebody up with imp. My wife explains to me the neighbor has been yelling at his wife and cursing her out in Russian for the last hour while I was sleeping. (My wife is not Russian but can understand a lot of it, enough to make out he was saying \"this is all your fault you suka\" , which is bitch is English. She also heard super loud thuds/noises throughout the whole upstairs. (Not sure if stuff is being throw, but what we assumed is aggressive fighting going at it from room to room. My wife described it that is sounded like he dragged her from room to room, she kept on trying to run away. \n\nI start hearing the thuds as well as the yelling and crying. My wife told me she is getting anxiety just listening to this and Def can't sleep at all. \n\nWe call the police to do a check up right away. (If nothing dangerous is occurring, it's a simple check up. 3 minutes in we hear the police come by and everything gets quiet. \n\nThen it hits me about 2 weeks ago I specifically placed my Arlo WiFi camera to face my street because a neighbor kept leaving annoying notes on my car about our association's parking which is another story. Right away I turn on live mode. Bam: we got front row seats to this. Grab the popcorn. We see 2 squad cars right in front. It looks like they are just the back up as the cops parked across from each other so they can chat with the windows down. There are more cars due to the lighting in the street and I'm pretty sure there is an ambulance as well because the street is lit up way too well (scene lights, there is always an ambulance dispatched to a domestic violence call) but we can't see anything due to the camera cutting off the view. \n\nA few seconds in we see the girl with her girlfriend and a suitcase leaving the driveway and getting out of the cameras view. Everything gets quiet. \n\nWhat I thought initially was that maybe he just got too drunk and they will take him in overnight until he sobers up, which is pretty common in domestic calls like that. \n\nThe thing is. My neighbor never came back. His car has not moved since Saturday night and is all frozen snowed in. Not a peep from the unit. It's Wed now. \n\nSo not sure what really happened could be a couple things. \n\n1. He is a  Eastern European dude with a pretty strong accent so we were thinking he might not even have papers. It's a far stretch, but it's pretty common for where we live in the U. S. Among the European population. We are Europeans ourselves. \n\n2. Perhaps police found some drugs after the party I don't know, but I am aware what happens at European parties like that and it's very plausible. \n\nObviously I don't think I am a complete asshole for calling the cops but there is no way I would stand for domestic abuse at that level and hey if nothing was wrong the gf would deny all accusations and I'm sure the only thing that would happen is he would be locked away for a night to sober up and it would have been just documented. \n\nWe are just wondering honestly what happened and I thought I'd share it with the internet. He only has 2 neighbors and obviously one of us called. I don't really care if he finds out that it's me. I will update if I find out anything new. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

My wife and I are of different nationalities, and whereas she is still religious--in the sense she'll go on the holidays--I do not believe in God although I was raised and confirmed Catholic. (This isn't a religious debate so please keep that in mind). I was forced to go to weekly mass (at a Catholic school) and complete all the religious sacraments even though I told my parents, from a young age, that I don't believe in God. This belief was solidified over the years following so many things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my wife and I got married, she kept her last names and I was fine with that, but there was the question of whose last name would the kids takeI love my wife dearly but I just couldn't see myself going through life with my children having two last names (I really don't know how to explain this one. I used to think that I'd be cool with pretty much whatever as long as my kids are healthy, but when the moment arrived there was something unexplainable to it). Probably very American of me, but it just didn't sit right. I was/am fine with her not taking my last name but it felt too much to ask of me to that we do things her culture's way in regards to our kids--at least for this theme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter months and months of long discussions, we finally came to a compromise. Our kids would take my last name, but they would be baptized in her religion. This was fine with me because I don't believe in God and she's still semi-religious. Unlike most compromises, where both sides feel like they got a bit screwed, we both came away feeling like we each got a win. Fast-forward to the present. We have one child and another on the way. Recently she asked me about their baptism and I reminded her of our arrangement, and mentioned that the baptism is her responsibility. She knows of my beliefs and stance towards God and religion. So, she looked into it. It didn't take her long to come back with some info, but I again reminded her that if she wants our kids baptized it's her choice and responsibility and that I'm not in the picture for that one because of my beliefs, or lack thereof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, it turns out that not only do both parents have to be present for the baptism, but I would have to take religious classes because I'm not her religion. There are two parts, come to find out, about this baptismal process that I refuse to do because of what I believe. Taking classes. 2.) I genuinely cannot bring myself to stand up at an altar and answer a priest in the affirmative that Yes, I do give this child to the kingdom of God. To me, that would be like saying, Yes, I give my child to nothing. (She got this info from talking with her priest).\n\nNeither of us was aware of this process and we figured it was something she could do on her own. I won't do the classes, again, and I don't see myself up at the altar telling the priest that I give my child to God.

My husband is the only child to a single mother. My mother in law has a very limited social life (limited to her sister in law and extended family) and no hobbies to speak of, so she spends a vast majority of her free time at home.  \nIn 2016, after many years of trying, I finally obtained a permanent visa to live with my husband (and his mother) in his home country. I moved here in january of 2017 and during the new year 2017/18 my parents came here and spent a week with me and my husband at the beach. Now, me and my husband are not very social people, and our idea of a good time is sleeping in, play video games, an watch movies, so for our beach trip, we mostly did our own thing, staying at the hotel pool and hanging out in the room while my parents were off doing touristy things, and then we would have dinner together and play cards late into the nights, all around good times.  \nMy mother in law's birthday is coming up, and she, along with her sister in law and extended family, are planning a trip to the beach, friday to monday. My husband has already agreed that we will go there friday morning and leave again late friday afternoon (6 hour round trip) because neither of us really wants to be there all weekend. We'd rather take the opportunity to be alone for a few days, since it is rarely the case.  \nMy mother in law is upset about this and thinks it's unfair we would spend a seek at the beach with my parents and not her, disregarding such things that if we did go with her, she would not leave our side, not giving us the alone time my parents did. As well as the facts that I had not seen my parents for a year, and they would not have taken the 13 hour flight from my home country to hang out in the city. \nMy country is also much colder than here, and spending too much time outside in the heat is incredible unpleasant to me.  \nAm I (and my husband) the asshole for wanting to have alone time at home with my partner rather than spend time with people I barely have a relationship in a place I do not want to be?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

They'd play very bass-heavy music, play Rock Band with their windows open, girls would be screaming every minute, and I'm pretty sure they were high half the time. It's college, so I get it, but my window was immediately adjacent to their opened windows so I could hear everything and my walls would shake due to the bass. My other roommate and I have contacted the leasing office on separate occasions about this, but either they didn't do anything about it or our neighbors got the warning but just didn't care. The issue went on and it was heavily impeding our studying. So eventually, when we got a bit fed up, we left a note on their door asking them to keep it down. We worded it as politely as we could, since we didn't want bad blood between us. They ignored the note and the issue went on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt got to the point where my roommate and I did call the non-emergency police number, and requested that an office come by and just ask them to keep the noise level down, since the leasing office didn't help and they ignored our first note. The next morning, we found a note on our door telling us that we should \"be adults\" and come talk to them in person. Personally, I don't think there is anything wrong with leaving a note, and like I said before, we were very polite about it. They left their number and wrote, \"Text me once you decide to grow a pair.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn retrospect, we really should have asked them in person, but at the time, we genuinely did feel uncomfortable approaching them directly since we're small-built females and our neighbors are tall males.

At the beginning of the month, my roommate paid the full rent (and normally I then pay him my portion) This time, I asked my roommate if I could keep my portion of the rent in exchange for him keeping the whole security deposit on the apartment. He got a little confused and thought I was asking him for money, but I was like \u201cno, you don\u2019t have to give me any money, I\u2019ll just keep this final month\u2019s rent to help offset moving costs and you can keep the entire deposit since you\u2019re staying here.\u201d I suggested this 1. So I would have more money to put down on a new place right away and 2. So that I could avoid having to deal with management, because they\u2019re horrible and I wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d be cooperative in paying us. Anyway, he said he was good with my proposal. So, I went ahead and made plans for a new place and put down my first last and security there. \n\nTurns out, for some reason the terrible management is asking him to pay an additional half a deposit to re-sign the lease, saying they\u2019ll send half back to me, since I\u2019m moving out. Sounds like a scam to me, because they could just as easily keep the whole thing, since it\u2019s technically in his name as much as it\u2019s in mine. So, my roommate comes back to me a couple days later and says that since they\u2019re not just keeping the deposit, he wants me to pay him. I sort of avoid the issue and say \u201cwe\u2019ll see, I don\u2019t see why they would do that, we should talk to them more about it.\u201d In the end, the management calls him, \u201cfurious\u201d that we\u2019re \u201cpestering\u201d them, and they say they\u2019re going to send a check back later and he just needs to pay up now. So now, my roommate is saying he only agreed to \u201clet me hold onto the money until we found out what the leasing company wanted to do about the deposit.\u201d And that I owe him, regardless of what happens with the deposit, even if we get scammed out of half of it. \n\nNow, I understand that he doesn\u2019t want be out $1000 or be scammed by the management; neither do I, which is why I planned this out from the start. He initially agreed to my plan, but once he realized the drawbacks, suddenly he says he never agreed and says I owe him (even though I\u2019ve already put all that money down elsewhere). He doesn\u2019t have any cash flow issues, he\u2019s actually very well off, he just wants me to be on the hook for the money instead of him. I think it would be fair for me to pay him half, so that if they scam us, then at least we\u2019re equally scammed since we\u2019re we\u2019re equal co-signers.

TLDR at the bottom. \n\nFor context, my (23F) cousin (25f) has a lot of issues. She has always been a pathological liar, has trouble making decisions and being responsible, etc.\n\nAbout a year ago, my cousin was sleeping with multiple people. I have absolutely no issue with that, she was not in any official relationships. She ended up becoming more serious with one of the dudes, and became monogamous. \n\nShortly after, it was revealed that she was pregnant. Her boyfriend wanted to take responsibility, and asked her to move in and marry him. They ended up getting married near the end of her pregnancy. \n\nHere\u2019s the tricky part. We discussed it near the middle of her pregnancy, and she told me that she had narrowed it down to 2 potential baby daddies - one of them (husband) is white, the other is Asian. She is also white. She also told me (keep in mind - pathological liar) that both guys were informed and amicable, and the hospital had done a \u2018blood typing\u2019 test but it was inconclusive because both guys have the same blood type. Firstly.. not sure that\u2019s a thing? And secondly, they would not casually do a paternity test on a fetus, it is very dangerous. \n\nMy brand new nephew is less than a month old. When he was born, it seemed very unlikely that he was white. To be fair, all babies look like little aliens, and often skin tone changes drastically. However, we have had Japanese, Korean, and Chinese people note that he looks specifically Chinese (which is where potential baby daddy\u2019s family is from) - I feel like folks with Asian backgrounds would be able to tell better than my white family. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s sister, who I am very close with, and I have been very torn. We both want what\u2019s best, and do not want to cause a divorce/etc for my cousin. However, we feel it is her husband\u2019s right to know, as he will figure it out eventually, and it is the birth father\u2019s right to know that he has a baby out there.\nI don\u2019t want to betray my cousin\u2019s trust, but at the same time I would not technically be at fault because she has explicitly told us, multiple times, that everyone is aware and amicable. I want to be proactive as I feel like the situation will get worse, the longer that time goes on and it becomes more obvious that the child is not white. I feel the bio dad is missing out on an important time in the baby\u2019s life. If it makes a difference, I am quite confident my cousin will reach out to him for child support, if her husband leaves her. \n\nWIBTA for casually mentioning the situation in front of the husband, perhaps by noting it is admirable he has stuck around? And WIBTA for anonymously contacting the baby daddy and letting him know about the situation? \n\nTLDR: White cousin has just birthed Asian baby. Husband is white.

The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

You invited her to your birthday party, you sat with her at lunch, and now your casting her out cause of your silly fued? That\u2019s uncalled for. If you want to invite me back, add Jen first.

Notttt into that at allll. And I actually consider u a friend while i thought jen was for about 2 seconds but was civil cause i didnt want to break the group chat so i kind just delt with it. But then they talk about Alexa in a bad way when they dont know what they r talking about and then they try to talk about ME like im a 2 faced bitch when i have literally never done that??? And like i like u as a friend but i dont like jen and if u cant be friends with me because u feel that me not liking someone\u2019s personality is too much then i guess thats sad but ill have to deal with it\n\n\nSky 09/29/2018\nFirst of all,, did you seriously just call toast by their real name when you know full well that toast goes by toast because of gender stuff??

You shouldn\u2019t not invite river cause of Jen, rivers your best friend, not jen. That\u2019s so fucking weird that you would say that. Second, I\u2019m not wrongfully guides by Jen.

And to round things up, just to learn u, u dont invite 2 friends who dont get along to a party because that really rude. Neither will have fun and just cause tension and nooo one likes that. No one. Fun ruined. Party ruined. Being civil wont fix anything. Anyway river didnt even like know jen at all. I was friends with her at that point and didnt want to have a shitty party because she wouldnt get alone with someone no matter the chances that they might get along tell me one time u came to me and expressed in anyway that u needed help?

We are getting ready to have a one year birthday party. My wife has been working really hard getting ready for the birthday party. Her mom, sister, and a few friends are coming from out of town to attend. My wife is extremely type A and has been killing herself making the house look good (which we recently moved into). However this has been super stressful for me, I\u2019m travelling for work and nothing is where I left it, we have new bathmats, new shower curtains, new coffee tables, new futon, new rugs, so much stuff. A lot of this requires assembly. There's also packages of party decorations, and streamers, and masks, and blah blah blah. This is stressing me the fuck out from a cost stand point and just the fact that there\u2019s five packages at the door everyday. I don\u2019t know why I find it so overwhelming exactly, but I do. There\u2019s overflowing garbage from all of the boxes that we had to have hauled away. We have enough money, it just feels wasteful and excessive to me.\n\nI about lost my shit last night because someone had to come haul away all the boxes and drive through our yard leaving a six inch deep gouge that\u2019s twenty feet long. The freezer\u2019s leaking water all over the tile floor because it\u2019s too full, my wife tried to put up curtains and left a bunch of error holes in the drywall, and my wife and MIL are cooking an involved dinner that we won\u2019t eat until 9:30 when I\u2019ve just had a fourteen hour day of work and out of state travel. She knows I\u2019m stressed about it and she\u2019s mad at me because the home is something she was proud of is now ruined and I\u2019ve \u201cbroken her heart\u201d. I\u2019ve told her I like everything and that it looks good (because it does) but she knows I\u2019m irritated. In fairness I was visibly distraught by the lawn, packages, freezer, and drywall immediately when I got home and pointed all these items out. In front of her mom. But I wasn\u2019t being angry or yelling, I just wanted to know what the fuck was going on.\n\nThe cherry on top is my mother-in-law. My wife told me was coming in last Sunday on last Friday. My MIL and wife drink heavily and stay up late having heated discussions about their family. She is going to stay for a week. Last night my wife came to bed late at 1 AM and woke me up to cry at me and tell me she didn\u2019t understand why I was so mad at her. Honestly I\u2019m mad at her mom who casually cusses me out all the time. It\u2019s under the guise of a joke but eventually it becomes very disrespectful. She said Fuck You to me like three times yesterday and called me a bastard and a bitch the night before. That COULD be funny but in this instance I\u2019m just not into it and don\u2019t want to be spoken to like that in my own home. My wife says I was acting pissed off all night. Well, in fairness, I was. Am I an asshole? My wife has been working from home, doing all this, doing a great job with our daughter, and doing the lion\u2019s share of the housework.

Fortunately he stopped drinking around the time I was 18, he claims \u201che sees whats going on now and nothing can get by me anymore\u201d but Other then smelling like beer and not being funny he haven\u2019t really changed.\n\nFast forward to today. \nI woke up later around 730, I wanted to leave at 8 this morning. My sister came to me asking for a ride I said sure and told her be ready at 8, she came running to my car as i was patiently leaving after waiting an extra 10 min. I told her that i will now be late and she can get a ride elsewhere.. she starts at 945. It was 810 when I left. She then begged my mom and bitched at her to get a ride making my mom late. \n\nWhen I got home later my dad was there and first thing he said was wtf happened this morning, as he \u201cwanted to hear both sides\u201d i told him i waited and then left when she took her time as i was late. He took her said in the argument that it was my family duty to give her a ride (He was mad that my mom bitched at him about my sister). We then started a 2 hour long argument about this. I walked away then asked my mom if I was the family joke as everything that seems to happen is my fault. I start telling her how this feels to me and that i feel that everyone is ganging up on me. Then my dad casually walks by and starts talking about how much everything I am is because of him And that i am nothing if it weren\u2019t without him.\n\nNote my dad is not rich. When I finished school i was given 2k for college, they helped out a little by not charging me rent but in the past year i\u2019ve been paying the electrical bill. About 100$ a month. About 90% of my pay cheque goes to savings because i am extremely strict with my savings and don\u2019t really like to spend money on luxury. \n\nBack to the fight.. \n\nHe said I am nothing with out him and a few more things. Honestly at this point I black out with anger. All i remember saying is \u201cI am about to slap you if you say one more thing\u201d he said \u201cgo ahead do it\u201d and I did. I hit him, open palm as hard as I have ever did in my life. \n\nPart of my is regretful. I cried uncontrollably after on the phone and in the car with my gf, i wanted to kill my self. \n\nThe other half is happy that I finally hit is stupid smug smile off his face after he said \u201cI dare ya\u201d. \n\nAm I the asshole?

When she moved in, my house was moderately modified to accommodate her furniture as well as an entire replacement of kitchen ware, due to her religious dietary needs.  Prior to her moving in, my house was meticulously renovated, designed, and decorated, as my profession is in architecture and I had always had a \u2018vision\u2019 for my first home. \n\nWhen I renovated my home a few years ago, I elected to not put a cable connection for tv in the two bedrooms. I never really watch tv, let alone cable television, so I didn\u2019t see a need for it. Especially as I can watch Netflix through my tv in the bedroom. My girlfriend is really into cable television. All she watches are reality tv shows and the news. When she first moved in, I didn\u2019t even have cable in the main living room tv, and when she moved in I called the cable company to come and install so that she can have her shows. We\u2019re currently in the midst of installing cable tv in the bedrooms now too, per her request. \n\nRecently she\u2019s now asked for cable tv in the kitchen. This is where I drew the line and said no. She got upset at me for it. The reason I said no is because my house isn\u2019t very large to begin with (1,300 sq.ft.).  I think a tv in the kitchen will look odd and out of place. It\u2019s not a large kitchen and having a tv there I feel just kills the mood and feel of my kitchen. Her argument is that she can\u2019t hear or watch the tv while she\u2019s in the kitchen cooking and cleaning, which she\u2019s been doing a lot of lately due to her unemployment status the last few months. I told her hopefully she\u2019ll find a job soon and she won\u2019t be in the kitchen for hours on end because she\u2019ll be busy at work. \n\nI can tell she\u2019s upset. I just don\u2019t want to have a small home filled with televisions, nor do I want to set the precedent of all this tv watching, and I really think putting a tv in the kitchen will kill the vibe and look of the kitchen I worked so hard to design.

POST : TLDR at the bottom.\n\nSo I feel the need to take this to reddit because I've been having quite the mental health crisis recently and seem to be incapable of thinking rationally at the moment and the other people in my life only seem to be telling me what I want to hear at the moment.\n\n\nBoyfriend has done his best to support me through said mental health crisis however it has understandably had a toll on him too. We have argued numerous times throughout this but were always able to reconcile our differences in what I would consider to be a mature manner. I feel we both have the attitude that the relationship is worth more than the argument and are this able to forgive each other despite feelings hurt in the moment. \n\n\nThe mental health crisis started brewing as far back as June/July when I started at my current job. I am a junior NHS nurse in one of the busiest hospitals in London and work in an extremely busy unit. My manager for want of a better word is a cunt and bullied me from day one. Other members of staff have done the same but my manager was the biggest culprit and has had the biggest impact on me psychologically. I began to make mistakes and said mistakes lead to self doubt. This self doubt quickly became crippling anxiety which lead to a deep depression and I had to take a significant period of sick leave. I have been fighting the urge to kill myself or self harm most days since August. I have returned to work on an informal performance management basis. I have reported the behaviour to my Lead Nurse (Matron) but was gaslighted. I am due to have a mediation meeting with my manager to discuss my concerns next month. \n\n\nMy boyfriend has encouraged me to move on to another job as he can see how miserable I have become throughout all of this but my parents encouraged me to stay because I left my previous post after only seven months and cannot keep \"running away\" when I run into difficult people. I needed their advice but now I feel broken. On top of the depression I have chronic fatigue syndrome and the toll that the emotion has taken on me has left me near bedridden on my days off. My room is a mess and I don't have the energy or the will to clean it and then I'm embarrassed for him to come home to it. I've put on a significant amount of weight that I am now struggling to even maintain as I have started an antidepressant that makes me starving all the time and I have PCOS that has always made it difficult for me to maintain a healthy weight anyway. This weight gain has effected my self esteem massively and I feel even uglier and even less desirable than I already did.\n\n\nI can understand why all of these things could be pushing him away.  I know that I cannot ask him to accept me for all of my flaws and not accept his in return. However I am feeling like his behaviour could be more supportive than it has in the past two weeks or so. \n\n\nWe have been together since last summer and have been best friends from the day we met. I moved to London to be with him in November of last year. We had a break up lasting approximately three weeks in February but got back together in March. We haven't spent a single night apart since then except for when I have visited family. He has for all intents and purposes moved into my room in my house share (yes he contributes to the bills). We had been talking as far back as April/May about moving in together and even viewed some places together in the summer. They wound up not working out for various reasons and then plans were put on hold when my my mental health started to deteriorate. If I barely had the energy to get out of bed how could I go to viewings and get a replacement tenant for my current room? However the prospect of living with him in a space all of our own has been one of the only things that has kept me going these past few months. My aspirations for my career had been completely shattered, along with my faith in my ability to do my job. I had no idea what my future held professionally. I had no idea what it looked like. But I did know that I would be with him. He had previously said that after a year of living together he felt he would propose, and that we'd move out to a cummuter town and hopefully by the time he's 30 (2021) be trying for kids and I could be very part time or a SAHM for a while. That glimmer of hope felt like the only thing that was keeping me going.\n\nCut to the 21st Novemeber and he tells me he no longer wants to make plans to move in together any time soon because he doesn't think that we have reached the point where we are able to argue 'maturely' yet because I had said that I had wanted space a couple of times during the darkest points of my depressoin. I never once 'kicked him out' or any similar dramatic behaviour of that kind even though he does have a rent free room that he could go to. I understoodthat I couldn't change his mind about it and that fighting with him about it in an attempt to do so would only push him away. I did however say that I felt that in out own plave we would be able to have a bit more space together as we would have more than just a bedroom to ourselves (even if our budget will likely only permit us a small place). I also cried. I cried and cried and cried. I couldn't help it. It felt like my future had been stolen from me by the person whom I wanted to share it with. He appeared legitimately taken aback at my emotional response, stating that \"[he] had no idea it meant so much to you\". He reassured me that it wasn't a precursor to breaking up and that he actually think that it would be good for the relationship. I responded that if he wanted to leave I would prefer that he did it sooner rather than later as it was very difficult to still occupy the same small space as him, knowing that he would rather be elsewhere. He asked if I would permit him to stay until today until he started looking as he is paid on the final Friday of every month. Bearing in mind that he has a room that he could go to in a property owned by his mother this irritated me. He stated that he didn't want to move back into that property as it would be embarrassing and he would feel unwelcome after living with me for so long. Last night he told me off for the mess in the room (I've recently had a huge influx of parcels because of Christmas present ordering) and stated that this was one of the reasons he wants a place of his own. I feel like if I pursue the conversation further or appear to be kicking him out I may lose him forever.\n\nSo to the title... I had a big interview today that realistically I had pinned way too much hope on. I am so ridiculously desperate to get away from my current job and it showed. I find out on Monday but I already know what the answer will be.\n\nStraight after I text him to update him. I'm not proud of the words I used because they probably read like I was just trying to prompt a reaction but I did mean them at the time. My exact words were, among others, \"definitely didn't get it\", \"no chance\", \"I'm never going to be able to leave\", \"I'm a failure\", \"want to fucking kill myself\". He responded with \"of course you are\" in response to me saying I'm never going to leave and then \"no you're not\" to my saying that I'm a failure. I then updated him that I had ordered an obscene amount of pizza when I got home, he said \"without me ffs\". Next time I hear from him is when he's getting off work at 17:13 \"I'm going out for a bit\", \"keep your phone near you\".\n\nHe is very popular at his workplace but does not usually take them up on their offers to go out on a Friday (or any other day really) as he prefers to come home and spend time with me. Obviously I want him to have a healthy social life beyond our relationship and I have actually frequently encouraged him to take them up on their invitations even where I am not invited too. I don't want him to stop getting them because of me. However I can't help but feeling like it is very bizarre that he would choose to leave me at home waiting on today of all days.\n\n\nI have continued to accommodate him despite a revelation that completely broke my heart. He knows I am having self-destructive thoughts. My career prospects are shit and I've become even more aware of this in light of this failed interview today. Am I being unreasonable to expect him to prioritise me over his friends that he complains about when he does go out with them? Or is his response only natural for someone with a partner who's losing it? I don't even know what is reasonable behaviour anymore. \n\n\nAlso, I start CBT next week. I asked for help months  ago but it takes a fucking long time to get seen on the NHS and I don't have the disposable income to go private.\n\n\n\n TLDR:\n\nWas desperate to do well at job interview today and fucked it. Texted boyfriend to update, went home, ordered pizza, cried. \n\nI am currently in a very serious depressive episode and am having self harming and suicidal thoughts every day, which he is aware of. He has put up with a lot of my shit, until today it seems. He just texted to say that he's going out to drinks with his work friends when he usually comes straight home (and has done so for the whole time that he has had this job, which predates this depression) \n\nI know that I cannot be my boyfriend's keeper however I am feeling abandoned at my time of need. \n\n\nAITA?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

So there\u2019s this new housemate and she\u2019s fine, a little annoying but fine. All of a sudden her MS starts getting bad and all of us have to start caring for her a tiny bit (nothing ridiculous, just getting her water or cooking chicken nuggets etc), even though we don\u2019t know her that well and are busy with university stuff. One day she\u2019s taken away in an ambulance and has to stay at hospital, this is where she starts really bothering us all. While she\u2019s in hospital she\u2019s let her dad move into her bedroom (he came over from another country to be with her), she didn\u2019t really ask if it was ok but just said it was happening and \u201cis that ok\u201d, and we can\u2019t just say no cause we\u2019d all seem like assholes and also she\u2019s already arranged it. So a few weeks later she comes back from the hospital and I\u2019m sort of trying to not be around her cause I know she\u2019ll waste my time (I study and work!) telling me all about it and I\u2019ll have to stand there and agree.

So anyway she\u2019s just gone BACK to the hospital (which I hate to say it but was a convenience to me- I realise that I\u2019m definitely the asshole at that moment) but then she messages us all saying that her dads gonna be staying here again. I only say him briefly last time she was in hospital but knowing there\u2019s a stranger here is really uncomfortable and I find myself limited in my own house as I\u2019m trying to avoid him.\n\nSorry for the long post but I feel as though I had to explain everything fully.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7**ReplyForward** ", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

I agreed and left.\n\nThe next day I delayed lunch because I was anticipating picking him up and he would get me food. I texted him what sandwich I would like him to get me and he responds \u201cShit man I already got a ride\u201d which pissed me off. This was probably an overreaction on my part but (after sending him an angry text) I went to his house, told his mom that I needed a game back that I let him borrow, took it and left. \n\nI thought he was intentionally screwing me over but he later said that he forgot and I was overreacting. He said he took 2 Xanax bars and drank some alcohol the night before and that made him forget. This led to an intense argument between us with him saying I shouldn\u2019t have been so angry and he sent that initial text (about getting another ride) when he was in the middle of work. He was also insistent that I should have reminded him. My main argument is that taking Xanax/alcohol is not an excuse and he should have made a point to remember especially after I sent the text about what food I want. I don\u2019t think I should have to remind him to hold up his end of the deal. I wished I could have not let him borrow it but it\u2019s too late for that.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

At the time we started dating they were still living in the same apartment and her ex-BF was not happy that she broke up with him and started dating me. Neither of them were financially able to leave and find a new place to rent immediately so they both had to live with each other as roommates for a while.\n\nThose few months were the most awkward and strangest times because her ex-BF thought she was just trying to get him jealous and play with his emotions. He still considered himself her \"real\" boyfriend and I am just that guy in the way because he believes she should have never broken up with him because they were on a unofficial \"break\". \n\nAll that fuckery aside, it all culminated 2 months later when he was about to go travel to see his parents and he asked my GF to give him a handjob before he goes. She told me about what he said and I tried to go to speak to him but she stopped me from doing so because it would jeopardize her living situation because honestly I would have got physical with him. \n\nFast forward a month later and she's finally able to move out and we are so glad that we don't have to deal with her ex-BF anymore.

She said she just sees him as an old friend and she doesn't get why I feel so badly about her seeing him because she says that she no romantic feelings towards him at all. \n\nThen she said she won't go see him \"right now\" since she thinks I am just being jealous/ not trusting her/ being a controlling boyfriend.

Now, I am pretty sure that everyone who orders food gets it delivered, not just partners, nor would they care anyway.  He seems to think otherwise, but I just said well I've asked them not to bring it up and they still do.  So he said he'd talk to the manager of the mail and see if he have him stop doing it.\n\nI don't really care either way, but it's bugging me.  I do think he has some personal issues (personality wise internally), but he loves my work, we get along great, getting a raise, no complaints.  He just wants me not to have food delivered up so he can keep up with his imaginary appearances with partners.  Meanwhile, partners don't even know who I am.\n\nSo I'd apparently be the exception at the whole firm (not that many people get lunch delivered but I get hankerings for food that isn't a nearby walk so I guess ordering 1-2 times a week is more than others in my floor).

POST : Long backstory ahead.\n\nMy friend and I are both 3rd year highschoolers, everyday our school has a special classes for general work and activities, and that includes class competitions that we're both apart of. What the competition entails is bringing in the most food for your classroom and whichever has the most wins a special breakfast for the class. After all is decided, all the food the school donates is then given to charities.\n\nMy class is one of the two most competitive classes for this, and last year we just barely lost. The most common way to get food is to stand outside grocery stores and request them to buy the needed food. Last year my friend convinced me to do a total of four shifts, I hated it as we were standing in the cold at night for two hours, good cause but it was tiring. \n\nMy friend texted me asking where I was as he was just about ready to do the second, and I had no clue about it due to lack of communication. When I explained that I couldn't come as it was in the opposite direction from another friend's house I was at and too short of notice, he simply said 'Fuck you' and held that grudge for awhile after, ignoring me (The grudge lasted through the rest of the hours he would do until we cleared it up, understanding it was a genuine miscommunication on both parts).\n\nNow to the point, he's been egging me on to do the service with him to get food donations for awhile this year. I haven't said it directly but I have shown I'm not eager to. I'm not in opposition to charity work in the slightest, but it was very draining and cold especially this time of year. And additionally I felt that he was being harsh last year instead of wanting to communicate with me when I was trying to and I'm afraid of it breaking out into drama with him again.\n\nHe said today that if I don't do the work with him, I need to bring in my own groceries to donate or he won't hang out outside of school with me. I can assume this means the silent treatment at school as well for at least a few weeks. I feel the need to state how this charity work shouldn't be used as a punishment against me, but for his own good intentions. I'm thinking of bringing my own groceries to donate, but if I do I want to make it clear that I didn't do it to remain his friend but actually take part in the charity work, not even for some stupid breakfast.\n\nSo AITA? Am I in the right to not want to do hours with him, and stating how I don't want to contribute out of his threats to our friendship? \n\nOr should I just do the hours with him?

We have a lot of regulars and a few weird  types that sometimes come across as either crackheads, alcoholics or  just the stereotype of chavs. One such feller who I'll call Jeff has  been a frequent customer/problem in the past who will often loiter round  the tables and be an annoyance from time to time.

Anyway, boss decided we're to stop serving Jeff if it keeps up.  Naturally, Jeff turns up the next weekend when it's quiet and sits  himself down on one of our tables to have himself a drink and a smoke.  Boss tells him tables are for customers only, Jeff moans and has a quiet  little word in behind my boss' back swearing and comes over.\n\nRemembering  what boss said, I told him we weren't serving him and to leave, he  argues with me demanding to know why to which I list off x reasons  (tl;dr he's a subhuman waste of space)  why  and say it's final, he can eat somewhere else as we don't want him  taking piss any more. In a bit of a rant Jeff throws the mostly-empty  can of lager he was drinking through the open hatch/window frame of our  stall which nearly smashes into my head. At this time I'm holding a cup  of coffee that was still too scalding to drink and instinctively throw  it at him which splashes into his face, Jeff screams and covers himself  up in pain and staggers off. I find out later in the evening that an  ambulance was called to town near our stall around that same time.\n\nMy boss has been OK about this as he thought Jeff was being a  twat but warned me he might try to cause trouble by involving the  police and so I should take a few weekends off until things quiet down.

The day we agreed to, she went home early, so I was alone. I don't like confrontation, so I got really nervous. One of my friends helped me out, and I asked the director. He said he would think about it. I played as S, F, and T throughout the entire rehearsal. I became much more comfortable with the roles, and embraced them.  I don't know how A feels still. I'm worried that she'll bother the director enough to get our roles switched. She is a better actor than I am, and I think she'll do better as this role.

While we were in this date I was having specially made meds for me so I was off them for a week or so. \n\nAnyway, I got confused and asked what they meant. They laughed and told me they didn\u2019t want to finish the joke but I just laughed and said \u201cCome on finish it.\u201d They said laughed and said \u201cBecause one depressed Twilipig is enough for me to handle.\u201d \n\nI won\u2019t lie, that stung a little. I can be a handful and I\u2019m aware. I don\u2019t have many friends and every time I try to make friends they either reject me or drop me fast. That was towards the end of dinner so we just paid the cheque and left. When I\u2019m upset I need time to process and thing of the proper words to say, my SO knows this. The drive home was very quiet. \n\nHe dropped me off and left and texted me asking if I was okay. I didn\u2019t respond cause I was still upset and still needed time to think of what to say. They called a few minutes later and I picked up. \n\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t lie SO, the therapy remark kind of hurt my feelings. You know how I feel about that kind of talk.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god babe it was a joke!\u201d\n\u201cI know but it still really hurt my feelings.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god I can\u2019t make any jokes with you it\u2019s so annoying.\u201d\n\u201cThat is so not true, you just know I don\u2019t like mental health jokes.\u201d \n\u201cYeah right whatever. I\u2019m tired about you being so sensitive about it. It\u2019s not even that big of a deal, people have it-\u201c\n\nI hung up on them in tears. They had always been supportive but to hear they found my mental illness annoying really hurt. We haven\u2019t talked since then. I know I probably should have handled things better but I got caught up in the moment.

POST : Best friend and I (both early 30s) have been basically brothers for 20+ years, and him and his wife were together for seven years and married for four. This last year he got a new job which made him very conceited and would go out every weekend with his new workmates who are all...quite misogynistic. I definitely noticed changes in the way he would treat people and pulled away a bit. \n\nThree months ago he showed up at my place in tears saying he made a big mistake and his wife was leaving him because she found a thong under the bed that wasn\u2019t hers and an email between him the workmates joking about hiring hookers. He swears up and down that he never cheated on her and never would and he was so devastated I had to believe him. His wife left him in the middle of the day without saying a word, just divorce papers and no one knows where she left to. \n\nHe was so broken and spent a lot of time talking to us about it, I know he really loved her and was totally blindsided but the situation also looked so bad from her end. We did our best to comfort and be there for him. A few weeks after all this, he stopped hanging out with us as much and started hanging out with his work friends a lot more. His attitude did a total 180, he wasn\u2019t sad and moping around anymore but cocky. He got on this kick about how she probably elaborately set him up to leave him for another guy and pin all the blame on him because he got his friend to watch her at her work and she was eating her lunch with a guy. He suddenly started dating this new girl - my wife and I were pretty surprised but trying to be supportive asked him about her and he said, verbatim \u2018she\u2019s a butterface but always down to bone\u2019. The new girlfriend started posting about them on Instagram in his hot tub that ex wife got him as a wedding gift with a caption that said \u2018my hot tub, my man, my house now\u2019 with the laugh emoji. Of course this got back to ex wife and she went absolutely psycho on him, telling him things so terrible I can\u2019t include them in the post, trying to screw him as much as possible in the divorce and selling the hot tub in the middle of the day while he was at work. \n\nSince this he\u2019s been terrified of running into her and he\u2019s convinced she\u2019s going to mess with all his stuff or him or his girlfriend. He\u2019s been begging me and my wife to let him stay with us for a few months while he tries to find a new place. We have a guest room but honestly don\u2019t want him there. My wife is in a VERY stressful masters program and I want her to have as little stress as possible right now. She is getting really sick of him because he doesn\u2019t take any of our advice. I want to help him because he seems like he\u2019s headed down a dark path and needs me but I also would lose my mind if he lived here. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I told him he can\u2019t stay with us?

This all happened quite a few years ago but it still sometimes pangs me. Basically, I'd been on-and-off dating a girl for about 12 months. We had a lot of fun, but she had a major problem with snooping - on one occasion, not merely logging into my facebook, but actually deleting someone she thought I shouldn't be friends with. When confronted about this, she was apologetic and said 'yeah, I know, I get kind of crazy sometimes'. I should also add that I never cheated on her, but because of the on-off nature of the relationship, I had had some recent hookups not with her. For my part, I'm not too strict about boundaries, so forgave her after the snooping incidents.\n\nFast forward to the end of the relationship. Basically we were bickering way too much and I just snapped and said \"I've had enough.\" We talked it through, and she said we should take a week away from each other, think carefully about what we regarded as the pros and cons of the relationship, and write up a list. These lists were intended to be private, serving as essentially personal discussion notes for a subsequent meeting. I did this, trying to be extremely honest with myself. Among the things I put on the list were some pretty blunt stuff, like I had always felt she was more attracted to me than I was to her, and that I wasn't wild about her body type. There were probably some other pretty damning items on there too.\n\nSo, then we have the meeting. We're at her place, drinking wine, she's running through some items from her list, noting the things that she regards as our strengths and weaknesses. I run through my list too, being careful to filter and rephrase as I go along - e.g., talking vaguely about 'flagging passion' rather than my lapsed attraction to her. The conversation is mostly productive. Eventually, I take a bathroom break, and I leave the list on the arm of the chair I was sitting on.\n\nI get back from the bathroom, and she's sitting there in tears. *Of course* she's read the fucking thing. She couldn't help herself. She says \"I don't think I could ever be with anyone who finds me so unattractive.\" I ask her what the hell was she thinking looking at a private document. She says I absolutely knew her well enough to realise that she would do it, and why would I leave it out if I didn't want her to look.\n\n(FWIW, I don't *think* I left it out deliberately, either as a self-esteem boobytrap for her or even a test. I'm just kind of forgetful and had been drinking wine. But the human mind is a funny thing. Maybe at an unconscious level I knew it was a risk.)\n\nSo, anyway, we broke up. I normally try to stay friends with exes, but she made it very clear that she regarded leaving out the list of her flaws as an asshole move and one that hurt her a lot.

I fully understand that I am old enough to be living on my own, but to make a long story short, my mom struggles with mental health issues and I worry that if I leave her on her own, she\u2019ll start living life in a very unhinged way. (she\u2019s struggled with addiction in the past) \n\nI\u2019m not going to make myself out to be a saint or anything like that, but I do help her out a lot around the house. For the past 5 years, I\u2019ve been giving her daily assistance with learning the internet &amp; web browsing, a lot of which includes helping her with online shopping. She had a slight addiction for a minute and was ordering 5+ items from a multitude of shops and having me complete all the return/support tickets when she doesn\u2019t like her items...which is almost always. \n\nI digress. I\u2019m just trying to paint an accurate portrait of our give and take relationship. She\u2019s on social assistance which pays for our rent. I\u2019m grateful that she allows me to live here, but I do pay for most of my own food and things, and lately I\u2019ve been going out of my way to pay for her meals and groceries as well. \n\nThis is where I get frustrated. I work about a 40 minute walk away from my house. It\u2019s a 5 minute car ride. It\u2019s freezing out right now, and taking the bus takes almost as long as walking since the schedules are wonky. \n\nI asked her if she\u2019d mind dropping me off (since her days are always 100% free) and she says no. I asked her why not, and her reasoning was that her boyfriend is awake and might want to use the car in the 10 minutes she\u2019d be gone. I told her I would really appreciate just a drop off and had full intentions of taking the bus home. Still no. \n\nShe very rarely gave me rides as kid\u2014I relied on the bus for school &amp; hanging out, even in the winter. When I missed my school bus, I\u2019d take a cab. \n\nI can drive, and I drive rather well... but I never have access to a car to practice, which is why I haven\u2019t gotten my license yet. There\u2019s always an excuse as to why I can\u2019t use the car when I ask to practice/book a road test. \n\nSorry for the brick of text. I wanted to paint a proper picture before I ask:\n\nAm I an asshole for being annoyed that she won\u2019t drive me 5 minutes up the road to work, but expects me to be on call for her tech support and questions 24/7 and bring her takeout/run various errands for her while I\u2019m on foot &amp; she drives? \n\nI know the realistic response is to move out and get my own car... but my dad just passed away recently and I have a lot of psychological hangups/panic about losing my mom now. She takes very poor care of herself without my help, and I fear that if I leave her, she\u2019ll let go altogether. \n\nI\u2019m just bitter lately because I feel like she has no remorse asking me for a million things because she \u201cputs a roof over my head\u201d (technically the government does but whatever) but when I ask her to drop me off, it\u2019s the end of the bloody world.
