Before they had just opened so I understood some of the flaws. Now it's been open about 2 years. Upon my second attempt at trying Ginban, I was again thoroughly disappointed. First flaw was the waiter, we could barely understand his mumbling. Second he didn't seem to even know the menu or inventory. We ordered the mango tango, and the king lobster roll, which both featured lobster salad, as we came just for those rolls (we love lobster, who doesn't). However we were informed a while after ordering that they were out of lobster salad (a good portion of their rolls feature this). Thirdly the menu descriptions are not accurate. The waiter wanted informed us about the lobster salad for the mango tango roll and not the king lobster roll. I had to dispute that the King Lobster roll has this as well, which is what the menu states. He then comes back saying that they don't really use it on the roll. Well then why is a King Lobster roll (I don't think the tempura lobster qualifies it as that). Also the menu did not list for one of our rolls had masago. And fourth the food was just meh and we left hungry and went to Sushi Ken down the road for an extra roll each. The Ginban roll, which should be the best since carrying their name, was subpar. This roll was supposed to be cooked, yet the tiny amount of salmon that was inside was raw. The snow something roll must of been called that because it tasted like the ingredients were frozen and not fresh. Other side notes: Ginban had only one other table filled, while just a mile down the road Sushi Ken was packed. When a customer orders their roll on soy paper, they need to be informed of it costing extra, since not every place charges extra.

So here goes.\\n\\nI have had a good time trying out different Wine bars. This one sucks ass tasting wise. (Randy's words not mine) I bought a Groupon to this place. It offered for $10 a $20 value of a wine tasting for two and cheesecake for two. For $10 can you go wrong? YUP! You can.\\n\\nNow let me say this, the owner was super nice! Local Cave Creek guy. My stomping grounds. Super casual. A little to casual. Nice store, greets you as you come in, etc. when we shared with him that we had been by twice during posted hours and that the place was closed, he casually responded that he had a baby and would head out early to put his baby to bed. Touching; (Later found out that the baby was 2 1/2 and that sometimes he went home early to watch football....hmmm?) bad business practice. If you aren't t open during posted hours, how do you run a business? I could go on about this, but I digress.\\nHe gave us several options besides those listed on the Groupon. I thought this sounded amazing! A $20 bottle of wine. Four beers, or your choice of any combinations of 8 wine tastings. All included the cheesecake.   Let me say this about the cheesecake, it was good but it was served in individual jars that made it look like baby food! The presentation was less than appetizing.  We made the choice to allow him to choose the wines. We wanted to try wines we had never tried before.\\n\\nThe wine choices were, well, NASTY!! I can get a better shot at a decent wine by rolling the dice in the grocery store, bottom shelf, $3.99. (Sad)  Four of the 8 wines had started to turn to vinegar.  I'm not sure how long the bottles had been open, but they were just stuffed with their corks.  No rubber suction stoppers to keep the wine from turning.  For all I know, they could have been good wines.  Again, not professional.  For an owner and purveyor who goes to wine tastings and sells wine for a living I was sadly disappointed. Cave Creek is full of hidden gems, this is not one of them.\\n\\nNow, in fairness, I will say that he poured us a wonderful Pinot Grigio.  I purchased this wine.  it was smooth and well balanced.  This was surprising since I was more interested in the reds....gross!\\n\\nOn a positive note, he does a lot of fund raisers for wounded vets and has been quite successful in raising money and awareness for wounded vets and their needs.

This was our second trip- the first was just after they opened and we didn't love it but figured since it has been open for awhile the kinks would be worked out.  8 of us went for a birthday celebration the other night, so between us we tried most everything.  Throughout our meal there were major problems with execution.\\n\\nBYOB is nice, the white bean dip is ok but bland.  The various breads were generally good.  Everything was downhill from that point.  \\n\\nApps: we had artichoke dip, stuffed zuchinni, and the gouda.  The gouda was fine, it was only room temp to slightly warmed but it's cheese and can't help but be tasty.  The zuchinni was notable only for not being bad.  The artichoke dip (2 orders, both this way) was just awful- it was more of an artichoke soup.  Chunks of oversalted artichokes floating (seriously- they were bobbing around like apples) in a thin, milky lukewarm broth with giant chunks of soggy unmelted cheese.  The center was cold- refrigerator cold.  We pointed this out to the manager, who didn't apologize or seem to note anything wrong, but offered to heat one up for us.  30 seconds in the microwave later it was steamy but the ingredients still weren't combined and it was still more soup than dip.  I think what is most bothersome isn't that there was clearly a prep error but that even after it was sent back, there was no quality control in the kitchen.\\n\\nA mushroom \\\"\"bisque\\\"\" which appeared to contain no cream was watery, salty, and uninspired.\\n\\nMains: our table tried the crab cakes, pumpkini ravioli, pork, London broil, and catfish.  Nothing stood out, and the pork was very dry and bland with an unappetizing combination of mushy sweet potato cubes and some unidentifiable grits-like topping.  \\n\\nDessert: Creme brulee, which semed to go over well.  We also had the red velvet cheesecake, which was bad enough that 8 people sharing didn't finish even half of it.  It took awhile to put our finger on the problem, but as one astute companion pointed out it was salty.  Combined with a strangely dense and chewy texture, the overall effect was of a lurid pink playdoh served on topsoil.  \\n\\nI like for places to do well, and I try to give them a fair chance.  If the food had just been not to our liking or even just plain bad, I probably would have chalked it up to a bad night and not written a negative review.  What bothered me and prompted this entry was that we so clearly weren't happy with our meal and there was never a point where any staff recognized the problem, asked if anything was wrong (when 8 people eat and not a single person finishes a single dish and something is sent back, there is likely a problem), or offered to remove the completely uneaten artichoke dip-soups from our bill.

There is a lovely dessert case with lots of pretty things inside.  So far I have tried 5 different pastries, and all have been really good.  Not the best desserts I have ever had, but definitely very tasty. The only drawback is very slow service.  There was only one man working up front the day we tried lunch, and he was making all of the sandwiches himself.

We honestly just stopped for drinks and figured this was a safe bet-place looked cool and there were empty spots in front, perfect for people watching.

(Would have been nice to know.)  After waiting much too long our drinks arrived but we were certain the mojito was wrong-it was in a clear glass, no fresh mint to speak of.  My friend had a sip and she said it tasted like the pre-mixed drinks you can buy in the grocery store in a can.  That is where I suspected my greyhound came from as well judging by the taste-it was horrible.  But if you are going to charge $14 (?) for a mojito at least fake it by throwing in a spring of fresh mint...but mAybe that was too much work.  So, we ordered from the happy hour menu next thinking this was clearly not a mixed drink place-we should have paid attention to the keg-decor and impressive beer offering.  I happen to love IPAs and was excited to see Dog Fish Head on tap...but no...it was out.  It was only 4:00 or so!!  Okay, so I ordered  Stone IPA, also. Rey nice.  Strike two... \\\"\"Sorry-we are also out of that.\\\"\"  So the only other IPA was Lagunitas which I like.  At $5 (happy hour) it was a deal including the $5 nachos-over the top fattening but good.

It didn't hurt, but it was incredibly rude, and needless to say, none of us left a big tip.\\n\\nThe food was really the only shining star in this place; the dumplings that I ended up ordering were absolutely delicious, as was the chicken that my friend ordered.

I asked them to remove it and I thought it was good. Even up until then, I wanted to be happy so I just left. As I was driving my car I noticed gunk all over the window. The guy who was scraping with the razor to get the decals and stickers off didn't bother to throw decal residue out after scraping them. Everything remained. As I checked more later, I noticed candy wrappers from the previous owner still there but this time soaked breadcrumbs from being watered during the detailing process.

We were 5 minutes late to our 10:30pm reservation and then stood for almost 10 minutes waiting to check in because a large party was standing in the entryway. The hostess (turned out to be the owner) saw us standing there and ignored us. When we finally got to check in she told us that they had given our table away so we now had to wait. After waiting 10 minutes I asked how much longer it was going to be because we had been told the food service stopped at midnight. I couldn't understand her answer because the DJ music was so loud. When I told her this she started screaming at me that I could stop yelling at her and that if we didn't like it we could walk out because she didn't need people like us. When I tried to explain that I was speaking loudly because of the music she cut me off and screamed at me some more. The other hostesses and guests were in shock. So I decided to ask her name. Her answer was that she was the owner and I could call her the owner or I could get out. Since there were no other options for dinner at that point I asked how long it was going to be and she said she had to find somewhere to \\\"\"put us\\\"\". We were finally seated last after she seated 6 groups that came in after us. We reached our table at 11:05 and then sat for another 5 minutes before anyone came to the table. There were at least 5 open tables in the section we were in so it was pretty clear there shouldn't have been a problem \\\"\"finding somewhere to put us\\\"\". The hostess who did seat us apologized repeatedly for her behavior and said she was sorry there was nothing she could do. It was clear from our conversation with her and other staff during the night that outbursts like this are a regular occurrence and the staff are used to trying to make it up to guests who do stay and eat. I guess it should have been a warning when I saw her grabbing party favors out of a guest's hand and yelling at the woman that she could only have 1 item per person. \\nOur server was wonderful once he realized we were his table. However it was clear the staff bringing the meat around had no idea how to navigate a full restaurant. My plate was constantly empty and we spent half the night craning our necks trying to find the closest meat server. The salad bar was the usual which surprised me for a party that they were charging so much extra for. It is tiny compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses we have been to and both times they have hit a big pet peeve of mine. They put the salad dressing in front of the tray of salad so lettuce drops into it during the night. By the time we got to the salad bar the dressing was full of lettuce, which is a health code violation. It has happened both times we have eaten there, so it is clearly not something they care to keep neat. The meats were so salty that I had to ask for center cuts. And after being promised they were serving food until 1am, they stopped bringing meat around at midnight. They put out a dessert buffet at midnight. By 12:20 there were about 20 items left and they were all stale like they had sat out all day before being served. The worse part was they didn't have any more so several people didn't even get dessert which was included in the higher price for the party. We finally had to ask for more fried bananas. Once the server realized we hadn't gotten any dessert he brought us something from their regular menu. \\nThe last thing that bothered me was on the check. The check had been rung up under a different server's name. When I asked about it we were told that our server was the \\\"\"second\\\"\" on a team and the name was the \\\"\"leader\\\"\" of the team. I asked where the leader was, and was told she had already left the floor for the night. I thought it was tacky that I was expected to tip a \\\"\"team\\\"\" of servers when only one person had spoken to us all night. I am not talking about leaving the bussers and such out. I don't think someone who never even spoke to me should get a tip from me. Especially someone who has already gone home even though we are still seated. \\nWe won't be going back unless someone else is buying for certain. If you do go, make sure it is on a slow night so you get good service and pray you don't cross paths with the owner.", "output": "NEGATIVE", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1102.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given Yelp reviews.

The small potato with cheese I ordered was actually two potatoes that were literally covered in cheddar-y goodness. Very messy, very hot, and very good. The toppings may look like too much at first, but there is enough to last through the whole thing and never leave any bare potato. Once you reach the skin, if you still have any room left in your stomach, eat the skin. It is delicious. \\n\\nIf you can, upon receiving your warm and crispy potato, find a place to sit (Scottish weather permitting), and enjoy people-watching while stuffing your face.", "output": "POSITIVE", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1102.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given Yelp reviews.
