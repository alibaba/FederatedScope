With a history lesson. The Massachusetts senator told the crowd of several thousand in Saturday's blustery cold about Everett Mill, the site where they had gathered in Lawrence, Massachusetts . Back in 1912, the textile factory was the scene of a labour strike for better pay and working conditions that expanded to include 20,000 workers, mostly women, in the then-bustling industrial town. The movement that started in Lawrence, she explained, led to government-mandated minimum wage, union rights, weekends off, overtime pay and new safety laws across the US. \"The story of Lawrence is a story about how real change happens in America,\" Ms Warren said. \"It's a story about power - our power - when we fight together.\" The extended opening was classic Warren. Erudite, informative and a bit long-winded. A mix of Ivy League intellectualism and blue-collar witticisms drawn from her working-class childhood in Oklahoma. These days, Lawrence isn't much to look at. Its once-imposing factories are worn and darkened by soot and time. The tall brick smokestacks stand like husks of trees in a long-dead forest. Twenty-nine percent of the town's 80,000 residents live below the poverty line. Opioid drug trafficking and abuse is rampant. Although Ms Warren didn't cite modern-day Lawrence as a cautionary tale, the backdrop served to illustrate another part of her message - that the current financial structure of America is broken, a victim of rapacious big business and indifferent government. The middle-class, she said, is struggling in a \"rigged system that props up the rich and the powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else.\" If that sounds a bit familiar, it's perhaps because the problems she identifies are similar to the ones highlighted by Donald Trump in his successful 2016 presidential campaign. Of course, her policy prescriptions are the opposite - and Ms Warren has positioned herself as a frequent critic of the president's. She says government needs to take a more active role in reining in the excesses of capitalism and provide a sturdier safety net for those on society's margins. \"Trump gave people false hope,\" says Brian Perry, a bricklayer from Weymouth, Massachusetts who came to Lawrence to hear Ms Warren speak. \"He said all the right things. He's just unprepared and not interested in fixing them. In fact, he made it worse. She intends to change it, and she's willing to offer real solutions.\" The solutions Ms Warren proposed on Sunday include \"big, structural change\" that addresses the corrupting influence of money in Washington, growing wealth inequality throughout the nation and electoral dysfunction that threatens a free and fair democratic process. Her centrepiece policy, at least so far, is a 2% tax on the wealth of households worth more than $50m, rising to 3% on portfolios over $1bn. She said it was an \"ultra-millionaire tax to make sure rich people start doing their part for the country that helped make them rich\". The progressive champion It's that the kind of talk that has made Elizabeth Warren a star of the progressive left for more than a decade. She burst onto the national scene following the 2008 economic collapse, championing the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - a government agency that would serve as a Wall Street watchdog and public advocate. In 2010, following congressional passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, she helped the Obama administration set it up. Two years later Ms Warren rode that wave of attention to a seat in the US Senate by defeating incumbent Republican Scott Brown, who just two years earlier had won a special election to fill the rest of the late Edward Kennedy's term. A viral video of her explaining taxation and government debt got more than a million views on YouTube. During her tenure she earned a reputation for her hard-nosed questioning of business executives from her perch on the Senate Finance Committee. She was floated as a possible presidential contender in 2016 and a potent challenger to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, but demurred, saying she had no interest in the White House job. Now that calculus has changed. On New Year's Eve she became the first major Democratic candidate to announce that she was planning a presidential bid. She hit the campaign trail in the key early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, as well as Puerto Rico. According to Iowa political analyst Pat Rynard, Ms Warren made a big splash in her January visit to his state - an indication that her popularity on the left could translate into votes in 2020. \"It was really eye-opening,\" he said. \"There were huge, enthusiastic crowds who knew her well and really liked her talk about fighting on behalf of the middle class and taking on the big banks.\" On Saturday, Ms Warren returned to her home state to formally announce she was running - and how she intended to win. \"There are a lot of people out there with money and power and armies of lobbyists and lawyers,\" she said. \"People who will say it's 'extreme' or 'radical' to demand an America where every family has some economic security and every kid has a real opportunity to succeed. \"I say to them, 'Get ready, because change is coming faster than you think.'\" More on the Democratic 2020 race White House obstacles Ms Warren will compete in a crowded primary field - one that already includes four of her fellow senators, four other women and at least a dozen more potential candidates. No candidate will have a smooth path to the Democratic nomination, and the reality is she has some imposing obstacles between her and the prize. Last Friday the Boston Globe published an editorial that highlighted a negative story that has dogged Ms Warren since she first ran for the Senate seven years ago - her past claims of native American heritage. She had previously claimed in interviews, publications and her 1986 Texas state bar application that she had Cherokee Indian heritage - and was once listed by Harvard University as a minority hire. Ms Warren says she was simply recounting what her parents had told her and she received no benefit from that status. The Globe wasn't satisfied. \"Warren's never been a member of any tribe,\" the Globe writes. \"She's white. Playing loose with the facts about identity is bad within the current political climate of the Democratic Party, where issues of race have come to the fore.\" Last year the Massachusetts senator released results of a DNA test that showed some native American blood, but the move did nothing to quash the criticism - and, in fact, led to sharp criticism from tribal leaders. The controversy has also attracted the attention of President Trump, who has frequently mocked Ms Warren with the name \"Pocahontas,\" a reference to the 17th Century daughter of a Powhatan tribal chief captured by English settlers. On Saturday morning, the Trump campaign issued a press release blasting Ms Warren's \"dishonest campaign\" as well as criticising her policies, which it said would \"kill jobs and crush America's middle class\". It was the first time the Trump team has directly attacked a Democratic candidate on their campaign launch day. Even among Ms Warren's supporters at her Lawrence rally, there was some unease with the controversy - not with the nature of the allegations, but how the senator has responded to the subsequent fallout. \"I think she's probably handled it poorly,\" says Melissa Saalfield of Concord, Massachusetts. \"It's unfortunate because I think it's somewhat derailing her campaign.\" Saalfield, a fundraiser for a local hospital, laments that while scandals seem to \"roll off\" Mr Trump, Ms Warren can't seem to shake this one. And the pressure and scrutiny of the senator will only grow sharper as she gets deeper into the campaign. \"I suspect that there's a larger contingent that are determined to derail her because she poses a threat,\" Saalfield says. Part of the skittishness among some Democrats when it comes to Ms Warren comes from the memories of the 2016 campaign, when the story about then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server - which was similarly dismissed by many as a passing controversy - bedevilled the Democratic nominee right up until election day. The similarities between Ms Clinton and Ms Warren as candidates - both white women running in their late 60s, both with policy-heavy campaigns, both relentlessly mocked by Donald Trump - could, fairly or not, be enough to touch raw nerves and give some Democrats pause. A much-publicised Politico article questioned whether the \"ghosts\" of Ms Clinton's campaign would haunt Ms Warren. The article was criticised as painting both politicians with a sexist brush - but it hinted at a deeper danger to Ms Warren's presidential hopes. \"When women politicians - especially women politicians who embrace a feminist agenda - overtly seek power, many American men, and some American women, react with 'moral outrage,'\" writes the Atlantic's Peter Beinart. The Bernie factor There is another thread that could link Ms Clinton and Ms Warren, and that's the threat to their campaign posed by the candidacy of Bernie Sanders. It may not at first seem obvious. The Vermont senator ran well to Ms Clinton's left in 2016, offering a big-ticket progressive agenda like universal healthcare, free college education, sweeping environmental regulations and a tax structure to address growing income inequality. In 2019, that sounds a lot like Ms Warren's platform. There is, however, friction between the philosophical outlooks of the two New England senators. If Mr Sanders, as is expected, enters the race, those differences could lead to a pitched battle for the progressive portion of the Democratic primary vote. According to Zaid Jilani, a progressive commentator and writing fellow for the University of California Berkeley, Ms Warren is a pragmatist, while Mr Sanders is a political revolutionary. She has hired former Clinton and Obama campaign staffers friendly to the establishment; he is offering a challenge from the outside. She was a registered Republican in the 1990s; he has been a self-proclaimed \"Democratic Socialist\" since the 1960s. Her policies aim to smooth capitalism's rough edges and create a competitive economic environment; he would prefer government step in and run things. \"When you're president you have limited amount of political capital and time to get things passed,\" Jilani says. \"You prioritise your core beliefs, and her heart is much more about 'can we make markets fair'?\" In an October 2018 essay in the Guardian, Jacobin magazine editor Bhaskar Sunkara was even more direct. \"Though Warren is an ally of many progressive causes, the best chance that we have to not just construct some better policy, but reconfigure a generation of American politics lies with Sanders running and capturing both the Democratic primary and the presidency,\" he writes. The fight ahead If Ms Warren can't win over some of the progressive true believers who flocked to Mr Sanders in 2016, a campaign focused on economic inequality and reform could struggle to gain traction. Her ideas may pull the rest of the field to the left, but candidates with clearer constituencies within the Democratic Party could flourish while she stumbles. Ms Warren is set to give it a shot, however. Iowa's Reynard says the senator is putting together a top-notch campaign operation. \"It's not just some little investment,\" he says. \"This is a team that you build to win.\" Success there, followed by a strong showing in New Hampshire, which neighbours her home state of Massachusetts, could knock enough other candidates out to give her a clearer path in the slew of states that follow. She's spent more than a year collecting favours and building a campaign network across the US, and early success could position her to cash in on those investments. \"There will be plenty of doubters and cowards and armchair critics\" of her campaign, Ms Warren said in Lawrence on Saturday. \"But we learned a long time ago that you don't get what you don't fight for. We are in this fight for our lives, for our children, for our planet, for our futures, and we will not turn back.\" In just under a year, she'll have a chance to prove the doubters, cowards and critics wrong.

Almost nine in every 10 (89.4%) entries were awarded A* to C grades, up from 82.2% in 2019. A body representing some school leaders has called for an immediate independent review of the process for awarding exam grades this year. The GCSE results have been issued just days after the Education Minister Peter Weir said they would be solely based on grades provided by schools. Mr Weir also made a similar decision on A-Level and AS grades which had already been awarded to students. Revised A-Level and AS grades will now be made available to affected pupils on Friday. 'Not disadvantaged' However, many pupils in Northern Ireland who were expecting to get BTec results on Thursday will not receive them. On Wednesday evening, exam board Pearson announced it would re-grade BTecs in line with GCSEs and A-levels and told schools not to release the results they had been sent. On Thursday, the chief executive of the South Regional College said Northern Ireland's six regional colleges will reserve places for students who have already applied. Brian Doran told BBC News NI it was \"extremely disappointing that Pearson have come out at the 11th hour to make this decision\", but said the colleges will take steps today to ensure students are \"not disadvantaged\". \"Our focus rightly so is on the student who is affected by this,\" he continued. \"These students have already gone through a very difficult time, they're extremely anxious and this just simply adds to that particular problem. \"The delay for the BTec students and their progression into college will be addressed.\" Heather McKee, a director at South-Eastern Regional College (SERC), confirmed it will also be reserving places for students who have already applied. \"In addition, the college's application processes will remain open to allow other young people to submit applications for courses whilst awaiting their results, which they can confirm when they receive their grades,\" she said. \"We feel desperately sorry for the students affected in a year when they have already undergone far too much disruption and hope that Pearson will act to issue revised grades within days.\" Top grades At GCSE, almost one in every five entries (19.6%) from grammar schools was awarded an A* grade, up from 13.3% in 2019. More than half of entries (53.9%) from grammar schools were awarded A*-A grades. That compared to 17.7% in non-grammar schools. Almost twice as many entries from girls achieved the top A* grade as those from boys. Just under 9% of entries from boys achieved A* compared to 15.7% of entries from girls. In languages, there were further decreases in the number of pupils studying French but entries in Spanish and German rose in 2020. The GCSE data provided by the Northern Ireland exams board CCEA does not include results for the relatively small number of students who take GCSEs through English and Welsh exam boards. Those pupils will also receive results on Thursday, although aabout 98% of GCSEs in Northern Ireland are taken through CCEA. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) congratulated pupils but said an overall review was needed into the process for awarding grades in 2020. \"We are supportive of the decision not to rely on a statistical model for moderating grades which would have produced far too many anomalous results,\" Robert Wilson of ASCL said. \"However, it is imperative that we now understand what went wrong and why we have ended up in this situation.\" \"We will be writing to the minister for education to ask him to commission an immediate independent review of the process for awarding grades to GCSE, AS and A-level students in Northern Ireland this year.\" 'Very pleased' Nicole, a GCSE pupil at Carrickfergus Academy, said she was delighted with her results and will now progress to A-level subjects in English, science and art. She was awarded an A*, two As, two Bs a C* and a C in Thursday's results. Fellow Carrick Academy student Oliver said he was \"very pleased\" after attaining 5As, two Bs, a C* and a C. The school's principal, Dr Paula Downing, said it had been a \"very frustrating week\", but it was \"much more positive than last Thursday morning\" when the standardised AS and A-level results were published. \"There were a lot of results that we found very difficult to account for and explain,\" she told BBC Breakfast. \"It left a lot of our students feeling very disappointed not knowing what the outcomes would be for them.\" She said around a third of the Academy's pupils are still waiting on results to be fully confirmed due to the delay with BTec grading, however, she said predicted teacher results \"allow them to make decisions\".", "output": "There has been a significant rise in the number of top GCSE grades in Northern Ireland.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said it was time to tackle nearly 20m tonnes of waste currently produced by Scotland every year. The zero waste plan includes tough new recycling and landfill targets over the next 15 years. But some environmentalists say it could lead to the construction of a wave of new incinerators across Scotland. New measures will include landfill bans for specific types of waste and separate collections of some waste to boost re-use and recycling opportunities. A new 70% target has been set for all waste to be recycled by 2025 and a maximum 5% target for all waste to be sent to landfill by the same year. Speaking at the official launch in Edinburgh, Mr Lochhead said the zero waste plan would also help deliver progressive landfill bans. It is hoped that no waste with re-use or recycling potential will be placed in landfill by 2020. He also argued that the plan could deliver major benefits to the economy as well as the environment. \"Scotland is embarking on the zero waste journey to protect our environment and help our economy. We can't go on as business as usual because we can't afford to and because resources are finite,\" he said. \"In recent years, the people of Scotland have made substantial progress in cutting waste but households, businesses and wider society still produce enough waste to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool every 10 minutes.\" The plan drew a mixed response from environmentalists and analysts. Environmental impact Mark O'Dowd, a solicitor with international law firm, HBJ Gateley Wareing, said that in order to meet Scottish government and European Union objectives, \u00a36.5bn would have to be spent up to 2025 to deliver a zero waste target. \"What is required is clear investment on next generation infrastructure, in the likes of energy from waste plants, recycling plants and an overhaul of rubbish collections, as well as improving grid connections,\" he said. He said the planning system would need to be streamlined and failure to achieve the statutory targets would have a damaging environmental impact and would hit the taxpayer hard through EU fines. Scottish local authorities welcomed the publication of the plan. But some environmentalists said they were concerned at the prospect of more incinerators being built. Green MSP Robin Harper told BBC Scotland he believed a zero waste strategy could be achieved but he remained worried that a 25% cap on incineration of waste could \"turn into a target\". He added: \"For every tonne of waste we could make about \u00a3600 in recycled products if we could get all the system working.

It could end more than four months of wrangling since inconclusive elections in September. But the deal will still need to be approved by SPD members. Many in the party fear that re-entering a coalition with CDU/CSU could damage it in the long term. In a joint news conference on Wednesday, Chancellor Merkel said the agreement gave the basis for a \"good and stable government\". SPD leader Martin Schulz thanked the conservatives for making what he said were tough compromises. In a tweet, he said the deal \"achieved a lot for people\" and he would be recommending that his party members accept it. What has been agreed? The SPD looks set to control six ministries, including finance and foreign affairs. Mr Schulz has confirmed he will step down as SPD leader in March and instead become foreign minister, if the coalition deal is approved by SPD members. He will be replaced as SPD leader by former Labour and Social Affairs Minister Andrea Nahles. The SPD's 460,000 members will have the final say on the whole agreement in a postal vote, the result of which will be announced on 2 March. Those opposed to any deal with Mrs Merkel include a new group within the SPD calling itself NoGroKo (no grand coalition). Why does Germany's government matter? By Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin Handing Germany's centre-left control of finance, foreign and labour policy would have a big impact on the rest of the world, particularly Europe. The promised spending spree on infrastructure and services will likely boost Germany's economy further, and the tax cuts may give an added boost to German consumer spending. A Social Democrat finance ministry - replacing pro-austerity Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble - is more likely to go along with French President Macron's ambitious plans for EU reform, by allowing more German support for struggling eurozone economies. Mr Macron wants to create a common eurozone budget and a eurozone finance minister, but Germany has so far been wary of any move that might lead to what it calls a \"transfer union\" used to prop up indebted governments. An SPD-led finance ministry could be much more amenable to Mr Macron's proposals. And at home these powerful ministries would help the SPD push for key left-wing policies, such as better rights for employees. All of this could go down well with SPD party members, who will vote on any final coalition deal. An agreement which looks like a win for the SPD will increase the likelihood that they will vote yes. But if they vote no, then the most likely outcome could be fresh elections. Why has this taken so long? Mr Schulz at first ruled out going back into government with Mrs Merkel's centre-right CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU. The parties had seen their popularity drop after being in coalition on and off since 2005. He changed his mind when CDU/CSU coalition talks with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens broke down. Both Mr Schulz and Mrs Merkel have been under pressure to see off a challenge by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which became the third biggest party in September's election. Other than distributing ministries, there have been big stumbling blocks in the coalition talks over workers' rights and healthcare. Immigration, Europe, and tax, have also been points of contention. What has the reaction been? European Union allies, such as France, see Germany as a pillar of stability in the bloc and have been hoping Mrs Merkel succeeds. Top EU officials, including the Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, welcomed the breakthrough on Wednesday. But inside Germany, FDP leader Christian Lindner said the CDU had been \"willing to give the SPD everything - key ministries and top positions - to keep the chancellorship\". He said in a tweet: \"Relaunching the German model in this parliament with this arrangement and this chancellor will clearly not be possible.\" Meanwhile Alice Weidel, the head of the far-right AfD's group of MPs in the new parliament, criticised the coalition's proposed immigration policy, which would see up to 220,000 asylum seekers given residency each year and a scheme to encourage highly-qualified people to move to Germany.

No.\" Labour has called on the government to \"use the window\" of the February half-term to vaccinate all teachers and support staff, ahead of potential plans to re-open schools in England from 8 March. But what does the data show? Teachers in England and Wales were not at significantly higher risk of death from coronavirus than the working age population, ONS figures covering March-December 2020 suggest. But there was one group where the risk was higher. Male secondary school teachers saw about two-and-a-half times as many deaths as men of the same age from an equivalent professional background - just under 40 deaths per 100,000 people. But the difference was much less pronounced when comparing teachers with all working-age men. What about other professions? Looking at other occupations, female nurses were 50% more likely to die than the general female working-age population, and male nurses were more than twice as likely to die as other working-age men. Social care workers were also much more likely to die from coronavirus. Frontline and social care workers are in priority group two for the vaccine, while teachers are not currently being prioritised as a profession. There are other key worker groups - such as bus and taxi drivers - who had a higher average death rate than teachers and have also not been prioritised for the vaccine. Jobs involving regular exposure to coronavirus and working in close proximity to others have higher coronavirus death rates, Ben Humberstone, head of Health Analysis and Life Events at the ONS says. But although these death rate figures are adjusted for age, they don't take into account other key factors such as ethnicity. \"There are a complex combination of factors that influence the risk of death; from your age and your ethnicity, where you live and who you live with, to pre-existing health conditions,\" he says. Labour is calling for \"key workers in critical professions\" to be added to the first phase of the vaccination programme. What about infections? Rates of infection across different jobs are less understood. One thing we have is estimates of occupations with the highest potential exposure to coronavirus, conducted by the ONS back in May. Medical roles including dentistry and nursing have among the highest exposure to disease, it suggests, although it does not take into account that these groups are likely to be wearing PPE. School workers had moderate exposure to disease, with primary and nursery teachers more exposed than secondary. As school buildings have often been closed to most pupils since March, many teachers may not have had as much regular exposure to children and other staff as they will do when schools fully reopen this year. Supporters of moving teachers up the list say it will also allow schools to reopen safely and smoothly, with less staff sickness and potentially lower rates of transmission.

Perhaps most important of all, however, he is the first foreigner to run the Bank in its more than 300-year history. In other words, he is something of an outsider, and will be scrutinised all the more for it. So what can we, and he, expect from his first few weeks in charge? A lot to live up to Mr Carney will have to convince his new colleagues, the City and the media he is up the job. And here, his reputation could be as much of a hindrance as a help. Being described by Chancellor George Osborne as the \"outstanding central banker of his generation\" is quite some introduction. No pressure there then. His appointment was almost universally praised in the media, which saw it as bold and imaginative. Whether it was viewed as such within the Bank, given that deputy governor Paul Tucker was odds-on favourite for the job, is another matter. Mr Tucker has since announced he will be leaving the Bank. What is certain, though, is that expectations are almost impossibly high. Settling in The new boss will have to settle in to what appears, at least from the outside, to be a rather stuffy, old-school institution. David Blanchflower, ex-member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College in the US, describes it as \"stodgy\". \"There is an unwritten rule that if you want to take your jacket off [at meetings], you have to wait for the governor. The Bank is very stuffy. The Federal Reserve is not like that, and Mark Carney is not like that.\" Whether he adapts to the Bank's culture or it adapts to him will be important. No doubt a balance will be struck, but Prof Blanchflower is in no doubt the new boss will have to bring in his own people and \"start cracking heads\". This, he argues, is the backdrop to the appointment of the Bank's first chief operating officer last month, Charlotte Hogg - the first senior female appointment in the Bank's history. Honeymoon period In his first week in the job, Mr Carney will chair the MPC's monthly meeting. It is here that the tone will be set for the rest of his five-year tenure, and the notes of the meeting published two weeks later will give an important insight in to how receptive the rest of the committee is to his ideas. Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics believes now is the time for him to push through change, when the feel-good factor may encourage a renewed spirit of co-operation. For there are major divisions within the MPC. Mr Carney's predecessor Sir Mervyn King was outvoted for five straight months when the committee voted six-three against expanding the Bank's policy of quantitative easing (QE), essentially pumping money into the economy to help stimulate growth. And it's not just the MPC Mr Carney needs to keep onside. The press is a fickle beast and questions have already been raised about his \u00a3480,000 salary, while comments from his wife about the difficulty of finding acceptable accommodation for their \u00a3250,000 a year housing allowance could come back to bite. Questions are also being raised about the current state of the Canadian economy, hitherto held up as an example of how to withstand a global financial crisis. As Ms Redwood says: \"Mr Carney may be getting out at the right time.\" Down to business Whether Mr Carney has arrived in the UK at the right time depends on your view of the economy. \"In a way, he has been given something of a poisoned chalice,\" says Prof Blanchflower. \"The economy is not in recovery, it is not healing, it is not [even] out of intensive care.\" Ms Redwood sees things differently, arguing there has been a tentative recovery, but what is certain is that more needs to be done to turn the economy round. And this is what Mr Carney has been brought in to do. There are a number of obvious places he can start. First is to expand QE and inject more money into the economy. Mr Carney may be able to persuade his colleagues to do so if the Bank widens the remit of QE beyond buying gilts, says Ms Redwood. Buying up private sector assets to the tune of \u00a310bn has already been agreed in principle, for example. Mr Carney could also cut interest rates further, and after the Bank's deputy governor Charlie Bean raised the subject recently, this option is \"back on table\", says Prof Blanchflower. Reducing the rate paid on bank reserves, as a way of encouraging them to lend more, is another possibility. Boosting bank lending will also be a priority. This is likely to be a popular commitment among the MPC given its enthusiasm for the government's Funding for Lending Scheme, which is specifically designed to lift bank lending. Mr Carney could, for example, relax banks' liquidity restraints. One thing he is likely to introduce is some form of so-called forward guidance, essentially giving an indication of future policy. He has all but said he intends to be more open in this respect. You just have to look at markets' fearful reaction to Federal Reserve head Ben Bernanke's recent hints that the US's own QE programme may begin winding down at the end of this year to see the importance of managing the expectations of investors. Reassurances that interest rates will remain low for a set period would, for example, allay many investors' fears. Such a commitment could even be pegged to the rate of unemployment - until it falls below a certain level, rates will remain on hold. Of course it's one thing making promises and quite another convincing others to believe them, let alone making them happen. What is certain, however, is that double dip or no double dip, the economy is struggling to show any signs of meaningful recovery and Mr Carney has a great opportunity to push through policies to help stimulate growth. Just as importantly, markets expect him to do so.", "output": "All eyes in the City will be firmly fixed on Bank of England governor Mark Carney in the coming weeks.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Cardiff council said boating activities had been suspended on Roath Park lake and it has warned people to keep their pets out of the water.

They believe that the establishment is not above fixing the vote to thwart the democratic will of the electorate. The run up to the referendum has seen the rise of the hashtag #usepens which urges people to reject the traditional pencils supplied at polling stations and instead use a pen to mark their cross on the voting paper. The thinking behind this is that it will then be impossible for some unknown hand to use an eraser to rub out your cross and make another mark in the other box. The hashtag seems to reflect the sentiment captured in a YouGov poll which suggested 46% of Leave voters thought it likely that the EU referendum would be rigged. However, some on the other side of the argument in the Remain camp, clearly regard the thinking behind #usepens as an absurd conspiracy theory and that those who advocate it are members of the tin hat brigade. Why are you given a pencil to vote? The theory of pencils marks being erased in any vote is an old concern. BBC Trending spoke to the Electoral Commission to ask why pencils and not pens are issued in the voting booth. In an email it explained that: \"the use of a pen or pencil when completing the ballot paper is not specified in legislation. In the UK, pencils are traditionally used for the purposes of marking ballot papers and are made available inside polling stations for voters to use. Having said this, there is nothing to stop a voter from using a pen to mark their vote - there is no legal requirement for ballot papers to be marked with a pencil. Pencils have been used partly for historic and partly for practical reasons.\" More information on how to vote on polling day can be found here.

A report by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said banks were also benefiting from customers taking loans and credit cards with the same bank. FCA boss Andrew Bailey said: \"There is no such thing as free banking\". The FCA said that the main High Street banks had a captive audience of customers who did not switch and who were targeted for cross-selling of other products. These major banks, despite the emergence of more challenger banks, still had control of more than 80% of the personal current account market. The regulator found that banks were making profits from customers who held money in accounts that paid little or no interest. Those with high balances were particularly lucrative for the banks. Often, loyal customers have savings and current accounts at the same bank, instead of seeking out better interest rates for their savings. As a result, they were receiving interest between 30% and 50% lower than they could generate elsewhere, the FCA found. About half of customers who had a credit card and a current account used the same bank for both, and a similar proportion had a loan with the same bank - even though these might not offer the best deals. Mr Bailey said the report was helping inform the FCA about the complexities of the current account market, and comes after a series of investigations into why few people shop around for these financial products. Overdraft row Overdraft revenue, including interest and other fees and charges, was responsible for more than 30% of banks' personal current account income A recent FCA report revealed that more than three million people have dipped into an unauthorised overdraft in the course of a year, exceeding their agreed limit. Yet, the majority of unarranged overdraft charges are concentrated on less than 2% of customers, some of whom are vulnerable. The regulator has already proposed that banks offer more information to customers, including mobile alerts, about when and how they go into the red. It is also considering a ban on fixed fees, which can lead to relatively high charges for a small unarranged overdraft. Part of discussions will be a \"potential backstop price cap for overdrafts\", but it is not an immediate proposal. The FCA said that it needed to overcome potential legal issues that had been encountered in the past. This stance has been criticised by debt and consumer charities, many of which want to see a speedy cap on the cost of overdrafts, to protect these potentially vulnerable customers. The FCA collected information from 45 firms across the range of the market, including major banks, small retail banks, building societies, specialist lenders and new digital banks. A spokesman for UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said: \"Management of personal finance is key and overdrafts are important for many consumers as a short-term solution to smooth cashflow. \"Lenders are developing and enhancing a series of measures to help those who regularly use their overdraft, including new ways to better identify and support customers with persistent overdraft debt. We will continue to work closely with the FCA through the next stage of its review and this report provides useful insight into what is a complex set of issues.\"", "output": "Up to half of the profits made by big banks from current accounts come from just one in 10 customers, according to the industry regulator.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Rodrigo Borda, 39, and Sergio Miranda, 45, said it was a day of much joy and emotion, but also of responsibility.

And what do some people have against it? Here's what you need to know. How many people have voted early so far this year? According to the US Elections Project, as of 2 November more than 99 million Americans had voted early - either by post or in person. This is already more than the total number of early votes cast in the 2016 election.

By his count, the state with the highest number of early voters so far is California, where more than 12 million people have already voted. Next is Texas, where the 9.7 million total has surpassed the total turnout for the state in 2016. Florida has had more than 8.9 million early voters so far. The number of people who've voted early so far is also already 72% of the total number of people who voted in the election in 2016. Who is voting early? As well as knowing where this year's early voters live, we are also now getting a sense of who these voters are. First of all, we know that a lot of early voters this year are young. According to the Tufts University Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (Circle), more than five million young people - classified as those aged between 18 and 29 - had cast early votes by 26 October. About three million of those young votes were cast in 14 battleground states, Circle adds. Polls have also shown that young voters could turn out in greater numbers this year than in the last election. In 2016, turnout was just over 46% among 18 to 29-year-olds - while 71% of people older than 65 voted. This year, a Harvard Youth Poll suggests that as many as 63% of people the same age will vote. More African Americans are voting early this year, too. According to analysis from data firm TargetSmart, more than six times as many black voters had cast early votes by 18 October this year, compared to the same point in 2016. Why are so many people voting early? One overarching reason is the coronavirus pandemic. The traditional way of voting - thousands of people going to a single polling station on one particular day, queuing with other people for hours, and standing in polling booths that are in proximity to each other - is not conducive to social distancing measures, particularly when not all states have mandated face coverings indoors. So for this election, at least 30 states have made adjustments to make it easier and more accessible for people to cast absentee votes. This includes, for example, removing strict requirements for people to have an excuse to have a postal vote, or allowing people to cite their concerns about Covid-19 as their excuse. Some states have also implemented ballot drop boxes, so people don't have to go to a crowded polling station, or have offered to prepay postage on election ballots that are sent in by post. Others, such as California and Colorado, have proactively sent all eligible voters mail-in ballots - a practice known as universal mail-in voting. In North Carolina, the state's board of elections extended the deadline for postal ballots, saying that any ballots received up until 12 November would be counted - as long as they were postmarked on or before 3 November. Some states have also brought the start date for early in-person voting forward from last year - for example, Texas moved its start date forward by six days, from 19 to 13 October. Minnesota and South Dakota were the earliest states to begin early voting, with in-person voting starting 46 days before the election. And while not all states have in-person early voting, those that don't are accepting early mail-in ballots. Having said that, voting early doesn't necessarily mean voting easily. In Georgia, for example, thousands of people waited for hours to vote at in-person polling stations. And in Pennsylvania, the state supreme court ruled that ballots needed to be mailed in with a secrecy envelope hiding the identity of the voter. However, because this decision was announced so soon before voting opened, it caused concern that significant numbers of so-called \"naked ballots\" would be declared invalid. There are also currently more than 300 lawsuits in 44 states concerning how absentee votes are counted, who is allowed to vote early, and how mail-in ballots are collected. Republican-run states say restrictions are necessary to prevent voter fraud, but Democrats say these are attempts at voter suppression. How could this impact the election? Perhaps the most obvious way an increase in early voting will affect the election is by driving up overall turnout. Prof McDonald, who runs the US Elections Project, told Reuters news agency that he predicts that a record 150 million people could vote in this election - which would be about 65% of eligible voters in the country, and the highest turnout by percentage since 1908. And according to Prof McDonald's data so far, the mail-in ballots are already leaning towards a Democrat majority. However, this isn't a reliable indicator of who will win the election in the end. President Trump launched a campaign against postal voting earlier this year, arguing that expanded mail-in voting would lead to the \"most corrupt election\" in US history and promoting claims that people would be able to vote more than once in the absentee ballot system. His dislike of postal voting may influence some of his supporters to wait until election day to cast their vote in person. To clarify - there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the absentee voting system. In fact, the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice.", "output": "Early voting is exactly what it sounds like - it's where people are allowed to vote before the scheduled election day.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The employees are demanding several key changes in how sexual misconduct allegations are dealt with at the firm, including a call to end forced arbitration - a move which would make it possible for victims to sue. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has told staff he supports their right to take the action. \"I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,\" he said in an all-staff email. \"I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society\u2026 and, yes, here at Google, too.\" A Twitter feed titled @googlewalkout documented the movement at Google's international offices. Google staff in Singapore, Zurich, London, Tokyo, Berlin and New York were among those to take part. Web developer Sam Dutton, who joined the walkout in London, told the BBC: \"We're walking out to support colleagues in any workplace that have suffered harassment and to ensure that perpetrators aren't protected or rewarded.\" What led to the walkout? Anger has boiled over in the past week since the New York Times alleged that one high-profile executive received a $90m (\u00a369m) payout after he left the firm, despite what Google considered a \u201ccredible\u201d allegation of sexual misconduct. Andy Rubin, known as the \u201ccreator\u201d of the Android mobile operating system, denies the accusation. On Tuesday, another executive - this time from the company\u2019s X research lab - also resigned. Richard DeVaul was said to have made unwanted advances towards a woman who was recently interviewed for a job in which she would have reported to him. Mr DeVaul has not commented since his resignation, but has in the past called the incident an \"error of judgement\". At least 48 other employees were sacked for sexual harassment without receiving a payout, Mr Pichai told staff. He admitted the New York Times\u2019 report had been \"difficult to read\". What do the employees want? Staff involved in Thursday's walkout left notes on their desks telling colleagues: \"I\u2019m not at my desk because I\u2019m walking out with other Googlers and contractors to protest sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency, and a workplace culture that\u2019s not working for everyone.\" They have also made formal demands to Google\u2019s management. They are: What is forced arbitration? Forced arbitration, a common contract clause for Silicon Valley workers, demands any disputes are dealt with internally rather than through other methods such as the courts. Critics of forced arbitration say it is used to not only protect the reputations of both the company and the accused, but also to silence victims who are unable to appeal against decisions or take further action. \"Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,\u201d said Mr Pichai in a statement on Wednesday evening. \"We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\" What else are Google employees angry about? Co-ordinated action of this scale is unprecedented at a Silicon Valley company, but follows a trend for increasingly impassioned employee activism. \"Women are fed up, and I don't think it's just women,\u201d said Prof Kellie McElhaney, from the Haas School of Business. \"There are a lot of \u2018manbassadors' out there who are equally as fed up and using their positions of power and voice, which can cost Google money. I think you have to hit these companies where it hurts. \"I think it empowers other Google offices when women and men are watching this happen, that they can do a similar action that's not just sitting by or making comments to one another or sharing emails.\" In the past year, Google employees have spoken out strongly against the company\u2019s work with the US Department of Defense, as well as plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a search product. The Tech Workers Coalition, a San Francisco-based advocacy group, said the dispute over the treatment of women was just one of several that tech companies need to address. \u201cWe stand in solidarity with the Google workers,\u201d a spokesperson for the group said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the executives won\u2019t do this for us so we\u2019re taking matters into our own hands.\"", "output": "Staff at Google offices around the world have staged an unprecedented series of walkouts in protest at the company's treatment of women.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The left side of Brett Dolby's body became trapped in the machine at Scapa Healthcare in Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire, in April last year.

A third of graduates are working in London and south-east England. There are also signs that more young graduates are self-employed. This UK report from the Higher Education Careers Service Unit (Hecsu) and Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services provides a detailed look at the paths taken six months after graduation - based on the cohort leaving university in 2011. Bar work Despite rising number of graduates and a struggling economy hitting recruitment, the graduate jobs market has remained relatively resilient. It echoes previous studies showing that in the long term, graduates are likely to earn higher incomes than non-graduates and are less likely to face unemployment. It also reflects that the jobs market is changing - with more demand for graduates and skilled workers. This latest study shows a stable picture - with 62% of recent graduates in employment, 9% unemployed, 14% staying on for further study and the remainder in a mixture of training while working and other activities. This snapshot, taken before many young people have settled into their intended careers, shows what type of jobs graduates are doing six months after leaving their first degrees. It shows that many are still in non-graduate jobs. The most typical sector is in retail, catering and bar staff, representing about 15% of young graduates. There are 13% in health sector jobs, 8% in business and financial jobs and about 7% in media and design. Few people will have entered jobs which usually require postgraduate training, such as law. The weak economy might have inspired more students to start up their own businesses - with a steady upward entrepreneurial trend in self-employment. This is now approaching 5% of university leavers - up from 3% in the middle of the last decade. Geographical spread Cuts in public sector spending could also be affecting the jobs market, says the survey - with reductions in the numbers of graduates going into a range of posts in health, education and social services. In terms of the geographical spread of jobs for new graduates, there is a strong bias towards London and the south-east of England. One in five of all recent graduates who are in employment are working in London, by far the largest share of the graduate jobs market. The next biggest provider of jobs is the south-east of England. In contrast, within England the lowest proportion of graduates are working in the North East and east Midlands. In terms of salaries, the typical range of earnings was between about \u00a318,000 and \u00a324,000 for those graduates who had jobs six months after leaving university. The deputy research director at Hecsu, Charlie Ball, says that in a \"difficult jobs market\" and a struggling economy \"over 166,000 of last year's graduates were known to be working in the UK six months after leaving university - nearly 8,000 more than the previous year\". \"The figures show that even in difficult times, graduates can and do get jobs.\"", "output": "The employment prospects of graduates are \"much better than feared\", although this might include a stretch of catering and bar work, says a survey.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The incident happened at about 16:30 BST on Tuesday at a junction in the Moseley area of the city.

Lord Hain said it showed that Brexit campaigners \"sold Leave voters a pup\". \"They were not straight with them. Every person I bumped into on the street believed that Vote Leave would reduce or stop immigration, and Leave campaigners encouraged that belief. It was central to their success,\" he said. \"This is frankly shameless and shameful to renege on the promises that were made.\" Earlier David Davies said the concept of a system continuing \"some sort of freedom of movement\" between the UK and the EU was \"probably right\" if \"benefits and council houses\" were stopped for EU migrants after Brexit The Vote Leave campaign had called for voters to \"take back control\" of borders, backing an \"Australian-style\" points-based immigration system. A majority of Welsh voters - as across the UK - backed Brexit in June's referendum, with much of the debate focused on immigration and the EU's system of freedom of movement. Currently, EU citizens are able to live and work across the 28-member bloc. Since Leave's success in the poll the nature of the UK's future relationship with the European Union after Brexit, and how immigration would work with remaining EU states, has been subject to debate. \"We can't do anything about immigration from within the EU until we leave,\" the Conservative MP told the BBC's Good Morning Wales radio programme on Thursday. \"Even then I think we are probably going to ensure some sort of freedom of movement for countries already in the EU, and I think that's probably right actually.

He claimed that because of EU membership, there was \"uncontrolled migration of mainly young men\" who were coming to the UK \"from a variety of countries looking for a better way of life\". Andrew RT Davies added: \"During the referendum campaign many voters told us that they want the government to have the ability to control the number of people coming to the UK, and that's absolutely right. \"At times that number may be higher, or lower - and would be set according to our priorities at the time.\"", "output": "The head of Labour's Welsh campaign to stay in the EU, Lord Hain, has called two prominent leave campaigners shameless for supporting some freedom of movement between the UK and the EU.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "\"While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics,\" company CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted. Social media rival Facebook recently ruled out a ban on political ads. News of the ban divided America's political camps for the 2020 election. Brad Parscale, manager of President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, said the ban was \"yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives\". But Bill Russo, spokesman for the campaign to elect Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, said: \"When faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out.\" Reacting to the move, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's policy. \"In a democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians or the news,\" he said during a conference call with journalists. Twitter's ban will be enforced from 22 November, with full details released by 15 November. How does Dorsey justify the ban? Mr Dorsey explained his position in a thread of tweets. Internet political ads, he said, presented \"entirely new challenges to civic discourse\". These challenges included \"machine learning-based optimisation of messaging\", \"micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes\". \"It's not credible,\" he wrote, \"for us to say: 'We're working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, but if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well...they can say whatever they want!'\" Countering the argument that the new policy might be seen as favouring leaders already in office, he pointed out that \"many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising\". Ads in support of voter registration would not be affected by the ban, he added. How is news of the ban playing out? Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic candidate who lost to Mr Trump in the 2016 presidential election, welcomed Twitter's ban and appeared to challenge Facebook to rethink its stance. Social media analyst Carl Miller said it was \"one of the first times a tech giant has stepped back in concern for the enormous disruptions they're doing to the institutions that don't move as quickly as them\". Jack Dorsey's decision is more significant for its timing and the principle it upholds than the practical effects it will have on modern democracy. Political ads on Twitter are just a fraction, in scale and impact, of those on Facebook. Mr Dorsey knew - and his chief financial officer has since confirmed - that this decision would have little impact on the company's bottom line. They therefore calculated that they could win a thumbs up from regulators and public opinion at little cost to the business. And they could also mischievously provoke Facebook, who are in a more difficult position on the subject. It cannot be mere coincidence that Mr Dorsey's tweet was just a fortnight after Mark Zuckerberg's speech on the same subject. A dividing line between the companies is useful for Twitter. It puts the onus on Facebook to once again defend its stance. It is very easy to find damaging or deceitful ads online. But asking Californian companies to decide what should or shouldn't be in the public domain grants them enormous power that is hard to undo. They already make such decisions on things like violent or hateful content; asking them to go further is, in effect, turning them into editorial arbiters of public conversation. That is, journalists. What is Facebook's policy? Earlier this month, Mr Zuckerberg went before an audience of students in Washington DC to defend the firm's decision not to ban political adverts that contain falsehoods. He had considered barring all political ads on his platforms, but said he believed the move would favour incumbent politicians and whoever the media chose to cover. The company should \"err on the side of greater expression\", he argued. Another spokesman for Mr Biden had criticised the firm for refusing to remove a video posted by Mr Trump's 2020 re-election campaign which promoted an unproven conspiracy theory involving the former vice-president and his son. \"It is unacceptable for any social media company to knowingly allow deliberately misleading material to corrupt its platform,\" TJ Ducklo said. Fellow Democratic candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren then paid to run an intentionally misleading advert on Facebook that claimed Mr Zuckerberg had personally endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. She said she had done so to protest against the firm's decision to allow politicians to run ads containing \"known lies\". How much impact will this have on the US election? US federal campaigns are expected to spend about $6bn (\u00a34.6bn) on advertising but most of it will go on TV ads, with about 20% put into digital ads, advertising research firm Kantar estimates. Twitter is also much smaller than Facebook. In February, it said it had 126m daily active users while Facebook boasted 1.63bn in September.

South of the border, the Sunday Mirror, Sunday People and the Daily Star have all seen substantial rises in their sales over the past four months.

Meanwhile, in an address to a smaller crowd of several thousand, Mr Lukashenko blasted opponents as \"rats\". He called on supporters to defend their country and independence. The rival rallies were taking place after Russia agreed to offer security assistance in the case of external military threats to Belarus. It emerged that Mr Lukashenko had twice spoken to President Vladimir Putin over the weekend. The long-time Belarus leader also voiced concerns over Nato military exercises taking place in neighbouring Poland and Lithuania and launched into a tirade against the Western military alliance. Nato - which sent four battle groups led by Britain, Canada, Germany and the US to the Baltic countries after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in Ukraine - rejected allegations of a build-up in the region. The unrest in Belarus erupted after Mr Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in last Sunday's election, the result of which has been condemned amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging. The Central Election Commission says Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, won 80.1% of the vote and the main opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 10.12%. But Ms Tikhanovskaya insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. How will Russia respond? Russian TV news bulletins have been making ominous parallels between Belarus 2020 and Ukraine 2014. Ukraine's pro-Western revolution led to Moscow sending in its special operations forces to annex Crimea and Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Six years on, could Russia's military intervene in Belarus? On paper, at least, such a move would appear counter-productive. The opposition movement in Belarus is not anti-Russia/pro-Europe - it is anti-Lukashenko. If Russia were to send in troops to shore up the Belarusian leader, it risks alienating the Belarusian people and creating anti-Moscow sentiment. True, Moscow is determined to keep Belarus within what it sees as Russia's sphere of influence. The Kremlin's ultimate goal is deeper integration with its neighbour - a fully-fledged union state (with Vladimir Putin at the helm). It could still achieve this through political leverage. The Kremlin has a pathological fear of \"coloured revolution\" on its doorstep. But Minsk 2020 is not Kyiv 2014. Belarus is not choosing between East and West. The Belarusian people are outraged by the brutality of their security forces. So much so that even Mr Lukashenko's traditional base - including the state factory workers - are deserting him. What is happening in Minsk? Local media reports suggest that around 31,000 people took part in the pro-government rally, though the Ministry of Internal Affairs estimated that the number was closer to 65,000. Speaking to supporters, Mr Lukashenko said he did not like rallies and did not need anyone to defend him. He said it was not his fault that he had to ask for their help. Rejecting calls for a re-run of the presidential election he said Belarus would \"die as a state\" if that happened. \"You came here so that for the first time in a quarter-century you could defend your country, your independence, your wives, sisters and children,\" he said. He added that the opposition would \"crawl like rats out of a hole\" if they were not suppressed this time. \"This will be the beginning of your end - you will go down on your knees like in Ukraine and other countries and pray, God knows to whom.\" There were reports of state sector workers being forced to attend or face the threat of losing their jobs. For days, workers at state-run factories have staged walkouts and many have joined street marches against the president. As the president spoke, around 220,000 of anti-Lukashenko protesters gathered near the Stela Minsk Hero City World War Two memorial in central Minsk, according to news website Tut.by. They had answered a call for weekend rallies from Ms Tikhanovskaya. The opposition leader had gone into exile in Lithuania after she registered a complaint with electoral authorities and spent seven hours in detention. Maria Kolesnikova, a former member of Ms Tikhanovskaya's team, addressed the crowds. \"You are incredible, I love you\", she said, before appealing to officials, security officials and judges. \"Guys, this is the last chance. Take the side of the good and the people. We are in the majority. We are power.\" Supporters also turned out in other cities. The mayor of Brest was booed by protesters when he tried to speak to crowds. In Gomel, demonstrators removed the official flag of Belarus from the city's flagpole and replaced it with the red and white flag of the opposition. Belarusian footballer Ilya Shkurin announced he would not play for his country until President Lukashenko stepped down and then scored his first goal for Russian premier league team CSKA Moscow. What's happening politically? As the unrest continued, Mr Lukashenko sought help from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Lukashenko said President Putin had promised to provide what he called comprehensive assistance in the event of external military threats to Belarus. The two leaders had a second conversation on Sunday, in which the Kremlin said they discussed \"the situation in Belarus, taking into consideration the pressure the republic was being put under from outside\". Mr Putin told Mr Lukashenko Russia was ready to assist Belarus \"in accordance with the collective military pact if necessary\". EU foreign ministers agreed on Friday to prepare new sanctions against Belarusian officials responsible for \"violence, repression and the falsification of election results\". The US has also condemned the election as \"not free and fair\". The prime ministers of three Baltic republics - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - later \"expressed deep concern at the violent crackdown... and the political repression of the opposition by the authorities\". Lithuania and Latvia have previously said they are prepared to mediate in Belarus, provided the authorities stopped violence against protesters and formed a national council with members of civil society. They warned that the alternative was sanctions. The leaders said the presidential election was \"neither free nor fair\" and called for a \"transparent\" vote \"with the participation of international observers\". More about the protests in Belarus Ms Tikhanovskaya left for Lithuania following the election after she publicly denounced the results. She had sent her children to Lithuania for safety before the vote.

Jan Melia, from the organisation, said it was \"hugely frustrating\" that it was \"just sitting there gathering dust\". The new law recognised that domestic abuse happened over time and for a long time, she added. According to statistics published on the PSNI website, there were 29,166 domestic abuse incidents record in 2016-17, the most in more than a decade. However, the level of domestic abuse crimes recorded dropped to 13,933, in comparison to 14,073 in 2015-16. In 2016-17, 69% of domestic abuse crime victims were female and 31% were male. During the same year, more than 50% of relationships between domestic abuse victims and offenders were categorised as current or ex spouse/partner. Coercive control model Jan Melia says there is currently no single piece of legislation that describes domestic abuse. \"What we have is different pieces of law that have a domestic motivation and are cobbled together to create a case,\" she said. The new law would put domestic abuse \"up there\", she said, and would give police and the courts \"more tools to their armoury\" in terms of prosecutions. \"The legislation is based on the coercive control model,\" she said. \"It's recognition that violence happens as part of an ongoing continuum of behaviour. \"For example, a physical assault can happen and then there's a period where emotional abuse happens, but there's no physical assault and then physical assault comes back.\" Ms Melia added: \"I would like the law out there... and with that a whole campaign about emotional abuse. \"Women tell us they don't often recognise abuse until it become physical but by then it is often too late. \"What we want to say to women is emotional abuse is abuse and this piece of legislation will help do that.\" Reports every 18 minutes A seminar was held in Belfast on Friday by the Bar Council for NI, to discuss \"developments in national law for protecting and supporting women who have suffered gender violence\".

The defendant, who was held at secret US prison sites before being transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006, is the first prisoner from that facility to be tried in a civilian court. His case is being watched carefully for indications as how civilian trials might be handled for other so-called \"high-value detainees\", including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed. 'Coercive interrogation' In Mr Ghailani's case, the prosecution opted to forego the use of statements the defendant had made during questioning by the CIA at US \"black sites\" as well as in Guantanamo Bay. Defence lawyers argue his statements were made under duress, and as such are inadmissible. In choosing to proceed without this evidence, prosecutors can avoid debates over the use of coercive interrogation techniques. But the decision not to use these statements, which prosecutors say amount to a confession, means the government will not be using some of its most powerful evidence - including Mr Ghailani's admission that he had later worked as a driver for Osama Bin Laden and had met several of the 9/11 attackers. The identity of Hussein Abebe - from whom Judge Lewis Kaplan refused to allow testimony - was revealed during the course of these interrogations. Government prosecutors had argued that Mr Abebe, who claims to have sold Mr Ghailani the explosives used in the Tanzania bombing, was a willing witness who had been eager to testify. They also contend that Mr Abebe would have been found without Mr Ghailani's confessions. Judge Kaplan disagreed, arguing that the government had failed to prove that Mr Abebe's testimony would be sufficiently removed from Mr Ghailani's allegedly coerced statements - thus rendering his testimony unconstitutional. Weakened case The decision is not only a major blow to the government's case - prosecutors had called him a \"giant\" witness who could illustrate that Mr Ghailani was not the clueless participant in the bombings he claimed to be - but it may also have implications for how future cases based on information gleaned at Guantanamo are mounted. Other aspects of the trial may also set a precedent for the future terrorism cases in civilian courts. Judge Kaplan ruled in July that the length of Mr Ghailani's detention - more than six years - did not undermine his constitutional right to a swift trial. Other terror suspects have been held by the US without trial for even longer periods. And, although the judge made no ruling on Mr Ghailani's allegations of torture at the hands of US officials, he did rule that the allegations, regardless of their veracity, were not sufficient to justify dismissing the charges against him. The delay in prosecuting these terror cases has had additional evidentiary implications.

Protesters against the film also attacked the US embassy in Cairo on Tuesday night. 'Asphyxiated' Speaking in the Rose Garden at the White House, President Obama told reporters the attack would not break the bonds between the US and the new Libyan government. But he added: \"Make no mistake - justice will be done.\" The US is deploying a marine anti-terrorism team to Libya to bolster security after the attack, a US defence source told reporters in Washington. Libya's interim leader, Mohammed Magarief, apologised to the US over the killings, which he called \"cowardly criminal acts\". Reports say a militia known as the Ansar al-Sharia brigade was involved in the attack, but the group has denied the claim, the BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli says. Reports suggest that Ambassador Stevens and his staff went to the consulate in an attempt to evacuate the site after it was attacked. They were reportedly trying to leave the consulate building for a safer location when gunmen launched an intense attack, apparently forcing back security guards. \"The American ambassador and three staff members were killed when gunmen fired rockets in their direction,\" a Libyan official in Benghazi told Reuters news agency. The Libyan doctor who treated Mr Stevens in hospital said he had died of severe asphyxiation, apparently from smoke inhalation, with no other injuries, and that he had tried for 90 minutes to revive him. He was the only American brought into the Benghazi Medical Centre and initially nobody realised he was the ambassador, Ziad Abu Zeid told the Associated Press news agency. A second US man killed in the attack was named as Sean Smith, a father of two who was employed as an information management officer. The names of the remaining two victims have not yet been released. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described Mr Smith in a statement as \"one of the best\". Speaking to reporters later, Mrs Clinton said many Americans were asking how such an attack could have happened in a country America had helped to liberate. \"This was an attack by a small and savage group, not the people and government of Libya,\" she said. The attack was condemned by UK Foreign Secretary William Hague as \"brutal and senseless\". Mitt Romney, Mr Obama's Republican challenger in the forthcoming presidential election, criticised the US administration's response to the attacks in Benghazi and Cairo, saying it had appeared to \"sympathise with those who waged the attacks\". Mr Obama's team, he said, had sent \"mixed signals to the world\" in the face of violence. Safety concerns Our correspondent says many people in Libya are still armed following the conflict that overthrew Gaddafi. Analysts say the attack will raise serious new concerns about stability in the country and the ability of the new Libyan administration to maintain security. In June, two British bodyguards were injured in an attack in Benghazi on a convoy carrying the British ambassador to Libya. Red Cross and UN staff also came under attack this year. Correspondents say the film at the heart of the row, which appeared on Youtube translated into Arabic, is highly provocative and insulting to Muslims. A demonstration in Cairo on Tuesday saw protesters breach the US embassy and tear down the US flag, which was flying at half-mast to mark the 9/11 attacks. An Islamic tenet bans the portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad. On Wednesday, the Afghan government gave orders for Youtube to be closed to the public until the offending film was removed but the site was still visible to internet users in the capital, Kabul. Cartoons featuring the Islamic religion's key figure sparked violent unrest among Muslims in 2005 when they were published by a Danish newspaper.

A warrant has now been issued for bailiffs to seize Greater Anglia (GA) property after it failed to pay him \u00a3350 compensation. GA confirmed it was in a legal dispute with Mr Pochin but could not comment. Mr Pochin, an ecologist, who moved to Halesworth a year ago, said he was considering moving to Ipswich to avoid the delays, which he claims added up to almost 28 hours over 12 months. Between February 2017 and February 2018, he made 550 journeys and recorded 183 delays. According to his figures, the majority of trains were between one and 10 minutes late. Mr Pochin said 26 journeys were late by more than 15 minutes, with the 100-minute delay on a journey last August. GA has a delay-repay scheme, paying out compensation for journeys more than 30 minutes late. Mr Pochin, who corresponded regularly with the firm about the quality of the service, said the 100-minute delay was the last straw. Using the Consumer Rights Act 2016, he paid \u00a335 to lodge a case at a small claims court \"to highlight the regular deficiencies with the service\". Judgement ruling In September, Mr Pochin and the rail company both agreed to mediation to resolve the matter. But after GA failed to provide dates to meet, Mr Pochin applied for a judgement ruling, which he won in December, and the train operator was ordered to pay him \u00a3350. In February, after failing to get this money, Mr Pochin paid \u00a377 for a warrant to be served on GA to seize assets worth \u00a3350. The courts and tribunal service confirmed a warrant had been issued against GA, which will now have to pay the sum or face the bailiffs. GA admitted 23% of delays were \"directly attributable to Greater Anglia due to incidents such as train faults\". A spokeswoman said the lines Mr Pochin travels on were being upgraded by Network Rail in a \u00a368m scheme \"to make the train service more reliable\". The legislation Mr Pochin used gives rail passengers the same legal protection they receive when paying for other goods and services. \"Hopefully, this case will result in train operators making compensation for delays easier to get,\" Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport said. \"However, passengers in general don't want compensation, they want trains that run on time.\" You may also be interested in:", "output": "A commuter fed up with \"continually\" delayed trains has won a legal bid for compensation against the rail company.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The remains were interred in a concrete tank in the grounds of the home, run by the Catholic Church, in Tuam, County Galway.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed retaliated by ordering a military operation which culminated with the overthrow of the local government, forcing the TPLF to retreat to mountains to fight what it calls \"invaders\". It has been difficult to get accurate information about the conflict because of a communication blackout in the region. The accounts of the soldiers highlight ethnic divisions in the Ethiopian military, with some Tigrayan soldiers accused of siding with the TPLF. Sergeant Bulcha: I was at a camp near Adigrat city, near the border with Eritrea. At around 23.30 on 3 November, I, and other soldiers, received text messages from our comrades at the base in Agula town - about 30km (18 miles) north-east of the Tigray capital, Mekelle - saying: \"We are surrounded. If you can come and rescue us, come.\" Not long thereafter, our camp was also surrounded, with hundreds of TPLF special forces and militias having taken up positions outside. Some of the Tigrayan soldiers - who had left our camp earlier - were with them. We went to the colonel who held the key to the storeroom where our weapons were kept. We told him to open it. He refused, saying he did not have orders to do so. He was a Tigrayan, and we suspected he was part of the plan to attack us. Some soldiers argued with him to open the storeroom; others tried to break open the door. Eventually, we got our weapons. The TPLF forces were already shooting by now. We took up our positions, inside and outside the camp, using rocks, barrels, walls as shields. It was around 01:00 when the battle started. There was a distance of no more than 50m (164ft) between us and them. We killed more than 100 of them. They killed 32 of us. In my unit, one died and nine were wounded. Most of our deaths were caused by the Tigrayan soldiers who had defected to the other side. The battle lasted for about 11 hours until noon when our senior commanders ordered us to stop fighting, return our weapons to the storeroom, and to go back to our rooms. We obeyed. Shortly thereafter the priests and elders of the town came. They negotiated a surrender. At around 16:00, we were ordered to hand over all our army belongings to the TPLF forces. Again, we obeyed. Then, we were told to collect our personal belongings and made to climb into lorries. We took our wounded with us. We were forced to leave the dead behind. 'I gave a false name' The TPLF forces transported us to one of their bases in the town of Abiy Addi, 150km south-west of Adigrat. The wounded soldiers got no medical treatment throughout this period. Each morning there was a roll call. We had to give our names, ethnicity and role in the army. I used to give a false name. This was like a desert area, and it was very, very hot. We had little water to drink. Every morning, we were given tea, with no sugar, in a plastic water bottle that had been cut in half. Our food for the day were two small loaves of bread. Soldiers from other bases were also brought to Abiy Addi. They told us they too had been attacked. Some of them surrendered without fighting; others put up more resistance than us, fighting for four days. Kalashnikovs, heavy weapons and even short-range rockets were used in the battle. Some of our soldiers fled to Eritrea. 'Uniforms burned' After about two weeks, the TPLF forces gave us three options - join them, live in Tigray as civilians or go back to our homes. We took the last option. But our senior commanders, radio operators, female soldiers and those who could use heavy weaponry were not given the option. They were kept at Abiy Addi, thousands of them. The rest of us were told to take off our uniforms. We refused, saying they could kill us but we would not do it - that our military code did not allow it; that our uniform was our pride. In the end there was an agreement. We would take off our uniforms, and they would all be burnt [so they could not be used by others]. The TPLF recorded the burning on camera. They took our personal belongings - rings, watches, money. More on the Tigray crisis: It was at around 15:00 on a Friday that we were all made to climb into lorries. Again, we took our wounded with us, but there were none in my lorry. There were about 500 of us in each lorry, and I'd say about 9,000 soldiers in all the lorries. We sat in the lorries crammed until we left Abiy Addi at around 23:00. We travelled for hours on back roads until the TPLF special forces - who were escorting our lorries - dropped us off on the banks of the Tekeze River so we could go to neighbouring Amhara state. The lorries came at different times. We all broke into groups and crossed the river in boats. About six hours had passed before my group reached the other side. We then walked for about 16 hours to reach Sekota town in Amhara. We are now in a police station compound in the town. We are being well fed and well looked after. The wounded are being treated in hospital, more than three weeks after the attack. I heard that some of them died on the way, and their bodies were left behind. Corporal Ibrahim Hassan: I have been in the army for about eight years. I was also in Adigrat, but at another camp. I was the guard on duty on 3 November, watching the camp from 22:00 to midnight. Some of the soldiers were already sleeping. Right after I finished my shift I heard gunshots. I had no idea what was happening. I went to see. TPLF special forces and militia had already surrounded our camp, and they entered it. Most of us were unarmed. They ordered the soldiers, including myself, to surrender. We refused, saying federal troops could not surrender to regional troops. But in the end we agreed on the orders of our seniors, who were Tigrayans. We were kept in the camp until 6 November. The TPLF forces then transported us in lorries to a small town, Idaga Hamus, which is about 26km from where we were. We were kept there for a week and then taken to Abiy Addi. There, we found many people loyal to the federal government, from the police, army and air force. We were divided into groups, and kept in three different places - a military camp, a training school and a compound. There was no water to shower, little water to drink. It was as though we were left to die in that heat. We slept in small rooms in very crammed conditions. Then more than three weeks later, we were given three options - if we were married with children in Tigray, we could live as civilians, or we could join the TPLF or we could leave. Most of us chose the third option. But radio operators, those who could use heavy weaponry and senior commanders had to stay behind. 'Jewellery stolen' I am a radio operator but I lied about my role so I was able to leave. My guess is that we left 3,000 to 4,000 behind, and close to 9,000 of us managed to leave. We were put in about 28 lorries and were driven for hours, through desert areas, until we reached the Tekeze River. The journey was very difficult. Some soldiers fell off the lorries and broke their legs. Others got sick. But we are now in Sekota. Some of the soldiers resent the fact that there was no rescue operation, but they understand that the situation was difficult. This was an unprecedented attack on the federal army. Soldiers who were at other bases reported that the TPLF forces stole watches and necklaces from dead soldiers. They even took their uniforms, and left the bodies behind naked.

Wandering albatrosses \u2013 which have the longest wingspan of any birds alive today \u2013 are thought to be especially vulnerable. Nesting on the barren islands of South Georgia, they feed their young by scouring thousands of miles of ocean for squid and fish but often bring back plastic instead. The final episode of what has become the most-watched TV programme of the year explores how the oceans are threatened by human activities including overfishing and pollution. It will be broadcast on Sunday 10 December. In a particularly moving scene, Dr Lucy Quinn, a zoologist, is seen checking albatross chicks on Bird Island where she was the British Antarctic Survey\u2019s winter manager for more than two years. One chick that Dr Quinn found dead and later dissected was killed because a plastic toothpick that it swallowed had pierced its stomach. Others had regurgitated plastic items including cling film, food packaging, cutlery and parts of bottles. Dr Quinn told me: \u201cI feel real shame and anger that it\u2019s humans who have caused this problem. \"It\u2019s really sad because you get to know the birds and how long it takes the parents, away for ten days at a time, to collect food for their chicks and what they bring back is plastic. \"And what\u2019s sad is that the plague of plastic is as far-reaching as these seemingly pristine environments.\" It's not known how many albatross chicks in Antarctica die from plastic pollution every year \u2013 it's thought to be fewer than the losses suffered by Laysan albatrosses on Midway Atoll in the Pacific . But on Bird Island, predators often eat dead chicks before the researchers can reach them \u2013 and the suspicion is that the effect of the plastic goes beyond the direct killing of seabirds. According to Dr Quinn, the threat is more insidious, weakening birds as they waste energy trying to digest plastic, which has no nutritional value, and potentially poisoning them as chemicals are released when the plastic breaks down in their stomachs. Research at the other end of the world into a smaller relative of the albatross \u2013 the fulmars of the North Sea \u2013 shows that while plastics may directly kill seabirds, it is the debilitating effects of the waste that could be more serious. Studies of fulmars found dead on beaches or caught accidentally by fishermen \u2013 which Dr Quinn has also been involved in \u2013 show that from 2010-2014, UK fulmars were found to contain on average 39 particles of plastic weighing a total of 0.32 grams. In an unsettling image, the volume of space taken up by that plastic in a fulmar\u2019s belly is the equivalent in a human stomach of the contents of a typical lunchbox, and usually the plastic is made up of consumer items used just once and then thrown away. Most shocking is the effect of party balloons, released in a moment of celebration, but then catching the eye of a fulmar searching for food. Dr Quinn remembers one occasion when she dissected one of the birds. \"I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, seeing a balloon in the bird\u2019s oesophagus, which would have killed it, along with cling film, toothbrushes and packaging \u2013 I feel extremely sad for the birds and impatient to do something,\" she said. The plastic may be undermining the fulmars\u2019 health, which could affect their ability to breed - with long-term implications for the population as a whole. The threat from plastic waste is not limited to pieces that are visible \u2013 bottles, bags and other items break down into minute fragments, or \"micro-plastics\", which enter the food chain in every corner of the ocean. Scientists from the University of Newcastle even identified tiny fibres in the smallest creatures living in the deepest part of the Pacific, the Mariana Trench. Dr Jon Copley, of the University of Southampton, who joined the Blue Planet submarine filming in Antarctica, says that although he did not spot any plastic in the polar waters, he has been shocked by its presence elsewhere. \"When I've seen plastic in the deep ocean - such as a bin liner we found near deep-sea vents in the Cayman Trough - there's an initial shock and disappointment that our rubbish has got here before us as explorers. \"But then there's the realisation that our everyday lives are more connected to the deep ocean than we perhaps think. \"Every piece of plastic rubbish has a story, so it also makes me wonder about the chain of events that led to that particular item ending up in the deep ocean, and whether any of those events could have been prevented.\" Follow David on Twitter: @davidshukmanbbc", "output": "Scientists who advised the Blue Planet II documentary team say they feel \"shame and anger\" at the \u201cplague of plastic\u201d impacting the natural world.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "BBC TrendingGoing in-depth on social media \"At one point I Googled myself and I got the result 'Anna Scanlon offers sex.'

After moving to Milton Keynes from California in 2012, she found video making not only a way to update friends and family on her new life, but an introduction to a whole new community. \"When I moved to the UK I didn't know anyone,\" she says, \"so YouTube became a great outlet to be able to interact with people on a daily basis.\" Anna, now 34, became immersed in her studies - a PhD in Holocaust History at the University of Leicester - as well as her YouTube channel. At about the same time she decided to turn vegan, motivated both by a desire to lose weight and also for ethical reasons. Her vlogging increasingly covered vegan issues - and soon she became a target for another vegan blogger. YouTube drama Vegan Cheetah, whose real name is Charles Marlowe-Cremedas, is a popular vegan vlogger. He lives in California and he built his channel, which has 37,000 subscribers on YouTube, by engaging in debates about veganism. Like in other subcultures, arguments in the vegan world are often fractious and - for those outside the subculture - often tediously detailed. Vegans argue back and forth about questions like whether it's OK to date non-vegans, or keep pets, and a host of other issues. You may also be interested in: The Vegan Cheetah channel included \"drama\" videos - a particular and hugely popular YouTube genre which catalogues gossip and rumours, often about other YouTubers or celebrities. Anna watched his videos. Initially she saw the appeal. \"He was saying something that a lot of people in the community resonated with,\" she says. But soon, she claims, Vegan Cheetah ran out of original ideas and his channel \"just became bashing individual vegans.\" Anna posted criticism of Charles in a private Facebook group, but somehow the drama vlogger got wind of it and began making drama videos - about Anna. He claimed that Anna called him on Skype, exposed herself to him, and started performing sexual acts on camera - all things which Anna says \"never happened.\" It culminated in a four-hour broadcast on another video site, YouNow. Charles repeated the allegations and encouraged people to join in a live-streaming conversation. More on this story \"I did confront him asking him to retract his statement, but as it went on I think he really enjoyed the attention that he got from saying these things,\" Anna says. \"His audience loved it and joined in.\" \"It was very shocking to me because it had no basis in reality,\" she says of the claims. \"I felt disgusted, at that point I thought about taking legal action.\" In April 2017 she did just that, and filed a defamation suit in California. Charles Marlowe-Cremedas declined to comment for this story, but in court filings he has denied Anna's allegations. Until recently, he continued to make a series of reaction videos insulting Anna and saying that the lawsuit \"doesn't scare me.\" Anna says that initially YouTube and YouNow took no action, even though she reported Vegan Cheetah's videos. \"I sent YouNow several emails,\" she says \"they didn't even respond.\" \"Social media companies could do a lot better especially when it comes to protecting the safety of people online,\" she says. \"If they have somebody who is constantly reporting incidents then maybe it might be better to actually look into it and talk to people and actually take reporting seriously instead of just glossing over it.\" Visit BBC Trending on Facebook In a statement, YouTube told BBC Trending: \"We have clear rules and policies against bullying and hateful speech and we enforce these policies. Our broadcasts are monitored 24/7, and any user who is reported is quickly disciplined.\" YouNow said in a statement: \"We have strict policies against inappropriate behaviour, harassment and illegal activities. 24/7 live moderators respond to any issue flagged by the community or detected by our automated systems.\" After Anna filed her lawsuit, Marlowe-Cremedas was suspended from YouNow. His YouTube channel is still online, however recently most of his old videos were taken down. Court case After initially refusing to respond to the legal action, Charles filed a response to Anna's lawsuit in May, 13 months after the lawsuit was originally filed. A trial is now pending. \"I think one of the positives is that people have seen that they can speak up for themselves,\" Anna says. \"I hope this gives people some hope that the internet will be a bit of a safer place.\" If you've been affected by this story, there are resources and links available from BBC Action Line Do you have a story for us?

The Xperia Sola handset is due to go on sale in the second half of 2012. But some mobile phone analysts question whether the feature will be practical or popular. Touchless world A number of firms around the world have been exploringgesture control possibilitiesfor quite some time. Giants such as Apple, Microsoft and US mobile phone chip maker Qualcomm, as well as several small start-ups, are currently developing camera-based touchless technology. Their aim is to let users perform tasks such as answering the phone, navigating the web and flicking through photos using gestures - for instance, snapping fingers in front of the screen. Sony's new \"floating interface\" is different. A user's finger will essentially act as a mouse cursor, highlighting a link. Once selected, it can be activated it with a single tap. Calum MacDougall of Sony Mobile Communications called the phone's technology \"a sense of magic\". Wet hands But not everyone is that optimistic. Chris Barraclough, devices editor at Mobile Choice magazine, said that it was unclear how popular and practical the feature would be. \"It is certainly an original piece of technology, and may be useful, for instance, when your hands are wet, but we still need to see other practical implications of it,\" he said. Although it may seem that the feature could help users eliminate fingerprint smudges that inevitably cover any smartphone screen, Mr Barraclough thinks otherwise. \"I don't think it will really help - just pulling your phone out of your pocket already leaves lots of smudges,\" he said.", "output": "A smartphone that allows users to browse the web by hovering a finger above links they would normally touch has been unveiled by the Japanese electronics giant Sony.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter at the Toronto Film Festival The film tells the story of the famous Wimbledon men's final of 1980, and stars Shia LaBeouf and Sverrir Gudnason as McEnroe and Borg respectively. Welsh actor Scott Arthur, who plays McEnroe's tennis partner Peter Fleming in the film, described the pair's duel as the \"perfect rivalry\". \"They were kind of the first rock star tennis players,\" he told BBC News. \"They had a swagger about them. Borg was almost like a Beatle. Everywhere he went, people were obsessed with him. \"Then you had McEnroe, who was more of a hot-headed fiery tennis player, didn't always play by the rules.\" Borg/McEnroe is one of several sports-based films attracting attention this year. I, Tonya - starring Margot Robbie as figure skater Tonya Harding - is hot property at the festival, alongside Battle of the Sexes, which sees Emma Stone portray former tennis world number one Billie Jean King. Scott said: \"Tennis is a sport where there's so much that comes with the way that you go about your game.\" \"Being respectful to your opponent, treating a loss the same as a victory\u2026 so to have Borg and McEnroe competing against each other, it was the perfect rivalry really. \"What's amazing is that after their rivalry they became best friends. Borg was the best man at McEnroe's wedding.\" Borg/McEnroe: Press conference Here's what some of the stars said about the film: Scott said preparing for the role involved spending more time in the park and, unfortunately, less time in the pub. \"About six weeks before we started filming, I got a call saying 'You need to make sure that you're training every day, going running and not drinking beer',\" the 28-year-old explained. \"Because if you're playing a tennis player you need to look as lean as possible, so that was probably the hardest part of everything, going running, not drinking beer and making sure I was watching my diet.\" Scott is no debutant, but described Borg/McEnroe as \"the most high profile thing I've done, by far\". \"I did a film called Bridgend, based loosely on the Bridgend suicides [a spate of suicides involving young people in Wales]. \"That got a bit of press, but it's nothing on the scale of Borg/McEnroe, so this is the first real big thing that I've done. \"So to be walking on a red carpet is a childhood dream. I'm trying to just stay on my feet, not get too swept up by it all.\" The film, which is due to be released in the UK on 22 September, is certainly turning heads at Toronto, although its first reviews were mixed. The Guardian awarded it two stars, with Peter Bradshaw writing: \"This tennis film feels like a two-hour baseline rally, and it's not just the rackets that are made of wood.\" Writing in IndieWire, David Ehrlich said: \"If not for LaBeouf, Borg/McEnroe would have nothing to offer that you couldn't get from simply watching a broadcast of the 1980 Wimbledon Men's Final.\" But Scott said he hopes the film will help shed light on the lesser known aspects of the famous tennis rivalry. \"I want audiences to come away having a bit of empathy for them both, to understand how much dedication and hard work it takes to become as brilliant as Borg and McEnroe are,\" he said. \"I want people to leave thinking 'I didn't know about that'. You really see the relationships between Borg and his wife, or John and his Dad, and so you get all of that and I want people to understand how much time they're putting in and how lonely they are.\" Read more: Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Witnesses said she was allegedly taken from a yacht near India and forcibly returned. The United Arab Emirates has denied the reports, and says she has been living at home with her family. The incident caused concern among international human rights groups, who asked authorities to prove her safety. On Monday, the UAE's foreign ministry said it had sent a communiqu\u00e9 regarding Sheikha Latifa to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights' Office of Special Procedures. In a statement, it said the message \"responds to and rebuts false allegations\" about the princess. The images it released show Sheikha Latifa alongside Mary Robinson, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and former president of Ireland, and were purportedly taken on 15 December in Dubai. \"Photographs taken during the afternoon they spent together have been shared, with their consent,\" the UAE's statement said. \"During her visit to Dubai, Mary Robinson was reassured that HH Sheikha Latifa is receiving the necessary care and support she requires.\" The United Nations has not yet responded to the statement. Sheikha Latifa - the daughter of Dubai's ruler - is said to have tried to flee in an attempt to live a freer life abroad. The 33-year-old was reportedly helped in her attempt to escape by Herve Jaubert, a former French spy. His yacht she was travelling on, the Nostromo, was then reportedly intercepted less than 80 km (50 miles) from the Indian coast. Mr Jaubert alleges the princess was then then taken onto a helicopter and forcibly returned, despite professing her will to seek asylum abroad. After she allegedly went missing, a video was released showing her discussing a planned effort to escape. \"If you're watching this video, it's not such a good thing. Either I'm dead or I'm in a very very very bad situation,\" she said near the beginning of the 40-minute clip. In the video, she alleges she and her family \"did not have freedom of choice\" in their lives, and discussed an earlier effort to leave the country aged 16. She alleges she was imprisoned for three years and tortured repeatedly on her return. Earlier this month, the UAE's government released its first statement about her apparent disappearance in which it said it was \"deeply saddened by the continued media speculation\" about Sheikha Latifa. In it, they said she was \"adored and cherished\" by her family, who were looking forward to celebrating her birthday with her.", "output": "Photographs have been released of an Arab princess who was feared missing.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}]
