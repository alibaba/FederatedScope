That work, as well as The Discourses, a rigorous analysis of the classical period, did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including Jean-Jacques Rousseau) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence. Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end\u2014i.e., the secure and powerful state. Thomas Hobbes, well known for his theory of the social contract, goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the English Renaissance. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.", "output": "What influential work was written in 1532?, What was published just before Machiavelli died?, The Prince and what other work influenced medieval political thought?, What was written to free the Mattice family from exile?, Who is known for their theory of social contract in the 1700s?, What did Thomas Hobbes write  between 1511-1512?, After what year did Jean-Jacques Rousseau die?, What did di Medici do for the West?, Who expelled Hobbes from Florence?, What group did Thomas Hobbes support more than the other?", "category": "Question Generation 976.json"}, {"instruction": "This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage.

Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials, with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles, from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles.

From the late 1960s, it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock.
