They were really nice and I loved their company. We hung out most weekends. We cooked, watched movies, chatted and shared jokes! It was amazing -- until something unexpected happened !     One of my friends was diagnosed with kidney   stones which needed to be removed as soon as possible. But our friend could not afford the surgery. He tried to get help from our other friends but they refused him. My heart cried for him! Our friends abandoned him just when he needed them most.

The breakthrough, which scientists say is the first new way to generate electricity in 160 years, could lead to batteries that use water instead of poisonous substances. The scientists made the discovery when they were investigating what happens when tap water is forced through extremely narrow glass tubes. Water squeezed down the tubes, each of which was narrower than a tenth the thickness of a human hair, generating a small electric current that ran the length of the tube. To produce a larger electric current, the team tried forcing water through a glass water filter that contained thousands of narrow channels lined up side by side. \"When we took a syringe of water and squeezed it through the filter, we got enough power to light a light bulb,\" said Larry Kostiuk of the University of Alberta in Canada. \"The harder you push the syringe, the more electric current you get.\" The current is produced because of an effect in the glass tubes. When they are filled with water, positively charged ions fixed in the tubes are washed away, leaving a slight negative charge on the glass surface. When water is then forced along the tube, the surface _ negatively charged ions in the water while positively charged ions are attracted down the tube. The result is a net flow of positively charged ions that sets up an electric current. According to Dr Kostiuk, no one has ever thought to use water to produce electricity in this way. \"The last time someone came up with a way of generating electricity was Michael Faraday in 1839,\" he said. \"So this is the first new way of generating electricity in 160 years, which is why we are so excited about it.\" Dr Kostiuk says water batteries might one day be used to power mobile phones and calculators, but admitted that the engineering challenges might make other applications more realistic. \"You'd need to be sure it wouldn't leak, and you'd need to make sure it wouldn't freeze,\" he said. More likely would be to install the electricity-generating devices where water is already being pumped, such as at city water filtration sites, he said. \"It could compete with wind and solar power,\" he added. \n Question: What does the passage mainly want to tell us about? \n Options: (A) A kind of solar power discovered by scientists.

Life would be bitter for most Americans. They spend about $13 billion a year buying all sorts of chocolate treats. However, for the African children who toil under slavelike conditions on cacao plantations, life is not sweet. The cacao bean is the main ingredient in the chocolate. According to a 2002 survey by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture and the US Agency for International Development, about 284,000 children work in dangerous conditions on cacao farms in western Africa. More than half those children are younger than 14. Many were sold into forced labor to work 12 hours or more a day on the cacao plantations. A number of international organizations, including several African governments, recently began a program to eliminate  child labor on cacao plantations. Under the program, government officials will remove children from abusive working situations while teaching farmers about child labor issues.

Others are scratching themselves to death because of a mite  infection. Only 115 of one species - the northern hairy-nosed wombat - remain alive in the wild.  Wombats are endemic to Australia. They are found nowhere else. A wombat looks like an overgrown, stocky guinea pig, covered with thick grey fur and with a wide, flat, broad forehead. Fully-grown adults are about a meter long and about half a meter tall. They weigh about 40kg.  But while their looks are pretty straightforward, people throughout history have found it less easy to understand their behavior. The Aborigines  seem to have mixed feelings about them, According to one story, the wombat once said he was more powerful than the sun. After a competition, however, the wombat lost, and so today hides from shame, deep down in a hole. But another Aboriginal story tells of how wise the wombat can be. He comforts the other animals in the forest, after their friend, a cockatoo, has died, explaining to them all about forest spirits. Wombats are strong diggers, with very powerful front legs and sharp claws, usually used to dig winding holes in the ground for their homes. Yet despite their strong appearance, these animals are struggling to survive.  Many have been suffering a lot from a foreign mite, from foreign foxes, introduced for hunting by the early English settlers of Australia. Because of scratching, scars form over the wombats' eyes and ears, and infections occur, finally causing their death. Its population is so small that the group is becoming inbred . Competition with cattle and sheep for grass to eat, drought, bushfires, as well as dingo and feral dog attacks have all whittled away wombat numbers.   But fortunately, a group of committed volunteers and scientists, working with the local government, has now put up fences to protect the wombats from meat-eating animals, made holes for extra shelter, and is working with zoos to create developing programs. These conservationists are well aware they have little time left. \n Question: According to the passage, wombats  _  . \n Options: (A) look like big cats. (B) are similar to foxes in size.

Researchers say a lack of sleep can produce hormonal  changes that increase feelings of hunger. In one study, researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people. The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night. They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours. And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin. Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry; leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies. They note the combination that sleep limitation is common and food is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised. People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy. But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially for high-calorie foods, so people gain weight. It seems that, for survival, the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study. They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night.The Public Library of Science published the findings in its journal Medicine .

This is because apples were one of the first foods that medical professionals recognized as healthy---their benefits became obvious when, quite simply, doctors found that people who ate apples were sick less often than those who did not. Today we have a more specific understanding of why apples are so beneficial to overall health. Apples can help keep your levels of bad cholesterol  down. The pectin  in apples helps you to maintain cardiovascular health and reduce LDL cholesterol(which is the \"bad\" kind). Apples themselves do not add cholesterol to your diet and are full of water and fiber to help weaken the cholesterol in other foods you might digest. According to Health Diaries, people who eat two apples per day may lower their cholesterol by as much as 16 percent. Apples are naturally low in calories and high in water content. Eating an apple can satisfy your hunger and keep you from reaching for high-sugar, high-calories snacks. By eating apples, you will be more able to maintain a healthy weight because they fill you up, potentially stopping you from eating food that encourages a waistline increase. Apples contain considerable levels of boron , which helps build healthy bones, and can also prevent diseases like arthritis. Apples are rich in vitamin C, which is known to help build immunity. Studies have shown that apples can decrease the risk of breast cancer and liver cancer. One theory is that the apple skins are responsible for this, so be sure not to take apple skins off before you eat them, as you could remove some of the health benefits. \n Question: The author begins the passage by mentioning the saying to  _  . \n Options: (A) make the topic easier to understand (B) bring up the topic of the text (C) supply a scientific evidence for the topic (D) show the richness of the English languages", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Those bacteria can increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke and worsen the effects of other diseases. And adults are not the only ones at risk. For example, a 12yearold boy died when a tooth infection spread to his brain in 2007 in Washington. Experts said it might have been prevented had he received the dental care he needed. Experts say good dental care starts at birth. Breast milk, they say, is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth. But dentists say a baby's gums and early teeth should be cleaned after each feeding by using a cloth with a little warm water. Experts say if you decide to put your baby to sleep with a bottle, give only water. When baby teeth begin to appear, you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies and to use them very gently. The use of fluoride  to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. For example, it is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel , the hard surface on teeth, to help prevent holes from forming. But young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully watched when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste, the size of a pea, should be used. Parents often wonder what effect finger sucking might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life. Most children stop sucking their fingers by the age of four. If it continues, experts advise parents to talk to their children's dentists or doctors. Because it could _ the correct development of permanent teeth. Dentists say children should have their first dental visit at least by the time they are one year old. They say babies should be examined when their first teeth appear--usually at around six months. \n Question: According to the passage,what is the function of fluoride? \n Options: (A) Making the surface on teeth much cleaner.

This is different from a palace, which is no fortified-though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to diverse structures. The European castles originated in the 9thand 10thcenturies, resulting in its land divided among nobles. These nobles built castles to control the area surrounding them, and they were both offensive and defensive structures. Although army uses are often emphasized in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local people and important travel routes, and rural castles were often built near farmland. Many castles were originally built from earth and wood, but had their defences _ later by stone. In the late 12thand early 13thcenturies, scientific approaches to castle defence appeared, and could function to maximize the castle's firepower. These changes in defence came from a mixture of castle technology. Although gunpowder was introduced to be built well into the 16thcentury, improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable places to live in. As a result, true castles went into decline. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no defensive purpose. \n Question: What can be inferred from the river? \n Options: (A) Castles have nothing in common with palaces.

Spanish people drink Coca Cola, wear blue jeans, watch Hollywood movies, listen to American music, and eat fast food, and they do these things every day. I think that American movies are a good way to spread American culture because people are often influenced by what they see in the movies. Most of the programs and documentaries   we watch on TV are from America, and most of the movies we go to see are made in Hollywood. In the last few years, the government has tried to protect the Spanish movies. Now, in our cinemas, at least twenty percent of the movies which are shown must be from Spain or from other countries in Europe. American culture is a part of Spanish life now. It's certain that many things from America are as much a part of people's lives as Spanish things. For example, Coca Cola is as familiar to everybody as any typical Spanish product. I've known about Coca Cola for my whole life. However, it's different with Western fast food. For example, I don't think McDonald's is as successful in Spain as it is in other countries. In my opinion, one of the reasons may be the lifestyle of the Spanish people. The Spanish people normally eat at home. On the other hand, maybe McDonald's hamburgers will eventually replace the famous Spanish tapas. It's true that in every city in Spain you can find a McDonald's, and it is more popular among the Spanish children than among the adults. In any case, it's obvious that American culture is becoming more and more a part of our lives every day. \n Question: What plays an important part in the spreading of American culture in Spain? \n Options: (A) American novels.

CAT scans can show even more. They can give three-dimensional  view of body organs . What is a CAT scan? CAT stands for Computerized Axial Tomography(X). It is a special X-ray machine that gets a 360 - degree picture of a small area of a patient's body. Doctors use X-rays to study and examine diseases and injuries within the body. X-rays can find foreign objects inside the body or to take pictures of some organs inside if special things as dyes or special liquids are added to the organs to be X-rayed. A CAT scanner, however, uses a beam  of X-rays to give a cross-sectional view of a particular part of the body. A fine beam of X-rays is scanned across the body and circled around the patient from many different angles . A computer analyzes  the information from each angle and produces a clear cross-sectional picture on the screen. This picture is then photographed for later use. Several cross-sections, taken one after another, can give a clear \"photo\" of the entire body or of any body organs. The newest CAT scanners can even give a clear picture of active, moving organs just as a fast-action camera can \"stop the action\" giving clear pictures of what appear only mistily  to the eye.

The Sun is the major source of energy for our planet. It causes the evaporation   of water from the oceans and lakes. Sunlight also provides the energy used by green plants to make their own food. These green plants then provide food for all organisms  on the Earth. Much of the energy that comes from the Sun never reaches the Earth's surface. It is either reflected or absorbed by the gases in the upper atmosphere. Of the energy that reaches the lower atmosphere,30% is reflected by clouds or the Earth's surface. The remaining 70% warms the surface of the planet, causes water to evaporate, and provides energy for the water cycle and weather. Only a tiny part, approximately 0.023%, is actually used by green plants to produce food. Many gases found in the atmosphere actually reflect heat energy escaping from the Earth's surface back to the Earth. These gases act like the glass of a greenhouse in that they allow energy from the Sun to enter but prevent energy from leaving. They are therefore called greenhouse gases. When sunlight strikes an object, some of the energy is absorbed and some is reflected. The amount reflected depends on the surface. For example, you've probably noticed how bright snow is when sunlight falls on it. Snow reflects most of the energy from the Sun, so it contributes to the low temperatures of winter. Dark-coloured surfaces, such as dark soil or forest, absorb more energy and help warm the surrounding air. \n Question: According to the passage, the root( ) cause for weather changes on the Earth is  _  . \n Options: (A) the atmosphere surrounding the Earth (B) water from oceans and lakes (C) energy from the Sun (D) greenhouse gases in the sky", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Alice found out about SPARK when the organization launched a campaign demanding Seventeen Magazine feature a more diverse group of models. She applied to be a blogger for the group in May and won one of the positions. Each month, Alice pitches (...) her girl -and women - centric blog post ideas via online chat to an editor at SPARK. So far, she has written about topics such as female actresses, choosing what to wear, and dealing with anger. Alice said she hopes large companies and media stop editing images of women.

The people were threatened by those scenes of destroying flood, severe earthquake, terrifying hurricane and constructions representing human civilization being destroyed and even swallowed by disaster.  Luckily, they are just the director' s imagination, but the present situation is not heading a positive direction, either. Take my own experience in Alaska as an example. Once I took a trip to the glacier. Along the way there stood signposts marking the snow lines of different years.  They started from the foot of the mountain, but it was at the top when I finally saw melting glaciers . My heart ached seeing the beautiful blue ice melting at every second. Sad but true, they are the effects of global warming and the result of our human impact. Furthermore, each year the rising sea level will kill 56 million people, and that's about the population of the entire Italy. According to studies, if the temperature keeps on rising like this, by the year 2050, some islands and coastal cities including New York, Shanghai, Tokyo and Sydney will be drowned in water. Our fortune is in our own hands. It depends on us to shape our future, to reduce future human impact and find ways to form a peaceful relationship with our environment. Therefore, it's time for actions to be taken right now. Contribute a little to energy saving by using more efficient light bulbs and less hot water. Let recycle become our habit by thinking twice before throwing something away. Let us take public transportation as our first choice when going to a certain place. It might cost more time for now, but it' s to the benefit of a permanent future. Take care of every tree and grass around us by watering them or simply just avoid destroying them. In a word, _ The earth does not belong to us. On the contrary, we belong to the earth. Please bear in mind that the earth is our home. It is our responsibility to build a brighter and better future of our planet and prevent what happened in the movie 2012 from becoming reality. \n Question: Why does the author talk about the movie 2012 in the passage ? \n Options: (A) To give example.

This is true for most examples of reaching out to help others. We find that we gain new understanding about not only those we help, but ourselves as well. Stressing the importance of helping others in martial arts students will benefit them both inside and outside of the class. Helping others strengthens families. Families that practice the belief of working together and helping each other prepare their children for the concept of teamwork outside of the home environment. By learning to help around the house through activities such as household jobs, baby-sitting and keeping a tidy bedroom, children learn valuable lessons that they carry with them to their future relationships. By helping others outside of the home environment, valuable friendships can be developed. When we learn to reach out to others and give off our time and talents we find that our friendships grow, which in turn is a benefit to our lives. Martial arts training supports this by exposing students to people of various backgrounds and beliefs that gather for a common goal and to help each other. Any time a group of people are working toward a common goal, team spirit surely forms. When we help each other in the martial arts setting and in every area of our lives, a friendship is formed that promotes teamwork. The most important thing to realize is that it does not take a lot to make a lot happen. Little things can make a big difference in the area of helping others. Simple gestures of kindness and support given frequently can build a strong base for the growth and development of each individual which leads to the success of all. \n Question: Any volunteer will benefit from the experience because   _  . \n Options: (A) they will be admitted to a martial arts class for free (B) they can also have a better understanding of themselves (C) they can understand the importance of martial arts better (D) they will be paid off by those who are helped sooner or later", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

It's always good to try new things because when you are trying new things you are growing. If you never try anything new,how can you improve?How can you expand?The simple answer is\"You can't.\"Look around you. With very few exceptions,either every-thing you see in your world or every single detail of every single thing is the result of someone trying something new. Another good thing about mistakes is this:When you are making mistakes,you are learning.Consider this:Edison failed 10,000 times before he perfected the 1ight bulb.When asked how it felt to fail that many times,he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times,but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work. Finally,when you make a mistake you are much closer to success.Why?Because when all is said and done,you will have tried some numbers of things before you succeed.Every time you make a mistake you eliminate one of those things and are one step closer.But this all doesn't mean that you should go ahead without considering the consequences of a mistake.Quite the contrary,when you try something new you have to be willing to set some reasonable limits so that in the event that it doesn't work out the way you want it to,you will he in a position to try again. We all have limited time and money so don't blow them all on one approach to a problem.Realize that it probably won't be perfect the first time and allocate these resources properly so you can learn,make corrections,and try it again.If you accept and use your mistakes in this way,you can make great progress in your business and your career.

Thus, a person has to work more hours to pay for the same thing. For example, let's say that this year a loaf of bread costs $1.00 and average salary in the United Sates is $10.00 per hour. That means a person could earn enough money to buy a loaf of bread in one-tenth of an hour, or six minutes. Then, halfway through the year, the price of the bread goes up to $1.25, while salary stay the same. That means that a person now has to work one-eighth of an hour--seven and a half minutes to buy the same loaf of bread. Now let's say that at the end of the year, salary go up to $11.00 per hour, but the price of bread goes up to $1.50. Now a person has to work more than one-seventh of an hour--over eight minutes--to buy loaves of bread, employees will have less money left over to buy other things, Inflation means that the same money buys fewer things and everybody's standard of living goes down, even if salaries are going up. Some kinds of inflation are worse than others. Moderate inflation does not distort  relative prices or incomes seriously. Galloping inflation happens rapidly, say at a rate of 100percent or more within a year. And then there's hyperinflation--inflation so serious that people try to get rid of their currency before prices rise further and make the money worthless.

I will milk her and churn  butter and we shall never want for anything.\" \"That is a good plan,\" said Mr. Vinegar, so he started off to town while his wife waited by the roadside. Mr. Vinegar walked up and down the street of the town looking for a cow. After a time, a farmer came that way, leading one that was very pretty and fat. \"Oh, if I only had that cow,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"I would be the happiest man in the world!\" \"She's a very good cow,\" said the farmer. \"Well,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"I'll give you these 50 gold pieces for her.\" The farmer smiled and held out his hand for the money, \"You may have her,\" he said, \"I always like to oblige  , my friends!\" Mr. Vinegar took hold of the cow's halter and led her up and down the street. \"I am the luckiest man in the world,\" he said, \"for only see how all the people are looking at me and my cow!\" But at one end of the street, he met a man playing bagpipes  . He stopped and listened -- Tweedle Dee Tweedle Dee. \"Oh, that is the sweetest music I ever heard,\" he said, \"and just see how all the children crowd around the man and give him pennies!

He could get nothing out of the bagpipes but \"squeak, squeak\". The children instead of giving him pennies laughed at him. The day was chilly and in trying to play the pipes, his fingers grew very cold. He wished he had kept the cow. He just started for home when he met a man who had warm gloves on his hands. \"Oh, if I only had those pretty gloves,\" he said, \"I would be the happiest man in the world.\" \"How much will you give for them?\" asked the man. \"Oh, I have no money, but I will give you these bagpipes,\" answered Mr. Vinegar. \"Well,\" said the man, \"you may have them for I always like to oblige a friend.\" Mr. Vinegar gave him the bagpipes and drew the gloves on over his half frozen fingers. \"How lucky I am,\" he said as he trudged  homeward. His hands were soon quite warm, but the road was rough and the walking hard. He was very tired when he came to the foot of the steep hill. \"How shall I ever get to the top?\" he said. Just then he met a man who was walking the other way. He had a stick in his hand which he used as a cane to help him along. \"My friend,\" said Mr. Vinegar, \"if only I had that stick of yours to help me up this hill, I would be the happiest man in the world!\" \"How much will you give me for it?\" asked the man. \"Well, I have no money, but I will give you this pair of warm gloves,\" said Mr. Vinegar. \"Well,\" said the man, \"you may have it for I always like to oblige a friend.\" Mr. Vinegar's hands were now quite warm, so he gave the gloves to the man and took the stout  stick to help him along. \"How lucky I am!'' he said as he toiled upward. At the top of the hill he stopped to rest. But as he was thinking of all his good luck that day, he heard someone calling his name. He looked up and saw only a green parrot sitting in a tree. \"Mr. Vinegar, Mr. Vinegar,\" it cried. \"What now?\" said Mr. Vinegar. \"You're a dunce  , you're a dunce!'' answered the bird, \"you went to seek your _ and you found it, then you gave it for a cow, and the cow for some bagpipes, and the bagpipes for some gloves, and the gloves for a stick which you might of cut by the roadside.

For some people searching through flea markets is a hobby which reaps rewards.They look for possible antiques among the items for sale or for old furniture which can be restored with a little care and used again.Many wise collectors often find rare items worth much more than their bargained price.Since prices are usually not fixed, if one is persistent a bargain can easily be struck.The owner may be selling a rare collectable and may not even be aware of its value.One of the great pleasures of shopping at such markets is the chance to bargain with the shop owner and settle for a price which one can afford and is willing to pay. Perhaps even more enjoyable than flea markets are the weekend outdoor garage sales which have now become very much a part of American culture.These are held usually in the spring and fall when the weather is still good.Usually a homeowner, having decided that he would like to clear his residence of accumulated items which are no longer useful to him, advertises in a local paper that he is holding a garage sale.More than likely the goods on display are in good condition and great buys can be found if one has the time and patience to search carefully.The home owner places items for sale on display along the driveway leading to his garage or on his front lawn and waits for people to look at what he has to sell.Old magazines, books, paintings, bicycles, ice-skates, items of clothing and electrical appliances of every sort appear on a regular basis.If the owner is in a position where he must sell his home or plans to move soon, then he may be forced to practically give things away at a price far below their true worth. \n Question: What do you usually do before holding a garage sale? \n Options: (A) Put on an advertisement in a local newspaper.

So it makes sense that the elderly should be routinely screened for new tumors   or doesn't it? While such tracking of cancer is a good thing in general, researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly. With the percentage of people over age 65 expected to nearly double by 2050, it s important to weigh the health benefits of screening against the risks and costs of routine testing. In many cases, screening can lead to additional examinations and operations to remove cancer, which can cause side effects, while the cancers themselves may be slow-growing and may not cause serious health problems in patients' remaining years. But the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so ingrained   that when health care experts recommended that women under 50 and over 74 stop screening for breast cancer, it caused a noisy reaction among doctors, patients and social groups. It's hard to uproot deeply-held beliefs about cancer screening with scientific data. Certainly, there are people over age 75 who have had cancers detected by routine screening, and gained several extra years of life because of treatment. And clearly, people over age 75 who have other risk factors for cancer, such as a family history or previous personal experience with the disease, should continue to get screened regularly. But for the rest, the risk of cancer, while increased at the end of life, must be balanced with other factors like remaining life expectancy. A recent study suggests that doctors start to make more objective decisions about who will truly benefit from screening--especially considering the explosion of the elderly. It's not an easy calculation to make, but one that makes sense for patients. Dr. Otis Brawley said, \"Many doctors are ordering these tests purely to cover themselves from medical disputes. We need to think about the wise use of health care, which means making some difficult decisions with elderly patients, and going against the misguided belief that when it comes to health care, more is always better.\" \n Question: Routine cancer screening for the elderly people makes sense because   _  . \n Options: (A) it is believed to contribute to a long life (B) it is part of their health care package (C) they are more sensitive about the health (D) they are in greater danger of tumor growth", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

However, there's one fib that's bigger than all the others. It's \"I don't have a favorite child.\" In his fascinating new book, The Sibling Effect: What Bonds Among Brothers and Sisters Reveal About Us, Jeffrey Kluger, a father of two daughters, aged eight and ten, claims that \" 95 percent of parents in the world have a favorite child -- and the other 5 percent are lying.\" Kluger may be exaggerating the figures for dramatic effect -- but despite every parent's vehement denial that they have a favorite child -- scientific research shows that he is not far off the truth.  According to one recent study by researchers from the University of California -- which followed 384  _ pairs and their parents for three years -- 65 percent of the mothers and 70 percent of fathers exhibited a preference for one child. As this was among families that knew they were being monitored, there's a strong possibility the true figures could be significantly higher. Favoritism is certainly a controversial topic. When raised as a subject for discussion on parenting websites, it always arouses a stream of angry denials.  But interestingly, a lot of personal anecdotes appear from parents who say they were overshadowed by a favored sibling, or were, indeed, their mother or father's favorite. It seems everyone knows favoritism exists -- but nobody wants to put their hand up and say they're guilty of it themselves.  Another research, where siblings have been asked to say who their mother and father favor, suggests that mothers do tend to a show a preference for their first-born son, but fathers often dote on their youngest daughters.   Parents will often be drawn to the child who is easiest to get along with -- or the child that shares similar traits to them. For example, mum will have a special bond with her sensitive, arty son, while dad lavishes attention on his sporty daughter.  Professor Scott says being least favored in a family can color1 our behavior as adults. \"Children who feel they are less loved within their family are more likely to develop low self-esteem, anxiety and depression.\" But some experts believe being less favored can have positive consequences. Professor Scott agrees that favored children can sometimes find life difficult when they have to rub along in the real world. \n Question: Which of the following is most likely a white lie? \n Options: (A) I am determined to go and nothing will stop me.

How would we enjoy speaking with others if we did not use humour to invite a smile or a laugh? And how would we manage in times when we feel sad and lonely?     Using humour we lighten up each day, and we find common ground with others. We build healthy relationships with others by knowing what to say and what to do. When our use of humour is successful, we build trust and cooperation. We discover that we are not alone, we learn to accept our mistakes, and we look for the good in others and in ourselves. Most importantly, we create common ground, as humour is an essential skill needed to communicate well with others. A few well-chosen words get the attention of others and make a serious point without their getting defensive  . Whether we prefer to be the centre of attention or to be shy and quiet, humour can be adjusted   to suit our personality.      However, when we lose our sense of humour, we often get critical or defensive, and we blame others or ourselves for what was said, and how it was said.      To ensure that our humour is welcomed by others, we need to combine our humour with speaking clearly and listening effectively.     Have you ever noticed that successful individuals often use self-depreciating humour to humble   themselves, without putting themselves down? These individuals understand that every person has strengths and weaknesses and that self-depreciating humour invites others to feel more confident and equal.

Within the English curriculum  you tend to look at a play text as a piece of literature rather than performance. But you can't possibly understand Shakespeare's language if you're just reading it in your head. Shakespeare is difficult; it's not a 21stcentury text. You have to use different ways to understand it. The new teaching way focuses on how actors come to understand Shakespeare's language. In fact actors have the same nervousness about Shakespeare's language as young people in schools do. But in six to eight weeks they get to a place of complete confidence about the play. Pupils can do as well. Exercises devised are to let children aged 11 to 14 imitate the methods of professional actors. Written and oral assessments developed alongside the lessons will show how well students have understood the texts. In one task pupils will work on creating four key physical figures of king, warrior , lover and joker, finding which lines of their chosen character go with those features first and then acting them out. Through this they can examine how a character such as Macbeth can switch dramatically within one scene from soldier to kingly figure to trick planner. It's really creative but you're still getting a really wonderful model of understanding. _  Educators think Shakespeare should be a central part of every young person's education.

Sounds easy, right? But the competitors weren't people--they were robots! The bots were participating in  the final round of the US's DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Robotics Challenge. This event, which took place on June 5-6, tested robots on how well they could respond during a disaster and the winning team finally took home a $2 million grand prize. The DARPA challenge was created after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. An earthquake caused a tsunami, which damaged a nuclear power plant. Workers at the plant needed to shut off an important valve , but it was too dangerous for humans to reach it. The US scientists at DARPA wondered whether the disaster could have been avoided if a robot had been sent to do _ . So they set up the robotics competition. Turning a valve was just one task a robot might have to perform when entering a disaster zone. In addition to doing this, robots participating in the challenge had to navigate a course containing several other tasks: driving and exiting a vehicle, opening a door, walking over or clearing objects, cutting a hole in a wall, plus climbing a flight of stairs. Teams had to complete the challenge in one hour, and points were awarded based on how quickly the robots completed a task. They didn't have to attempt all the tasks. To make things even more realistic, challenge organizers caused short computer-system blackouts  that prevented robots and the human operators controlling them from communicating. That means teams had to program their robots to be partially autonomous . Robots also couldn't be attached to anything that could keep them from falling down, which happened a lot. \n Question: What do we know about this year's DARPA challenge? \n Options: (A) It lasted five days.

Thanks to modern technology, we have been able to increase greatly the efficiency of our work force. New machines and new methods have helped cut down time and expense while increasing overall output. This has meant more production and a higher standard of living. For most of us in America, modern technology is thought of as the reason why we can have cars and television sets. However, technology has also increased the amount of food available to us, by means of modern farming machinery and animal breeding techniques, and has extended our life span via  medical technology. Will mankind continue to live longer and have a higher quality of life? In large measure the answer depends on technology and our ability to use it widely. If we keep making progress as we have over the past fifty years, the answer is definitely yes. The advancement of technology depends upon research and development, and the latest statistics  show that the United States is continuing to pump billions of dollars annually  into such efforts. So while we are running out of some scarce resources  we may well find technological substitutes for many of them through our research programs. Therefore, in the final analysis the three major factors of production(land, labor and capital) are all influenced by technology.

Since the public health importance of these chemicals is not yet fully known, they are of increasing concern. The chemicals from fertilizers are also finding their way into water supplies from pollution. As man's desire for water-based recreation increases, greater demands are placed on the quality of the water. The water must not only but be attractive in appearance but also meet certain other conditions.  Sports such as swimming involve direct contact with water, and so water standards are raised higher. The range of water quality necessary for industrial processes varies greatly with the intended use of the water.

People who have hearing trouble suffered meaningful impairments in memory, attention and learning about three years earlier than people with normal hearing, a study published online January 21 in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals. The finding supports the idea that hearing loss can have serious consequences for the brain,says Patricia Tun of Brandeis University in Waltham,Mass., who studies aging. \"I'm hoping it will be a real wake-up call in terms of realizing the importance of hearing. \" Compared with other senses, hearing is often overlooked, Tun says. \"We are made to interact with language and to listen to each other, and it can have damaging effects if we don't.\" Frank Lin of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and colleagues tested the hearing of 1,984 older adults. Most of the participants, who averaged 77 years old, showed some hearing loss -- 1,162 volunteers had trouble hearing noises of less than 25 decibels, comparable to a whisper or rustling leaves. The volunteers; deficits reflect the hearing loss in the general population: Over half of people older than 70 have trouble hearing. Over the next six years, these participants underwent mental evaluations that measured factors such as short-term memory, attention and the ability to quickly match numbers to symbols. Everybody got worse at the tasks as time wore on, but people with hearing loss had an especially sharp decline, the team found. On average, a substantial drop in performance would come about three years earlier to people with hearing loss. Lin cautions that the study has found an association between hearing loss and mental abilities; the researchers can't conclude that hearing loss directly causes the decline. Yet more and more studies are turning up ways that diminished hearing could damage the brain. A person who can't hear well might avoid social situations, and isolation is known to be bad for the brain. \"You gradually become more socially withdrawn, \" Lin says. \"Social isolation is a major, major factor for dementia and cognitive decline. \" Other studies suggest that when people struggle to interpret and decode words, their brains _ energy away from other tasks, such as memory. Audiologist and psychologist Kathy Pichora -- Fuller says that this brain drain happens to everyone, even people without hearing loss. Studies have shown that people are worse at remembering things when they're in a noisy room, for instance. People with hearing loss may be constantly diverting a large swath(--)of their brainpower,leaving less for other mental tasks, says Pichora-- Fuller, of the University of Toronto Mississauga. \n Question: Mass does the research to   _   . \n Options: (A) present the mental decline (B) attach importance to hearing (C) compare hearing with other senses (D) exaggerate the damaging effects", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Researchers from the University of Texas said those who drank two or more diet sodas a day had waist  size increases that were six times greater than those of people who didn't drink diet soda.\"What we saw was that the more diet sodas a person drank, the more weight they were likely to gain,\" said Sharon Fowler. The study was based on data from 474 participants in a large, ongoing research project, where the participants were followed for nearly l0 years. While the findings are surprising, they also offer some explanations. Nutrition  expert, Melanie Rogers, who works with overweight patients in New York, has found that when patients are switched  from regular to diet soda, they don't lose weight at all.\"We weren't seeing weight loss necessarily, and that was confusing to us,\" said Rogers. So why would diet soda cause weight gain? No one knows for sure yet, but it could be that people think they can eat more if they drink diet soda, and so over-compensate  for the missing calories( ). A related study found some sweeteners   raised blood sugar levels in some mice.\" Data from this and other potential studies suggest that the promotion of diet sodas and artificial  sweeteners may be risky,\" said study researcher Helen P.Hazuda, professor at the University of Texas's school of medicine.

After travelling from Beijing up to Xi'an, I wanted to challenge myself by choosing a smaller town----Xiahe in Gansu Province. I arrived in Lanzhou at around 5 am, but there were no buses to Xiahe. I managed to spot a policeman and attempted to explain my destination to him in simple English, praying that he would understand. I wasn't sure that he did but I just followed him anyway as I had no choice. He took me on a bus and I didn't know where I was going. Luckily, I met a student who explained to me in English that the policeman was taking me to another bus station where I could take a bus to Xiahe. During this conversation a third man said he was also a policeman and would help me buy tickets. But as he was not in uniform, I was a little doubtful. The uniformed policeman told me it was OK to go with the third man, so I got off the bus with the so-called policeman who at this point, disappeared and I was left in the middle of nowhere. I stood panicking. Around one minute later a police car came and stopped right by me. It was the un-uniformed policeman. I got into the car and he dropped me directly at the bus station, and helped me buy the ticket. This is one of many experiences that I have had in China.

Why should money, time and effort be spent exploring and researching something with so few obvious benefits? Why should resources be spent on space rather than on conditions and people on Earth? These are questions that, understandably, are very often asked. Perhaps the best answer lies in our genetic makeup   as human beings. What drove our ancestors to move from the trees into the plains, and on into all possible areas and environments? The wider the spread of a species, the better its chance of survival. Perhaps the best reason for exploring space is this genetic tendency to expand wherever possible. Nearly every successful civilization  has explored, because by doing so, any dangers in surrounding areas can be identified and prepared for. Without knowledge, we may be completely destroyed by the danger. With knowledge, we can lessen its effects. Exploration also allows minerals and other potential   resources to be found. Even if we have no immediate need of them, they will perhaps be useful later. Resources may be more than physical possessions . Knowledge or techniques have been gained through exploration. The techniques may have medical applications which can improve the length or quality of our lives. We have already benefited from other spin-offs including improvements in earthquake prediction, in satellites for weather forecasting and in communications systems. Even non-stick pans and mirrored sunglasses are by-products   of technological developments in the space industry! While many resources are spent on what seems a small return, the exploration of space allows creative, brave and intelligent members of our species to focus on what may serve to save us. While space may hold many wonders and explanations of how the universe was formed or how it works, it also holds dangers. The danger exists, but knowledge can help human being to survive. Without the ability to reach out across space, the chance to save ourselves might not exist.

On returning to Australia, she talked endlessly about her grandmother's next-door neighbor, Mara.

Our everyday speech is made up in large part of words like probably, many, soon, great, little. What do these words mean?Such verbal expression is not necessarily to be criticized. Indeed, it has a value just because it allows us to express judgments when a precise quantitative statement is out of the question. We have been trying to pin down by experiments what people mean by these expressions in specific contexts, and how the meanings change with age. For instance, a subject is told \"There are many trees in the park\" and is asked to say what number the word many mean to him. Or a child is invited to take \"some\" sweets from a bowl and we then count how many he has taken. We compare the number he takes when he is alone with the number when one or more other children are present and are to take some sweets after him, or with the number he takes when told to give \"some\" sweets to another child. First, we find that the number depends, of course, on the items involved. To most people some friends means about five, while some trees means about twenty. However, unrelated areas sometimes show parallel values. For instance, the language of probability seems to mean about the same thing in predictions about the weather and about politics: the expression \"is certain to\" (rain, or be elected) signifies to the average person about a 70 percent chance; \"is likely to\", about a 60 percent chance; \"probably will\" about 55 percent. Secondly, the size of the population of items influences the value assigned to an expression. Thus, if we tell a subject to take \"a few\" or \" a lot of\" glass balls from a box, he will take more if the box contains a large number of glass balls than if it has a small number. But not proportionately more: if we increase the number of glass balls eight times, the subject takes only half as large a percentage of the total. Thirdly, there is a marked change with age. Among children between six and fourteen years old, the older the child, the fewer glass balls he will take. But the difference between a lot and a few widens with age. This age effect is so consistent that it might be used as a test of intelligence. \n Question: What's the right attitude towards the words like probably, many, soon? \n Options: (A) They are inaccurate and we should avoid them.
