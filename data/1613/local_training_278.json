After 48 hr the surviving animals were killed and measurements were made of the risk region (by postmortem angiography) and infarct size (by gross pathology). All measurements were made by investigators blinded to treatment given, and the code was broken only at the end of the study. Hemodynamic variables and collateral flow during ischemia were similar in the two groups. Infarct size in control animals (n = 8) averaged 22.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle and 52.2 +/- 7.1% of the risk region, compared with 13.3 +/- 0.8% of the left ventricle and 33.6 +/- 2.1% of the risk region in h-SOD-treated dogs (n = 8) (p less than .05). Infarcts in treated animals were not only smaller, but also exhibited a distinctive \"patchiness,\" suggesting protection along vascular distributions. Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between infarct size and collateral flow measured during ischemia in the two groups indicated that protection by h-SOD was greatest in animals with the lowest collateral flows. This study supports the concept that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in a separate component of cell damage, presumably linked to the generation of oxygen free radicals on reflow. Since the h-SOD preventable reperfusion component of injury was most pronounced in hearts with the most severe ischemia, scavenging of oxygen radicals at the time of reflow may offer a novel and particularly promising therapeutic approach for the protection of ischemic myocardium. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Today, echocardiography enjoys a prominent place in the physician's diagnostic armamentarium.

Although methods of ascertainment are not standardised, regional differences and changes with time are present for each of these statistics. Mortality has declined, whereas prevalence and hospital discharge rates have increased owing in part to the improved survival but also to better case ascertainment. The gradient in prevalence seen between Southern England (63/10(5)), Northern England and Northern Ireland (76-79/10(5)), Wales (c. 113/10(5)), North-East Scotland (155/10(5)) and the Orkneys (258/10(5)) can in part be attributed to varying methods of ascertainment but correlates with regional differences in the frequency of HLA-DR2 in normal individuals (21-50%). However no HLA-DR2 association is observed in parts of Scotland, where the prevalence is the highest in the United Kingdom, because HLA-DR2 and linked genes occur in up to 50% of the normal population from these areas. If the aetiology of multiple sclerosis is multifactorial the frequency of the disease will increase where susceptibility genes are common because the probability of concurrence of the remaining critical events is high; conversely when each aetiological agent is infrequent the chance of them all occurring in the same individual and therefore incidence of the disease are both lower. The fall in incidence observed in the Orkney Islands, possibly reflecting decline in an exogenous agent interacting with susceptibility factors, is consistent with this multifactorial hypothesis. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: The purpose of this study was to add to the limited information available regarding the pharmacology of ritodrine in the peripartum period when treatment fails and labor is not inhibited.

Since Parkinson's disease also involves lesions in extra-striatal midbrain cells which reduce the extrinsic supply of dopamine to this cortical region, such functions are at double risk. Forty nondemented parkinsonian patients were drawn from a pool of 100 consecutive patients and matched with 40 normal control subjects according to age, education, IQ, and sex. All patients were quantitatively rated on neurological indices of disease. Neuropsychological assessment of the patient and normal groups included tests of general intelligence, psychomotor skills, memory, visuospatial and executive functions. No global cognitive decline was observed in the parkinsonian group. Moreover, memory and visuospatial abilities were generally intact. A small cluster of deficits emerged, interpreted as reflecting impairment in the ability to spontaneously generate efficient strategies when relying on self-directed task-specific planning. In addition, several tests thought to be sensitive to frontal lobe function distinguished patients with symptoms strongly lateralized to the right versus left side of the body. Deficits in strategic planning were later investigated in relation to severity of disease and to patient attributes including IQ and age, both of which were relevant to performance on specific tasks. Results were compared with previous investigations in parkinsonian patients and discussed from the perspective of both animal and human studies involving damage to the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. As the prefrontal cortex is thought to play a crucial role in self-directed behavioural planning, the validity of an outflow model in predicting the consequences of caudate nucleus dysfunction was supported. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Available facial tissue thickness standards for facial feature reconstruction are based on adult measurements.

To determine whether the rat system serves as a general model for prodynorphin processing in the mammalian posterior pituitary, we examined the steady state levels of prodynorphin-derived opioid peptides in the posterior pituitary systems of representatives of three diverse orders of mammals: guinea pig (order Rodentia), pig (order Artiodactyla), and rhesus monkey (order Primates). In each species studied there was evidence for species-specific deviations from the rat model. The most pronounced differences were observed with respect to the conversion of dynorphin A-(1-17) to dynorphin A-(1-8). In rodents, rats, and guinea pigs, under steady state conditions, the molar ratios of these forms are approximately 1:2 and 2.5:1, respectively. However, in the pig and rhesus monkey, the molar ratios of these forms are 10:1 and 14:1, respectively. Thus, under steady state conditions, the conversion of dynorphin A-(1-17) to dynorphin A-(1-8) appears to be a minor event in porcine and rhesus monkey posterior pituitary. Species-specific variations were also observed with respect to the steady state levels of alpha-neo-endorphin and dynorphin B-(1-13). In addition, the results of these studies suggest that the conversion of prodynorphin-derived opioids to leu-enkephalin probably represents a minor event in the species studied. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: This study was performed to determine whether the brain can increase the number of perfused capillaries and arterioles supplying it regionally during hemorrhage.

Regional cerebral blood flow was determined using [14C]iodoantipyrine in half of these animals and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran was injected in the other half for determination of perfused cerebral microvascular morphometric indexes. The total microvasculature was labeled postmortem via an alkaline phosphatase stain. Regional cerebral blood flow was significantly increased in animals bled to 65 mmHg. During hemorrhage to 40-45 mmHg, cerebral blood flow was reduced 50% (from 59 +/- 28 to 26 +/- 11 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1, mean +/- SD) with no regional redistribution. For all treatments, total capillary density ranged from 400 to 500 capillaries/mm2, and in controls 47% were perfused. Animals bled to 65 mmHg did not mobilize their unperfused microvascular reserve even though they showed a slight tendency to do so. During hemorrhage to 40-45 mmHg, this percent increased significantly to 57% with the largest increase occurring in the pons. Approximately 51% of arterioles were perfused in controls and this was not different compared with the percent perfused during hemorrhage. Despite the overall lack of mobilization of unperfused arterioles, some regions within the brain significantly mobilized their reserves with severe hemorrhage, e.g., hippocampus (78%), hypothalamus (67%), and medulla (73%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: A clinical trial was undertaken to assess the effects of oral H1 (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) and H2 (cimetidine) histamine blockade on nasal resistance induced by topical histamine.

The shoulder mechanism provides the upper limb with a range of motion exceeding that of any other joint mechanism. The placement of the hand is determined by four components of the shoulder complex: the glenohumeral, acromioclavicular, and sternoclavicular joints and the scapulothoracic gliding mechanism. The clavicular joints permit the scapula to move against the chest wall during movements of the arm, allowing the glenoid fossa to follow the head of the humerus, and thus contribute significantly to total arm movement. The functional interrelationships between the glenohumeral, scapulothoracic, and clavicular joint mechanisms are critical in providing a full, functional ROM. Any pathological condition of any one of these mechanisms will disturb upper limb function. The ligamentous and periarticular structures of the shoulder complex combine in maintaining the joint relationships, withstanding the forces applied to the joint surfaces, and stabilizing the dependent limb. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "No", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: There has been concern that the smoking of tobacco can adversely affect the health of non-smokers.

Maternal smoking caused a significant rise in both IgE (p less than 0.05) and IgD (p less than 0.05), a finding that was most apparent in newborn infants with a negative biparental history of allergy (p less than 0.025 and p = 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, newborn infants of nonallergic parents had a more than threefold (p less than 0.01) higher incidence of elevated cord IgE (greater than or equal to 1.20 IU/ml) and a fourfold (p = 0.005) higher risk of developing definite or probable atopic disease before 18 months of age if the mother smoked than if she did not. Paternal smoking did not influence, in whatever the subgroup, cord IgE or subsequent infant allergy but increased cord IgD (p less than 0.001) among newborn infants with a negative family history even after controlling for maternal smoking (p less than 0.04). These results suggest that parental smoking in some way affects the fetal immune system, probably via substances in tobacco smoke. Maternal smoking in particular appears to exert a pronounced effect on the IgE system already in fetal life, predisposing even \"low-risk\" infants to subsequent sensitization, probably in synergy with a later acquired mucosal damage that would facilitate penetration of foreign matter. Pregnant women and mothers should be encouraged to try and give up smoking that might help to prevent allergic disease in their infants. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Pulsatile LH secretion was studied to determine if the frequency of LH pulses was altered by the administration of clomiphene citrate (CC; 150 mg) for 5 days during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Seven normal women received CC or placebo in alternate cycles in a randomized double blind fashion. On the day after drug administration, blood samples were obtained at 15-min intervals for 8 h for serum LH determinations. Daily blood samples were also obtained throughout the luteal phase for determination of serum LH, estradiol (E2), and progesterone. LH pulse frequency increased from 2.4 +/- 0.5 (+/- SEM)/8 h after placebo to 3.9 +/- 0.6/8 h (P less than 0.01) after CC treatment, but pulse amplitude did not change. The transverse mean of serum LH was higher after CC (13.6 +/- 0.5 mIU/ml) than after placebo (8.4 +/- 0.3 mIU/ml; P less than 0.001), and luteal phase length was increased from 13.5 +/- 0.5 to 16.0 +/- 0.4 days (P less than 0.001) by administration of CC. Luteal phase levels of E2 and progesterone measured daily were significantly elevated (P less than 0.01) in CC-treated cycles. These findings suggest that CC increases the frequency of hypothalamic GnRH secretory episodes, perhaps by an action involving a decrease in endogenous opioid peptide activity. Since peripheral progesterone levels were elevated in the CC-treated cycles, E2 may play a permissive role in the ability of progesterone to increase endogenous opioid peptide activity acutely. Furthermore, since the luteal phase was significantly prolonged by an increase in endogenous LH pulse frequency, the slow frequency of LH pulses in the normal late luteal phase may contribute to the onset of luteolysis in the human. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: A new optimization model for explaining the observed left ventricular ejection patterns is presented.

Mouse thyrotropic tumor tissue, or pituitaries from euthyroid or hypothyroid mice, were incubated with D-[2-3H]Man, homogenized, and incubated in the presence or absence of pH 3 buffer to dissociate heterodimers. Highly enriched TSH beta-subunits, or TSH heterodimers, were obtained using anti-TSH beta serum and free alpha-subunits were subsequently obtained using anti-LH alpha-serum. High Man units released by endoglycosidase H were analyzed by paper chromatography. At 1 and 3 h oligosaccharides with 8 or 9 Man residues predominated in all subunits. In all three tissue types, units with 9 Man tended to accumulate in TSH beta-subunits, whereas Man-trimming from Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc proceeded more rapidly in TSH alpha-subunits, and in free alpha-subunits. The rate of TSH beta-subunit processing was also a function of tissue type; the rate in euthyroid pituitary tissue equaled that in tumor tissue and was greater than that in hypothyroid pituitary tissue, suggesting that processing may be physiologically regulated. Hypothyroid calf serum slowed TSH alpha-subunit processing in euthyroid pituitaries. Thus, the previously reported slower processing of Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc in heterodimers as compared to free alpha-subunits is in large part due to accumulation of Man9GlcNAc in TSH beta-subunits. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: In this investigation, determinations of peak diastolic filling rate (PDFR) and ejection fraction (EF) by two distinct nuclear techniques--gated radionuclide angiography (RNA) and nuclear cardiac probe (NCP)--were compared with contrast ventriculography in 44 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Oxygen saturation (SaO2 was negatively correlated with maximal expiratory flow at FRC, indicating that measurement of SaO2 alone may not be sufficient in the evaluation of lung function in infants with BPD.

The absorption of injected epinephrine was variable and in several cases very slow. The individual maximum values for epinephrine in plasma were 4.65 +/- 1.09 (range 0.74 to 8.31) nmol/L, and these maxima were attained 5 to 120 minutes after injection. Inhaled epinephrine was rapidly and dose dependently absorbed. Ten inhalations resulted in 2.72 +/- 0.84 (0.75 to 5.67) nmol/L within 5 minutes and 20 inhalations resulted in 7.19 +/- 1.78 (2.10 to 13.83) nmol/L with rapid increases and maxima within 20 minutes in seven of eight subjects. Gastrointestinal side effects were dose limiting when epinephrine was administered by inhalation. Our results indicate that inhalation of 2 to 3 mg of epinephrine produces rapid increases of epinephrine concentrations in plasma to levels that have previously been demonstrated to counteract bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled allergen in subjects with asthma. Inhalation has several advantages over injection for self-administration of epinephrine, e.g., in patients who are allergic to insect (Hymenoptera) stings. Apart from the absorption being more rapid, the locally high concentrations of epinephrine in the airways should be advantageous, since bronchoconstriction is one of the life-threatening phenomena of the anaphylactic reaction. This route of administration is also simple for the patient. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Results from studies of twin concordance in multiple sclerosis have not conclusively differentiated between environmental and genetic factors that determine susceptibility to the disease. Published studies that have been based on case finding by public appeal have been characterized by difficulties in ascertainment. The data reported here are from a large population-based study of multiple sclerosis in twins, in which ascertainment has been relatively unbiased and the cooperation of patients nearly complete. A total of 5463 patients attending 10 multiple sclerosis clinics across Canada were surveyed. Twenty-seven monozygotic and 43 dizygotic twin pairs were identified, and the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was verified by examination and laboratory investigation. Seven of 27 monozygotic pairs (25.9 percent) and 1 of 43 dizygotic pairs (2.3 percent) were concordant for multiple sclerosis. The concordance rate for 4582 nontwin siblings of patients at two multiple sclerosis clinics was 1.9 percent, closely paralleling the concordance rate in dizygotic twins. To the extent that the difference in concordance rates between monozygotic and dizygotic twins indicates genetic susceptibility, the results of this study show a major genetic component in susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: The role in the pathogenesis of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis of C5 or some terminal complement component dependent upon C5 for activation was explored in a congenic strain of C5 sufficient (NSN) and C5 deficient (OSN) mice. When these mice were given daily injections of heterologous protein, horse apoferritin (HAF), there were profound differences between the strains in the development of glomerulonephritis and renal dysfunction. When NSN and OSN mice produced low levels of anti-HAF, NSN mice developed extensive glomerular deposits of HAF and immune reactants and a mild proliferative glomerulonephritis. In contrast, comparable OSN mice developed only trace mesangial localization of HAF and no glomerular lesions by light microscopy. When NSN and OSN mice produced high levels of anti-HAF, both strains had equivalent glomerular immune deposits; however, NSN mice developed a severe necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, while OSN mice had much less glomerular injury. Compared to OSN mice, these NSN mice also had much more severe tubulointerstitial injury, and significantly higher serum creatinine levels. Thus, in this experimental model, the absence of C5 resulted in reduced glomerular immune complex localization when there were small amounts of circulating immune reactants; and in markedly reduced glomerular leukocyte influx, necrosis and crescent formation, when large amounts of immune reactants have localized in glomeruli. These effects could be mediated by C5 (such as C5a) or by some terminal complement component(s) dependent upon C5 for activation. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: The selection of assessment procedures for the preclinical evaluation of haemosorbents and the relationship between such procedures and the intended application are exemplified by examination of the design and utilization of procedures based on the rat.

To identify age-related alterations in vitamin D and PTH physiology and to assess their impact on skeletal health, we studied 62 normal men, aged 30-92 yr. The men were in excellent health, and none had any evidence of metabolic bone disease and/or known risk factors for osteopenia. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations declined steadily with advancing age (r = -0.47; P less than 0.001), and there was a corresponding decline in serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25-(OH)2D] levels (r = -0.41; P less than 0.001). Serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations, however, did not vary over this age range (r = -0.07; P = NS). Plasma PTH levels increased with aging (r = -0.24; P less than 0.001), and there was a concomitant increase in urinary cAMP excretion (r = 0.38; P less than 0.001). Renal function (creatinine clearance) clearly declined with increasing age (r = -0.71; P less than 0.001). In conjunction with these changes in calcium metabolism, radial and vertebral bone mineral content declined. Whereas the fall in radial bone mineral content (single photon absorptiometry) at both proximal and distal sites was slight, there was a marked decrease in vertebral bone mineral content, as measured by quantitative computed tomography (r = -0.72; P less than 0.0001). The fall in vertebral bone mineral content correlated well with the declines in serum 25OHD and 24,25-(OH)2D concentrations (r = 0.47; P less than 0.001 and r = 0.51; P less than 0.001, respectively) and with the decline in renal function (r = 0.46; P less than 0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the effects of aging on bone mineral content could be accounted for in large part by concomitant changes in mineral metabolism. Both the decline in renal function and the fall in serum 24,25-(OH)2D levels were closely associated with the fall in bone mineral content. These results indicate that a decline in renal function and alterations in vitamin D metabolism occur with aging in normal men. These changes contribute to, if not cause, the associated decline in skeletal mineral content in aging men. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: A hemophiliac with a self-inflicted abdominal stab wound was evaluated with computerized tomography, ultrasound, and technetium-99m labeled red blood cell (Tc-99m RBC) imaging.

In circular and longitudinal ileal smooth muscle, tetrodotoxin was used to separate direct from neurally mediated contractile effects. Cholecystokinin receptors on smooth muscle cells were found in all locations. The muscle cells displayed a decreasing order of sensitivity to the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin as expressed in the median doses, and to the selective cholecystokinin antagonist, proglumide, as expressed in the inhibitory dissociation constants. The median doses of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin ranged from 5.5 nM in gallbladder muscle to 185 nM in circular ileal muscle; the corresponding inhibitory dissociation constants of proglumide ranged from 180 to 437 microM [corrected]. Cholecystokinin receptors on cholinergic neurons were confined to circular and longitudinal ileal muscle; the neurons were 80-300 times more sensitive to the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (D50's 0.5 and 2.3 nM) than the corresponding muscle cells, and 19-21 times more sensitive to proglumide (inhibitory dissociation constants, 20 microM [corrected]).

This technique consists of a complete mobilization of the left subclavian artery extended to the origin of its first branches. The aorta need not be extensively mobilized and the intercostal arteries are individually controlled with snares. After all the proper clamping, the left subclavian artery is detached from the aorta at its origin and is opened longitudinally on its posterior aspect. The anterior wall of the aorta is then incised, beginning with the opening at the origin of the left subclavian artery and extending distally to the descending aorta 12 to 15 mm past the coarctation. The coarctation membrane is excised and the ductus is ligated and divided. The opened left subclavian artery, now forming a flap, is pulled down and sutured to the edges of the aorta, widening the coarctation site and also preserving the blood flow to the left arm. The ages of the patients ranged from 2 months to 25 years (mean 4.24 +/- 4.9 years) and their weights ranged from 2.8 to 52 kg (mean: 14.8 +/- 10.0 kg). There were no hospital deaths and the mean follow-up was 9.6 months (+/- 4.9 months). Recatheterization of four patients from 4 to 12 months postoperatively showed adequate correction and strongly suggested normal growth of the aorta at the site of coarctation, as well as preservation of the blood flow through the left subclavian artery. Doppler measurements showed normal flow to the left arm and no gradients through the isthmic area. Our experience indicates that this technique is not only feasible but is the procedure of choice in most cases of discrete isthmic coarctation and in some cases of long narrowing of the isthmus in patients with a wide range of ages and weights. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Supramaximal medial and lateral rectus surgery was performed to correct horizontal deviations in seven cases of sixth nerve palsy and three cases of third nerve palsy, with satisfactory results in most cases.

Vessel edges were measured by use of catheter calibration and an automated computer algorithm yielding two \"absolute dimensions\" (mean and minimum diameters) and two measurements (percent stenosis and atheroma area) that required a \"normal reference\" diameter. The coefficient of variation for repeated segment measurements was less for mean and minimum diameter than for percent stenosis and area of atheroma. The best measure of progression of coronary disease as determined by t test comparison of different methods was the change in mean diameter over time (6.7 +/- 14.1% decrease), whether calculated on a per coronary segment or per patient basis (p less than .001). Based on this measurement and its standard deviation of progression of coronary disease in this patient subset with relatively benign disease, it is estimated that 470 patients per group would be required for an interventional study to demonstrate a 33% reduction in disease progression (207 patients for 50% reduction) at a 95% confidence level and 90% power. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Six subjects (25.3 +/- 3.3 yr, mean +/- SD) exercised for 60 min at 42 +/- 4 [low (L)], 55 +/- 6 [moderate (M)], and 67 +/- 4 %VO2max [high (H)] in a moderate environment.

All were full agonists for both effects, and all were more potent for the stimulation of cell growth than for stimulation of PRL production. The order of analog potency for both biological effects was the same as the order of potency for inhibiting saturable [3H]estradiol binding to intact cells. Therefore, both biological effects appear to be mediated through the same receptor, and metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol is unlikely to account for the difference in the concentrations required to elicit the two effects. We selected two estrogen-responsive clones from a cDNA library made from GH4C1 cells. The clones were chosen because they were induced at the estrogen concentrations that stimulate growth. Estradiol caused maximal stimulation of the mRNAs corresponding to the two recombinant clones at 10(-10) M, a concentration over 10-fold lower than that required for maximal stimulation of PRL mRNA. These data indicate that a difference in sensitivity to estrogen occurs at the level of mRNA accumulation as well as at the level of the biological responses. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Antithrombotic therapy in prevention and management of stroke is evolving rapidly as new clinical data better define indications.

However, because it is difficult to isolate and grow precursor populations, it has not proved possible to study rearrangements occurring in normal untransformed cells in vitro. Here we show that a single T-cell precursor colonizing an alymphoid thymus lobe in organ culture can generate multiple receptor beta-chain gene rearrangements.

The mean serum creatinine concentration was 2.48 mg per deciliter. The low serum bicarbonate level and the high serum anion gap were corrected by rehydration. The increased serum anion gap was caused by hyperproteinemia, lactic acidemia, and hyperphosphatemia, with anionic contributions to the rise in anion gap estimated as protein, 5.5 meq per liter; lactate, 2.5 meq per liter; and phosphate, 2.5 meq per liter. The hyperproteinemia was attributed to dehydration, the lactic acidemia to shock, and the hyperphosphatemia to acidosis and transient renal failure. The mean concentrations of serum calcium and magnesium were slightly elevated but did not affect the increased anion gap. These results indicate that severe cholera causes acidosis with relatively little change in serum chloride but an increased serum anion gap. The acidosis is more profound than would be expected on the basis of stool losses of bicarbonate, because of superimposed lactic acidemia and renal failure. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Thirty legs in nineteen patients, eleven with bilateral and eight with unilateral chronic anterior-compartment syndrome, were treated by fasciotomy.

The purpose of this study was to examine the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios in a group of healthy subjects and to determine if some of the variability is accounted for by different maximum inspiratory pressures. We measured maximum expiratory and inspiratory flows at 50 percent of vital capacity from the flow-volume curves, and maximum inspiratory pressures in a group of 60 healthy nonsmokers (30 men and 30 women) whose ages ranged from 21 to 40 years. We found that mid-vital capacity flow ratio (mean +/- SD) was 0.72 +/- 0.19 in men and 0.77 +/- 0.18 in women. The coefficient of variation of the mid-vital capacity flow ratio was 28 percent for men and 23 percent for women. The 95 percent confidence limits for the mid-vital capacity flow ratio were 0.65 to 0.79 for men and 0.70 to 0.84 for women. Maximum inspiratory pressures (mean +/- SD) were 129 +/- 30 cm H2O in men and 91 +/- 16 cm H2O in women, not significantly different from previous studies. Normalizing maximum inspiratory flow for maximum inspiratory pressure did not reduce the coefficient of variation, which became 29 percent in men and 30 percent in women. We conclude that the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios is wide, and it cannot be reduced by standardizing it for maximum inspiratory pressures. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Spastic patients were instructed to make accurate, rapid ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion movements over different distances to a target. Ankle position and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. In 3 of 8 spastic patients tested, dorsiflexion evoked velocity-dependent activation of the antagonist (SOL) muscle which impeded the movement to the extent that the limb unintentionally reversed movement direction. We propose that this activation is reflex in origin since it is tightly synchronized, has a large peak amplitude, occurs about 50 ms after the initiation of the movement, and is velocity dependent. One of the 3 patients who had reflex-induced antagonist activation in dorsiflexion also demonstrated sustained clonus during plantarflexion. This usually occurred only if the target had been overshot so that the return of the limb stretched the soleus muscle and triggered clonus. We conclude that in some patients, hyperactive stretch reflexes cause movement deficits. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Digital subtraction angiography is a new imaging technique that uses a computer to subtract background distractions and to enhance contrast and density.

The value of intravenous digital subtraction angiography in screening for renovascular hypertension is less controversial, but selection of patients remains a subject for further study.

All lungs were perfused for 4.5 h at a constant rate of 100 ml X min-1 X kg-1. In control lungs, the left atrial pressure (Pla) was kept at atmospheric pressure. In experimental lungs, Pla was kept atmospheric except for a 50-min elevation to 18 mmHg midway through the perfusion. During this period of left atrial hypertension, pulmonary arterial pressure rose from 18 to 31 mmHg, lymph flow rose from 3 to 12 ml/h, and the lymph-to-plasma oncotic pressure ratio (pi L/pi P) fell from 0.7 to 0.48. After left atrial pressure was returned to control, pulmonary arterial pressure, lymph flow, and pi L/pi P all returned to control levels. The rate of weight gain after the return of left atrial pressure to control was also the same as that in the control group. However, during the period of left atrial hypertension 135 ml of fluid were filtered into the lung, and this large increase in lung weight remained after the pressure was lowered. The presence of this substantial excess lung water despite control values for vascular pressures, lymph flow, rate of weight gain, and pi L/pi P suggests that the absolute amount of lung water has little influence on the dynamic aspects of lung fluid balance. These results are consistent with a two-compartment model of the interstitial space, where only one of the compartments is readily drained by the lymphatics. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction occurred in a 25-year-old woman.

The following basic principles of clinical psychopharmacology should be followed: Consider risk and benefits; clinical experience is prerequisite; establish the diagnosis; select the appropriate class of psychotropic drug for the primary diagnosis; within drug class, the drugs are usually equally effective for patients with the diagnosis; give a dose that is high enough to be effective; choose target symptoms that can be monitored to indicate when to stop or increase the drug; avoid use of multiple drugs when possible; drugs are only one element in a comprehensive treatment strategy.

A linear accelerometer was affixed to the lever arm. Speed settings were standardized percentages of each machine's maximum tachometer feedback voltage (0 to 100% Vfb max). Regression of Cybex transducer-observed voltages (V0) on true, i.e., expected, torques (Me) revealed that, for any static loading condition or angle, the measurement system was essentially linear and valid, although greater variance was evident for smaller torques. However, different calibrations, i.e., regression lines, were required for different speed settings. The error in predicting Me from V0 increased substantially with increased % Vfb max. Methodologies which assume constant velocity dynamic loading induce questionable, often invalid, results and inferences. Dynamic V0 represents both gravitational and inertial components. Considerable fluctuations in lever arm instantaneous velocity were ascribed to the combined influence of load and % Vfb max upon the servomotor. After computing inertia-corrected Me, calibration variability and prediction error were markedly reduced. Unexplained variability may be due to poor proximity of the Cybex transducer to the force application point. We concluded that: Cybex II should be calibrated only statically; use of an optimal filter will avoid false estimates of joint torque; inertial corrections must be applied in order to minimize potentially serious errors due to system angular acceleration; and reported muscle function relationships might be usefully re-assessed in view of these findings. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: When elements of a parallel network, such as the human brain, are extensively interconnected, the network can exhibit 'cooperative behaviour'.

Five antibodies that varied by either their affinity for beta hCG or their specificity for epitopes on CTP were investigated. To measure hormone levels, we used as the radiolabeled indicator an alpha-subunit-reactive Mab. The monoclonal-immunoradiometric assay had a lower limit of sensitivity of 0.05 ng/ml. Serum levels of hCG or hCG-like material with CTP structure were measured in 229 healthy blood donors; 1.1% of healthy men and 4.6% of nonpregnant women younger than 50 yr had serum values varying between 0.05 and 0.23 ng/ml. Moreover, 6 to 7 healthy women older than 50 yr had detectable levels in the 0.05-0.20 ng/ml range. To study the disappearance rates in normal women, we followed serum hCG serum levels of 6 women who had previously received a single im injection of the hormone. These individuals failed to develop a pregnancy after in vitro fertilization; hCG declined from 0.5 to 0.05 ng/ml within 2 weeks. These results were in contrast to the findings in 12 patients with hCG-producing tumors. In 9 patients without any evidence of recurrent disease, hCG levels became undetectable within 5 months. However, 3 others had levels consistently above 0.05 but below 0.5 ng/ml. In 2 of these three patients, subsequent increasing hCG levels were associated with tumor recurrence. We conclude that this hCG assay based on both anti-peptide and anti-hCG Mabs may be useful in tumor monitoring. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: The capacity to absorb fructose in 10 healthy adults was investigated by means of hydrogen breath analysis.

Moreover, the mathematics turned out simple, since the concentration courses could be described with one exponential power. Therefore, a formal model was developed, assuming linear isotherms and adsorption, proportional to the average concentration in the column. With this model predicted in-vitro inlet and outlet concentrations could be fitted to the measured data accurately. A relation between both models is given under the condition of high intraparticle mass transfer, which is allowed in case of powder adsorbents.

The number of patients diagnosed yearly has increased since CT scanning became available, but despite the enhanced sensitivity, the time from either onset of symptoms or hospital admission until initiation of therapy was not decreased and there was no dramatic effect upon morbidity or mortality in this series. Infections of paranasal sinuses, ears, lungs, and odontogenic foci were predisposing factors in approximately 70% of cases. Single abscesses, present in 75% of patients, were distributed equally in both hemispheres, with more than half in the frontal and parietal lobes. Common signs and symptoms included headache, fever, chills, seizures, nausea, vomiting, altered sensorium, nuchal rigidity, and localizing neurologic signs. Blood cultures were positive in 11%. Lumbar puncture rarely provided data from which a diagnosis could be established; CSF cultures were positive in only 7% of patients, and there was a 15% temporally associated incidence of brain herniation and death. Diagnostic information was most readily obtained using imaging techniques such as CT and 99mTc scanning, and arteriography was invasive and of no added value. CT scans are however, often initially negative in patients presenting with clinical signs of meningitis presumably following rupture of an abscess into the subarachnoid space, and the average time for changes to appear on CT scan is 9 days. It is, therefore, recommended that when the clinical assessment suggests the possibility of brain abscess the patient be treated empirically with antibiotics and that lumbar puncture be performed only after thoughtful assessment of the risk-to-benefit ratio for each patient. Causative organisms were isolated from more than 80% of abscesses despite prior antibiotic treatment; more than half grew a single pathogen, most commonly streptococci. Anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria accounted for 62% of all isolates, and were the only organisms in 33% of patients. Computerized tomographic scans in 30 patients showed \"ring-enhancing\" lesions, nodular enhancement, or areas of low attenuation. Complete resolution of abscesses on CT scans rarely occurred during hospitalization and took as long as 5 months. Decrease in the size of abscesses on CT scan correlated well with clinical improvement and was seen within a week when abscesses were excised, but was often not obvious for 6 to 8 weeks if antibiotics were used alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: The binding by serum albumin of many drugs and endogenous metabolites is impaired in humans and animals with renal failure. Unknown solute(s) retained in renal failure have been extracted from uremic fluids. When added to normal plasma they induce a similar binding defect. Similar activity can be extracted from normal urine. We have devised a series of extraction and purification techniques that yielded three binding inhibitory ligands from normal human urine in sufficient quantity and of a high degree of purity. Rigorous methods have been applied to determine chemical identity of the ligands. Purification steps consisted of: adsorption at pH 3.0 to polystyrene-divinylbenzene resin (XAD-2); elution from the resin with methanol followed by drying and solution in dilute formic acid; passage through SP-Sephadex to remove cations, especially yellow-brown pigments; adsorption to the anion exchanger QAE-Sephadex, and separation into three zones of inhibitory activity with a formic acid gradient; purification to homogeneity with C-8 or C-18 silica reversed-phase chromatography. Using this isolation procedure, followed by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have shown that the binding inhibitory activity is due not to one ligand, but to a family of aromatic acids. To date hippurate, beta-(m-hydroxyphenyl)-hydracrylate and p-hydroxyphenylacetate have been identified as binding inhibitors.

After four weeks of therapy the 11 cyclosporine recipients had the following response to treatment: two had total clearing and six improved markedly, two moderately, and one minimally; whereas ten vehicle-treated patients showed no change or minimal improvement. Vehicle-treated patients, after a switch to cyclosporine for four weeks, demonstrated impressive improvement similar to that seen in patients who initially received only cyclosporine. Moderate or marked improvement or total clearing was noted in 17 (81%) of 21 and 20 (95%) of 21 after one and four weeks of therapy, respectively. Mitotic figures and leukotriene B4 levels in lesions decreased 86% and 64%, respectively, after seven days of cyclosporine therapy. Mononuclear (including activated T cells) and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrates were markedly reduced in lesions of all patients after seven days of cyclosporine therapy. These results suggest that psoriasis may have an immunologic basis mediated by activated T cells and/or other immune cells; if a long-term regimen with a favorable efficacy-side effect ratio can be determined, cyclosporine would be a significant advance in the treatment of psoriasis. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: These studies were designed to characterize constitutive steroidogenesis in Leydig tumor cells. Constitutive steroidogenesis was investigated by comparing constitutively active R2C Leydig tumor cells to trophic hormone-responsive MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. Unlike the MA-10 cells, R2C cells appeared to synthesize steroid hormones independently of the cAMP-protein kinase pathway. Although the adenylate cyclase of R2C cells could be stimulated in the expected manner by cholera toxin, cAMP concentrations in these cells were low, and R2C cell steroidogenesis could be dissociated from other cAMP-dependent processes. Two cAMP-dependent processes in steroidogenic cells, protein kinase activation and lactate formation, showed low basal activities in R2C cells and could be stimulated by (Bu)2cAMP with a dose dependence similar to that detected in MA-10 cells. Steroid hormone biosynthesis parallelled these other cAMP-dependent processes in MA-10 cells, but not in R2C cells. Cycloheximide, however, caused similar dose-dependent inhibition of steroidogenesis in both the R2C and MA-10 cells. Using a cell component bioassay, it was shown that R2C cells constitutively synthesize an extramitochondrial cycloheximide-sensitive factor that is functionally identical to the factor produced in response to hCG in MA-10 cells. This factor enhanced mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis. Thus, constitutive steroidogenesis in R2C cells could be explained by the cAMP-independent but cycloheximide-sensitive constitutive production of an extramitochondrial factor that activated mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Although left ventricular diastolic filling patterns can be examined by both Doppler velocity recordings and gated blood pool scintigraphy, few data exist regarding a comparison of these techniques. Therefore, Doppler echocardiography and scintigraphy were compared in 25 patients. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography was performed using an apical four chamber view with the sample volume at the level of the mitral anulus. Doppler measurements included peak velocity of the early diastolic filling wave, time to peak early diastolic velocity from both end-systole and end-diastole, diastolic time period and diastolic integrated velocity (early, atrial and total). The cross-sectional area of the mitral anulus and the left ventricular end-diastolic volume were estimated from measurements made on the apical four chamber view. Scintigraphic measurements included normalized peak filling rate, time to normalized filling rate from both end-diastole and end-systole, diastolic time period and relative diastolic filling during early and atrial filling. Doppler echocardiography and scintigraphy compared favorably in assessment of fractional filling during early diastole (r = 0.84) and atrial systole (r = 0.85), ratio of early to atrial filling (r = 0.83), diastolic filling period (r = 0.94) and interval from end-diastole to peak early diastolic flow (r = 0.88). Normalized peak filling rate and time to normalized peak filling rate from end-systole did not correlate closely by these two techniques. The differences in normalized peak filling rate may be explained by difficulties in estimating mitral anulus cross-sectional area and left ventricular end-diastolic volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Contrary to hindlimb muscle, extracellular calcium plays an important role in diaphragmatic strength generation (J.

Since the inotropic effect of digitalis appears to be related to cell membrane transport of calcium, we studied the effect of digoxin on diaphragmatic contractility in 20 anesthetized dogs. The diaphragm was electrically stimulated with intramuscular electrodes. The transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during supramaximal (50 V) 2-s stimulations applied over a frequency range of 10-100 Hz was measured with balloon catheters at functional residual capacity. Cardiac output was measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter and diaphragmatic blood flow (Qdi) by timed volume collections of left inferior venous effluent. The force generated by the sartorius muscle during electrical stimulations was studied concomitantly to Pdi. In 10 dogs (group A) 0.04 mg/kg of digoxin was infused in 10 min. In 10 other dogs (group B) 0.2 mg/kg was administered. All measurements were performed during control and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after digoxin administration. In group A, digoxin plasmatic level at 60 min reached a therapeutic range in all dogs (1.8 +/- 0.3 ng/ml), whereas in group B, digoxin plasmatic level was higher (8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml). No significant change in cardiac output and Qdi was noted after administration of digoxin, either in the dogs of group A or those of group B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: In routine clinical practice and in research interviews like the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), symptoms attributed to physical illness are excluded from contributing positively toward psychiatric diagnoses. The maximal rate of underdiagnosis which results from this diagnostic rule was determined in 114 patients with diabetes mellitus. When symptoms attributed to diabetes (total = 296, mean = 2.6 per patient) were discounted, 256 diagnoses were made. Eighteen additional diagnoses (a 6.7% increase) were appreciated when these excluded symptoms were considered as psychiatrically significant; however, only two of these new diagnoses were given to patients previously without a psychiatric diagnosis. The authors concluded that the DIS is sensitive in its detection of psychiatric illness in diabetes and perhaps other physical illnesses as well. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: In order to investigate the localization of nuclear T3 receptors in adult rat brain, we have developed a technique for separating neuronal and glial nuclei, and compared nuclear T3 binding in both fractions. Glial and neuronal nuclear populations were prepared by homogenization of the whole brain except the cerebellum, followed by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in 2.4 and 2.2 M sucrose. For purposes of comparison, liver nuclei were prepared by centrifugation in 2.4 M sucrose. Microscopic examination of the nuclei confirmed the purity of the two nuclear fractions to be above 90% with minimal extranuclear contamination. T3 binding studies were performed on the washed nuclear fractions using saturation analysis techniques. Maximum binding (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) were obtained by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. After 30 min incubation at 37 C, Bmax in neuronal nuclei was 1203 +/- 118 fmol/mg DNA (mean +/- SE) (n = 6), in comparison with 196 +/- 14 fmol/mg DNA in glial nuclei (n = 7). The corrected value for Bmax in glial nuclei, assuming 8% neuronal nuclear contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was 299 +/- 38 fmol/mg DNA (n = 6). The Kd values were 0.38 +/- 0.04 nM, 0.34 +/- 0.05 nM, and 0.33 +/- 0.04 nM in neuronal, glial, and liver nuclei, respectively. The specificity of T3 binding to the nuclear receptor in both neuronal and glial nuclei was studied in competition studies, and revealed closely similar relative binding affinities (T3 greater than T4 greater than rT3) in both. We conclude that the higher T3 binding capacity of neuronal nuclei may be related to their higher protein synthetic ability, suggesting that T3 may be of importance in a rapid structural turnover in these cells. The effect of T3 on myelination in glial cells may be mediated through the nucleus. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Nucleated cells can resist lysis by and recover from complement attack even after formation of the potentially cytolytic membrane attack complex on the cell surface. We have found that human neutrophils resist complement lysis by the physical removal of membrane attack complexes by both endocytic and exocytic process. The latter mechanism predominates, vesiculation being detectable within 60 sec of initiating the complement cascade. Sixty-five percent of the formed complexes are removed on plasma membrane vesicles, although only 2% of the cell surface is lost. Ultrastructural examination revealed that these vesicles were covered with ring-like \"classical\" complement lesions. Analysis of these vesicles by gel electrophoresis indicated that C9 was present exclusively in the form of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant, high m.w. complex. In contrast, the 35% of C9 that remained associated with the cells was found to be inaccessible to a C9-specific monoclonal antibody, and was partly degraded, suggesting internalization of the membrane attack complex and proteolysis of some C9 molecules. The molar ratio of C9 to C8 was 12 to 1 on shed vesicles and on recovered cells. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Three clinicopathologic cases with a remarkable pattern of extensive diffuse subependymal periventricular spread of cerebral metastases from solid systemic cancer are reported.

Involvement of the choroid plexus and leptomeninges was moderate or absent. Intraparenchymatous nodular metastases were not found except in one case in which rare nodular superficial cortical metastases were present. The clinical data were nonspecific except for orthostatic hypotension, in one patient, which was probably due to the infiltration of the floor of the third and fourth ventricles.

In this report, we describe diffuse and severe ultrastructural damage to the capillaries of the gastric glandular mucosa of the rat that occurred within 1 min after intragastric instillation of 100% ethanol. There was a gradient of damage in that endothelial cell structure was most severely disrupted in profiles of capillaries located close to the luminal surface but some morphologic evidence of damage was evident in the wall of capillary profiles to a mean depth of 256 micron. Capillary structure was generally normal in the deeper regions of the mucosa. Pretreatment with intragastric cysteamine, 30 mg/100 g, or intragastric prostaglandin F2 beta, 0.5 mg/100 g, significantly reduced the depth in the mucosa to which damage to capillaries extended. Pretreatment with intragastric prostaglandin F2 beta, 0.2 mg/100 g, afforded no significant protection. We conclude that a 1-min exposure to 100% ethanol induces striking damage to the microcirculation of glandular mucosa of the rat stomach with severe damage to capillary profiles near the lumen and sparing of capillary profiles near the muscularis mucosa, and pretreatment with the sulfhydryl agent, cysteamine, or with a large dose of prostaglandin F2 beta reduces the extent of but does not abolish ethanol-induced damage to gastric mucosal capillaries. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}]
