And I started figuring out pretty quickly that Jake was problematic as fuck. And the longer we were together, the more I had to call him out on his shit. \nHe groped me at a party after I said no repeatedly, he set me up on a blind date with this dude who thought I was hot without my consent (and told me we were just hanging out with him to play video games until the last minute when he told me the truth). He lied to me about a lot of things big and small, and he gave me an STI without any disclosure whatsoever that he had one. And the longer I dated him, the more I heard him tell stories about how he\u2019d \u2018get crazy drunk\u2019 with female friends and then fuck them. And as he kept telling me these stories, I realized that at least two of them had made it super clear in front of me that they weren\u2019t interested in him. \nEvery time one of these offenses happened, it would be a fight. We\u2019d go in circles for hours. I spent a lot of time doing my best to patiently explain why these things were wrong and that he needed to stop. But it was of course super frustrating because he wasn\u2019t taking real accountability. As it went on, he started gaslighting me and telling me I was overreacting, and then we\u2019d fight about what gaslighting was and why THAT wasn\u2019t okay. It was a damn mess. \nNeedless to say, we broke up. But st some point, I had committed myself to trying to hold him accountable rather than just bailing on the relationship. So what ended up happening was, he made up a manipulative situation where he tried to claim he was mad at me after he fucked up, and then when I tried to get a hold of him to be like \u2018what on earth did I do? What do you mean you\u2019re mad at ME?\u2019 He refused to answer or take my calls, no explanation, and then started telling all our mutuals that I was crazy and stalking him. He basically tried to escape from the accountability, and also frame me as crazy so that nobody would believe me if I told them. \n\nTHAT was the last straw for me. At this point I was finally convinced that this dude was dangerous and there was nothing I\u2019d be able to do to get him to change. \n\nSo I went to his roommate/bff. I went to this dude we\u2019ll cal Albert, and I reached out first to say \u2018hey, I\u2019m super concerned about a bunch of things regarding Jake, can we sit down over a cup of coffee? Because it\u2019s a lot.\u2019 I regret now doing this all in person, but we\u2019ll get to that. \n\nAlbert agreed, so we sat down and I laid out everything that had happened to me, as well as everything Jake had told me about. In addition, Jake told me how he had a restraining order against him for raping someone in college. Someone we all still knew. So I felt like I had a lot of reasons to be both angry, but also concerned. And because Jake had created this whole stalker narrative, I was afraid to talk to anyone about this, and I was afraid to go public myself. I felt powerless. \n\nAlbert agreed with me that I had reason to be concerned. He was very reassuring. And he basically told me \u2018don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take point on this.\u2019 So I trusted him. \n\nA few months later, I had moved on. I left our whole friend group because I didn\u2019t feel safe there anymore, and I was trying to get on with my life. And Albert reached out to me on Facebook and says \u2018hey I just want you to know, I\u2019ve decided to try and rehabilitate Jake. I\u2019m gonna try to hold him accountable.\u2019 And I was like \u2018are you kidding me? I already tried that. And I already TOLD you I tried that. He hasn\u2019t even apologized to me or shown remorse for anything he\u2019s done.\u2019 \nAnd Albert was basically like \u2018sorry you feel that way.\u2019 So tough titties for me, I guess. \nI also asked Albert what exactly that meant. Did he go down the list of behaviors and tell Jake to stop them? And Albert was just like \u2018nah I asked him if he understood he\u2019d fucked to and he said yes, so I think he got the point\u2019. Massive eye roll on my part. But what was I gonna do? \n\nFast forward to a year later. A mutual friend of ours, Catherine, reaches out to me and asks me if I\u2019ve heard anything about Jake having negative/predatory behavior. \nI was too afraid to tell anyone else what had happened because Jake was telling everyone I was a stalker. So I\u2019d kept loosely in touch with Catherine, but once she asked for info, I unloaded everything I knew   Then Catherine told me that Jake had assaulted two more women at a con, and she was about to go public with everything. She did, and it caused a huge stir in our community, as those things do. \n\nBut shortly after the truth came out, Albert starts posting on Facebook about how shocked he was, and how he had been \u2018following his blind optimism and believing the best about his friend\u2019. He went on and on about how much he was hurting, and it was a clear grab for sympathy. \n\nThat was it for me. I lost my damn MIND and went off on him publicly. He was making all this about HIM, and how hurt he was that his bff was raping women, but dude, you weren\u2019t a victim! You weren\u2019t one of the (now many) femmes that this dude actually hurt! And when I tried to tell you, you blew me off! A year ago! \nSo I went O F F. Told him that this \u2018blind optimism\u2019 bit was bullshit and that he was actively choosing one man in his life over many women. And further, it was a roommate, so he was protecting and enabling this dude because he didn\u2019t want to lose the house they shared, or give up Jake doing all the work Jake was doing to keep things together for the household. He had a lot to gain by keeping it quiet, and a lot to lose by doing the right thing. Even after Catherine outed Jake as a serial rapist and abuser, it took like 4 more months for Albert to kick him out of the house. \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Albert is super popular. When I went off on him, he fought back and started attacking my character. \nHe said that \u2018the reason I didn\u2019t believe you or keep you involved is that you\u2019re a toxic, emotionally violent, vindictive bully.\u2019 And he started trying to imply that I was lying, breaking down some of the timelines and details of what I was saying, questioning the truth of it all. And several other people chimed in and came to his defense, calling me similar names, or saying basically \u2018how dare I kick Albert when he\u2019s down\u2019. \nSo I backed down and unfriended him, and decided to remove myself from the conversation. Nobody had ever called me any of those things before. And I don\u2019t honestly know if they\u2019re true. I\u2019ve been wondering ever since. But of course I also can\u2019t help but feel like maybe he was just trying to deflect and discredit me to cover his own ass. \n\nBut if they are true, does that impact things? Would me being a toxic person mean I should have stayed out of it? \nWas I wrong to call him out on what I perceived to be misogynistic behavior, disbelieving women, and enabling a rapist? \nAm I wrong to feel like he betrayed me personally and owed me an explanation? \n\nThank y\u2019all for reading, I know it\u2019s a lot. \nI\u2019m still really hurting over this, obviously.

I tried my best to reconnect with her and make an effort but she was cold and distant went i talked to her. I shrugged it off and just boiled it down to her just hanging around different people.\nAt the time this was all happening we had a mutual friend - Harriet - who i had gotten closer to over a few months.

One day, Harriet told Jess that i had got off with Jess's friend's cousin - Jess's friend will be called Katie - and we made it very clear that she COULDN'T tell anyone ESPECIALLY not Katie. The first thing she does is tell Katie which is where this started.\nJess started to stay nasty things to me at random and pass it off as a joke. She'd say things like \"you're just funny looking\" \"your teeth are really bad\". I told her that my teeth were my biggest insecurity and she proceeded to pick on it. She did this thing where she would say she didn't like something about her self - say her teeth in this instance - and encourage people to say things like \"well at least you dont have teeth like her\" or picking on me for my ethnicity which im understandably quite sensitive about (I have some Japanese heritage). \nShe would do this for weeks without any retaliation.

TL;DR at the end.\n\nThe reason I call her my sweetheart is because we haven't yet committed to a full relationship. I don't think either one of us is mature enough to handle a long-distance, but we've been talking over text and phone a lot. Both of us have broken out the L-word, so I have reason to believe it's a good chance this might develop further. I really, really enjoy talking to her.\n\nShe and I were in the same classes through middle school to the end of high school, so we know each other very well. In my final year of high school, I think she might have been romantically interested in me, but I had college applications and exams (we have those here, I don't know where else) so I never pursued the possibility. She's also way out of my league, so I always assumed wishful thinking too.\n\nI came to college in August, and she took a year off to prepare better. We got to talking in January, and discovered a lot of the relationship stuff shortly after. However we've decided to halt progress for now because of her imminent applications and exams, which are in May/June.\n\nSo my (engineering) college offers a program that's tailored specifically for her field (biology), and I have jokingly mentioned it to her a few times. She dismissed it on account of low future prospects and high college fees, but I have a few doubts about that. I did some research (because I'm insecure like that) and talked to people in my college enrolled in the course, and found a lot of paths that the course opens. She's also financially better off than me, so I found the fees issue strange at first, but I later reasoned that it's dependent on a number of factors I know very little about. However, I still think she hasn't thought this through as a viable career path and is dismissive of it. I won't deny that I have a selfish interest in this.\n\nTL;DR: She and I are engaged in a relationship in all but name, and she will be choosing a college these coming months. I'd like her to apply to a course in my college, but she doesn't want to on account of low prospects and high fees. After legitimate research, I found that she's grossly underestimating the prospects, and I'd like her to rethink this conclusion. I won't deny that I have a selfish interest in this.\n\nNow, I respect this woman in every way and stand by every decision she makes, so I will have no issues if she chooses to reject my suggestion after being aware of the facts. All I want to do is make her aware of them. She probably won't change her mind, but I'd still like to try.\n\nSo, Reddit.

Fast forward to a year after kid two and he admits that he\u2019s not \u2018into\u2019 my body type and thought he could help me lose weight(I\u2019ve never weighed more than 210) and he would never have to say anything, but my depression from some major family drama and my inability to lose weight fast due to PCOS and thyroid problems made him admit \u201cI\u2019m shallow, I just don\u2019t find you attractive and I don\u2019t think i ever will. But i still love you and care for you.\u201d We went to couples counseling where the therapist proceeded to tell me to try to get passed the hurt and use it as a chance to motivate me to look better. I proceeded to put up with a lot of building resentments and anger between the both of us. This created a toxic dynamic where he held onto anger to mask every emotion. I literally only saw him cry once when he broke up with his gf he had when i was pregnant. His anger kept building and building; things would get thrown, doors slammed, hours and hours of tears while he yelled at me. This started to severely trigger some trauma from my past and soon i would sit in a puddle of tears shaking while he chewed me out for my \u201cattitude\u201d \u201cnot understanding him\u201d \u201cnever forgiving him\u201d \u201cbeing selfish\u201d and \u201cbroken beyond repair\u201d any time he started yelling i would start bawling and he wouldn\u2019t comfort me at all; no touching, no hugs, no apologies. I would literally have to leave the room sobbing and come back calm before he would even attempt to tell me again how i should have asked for comfort if i wanted it and how he needed comfort too and i didn\u2019t give it to him. \n\n6 months ago, shit hit the fan and we had a sheriff at our door. This sheriff looked at him and told him as long as the kids were in the other room he wasn\u2019t there to be a marriage counselor and didn\u2019t care what was said or who yelled at who. This only led to him doubling down and every two weeks i was crying while he was yelling about something else i screwed up or hurt him for. I had enough. I packed everything i could and tried to find somewhere to go and came up empty. I got a job and started to get some confidence back. When i knew i could take care of myself i started to pull away. He could immediately tell and something snapped; this is officially where my ask starts. \n\nI told him I wanted to separate and give myself an opportunity to work on myself without the constant need to fix our marriage. It\u2019s broken, it has been for a long time and he admitted that for a long time I\u2019ve been the only one trying. Now, he wants to try, he wants to fix things, he wants to promise to give me all the things I\u2019ve asked for for years, and it fucking stings. Why did it have to take years and me leaving before he did the right thing? He keeps trying to say he wants to know if him trying is wasted efforts, if I\u2019m going to leave him fully anyways he wants to just call it quits right now and get papers, but he says that if we are going to work things out we shouldn\u2019t even separate because he can\u2019t fix things if i push him out. Thing is, i feel like if i take him back right away, what does that say about my own self respect? I know it would be easier, but i will always wonder if he truly finds me attractive or loves me because I\u2019ve literally been questioning that the whole time. Because of our open relationship, i had a date a few weeks ago and truly felt the difference once again in how it felt to passionately be with someone who actually wanted me and i can still feel the difference and it\u2019s changed the dynamic and he can feel it. He finally talked to his family about what was going on and he\u2019s been owning up to how verbally abusive he\u2019s been, but everyone is saying that because we\u2019re married and have kids we should be working things out, but not separating and that I\u2019m an ass for not understanding that all his anger was from stress and stuff and we made a promise to work things out no matter what....but i have been living literal years in a hellish relationship where i was not wanted, how do i take him back without that being addressed somehow someway? I don\u2019t want to ignore all my years of pain, and does he really deserve me when I\u2019m at my best when he didn\u2019t want me at my worst? Am i really an asshole if i don\u2019t \u2018let him show me he can be better\u2019 and give him a second chance? There\u2019s so much more at play here and specific instances of where care should have been shown and wasn\u2019t, and I\u2019m literally all on my own with no fam or friends so this is literally the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life. I do love him, but i need to love me too and i don\u2019t know if he even realizes he\u2019s never fully let himself love me. \n\nTLDR;\nMetaphorically speaking, pulled my husband kicking and screaming all along the way in our relationship for the past few years and finally had enough yelling and let go, only to find out once I stopped trying to drag him with me he was willing to do it himself and I\u2019m being called the asshole for not wanting to give him a second chance right away.

You can accept gifts with a value of up to $100 but it cannot be considered currency in any way. \n\nI know with almost 100% certainty that most of an entire department is accepting tips under the table. These are people I've worked with in the past, and while I wouldn't call them friends, we all know each other and are friendly. These tips can be upwards of $500 and likely even more, and while I don't know the frequency, it's safe to assume that each individual participating are getting these tips on at least a weekly basis. If it's true that most of these people are accepting tips against policy, there's no way they're being claimed with their taxes and they are effectively defrauding the IRS for tens of thousands of dollars annually.\n\nTruthfully, I think they, and everyone else, SHOULD be able to accept tips, given the environment that we work in (I won't specify but it's probably not hard to figure out). My issue comes from the fact that many other people have turned down hundreds and thousands in tips while this particular group of people have been accepting then because there in a position where they can do it behind closed doors, and in turn, this income goes unreported.\n\nI won't deny that these thoughts are partially driven by jealousy and greed, as I've heard that the IRS sometimes financially rewards people for tips leading to issues like these, so that begs the question.\n\nWIBTA?", "output": "turning in a group of acquaintances to the IRS", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

I\u2019m at an entry level position, it pays more than minimum wage but you don\u2019t need a college degree to work there.

And yesterday we got news that he\u2019s being promoted.\n\nA few of us were kinda baffled by it. He had no prior experience in this kind of work. \n\nManagement has always made it clear to me that they think I\u2019m doing a great job, and that they can always count on me, and I always get really good marks in my employee reviews, etc etc.\n\nYesterday a few of us were talking about why this new person would\u2019ve gotten promoted, instead of someone like me, who\u2019s been there for much longer and who is a great employee. \n\nOne person speculated that it could be because this new employee is the only one (in our entry level department) who has a bachelors degree (albeit for something not related to what our company does) and so they felt he may be somewhat \u201cover qualified\u201d for the position he was hired in for, and that maybe they didn\u2019t want him to get \u201cbored\u201d with what he was doing and look for another job instead. \n\nAfter thinking about it, that possible explanation seemed to make a little bit of sense to me and made me feel a little better.\n\nAlso important to note: this new person has also expressed interest in working more hours and doing more things for the company, so this could go along with the \u201cwe don\u2019t want him to get too bored\u201d explanation. But this better not be the only reason though, because I have also expressed interest in working in higher positions in the past.\n\nThen today, I was talking to my other coworker, who was saying she felt kinda pissed for me that this new person got promoted before me. I explained to her that I did feel kinda bummed about it, but that I would kinda understand if it was because he had a college degree, and they felt he was overqualified. But then she said \u201cit shouldn\u2019t matter that he has a college degree, it\u2019s not related to what our company does at all and he has no prior experience; and if being \u2018overqualified\u2019 was a problem, he shouldn\u2019t have taken the job in the first place.\u201d Then she said I should ask management why he was promoted and I wasn\u2019t.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know how to ask without sounding entitled.\n\n**TL;DR**: I\u2019ve been working at this company for 2 years and I\u2019m a great employee.

My other coworker feels pissed for me, thinks it\u2019s unjustified that he got promoted over me, and that him having a bachelors degree shouldn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s not related to what our company does, and he has no prior experience doing what we do, and him being \u201coverqualified\u201d is his problem because he took the job in the first place.", "output": "asking my boss why my coworker was promoted instead of me", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

My apologies for the book that I'm about to write, but there were a lot of events that happened leading up to the situation. \n\n**SCROLL DOWN TO SKIP THE BACKSTORY**\nSo I've been trying to plan a trip to Europe in May with a couple friends for the past month. I invited my boyfriend because we've been wanting to travel together more too. However, this last Saturday my friend, who's also been tracking flights to Japan, found flights for nearly half the price of what they usually go for AND it would also be during prime cherry blossom season in March. She ran it past me as something to think about, but ended the call with a heavy implication that her and my other friend (a couple) would most likely be opting out of the Europe trip and doing Japan instead. I wasn't against the idea since both Europe and Japan were desireable destinations, and I mainly just wanted to be able to travel with my friends. I wake up the next morning to a text saying that they bought the tickets to Japan for March because they wanted to jump on the deal before prices went back up.\n\nDuring this time I've been filling my boyfriend in on everything that's happened. Both my boyfriend and I are pretty hesitant on getting the Japan tickets because moving the trip up 2 months felt pretty rushed. However, I had pressed the fact that we need to make a decision soon because this deal wasn't going to last much longer. Because they're my friends and I was a little more willing to take the leap and buy the flight, my boyfriend suggested that I just work something out with my friends first, and if he can make it, he'll join too.\n\nI explain the situation to my friends who had already bought the tickets and ask if they can move their flight to Japan to May so that it could better align with my bf's and my schedule a little better. After some back and forth, we agreed on mid April. I buy the flight with them and it turns out that we were all able to get the same flights so it was pretty ideal.\n\n**YOU CAN START HERE TO SKIP THE BACKSTORY**\nI tell my boyfriend that my friends and I all booked the same flights to Japan, and he should really try to get his flights asap as well so that he can get the same flight back with us (he's joining for the second half, and will be arriving separately) because we don't know how long they're going to be available and for this cheap. He says that he's going to do it tomorrow (Monday) because it was pretty late and he had just gotten home from a flight.\n\nMonday morning comes around, and I check the flight prices. I let the bf know of a few options where the flights are still cheap and hopefully last, but naturally bc it's work hours, he's busy with work. He suggests that we figure it out after work bc he's got his hands pretty full. After work, we look at flights, but unfortunately the ones that would have had the same flight back as us are no longer available (other options still have decent deals). \n\nMy initial reaction was to blame him for not getting the tickets earlier like I was suggesting when I had said to get them asap. And so I was quick to point my finger at him. He got pretty hurt by it because from his perspective it was out of his control - he was really tired getting back home from his flight at around midnight, there was a lot of work stress during the day, and neither of us could have anticipated the flights selling out that fast.\n\nHowever, I just couldn't get the idea out of my head that it was his own fault for taking so long even though there were external factors at play. We got into an argument, and he suggested that he should just opt not to go anymore because it felt like I didn't want him to go with how I was blaming him. To him, it felt like he was just an add-on to the trip, one, because they're primarily my friends, and two, he'd be flying in and out by himself, rather than being with the group for at least the return flight. I felt bad because this hasn't been the first time where I made him feel second to my friends and that he wasn't as important. \n\nEventually I decided to cancel my flights with my friends so that I could fly back with my boyfriend. I chose a flight where I would still arrive around the same time as my friends, but I would have to fly by myself there in order to get the same flight with the bf back. After cancelling and making the change, he felt bad that now, for my trip with my friends, I won't be able to fly with them. And he felt as though he has negatively impacted the trip I was planning with my friends because I won't be able to fly with them. However what's done is done and I'm just glad that I get to travel with some of my favorite people. \n\nAITA for blaming him initially? Because after taking a step back knowing that he gets pretty sensitive with this kind of stuff, and that there's a lot of stress going on in his life currently, I felt like it was pretty asshole-ish of me.

For the past three months I have not been allowed to run, use stationary bikes, ellipticals or lift more than 2-5 lbs. The recovery has been incredibly painful-- possibly the most painful thing I've ever had to work through. The whole thing has massively lowered my self-esteem. I used to be fit and happy with my body. Now, I'm several lbs heavier and just really frustrated with not being able to workout.\n\nIt's coming up on the one year mark since I injured my arm and all I want is to feel like I have some control over my body again. I decided that I wanted to try personal training so I can have someone there to check my form and help me find creative ways to push myself around my limitations. I feel like getting someone qualified to guide me is the safest way to get back in shape without compromising my shoulder's recovery.\n\nMy friend, Julie, goes to a gym she LOVES that is really close to my house. She's been going there for over a year. After texting her a question about the gym rates, she called to tell me she didn't think it'd be a good fit for me. She started out by telling me it was SUPER expensive and that it\u2019s got limited equipment (it has great equipment), but eventually she just came out and said \"I don't want to be a bitch, but I just don't want to see you there.\" It\u2019s a small facility and she feels like she's finally comfortable working out. She's struggled to be active her whole life and to find a place that really worked for her and this was it. It's clearly become her fitness safe space--and I get that. But then she got super condescending and wouldn't listen to me when I told her I didn't want to workout together, I just noticed their trainers had great accreditations. I tried to explain how hard  the past few months with my shoulder have been and that I really needed to find a trainer who knew what they were doing. She pretty much just ignored me and told me to try LA Fitness or anywhere else.\n\nIts been a week and I finally had time to go through and contact 16 different gyms in my area. Julie's gym is tied for the cheapest prices with one other facility. (Depending on the number of sessions I purchased, hers would be the cheaper of the two by $5/session). I texted her to let her know this -- including the names of all the facilities I contacted to show I made an effort (I also made a list of all the prices), but I haven't set up meetings to go talk to trainers at either gym yet (I intend to speak to both). She has yet to text me back and I have a feeling that she's pissed. I kind of wish that there were more options available, but I'm also a broke student and unfortunately her gym actually is really fairly priced with supposedly excellent coaches.\n\nAITA if I decide to set up personal training sessions at her gym after she told me she wasn't okay with it? \n", "output": "invading my friend's fitness safe space", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

He\u2019s a very talented musician. He was in a band when we met. About a year into our relationship he joined a different band that\u2019s much more involved. They\u2019re moderately successful. They usually tour April-September ish. honestly, it depends on the festival season and a ton of other stuff. Also, I live in Virginia because of him. I moved here about 5 and a half years ago to help my brother and his wife out with their baby. They\u2019re military and got transferred elsewhere about 2 years ago. My boyfriend and his family are the only family I have on this coast. ALSO I\u2019m a flight attendant based in Boston so I travel a lot and don\u2019t have a traditional work environment to make friends. I don\u2019t really have any friends in Virginia. My boyfriend and his family are literally all I have here.\n\nSince college I\u2019ve always been a bit weird about my birthday. My birthday was always over spring break so I never really got to celebrate it. I can honestly recount every single birthday I\u2019ve had since I met my boyfriend. A few of them have been disappointing and we\u2019ve had issues with it before. He knows it\u2019s important to me and the last few years he\u2019s really tried to make it special.\n\nA couple weeks ago his band\u2019s manager posted on their instagram that they were going to be playing at Savannah Stopover which is March 7th-8th. This was the first I\u2019d heard of it and my birthday is the 5th. It\u2019s at least a day\u2019s drive down there so I asked him if he was going to be gone for my birthday. I just wanted to be prepared if he was. He said no he should be home, and that was the start of a couple weeks on the road so they probably wouldn\u2019t be leaving until the 7th or the 6th at the very earliest. I asked him if he was sure and he said he was pretty sure. \n\nThis morning I brought it up again. He said he couldn\u2019t imagine them leaving before the 6th and that he was pretty sure that was the start of the tour. I asked him point blank: \u201care you *really* not sure or do you know you\u2019re going to be gone for my birthday and you just want to say?\u201d He said \u201cbabe, I\u2019m telling you what I know.\u201d \n\nI took that to heart and started planning my birthday this afternoon. I texted my best friend who lives in Boston (and is also a flight attendant) and asked her if she wanted to come visit for for my bday. She of course said yes. I said to her \u201call I want for my birthday is to go to brunch and then day-drink and watch movies at home with you, boyfriend, and the kitties.\u201d\n\nThe band has been recording some new songs about 30 min away from here. He left not long after our conversation. When he got home this evening this is the conversation we had:\n\n\nme: I invited *bff* to come down for my birthday, I hope that\u2019s okay.\n\nbf: oooh about that. We have a show.\n\nme: excuse me? what? we just talked about this less than 12 hours ago.\n\nbf: yeah *band manager* reminded me today. we talked about it over email a few months ago and I totally forgot I said it was fine.\n\nme: what? you just said today you didn\u2019t have any shows before savannah stopover. how did you not only forget this conversation but also forget that\u2019s my birthday!?\n\nbf: sorry if was over email a few weeks ago and I just didn\u2019t notice. \n\nme: seriously what the fuck I\u2019ve asked you about this multiple times over the last few weeks.\n\nbf: it wasn\u2019t on purpose I didn\u2019t even realize it was your birthday but even if I had I would have still said yes because it\u2019s $1700 and we could use the money.\n\nI was speechless at that. He tried to hug me and I told him to go to bed and he went upstairs. I\u2019m downstairs drinking wine and stewing. My feelings are really hurt. He\u2019s come down once since and didn\u2019t say too much but suggested I could come to the show on my birthday and tried to hug me. I pushed him off and told him to go to bed.\n\nThree years ago I went to New York for a show on my birthday and he didn\u2019t tell anyone it was my birthday. It may as well have just been a regular day. I\u2019m not trying to do that again.

I\u2019m really upset and my feelings are really hurt. I realize this is definitely a first world problem but he knows how I feel about my birthday and could have done so many things differently to not make me feel so shitty. I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole here but I want to make sure before I make a big thing of it. If I\u2019m the asshole here I\u2019ll try to accept it and stop being upset at him.

So four weeks prior to st.Patrick\u2019s day we\u2019ve finalized the guest list (9 people) and reserved everything (bar crawl tickets, restaurant reservations, hotel rooms, etc. Now, for my best friends gf of 8 months this would be her first time there and, might I add, she was not very accepting of what we had planned - suggested different things/said she didn\u2019t want to do the things our friend group typically does. \n\nNow a few days ago less than one week before we take the trip I get a text from my friend saying the gf has invited one of her friends to come along and the friend accepted and is planning around coming.

She would easily spend 15k-20k on Christmas alone and who knows what else during the year. \n\nSo last year, my parents gave our daughter the 4 gifts but added a few extra items in her stocking. I was fine with that. My MIL gave 12 wrapped gifts, all with multiple items inside. So, I got up early and hid half the gifts so my daughter wouldn\u2019t seen them. So it looked like she only bought 6. \n\nI know she has a spending problem. My wife\u2019s siblings all say just accept the gifts and get rid of them when you get home or just give them a list of what you want so you don\u2019t get crap. This goes for both themselves and their children. Last year, I just did not accept any gifts from her to me. My wife receive about 4 or 5 gifts plus a gift card. We both got significantly less than the others.

I'm 27 years old and she's 25, and the incident I'll talk about happened on our third date.\n\nOn Saturday night we went to a gourmet burgers and fries place (think Pulp Fiction John Travolta/Uma Thurman car in the wall joint) for my birthday dinner. It was her choice and I thought it sounded like a grand idea, as corny restaurants are always a blast. A while after our burgers came the waitress paid us the typical \"how is everything\" visit, and stuck around for a short chat after. During the course of our talk I ended up mentioning that it was my birthday, and she told me that it was hers too. It was a nice little coincidence and we all seemed to get a kick out of it.\n\nEventually our waitress excused herself. After we finished eating we ordered a couple of shakes, at which point the waitress and I nicknamed each other \"birthday girl\" and \"birthday boy,\" respectively.\n\nOur check came, and to my surprise my date didn't make any indication that she was going to pay. I didn't raise a stink about it of course, and I didn't think it was exactly a huge deal. I thought it was normally for the non-birthday party to pay on someone else's birthday, but again, different people may be used to different things.\n\nI checked the bill and saw \"Happy Birthday!\" written at the bottom with a cute smiley face. I put in the cost of the meal with a standard tip, and we got up and put on our coats. At the last second I told my date to hold on a bit, opened the bill back up, and slipped in another $100. I wrote with the provided pen \"You too!\" next to her message. My date noticed this and gave me a sideways look.\n\nIn the car I asked what she wanted to do next, and she gave me the silent treatment, just kind of sighing and looking out the window. I figured it had something to do with the tip I gave the waitress because that's when she started acting like that. I asked what was wrong and she just responded by settling deeper into the seat. The next few minutes were completely silent and I just started heading towards her house.\n\nShe abruptly blurted out a bit later that I was wasting my money and she couldn't believe I was so irresponsible. I asked her what was wrong with giving $100 to our waitress for her great service, and she said that I should have spent the money elsewhere, or at least given it to a deserving charity. Again, I reiterated that I felt it wasn't a big deal, and couldn't get a decent answer out of her.\n\nI took her home and without a word she just stepped out of my car, walked to her front door, opened the door, and walked without even turning her head back. Last night she texted me saying that I overtipped the waitress and asked how I felt about giving the waitress $100 when I haven't given her (my date) a single gift yet.

Gf has not been there either). From the first time I heard of this, I told her that while I obviously couldn't stop her from going, I wasn't really comfortable with that notion. It didn't matter though, I said, that based on my experiences in the past, these kind of trips are mostly just talk. We're from a place and at an age where most students (17-19yo) either won't have the money, didn't have the permission, or ultimately no one would take the initiative to plan it and thus trips such as these almost always didn't happen.

This obviously also made me feel terrible, because she spends no where near the amount of effort planning time between us.\n\nNow, few days before the trip, she starts to become overwhelmed by everyone else's lack of involvement in said planning. She starts to complain to me about how everyone is treating her as the tour guide and how she has to do everything and how she regrets agreeing to go with them. I force a smile and try my damnedest not to tell her I told her so. Couldn't do it. I mean, from my point of view, she forced a trip that in my opinion wouldn't have happened otherwise, in an effort to prove me wrong, to somewhere they have never been before, to a relatively more dangerous country in terms of crime rate as a small group of teenagers unsupervised.

He also smells awful, he\u2019s always cooking very smelly foods in the room and that combines very poorly with his BO and mildewy towel.

I\u2019ve been sleeping great and we all get along spectacularly. I didn\u2019t tell Cole at first, but a few days after the move we ran into each other and he asked if I had moved, and I said yeah but just because my friends dorm was in the same building and they had an opening, and that was that. Just to clarify, Cole and I are not friends. We only communicate on things related to our room.\n\n\nToday I went back to my old room to get a notebook that I forgot there when I moved for a class I had in a few minutes. Two of my old neighbors (we\u2019ll call them Lauren and Alice) stopped me and asked if I moved without telling Cole. Lauren already knew all the reasons why I had moved, Alice did not know. Lauren told me that Cole had stopped by her dorm wondering if I was okay and if she knew why I moved. She didn\u2019t tell him but suggested that I did. I kind of laughed at this and mocked the idea that I tell him I moved because he smells bad. This made her very upset and she got pretty angry at me calling me all sorts of awful names for moving without telling him. Alice jumped on the bandwagon too and started saying \u201cit\u2019s common courtesy\u201d and telling me that I have no respect.

I'm 31 non-native english speaker, have a 8 yo daughter, who lives with her mother. I have helped raise her, tho, been at her house, and all that, so I've been a part in her education/manners. Also, she spends every saturday with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago, a friend of mine from school got in touch with me via Facebook (we were classmates and good friends in school, but after graduation we went our separate ways). She tells me she moved back to town, she's got a kid (6 yo), got married, got divorced (husband cheated on her) and stuff. Since we've got kids who are around the same age, maybe we could meet up and the kids could play while we catch up. Sounds OK to me and my kid agrees, so we do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey came to our house and they get along, playing until it's time to eat (tea time). So we are eating, and suddenly this kid farts. I look at him, and so does his mom, but we don't say anything. The kid then rips another one. My daughter looks at me kinda shocked, and the kid starts laughing and lets another one out. I look at my friend and she just looks me back and says \"kids will be kids\". So I look at the kid and say \"you shouldn't fart on the table, kid\" in my friendly-yet-firm dad voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe doesn't respond and starts eating his sandwich. He eats with his mouth open, talks while eating, and I can notice my daughter is annoyed. Suddenly, the kid farts again and starts laughing (again, mouth full with his sandwich bite.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got annoyed. He's 6, but he should at least apologize. So I tell him \"Hey, \\[blank\\], you shouldn't eat with your mouth open. And if you're gonna fart, at least apologize. I know farts can sound funny but we are eating. It's not polite.\" His mom tells him to listen to me, and he kinda does (he still eats with his mouth half open, but no more farts.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe finish eating and the kids go back to play, only my daughter now doesn't want to play with him. She asks if she can play with my phone, and the kid wants to play smash bros (wii U) so I put him against the CPU. Eventually, they have to leave. They live close so we walk. We let them at their house and everything seems normal, except is mom was silent the whole walk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got tome, I text her saying my daughter and I got home safely. She texts me back a \"that's nice\" and then proceeds to tell me she liked the visit but was kinda annoyed of me lecturing her kid. That she get's it not the best behaviour but I should have overlooked it, and that the kid said he would like to come by again to play but didn't like me \"acting like a dad\". I tell her that I get her point, but in my house, and in my table, we behave, and that at no moment was I rude or harsh to her kid, I was acting mainly because my daughter showed concern.

I'd have never imagined this being my first post but I'm really conflicted about this one.\n\nI'm on holiday somewhere in South America. The first day here, I met a girl working in a coffee shop. I didn't notice her at first but then she asked me where I was from. This ended up in a really long conversation and me going to a party with her. Nothing to crazy until I tried some local \"moonshine\" and got fucked up. I remember she told me she was taking me back to her place, but ended up in my hotel (she says I refused to go).\n\nDuring that conversation, she told me she will soon start working as a flight attendant and she's really interested in visiting my city. I told her she was more than welcomed. I travel a lot because of work so in a way, we would have seen each other pretty often.\n\nI decided to spend my last two days here with her, since I've already seen most of the things i wanna see. We decided to do dinner on Thursday and then, the next day, I'd stay at her place and cook her something from my country.\n\nThursday comes around and we decided to meet in an Italian restaurant at 8. She showed up an hour late, completely drunk. We had dinner and went for a drink. During drinks she told me we couldn't go back to her place and that she just wanted to dance and then go home.\n\nI was a little disappointed, but it was ok. She then proceeded to take like a hundred pictures of me, flirt, kiss me and dance around me like it was a lap dance. I was a little confused but decided to go with it.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I kinda developed a crush on her. I told her that and she told me she didn't believe, that she was ugly (her words, not mine), that I probably was controlling and an abuser (this one hurt the most, cause I would never do something like that) and, as the cherry on top, she started making fun of my culture.\n\nNow, while I was really sad this happened, I understand that alcohol can make you do stupid things (boy do i know that), so I let it slide. She went back to her place and I went to my hotel. However, before that happened, she told there was other dude (fml, amirite?). She described him as everything she hated and thought I was, but she still liked him.\n\nThis last part made it for me. I was still sad, but decided I wasn't even gonna try anymore.\n\nHowever, this morning, she sent me a bunch of videos and pics of us dancing and kissing. I don't even wanna see them. I told her maybe it was best we didn't meet today, and to not look for me while on my city (if there's something i hate more that dating, is being used)\n\nI'll spare you the details, but she called all kinds of things and where can I stick my invitation. \n\nTruth is, I really suck at dating, and I can sense when something is bound to fail, but sometimes I just go with it and hate myself later. Here I'm just trying to at least avoid a couple of sleepless nights. But I did promised her to show her around my city and a part me feels like I'm acting out of pettines.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: how tf do you catch feelings for someone you just met a week ago? \n\nWell, attraction for me (at least) is a tricky thing. I can spend months by myself, not attracted to anyone. Then, out of nowhere, someone shows up and turns my whole world around, so this is not the first time it happens.

Before he got into trouble, she didn\u2019t care for his personality but she has literally spent 5 minutes total with him a single time 3 years ago (when him and i were just friends and i was living somewhere else) and has refused to spend any more time with him or get to know him. She was rude about him coming to our house last year, which he knew so he never wanted to come over and that made it really hard for us. We\u2019d literally sit in my car outside for hours. I basically chose to not make my living situation shitty by doing things that made her mad so we tried to stay out of the house. My bf was going through court for a DUI (no one got hurt, I know it\u2019s an awful thing, he\u2019s in recovery and sober and getting better) and was suicidal and depressed the entire 6 months leading up to him going to jail. He and his family have both told me that they don\u2019t think he would be here if I wasn\u2019t there for him and trying to keep him out of the hole. What this translated to was me spending a lot of time with him over the 6 months he was going through this case. My roommate worked 6 days a week 8-7:30, we spent every Sunday together and she usually had plans weeks in advance for weeknights, but she gave me a huge lecture the week before he was going in about how awful of a person I was for only spending time with him(not entirely true, i did spend a majority of my time with him though), what was I doing, why was I doing it, she said I \u201cflew too close to the sun\u201d and should have left him when the court case started. I can see where she\u2019s coming from but if there was one thing I always tried to do it was make sure I spent time with her at least twice a week. We\u2019re both busy and it was like she wanted me to wait 3 hours for her to be off work and not make plans myself so i could see her. That conversation was really hard, it made me feel like the biggest piece of shit ever. But fast forward now, my boyfriend has been serving his 6 month jail sentence and he\u2019s about 2 months in. I see him once a week and he hasn\u2019t been able to call me up until this week, so he\u2019s been calling me every day. The problem is, he\u2019s been calling me during dinner time because that\u2019s when the phones are open, plus I work 8-5:30 Mon-Saturday so there aren\u2019t a lot of windows and he knows that. So a couple times this week (3 times) I\u2019ve been eating dinner with my roommate and I\u2019ve excused myself when he calls for the 20 minutes I\u2019m allowed to talk to him and then I come back and hang, but last night he called when i was out to eat with her so i tried to keep the conversation under 10 minutes (which is was), and i had to give him a couple messages from his family, so I came back to the table and she was SO MAD at me. Like barely spoke to me and typed out huge texts to her other friends and boyfriend across the table and said that it\u2019s really annoying that we talk every day now and why can\u2019t I just tell him I need to go because I\u2019m at dinner, and that I see him once a week and we really don\u2019t need to talk every day. I definitely did tell him i was at dinner but he waits from 2pm for his phone slot at 7 to open up so i wanted to make it worth it for him too. I felt like shit because I\u2019m just happy I can talk to him again. My roommate stays in constant contact with her boyfriend via text and he calls her sometimes, plus she sees him at least 2x a week. I\u2019m just frustrated because I don\u2019t want to ignore his calls, which she said \u201cI know that would LITERALLY kill you so don\u2019t ignore his calls, I\u2019m just annoyed because he calls during dinner always, I have a right to be annoyed. Like when he called on Saturday you should have just told him you would see him tomorrow and talk to him then.\u201d I do get what she\u2019s saying. But am I the asshole here? Because she makes me feel like it. I miss him more than anything and this week has been the first time in months that I\u2019ve been able to talk to him every day and I\u2019m grateful. Ugh.

I don\u2019t want to have sex tonight.\u201d (He always rubs my stomach when he\u2019s feeling horny, and I hate having my stomach touched). He huffs and says \u201cbut I think you\u2019re sexy.\u201d He puts his hand under me and grabs my butt. I\u2019m fine. 20 seconds or so pass. His hand goes into my crack. I say stop and I move.

She and her fianc\u00e9 are both 21 and have been together for about a year if I remember correctly.\n\nI feel awful about not really being able to feel happy or excited for them, but 19 - 21 just seems too young for this stuff. I know some people start families and find \"the one\" earlier than others, but it just doesn't feel right and there's something holding me back, though I do congratulate them and act 100% supportive in person. I like all of their partners and the baby (he's approaching 10 months old now) is wonderful. \n\nBut AITA for not being able to feel excited for my friends?

A month ago a group of my friends and I rented a small cabin about 5 hours away from where we go to college.

Two days ago (the day before we were supposed to leave) my gf kept texting me the entire morning saying how she felt horrible like she\u2019d been hit by a truck. She ended up going to the doctor where they told her she had the flu. \n\nSo I made the decision that she wasn\u2019t going to go with me since she had the flu and going on vacay for a few days wouldn\u2019t help her get better at all. She claimed she didn\u2019t care if I went without her and we got into a little argument, resulting in her saying she didn\u2019t care and that I should \u201cjust fucking go.\u201d So I drove all the way there. \n\nShe then texted me very pissed saying that I only left to get drunk with my friends and didn\u2019t care at all about her.

All the people there are my good friends and I wanted to spend time with them. Instead, because she didn\u2019t believe I actually cared about her, I drove 5 hours back to school to show how much I really do care about her.

I just decided\". She demands to know why and I say because how she's acting.

And then she tells me of course she didn't mean it in a negative way and that she doesn't speak English that well and can't explain what she meant.

I said it would be a great way to bring everyone together, and since the two of us were helping it wouldn\u2019t be as hard to keep track of everyone.\n\nA agreed and we made lots of flyers that explained the cost ($4.00) and the times we\u2019d have the salad bar open (11am-2pm.)   These things were clearly stated and in addition everyone that participated was emailed a copy of the flyer.\n\nWe set everything up and left it out until just after 3pm, essentially giving everyone an extra hour to get a plate.  Announcements were made throughout all departments around 11am to say it was open, and at 1pm to say if you wanted seconds you were free to go around again.  (At this point ALL departments involved had already arrived and had been at their desks for at least 1 hour.)  At 4pm, coworker \u201cJ\u201d emailed me asking if she and 3 other people were able to get salads.  Turns out, those 4 people hadn\u2019t gotten even 1 salad.  I told her the leftovers were in the fridge if she wanted to help herself.  Cue attitude, complaining that if they had known they weren\u2019t going to have salads at that time, they wouldn\u2019t have participated.\n\nApparently sometime last night, someone went into the fridge, took lettuce, and didn\u2019t properly wrap it back up so it all went bad.  We had to throw away an entire tray of lettuce.  My manager found out about the lettuce, went to all of the departments, and said there were leftovers but no lettuce b/c it wasn\u2019t properly wrapped up overnight.  That was it, no accusations, nobody was singled out.  (It could have been anyone; we have had issues in the past about random people going to the fridge and taking food that wasn\u2019t theirs.)  Manager said everyone was now welcome to get some of what else was left.\n\nJ emails me saying that it wasn\u2019t her that didn\u2019t wrap up the lettuce incorrectly and that she \u201cjust wanted to make that clear.\u201d  I\u2019m honestly clueless b/c I had no idea what even happened about the lettuce going bad overnight.  I forwarded my manager the email and said that I no longer wanted to help run anything like this again unless her department is no longer included; making this event a 1st shift only thing.

Names have been changed.\n\nSo my grandma comes over to my moms every other week and stays for awhile. She brings her dog, B (corgi mix).  My mom has Worm (aussie mix). We have had Worm for 8 years.\n\n\nI recently got Worm a bone. The dogs fought over the bone and Worm bit B\u2019s neck and held on - but from what my mom told me, there\u2019s no injury at all.  My mom tries to break them up, but B bites her on the wrist, making blood SPURT out of her. My mom went to the ER after locking them in different rooms. My grandma drove her.\n\n\nMy mom didn\u2019t report B. This isn\u2019t the first time my grandmas dog has sent someone to the ER.  In high school, he sent one of my friends to the ER for biting their pinky so badly.  He was also not reported for that incident. B is a very possessive and jealous dog when it comes to food, toys, or humans.  B has also NEVER been professionally trained and has barely been trained by my grandma.  The boy barely knows how to sit. \n\n\nMy family (my late father and I) trained Worm, but we\u2019re no experts. Since my mom moved to a smaller house with no backyard, Worm has gotten leash aggressive and less friendly with other dogs.  Before B came along, Worm was always playful and social with other dogs. When I\u2019m home I notice that Worm will whale eye and move away when B comes towards him. I don\u2019t think my family notices.\n\n\nGenerally, I\u2019ve been having issues with my mom about Worm.  She doesn\u2019t make the time to walk him for longer times, or put in the financial effort to get him a dog walker or even groom him.  The only time Worm gets brushed is when I am visiting and that\u2019s only once out of a few months.\n\n\nI told my mom that I\u2019m looking into a dog trainer for both dogs, esp for B. I told her I would help pay since my grandma is poor; I also offered to pay for Worm. My mom seemed sad on the phone.\n\nI regret saying that I would help pay.  My friends tell me that it\u2019s not my responsibility.  I worry that it would be a bad investment if my family doesn\u2019t put in the effort.

I worked with this woman for a few years. I did not like the woman for various reasons and it culminated in the signing of the card when she left.\n\nAt work, she would do the bare minimum that was required of her and generally just didn't care about the people she was meant to be there to help (we work with teenagers). When she went on maternity leave, she spent the last few months of her time at work slacking off and not having her students do the work they were meant to do, which we didn't find out about until after she'd left; she'd effectively downed tools because she knew it wasn't going to be her problem when she was gone. We ended up having to redo all of her work on top of our own. She would also be the only one referring to our transgender students by their \"old\" names and pronouns, even when they'd never been referred to as those names and pronouns and they were only on the system because they hadn't legally been able to change their name yet.\n\nThen a while back she was renting out her apartment because she was moving in with her long-term partner, and I was looking for a place with my best friend at the time so we ended up renting the place from her (this was before quite a lot of the stuff in the first paragraph had happened, we'd only been working together for about a year at this point). Turns out she was a bit of a nightmare. She refused to do basic things such as put locks on the bedroom doors telling us that \"if you're such good friends, you shouldn't need locks\", and even when we offered to pay for them ourselves said she wouldn't allow us to have locks and it was \"non-negotiable\". It basically became a running theme that if we wanted it, we weren't getting it regardless of if we would pay or not.\n\nShe also wanted nothing to do with my friend who was paying half the rent. If my friend asked her a question on the groupchat, she would often answer in a separate chat or phone call to me specifically. When it came time after a year to renew our agreement, she send a list of amendments that straight up said \"All communication regarding the apartment is to be between me and IFeelRomantic\". After a while because of this and some other warning signs I figured out she was committing fraud, pretending to her mortgage company that I was the only person living there. I could have shopped her, but I didn't want to cause problems at work by essentially turning a co-worker into the authorities. We were planning on leaving as a result of all this, but she ended up selling the apartment anyway after we'd been there 18 months.\n\nSo essentially due to all this ... I wasn't her biggest fan.\n\nShe quit the job recently, and a leaving card was going round the office. I was trying to pretend I didn't see it or I was just too busy, but it eventually got dropped specifically on my desk and I couldn't. I didn't have it in me to write a love-dovey message after the crap she'd pulled. So I just wrote *\"Bye bye! - IFeelRomantic\"* in the card. I could have made up some fake BS, but I didn't.\n\nAs she's leaving the building for the last time we happen to cross paths as I'm coming in from break, and she has a go at me for writing the message in her card. She says \"that's all I get for all these years working together, all the things I've done for you?\" (referring to letting us rent her apartment presumably, since she damn well never did anything for me at work) and says she knows I hate her even though she doesn't know what she possibly could've done to deserve it.

Our electric bill has been obnoxiously high lately for only two people living here, especially since I\u2019m only here a few days out of the week.  She is here every day of the week and is terrible at turning off the lights or the television. I usually fall asleep before her, but when I wake up in the morning I notice that she turned on every light in the kitchen and living area including the lights being on in her bedroom. Not only is keeping the lights on all day every day a waste of money, it\u2019s not good for the environment. I tried to be nice about it by telling her to try to be better at turning off the lights if she isn\u2019t using them. \n\nLast year, I went grocery shopping for the apartment often, and she just constantly ate the food I would buy. I don\u2019t have a problem sharing bread, butter, or any of the basics, but she thinks that everything is free range for her.

One of them is 4 years older than me, the other is 8. Soon after we got all moved in and settled the eldest's, we will call him Bob's, attitude towards me changed, he went from a protective, fun, new big brother to very short tempered and downright mean. Soon the \"mean-ness\" got worse and eventually became physical....in every sense of the word. Long story short mom and I eventually left and things got much better.\n  Fast forward to last year. My mom had since  remarried and was trying to leave her current asshole of a husband, so I moved her in with me and helped her get an apartment of her own. She was very down and depressed and reconnected with her previous husband.

Well earlier today while talking to my mom she mentioned how Bob and his wife were asking about homeless shelters in our area because he had already gotten frostbite last week and wanted somewhere warm to stay.(I feel I should add they are homeless by their own stupid meth fueled choices) Well I gave her the info I knew about local places to get some help, she thanked me, and that seemed to be the end of the conversation. Then I get a phone call about a hour ago from my mom asking for some advice, she wants to let them stay with her for a night or two, or get this, SHE WANTS THEM TO STAY IN MY APARTMENT!!!!!

My little sister (F18) has applied to a couple different schools, and her dream school was the one I attend, but she was rejected this week from the school and has to start looking elsewhere. She and my dad (M55) and mom (F53) have been talking about visiting schools sometime this month.\n\nThis afternoon I missed a call from my dad, who left a voicemail just asking him to call him back. I did, and my dad started asking me about when my classes for the week ended and what days off I had next month. I told him but cautioned that I frequently have plans with my friends on the weekend, and I overheard him over the phone telling my little sister to \"look up available dates\". I asked him point blank what was going on, and he told me that my little sister, he, and my mother were going to go to some of the schools that my little sister had been accepted to, and they wanted me to fly home to watch the dog and house sit for possibly multiple weekends next month.\n\nI was a little incredulous at this - my twin brother (M20) is at college at a school much closer than me and regularly visits home for the weekends, something that I rarely have the luxury to do. My family also knows many people with whom our dog is quite friendly, so it's not like they \\*need\\* me around. The dog has some medical issues and will get very stressed if he is separated from his family, however, but we have gone on extended trips without him several times without significant issues.\n\nI told my dad this, and he said that he wanted me to dog-sit, and would pay for me to fly home. I felt really uncomfortable with this (a plane ticket would be something like $300, and the cost of getting a friend to dog-sit would be far less, or even free if my brother was available, though my father is well enough off that finances are not a significant obstacle for him). He asked me when I would be available for the weekend, and I told him point blank that I simply did not want to do it. I often go out and do things with my friends on the weekends, and I thought that it was a waste of my time and his money to send me home just to dog sit. I am not home sick or anything, and the thought of flying home to an empty house for a weekend is not something I enjoy.\n\nHe accepted it, we talked for a little bit more, and then we ended the conversation. A few minutes later, he called me back, and said that he was quite angry at me for saying no.\n\nHe said that he was only asking a favor of me, and that he had spent the past twenty years doing favors for me (including paying for my college, plane tickets home for winter/spring break), and that he felt offended that I had declined to do this favor for him, and that he did not like that I had declined without giving him specifics with regard to availability. I told him that I appreciated all of the favors that he had done for me throughout the years, but I did not feel comfortable doing this for him as I did not think it was a smart move on either his part or my part. I apologized for offending him. He did not ask me again to come home and dog sit, and I did not offer. We ended the conversation again, but I got the impression that he was still angry.\n\nAm I the Asshole?

I ended up helping out with some astronomy research at a local college over the summer of 2018 (mostly data processing), and the professor was kind enough to let me use the preliminary data for my thesis. Most students present and defend their projects before the end of the calendar year, but due to some scheduling issues mine got pushed back to just last week. I was told I did extremely well and it felt amazing to finally finish a year long project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy biological mother is an alcoholic, albeit a recovering one, and I've tried to keep her distant from school related events (talent shows, open houses, etc.) ever since she showed up very obviously drunk to a meeting with my guidance counselor my freshman year.

She's been going to therapy, staying on her medications, and attending A.A. meetings.

I commute like 50 minutes to my school everyday, so for this reason alone I do not have much time to hang with my friends for hours during the school week.\n\nFlashback to my last 2 years of high school, one of those years which I spent at community college. During this time I had a friend group who like to get together and play this game called Exalted every week, which is another RPG game like DnD.  My friend group consisted of my current best friend Rose, an ex friend named Mark, Marks little sister, another guy named Tom, an old friend named Katy and her step brother Robert who is 40 years old. Everyone else was 17-19 when we first started playing. Robert was always the DM or GM of our games, and because we had no where else to play for over a year, I offered up my house for us to have game night on Fridays. After a while, I felt like my friends were overstaying their welcome. Each Friday game took a minimum of 6 hours to play, they would always order take out with often with a mess they would sometimes leave for me to clean up. I began to feel stressed out about playing this game. \n\nI didn't begin separating from my friends until we all tried to go to the Renaissance festival together. I was going with my family and the Exalted group. When my friends show up (which was like 6 or 7 people) in their minivan to go to Renaissance festival, the van engine craps out immediately on us in front of our yard. So we offer up our other family minivan for them to borrow. \n\nI remember this weekend in particular. This was the same week that I had broken the tip of my right index finger, and the same week my backpack was stolen at school. I remember trying to open up about it with my friends at the time, but they weren't respondsive to what I was saying. So to top it all off I decided to go to Ren Fest to feel better. However after like 2 hours or 2 1/2 hours I was feeling pretty done with the Renaissance festival. I had fun, but I had seen all the fake Renaissance/medieval attractions years prior, and I was tired and ready to eat. But my friends were hardcore Renaissance people, they were following the day's schedule and ready to commit the rest of the day there. But I split off with my parents and my sisters to get lunch and go home. My friends were tense and disappointed that I left early. I told them that my finger still hurt and I wanted to take more pain meds (which was kinda true lol).\n\nLater that night, after my friends returned the family van and left, I got a series of cryptic texts from Mark, which basically revealed to me that I had offended him at Ren Fest. I remember eventually calling him and asking him \"what the fuck? Why exactly?\" And trying to drill him to get him to say exactly what he was thinking. And then, Mark starts crying (which he did a lot when manipulating me and others in the past \ud83d\ude43). And then I hear Rose's voice on the phone and I realize she was there the whole time listening and talking to Mark. Then she begins to tell me that I don't hang out them as friends enough anymore. This shocked me because we already spent once a week playing our RPG game and never missed our game night. At this point I had told them how busy I was at school (community college), and about the bad week I had before hanging out with them. I felt like their request to spend more time with me, after they had been so tense around me that I didn't want to hang with them, was inconsiderate of my feelings. I remembered crying that night because being attacked by 2 friends over the phone is so fucking fun. \n\nIt's been like a year since this event, and I'm actually still friends with Rose. I feel like Rose just got fed Mark's bullshit at the time and took his side, but she's been a much better friend since then. I have also stopped playing Exalted with these people because I've lost my interest in 6+ hour long RPG games. I guess I just grew out of that. As a result I don't see the group much anymore. Also because of many other factors involving Mark, I have been ghosting him for over the past couple months. (He was dependedent on me and our conversation had become passive-agressive whenever we talked to each other).\n\nSo was I the asshole? Also if you answer \"Not enough info\" I understand. This was just a whole shit show of a friend group and I didn't want to live every single detail of it again\n\n", "output": "not hanging out with most of my high school friends anymore", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

In one of my classes we had a poster project. The project was fairly simple: find a management method used in farming and make a poster about it. \n\nIn the group were two other girls (let\u2019s call them Elle and Ree) and myself. We had plenty of time to get the project done, and the project was fairly simple so I wasn\u2019t too worried about it. \n\nAlso important: this class only meets once a week, so most communication through the group is online. \n\nActual story:\nA week and a few days before the project is due I make a GoogleDoc so that we can all work on the poster together and get it done. A few days pass by and I notice neither group member has done any work on the project. Frustrating but whatever, people get busy. I continue working on the poster, no biggie. \n\nThe next time class meets I go up to Elle and Ree and ask if they got the invitation to edit the Google Doc. Ree said she got it and will work on it later. Elle said she never got the invite. (This should\u2019ve been a red flag but I thought nothing of it) I tell her no worries, I\u2019ll send another one and add her on Facebook so we could communicate easier (our communication before that was through email). \n\nWhen I get home I add Elle and Ree on Facebook, both accept within a few hours and I make a group chat. I send the link to the Google Doc and all is good. Ree replies and says she\u2019ll get started. \n\nA day passes and Elle still hasn\u2019t opened the message. Weird. Maybe she doesn\u2019t go on Facebook a lot. I send her a private message asking if she\u2019s received the group chats and see if that works. A little while after that I see Elle has posted a status update on her page. Even though she has yet to reply to me. All my messages to her are still unopened, yet it says she was active minutes ago. This is where I start to get frustrated. I cannot get a hold of this girl. \n\nA few days pass, Ree got her shit done and I got my shit done, but there\u2019s still shit to do. Elle is still MIA, I\u2019ve accepted the fact that she will not be contributing to this project. Maybe she got a new group? Maybe she\u2019s dead? Well actually, She can\u2019t be dead bc she\u2019s still updating her fb page. \n\nWe submit our project. It was good but not great, you definitely needed three people for the amount of work it was and we only had two. Elle still has not replied to any message and has done absolutely nothing to contribute to this project. \n\nI let our professor know that we tried to get ahold of her to no avail. He replies that he will take that into consideration while grading. \n\nA few days later I receive a message from her:\n\u201cHey sorry I've been a piece of garbage human being for the last couple weeks. I have no excuse. I've been really discouraged with school but it's no excuse to not even participate. The poster look awesome! Again, I really apologize for being completely absent. Hope you have a good Thanksgiving!\u201d\n\nShe also lets me know that she got a zero on the project and starts saying it\u2019s \u201cexactly what she deserved.\u201d \n\nInstead of accepting her apology I reply with:\n \u201cWe let [professor] know that we couldn\u2019t get ahold of you. Honestly if you would\u2019ve warned us beforehand that you would be MIA it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal. Everyone goes through rough patches. But not replying was messed up. (Even after I talked to you in class about the project and you let me know you would get working on it). Hope school gets better for you. Good luck\u201d \n\nHer final reply to me was:\n\u201cWell that's unfortunately how I deal with things when I get depressed- I withdraw. Again, I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say but I figured I'd apologize for it because I knew it was garbage of me. Thanks, I hope it does too\u201d\n\nAITA for giving this girl a 0 on the project and not accepting her apology?

My work hired someone new, a woman. I am by far the youngest person in my office and she was closer to my age then everyone else so I think she felt comfortable talking to me. She got into a fight with another co-worker pretty early on and came to me for advice and how to handle it. I told me GF about this and she was not happy. She claimed that the new co-worker was too friendly and instructed I stay away from her. She then insisted that I show her my work email about once a week so she could properly monitor my interactions with her. Again, I thought this was a bit much, but I didn\u2019t really care because I had nothing to hide and I truly love my GF. Eventually this stopped however when I made it clear she had nothing to worry about. \n\nNow fast forward to now, about a month ago this co-worker sent me a friend request on Facebook. I accepted it without thinking anything of it and forgot to tell my GF. \n\nLast night, my GF demanded I give her my phone so that she could inspect it. After I gave it to her she realized I had friended my co-worker without telling her and she completely lost it. She claimed I \u201ccheated\u201d on her, she broke up with me, and she even contacted the co-worker to tell her to stay away from me. \n\nI think this is all a huge overreaction.

I told him I had called and was going to call back, but that I'd just be crying to them. He said to not cry because it is \"not professional\". I know crying is unprofessional.

She wanted me to get to know her because she thought we would be a good match despite only knowing me for a short period of time. This girl and I were both pretty drunk when she introduced us. We had a long conversation and got along well, but I had the feeling that she wasn't what I was looking for in a partner. The evening got longer and after a while, we sat down next to each other and talked some more. Eventually, I kissed her even though I knew I had no intention of ever being together with her. Still, we started dating after a while and we are now together for 1.5 years despite that. The reasons which made me think we're not \"meant\" for each other are still ever present but she has some other qualities that made me overlook them. Part of them is she is really sweet and overall just a loving and caring person and we also totally match sexually and have amazing sex. Still,  There a just a couple of things about her that are a dealbreaker for me in the long run. Anyway, now that this relationship is getting more long term I wonder if I should break up, because deep down I know I wouldn't want to marry her or start a \"future\" with her.  I talked to her about it and she says she doesn't care because I am the best thing that ever happened to her and that she doesn't care as long as we are together. Also, we both love each other, but I still think that that is not enough for a long term relationship. \n\nTo further complicate things I'm moving away for college in 2 months to a city that's about a 3h drive away. I don't want to stay there longer than necessary and move back home eventually, but I think that it will be probably 1.5 to 3.5 years before I can move back to my home town.

I clock out, say bye to my girl and head towards the exit. \n\n  Im already pretty close to the door when i hear my name.

While I was out there I tried to text BF as much as possible, when I woke up, a little bit on the mountain, and more once I got done for the day and went back to the hotel. When I came home I was really glad to be back at school because this was the 4th trip my mom took my out of school for, I couldn't say no to them. The Tuesday after I got back I had a girl come up to me in person and tell me that she saw BF sitting in his car making out with some other girl during lunch while I was gone. Obviously i was pretty pissed so i ran out to his car and asked him what happened. He told me they just ate lunch. I badgered him more and he finally let out that it was his sophomore neighbor, they've been friends for a really really long time, they had lunch and then after school ate dinner then messed around driving trucks for a while. As far as I'm concerned, he can eat lunch with who ever he wants. I told him that, and that if he does have lunch alone with some other girl to just tell me about it so I dont have to have 3 people tell me \"BF was hanging out with another girl!!!!!1!!\" Because it's really annoying and really lowers my trust for him.\n\nSo that was the major incident that made me pretty mad and passive aggressive towards him for the past week. If I ever use his phone and open snapchat he tells me not to read his really personal messages with people so its whatever. He has probably 50 different girls he snaps every so often, some once a day, some once a month. Then if I check his texts he has around 4 or 5 girls that he'll check in on every day. Usually sparking a conversation with \"Hey \ud83d\ude0a\" or \"Good morning \ud83d\ude1a\". There were a few occasions of him calling other girls his baby which really pissed me off because that's how he texts me and if this is just how he texts everybody then it feels fake. I dont really have a whole lot of trust for him. I know it seems really petty to be mad at him over this but I just think it's really freaking weird that he texts these girls like he wants to get with them WHILE WE ARE DATING. Obviously itd be a different story if it happened before we were dating. \n\nSo yeah that's my side of the story, tried to make it as unbiased as possible with how I see things.

We were both sophomores in high school at the time and we were good friends for about 3 months prior to getting together. However, we had a sort of rocky history. Long story short, in 8th grade I was a real asshole to her. We mainly spoke online and that had the effect of both shortening my fuse and taking away my filter. She had some unresolved feelings about it even going into our relationship (2 years later), which I was fully prepared to deal with.\n\n However, it was impossible to see in advance the sheer emotional toll this relationship would take on me. Every day, multiple times a day, she would find something to have an anxiety attack about, whether it was \"flashbacks\" to 8th grade or something I said or did that day. \n\nFor example, we once went out rollerskating. When it was time to go back to our friend's house, she wanted to take a picture of him using my phone. I didn't have a problem with this. However, when I looked at what she was doing after I gave it to her, I quickly noticed that she was searching through my dms on instagram. I have nothing to hide but I resented the fact that my privacy was being invaded, so instinctively I grabbed my phone out of her hands. She insisted she wasn't doing anything but I saw what I saw. \n\nShe refused to speak to me on the car ride back to our friend's house. She refused to speak to me for hours going into that night no matter how much I pleaded with her to speak to me and explain what was going on, because at the time, I had no idea why she was upset. I suspected it was because of the phone but I wasn't sure. \n\nLater, while she was using our friend's VR headset, she knowingly made her way over to me and punched me twice in the face. She still wouldn't talk to me after this. After we were finished, we went down to the basement to watch a movie. I let her pick the movie. I discreetly texted my friend to go away for a minute so I could talk to her one on one and finally figure out what was going on. \n\nHe leaves. I talk to her. She says nothing. I move over to sit on the same couch as her to get closer to her. She kicked me hard in the chest and then moved to the other couch. She still refuses to speak to me. We had approximately 30 minutes left until her mother was going to pick her up, and then we wouldn't be able to see each other for another week. (we could only hang out on weekends because I lived an hour away)\n\nWe eventually make up after I broke down into tears from pure frustration (in front of our other friend mind you, which I didn't want to do) and then she goes home. I go home as well and I text her, because we texted each other pretty much all day every day. \n\nShe spontaneously suggests that we talk about our kinks. I tepidly agree because I know I'm walking on eggshells and I don't really want to provoke any more anger from her. She starts by saying that, because of how I treated her in 8th grade, she developed a sexual affinity for psychological abuse. She said she wanted someone to \"tell her they wanted her to kill herself, then kiss her\".  I, of course, told her I wasn't comfortable doing that for her but I don't judge her for having an uncommon kink. She then has a mental breakdown because I'm \"judging\" her and \"I know you can't do that for me, my next boyfriend will.\" \n\nI spend hours into the night calming her down and reassuring her that she isn't being judged. This whole conflict is resolved at around 1:30 AM on a school night. This is an example of a more or less typical day with her. There were both worse and better days but it was generally around that level of awfulness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn August 6th, I decide to break up with her. I couldn't handle being emotionally drained every single day anymore. For the first 3 months of our 4 month relationship (which is way too fucking short to be having these kinds of problems) I was essentially a doormat for her. After the 3rd month I became more coarse and abrasive and less tolerant of her breakdowns.\n\nOne example is we were doing playground mode in fortnite. She was killing me so I was killing her back. I was laughing and I thought it was all in good fun, since, y'know, it's a fucking video game, but she hangs up on me on skype and starts telling me that she \"saw a side she hasn't seen since 8th grade\", and that she was \"scared\". I told her that she was taking the game too seriously and that she was over dramatizing me laughing and having fun. This turned into a several hour long argument.\n\nThat's the type of toxicity that happened virtually every day for the fourth month of our relationship. There were multiple occasions where I was literally driven to tears just by being in her presence and knowing the constant pain she was in, purportedly because of me. \n\nSo I broke up with her. A few weeks later, she attempts suicide. At first she says it wasn't because of me but soon after that she labeled me as the sole cause of the attempt. She had also threatened suicide to me during our relationship when she was on a vacation in Florida. She said she was on a balcony and she wanted to throw herself off, \"solely because of me.\" \n\nTo get to the point, I was perfectly fine with our mutual friend, who I will call N, maintaining his relationship with my ex. If demonizing me was how she coped, then fine. As long as she wasn't proactive about trying to ruin my reputation or get me into genuine trouble, then I wouldn't have any problems with it. \n\nRecently, my dad bought a house in my ex's town and we're moving there after Christmas break. This has absolutely nothing to do with my ex. Most of my friends live in that town because I attended school from 3rd-9th grade there. I told N to notify her because I wanted to give her time to cope before seeing my face in the hallways, since I knew that would be painful for her. \n\nShe immediately goes into a downward spiral. She's frantically posting on social media and actively trying to convince popular and influential kids at our school that I verbally abused her. She threatens to post screenshots of the alleged abuse. N saw the screenshots and said they would help my case, not hers. \n\nNow I'm not popular, but I'm relatively well known and people just by knowing me can tell I would never abuse someone the way she claims I abused her. \n\nHere's the part where my dilemma comes in. After realizing that she won't have any luck convincing people I abused her verbally, she tells her parents that I abused her physically. She claims that I left bruises on her and that she has a friend who saw the bruises. Her parents contact my father and threaten us with the prospect of filing a police report. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was perfectly comfortable allowing N and my ex to be friends before any of this happened, but the fact that she escalated it so much in such a short time (less than a week from when she found out I'm moving back) I decided I no longer wanted to share mutual friends with her. N and I have been best friends since the 6th grade. My ex and N have been friends for less than a year. \n\nI told him that, under normal circumstances, I'd have no issue with them continuing to be friends, but in light of the fact that she made an earnest attempt to sabotage my future out of spite, I was no longer comfortable with them being friends. \n\nHe told me that it wasn't my place to determine who he's friends with. I agree, but I think it says a lot about his character that he wouldn't just stop being friends with her on principle. She did, after all, threaten me and my family with legal action based on a lie. \n\nA pretty heated argument ensued. I told him he didn't understand that not only had I not abused her, but she abused me, both physically and emotionally. He told me essentially that it was my fault for not leaving the relationship sooner, that \"there was no gun to my head\".  I told him to steer clear from me and blocked him on everything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** I have an ex who used to have manageable levels of craziness, but now that she learned I'm moving back into her town, she threatened to take me to court for physically abusing her (which never happened) and my best friend, despite this, refuses to cut her off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting my best friend to remain friends with my psychotic ex? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ", "output": "not wanting my best friend to remain friends with my ex", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

The problem is, I\u2019m positive this new turbo is going to meet the same fate as the last two (the new turbo from two months ago is linked in this post).

I'm a shift manager and mostly enjoy my job, but my boss (GM) has been really difficult lately. Thing is, GM has been pretty cool in the past and accommodates my school schedule since I'm in college, and I'm very thankful for this. I've become sort of close with her and even got her husband a job with my dad's company.  However, things have gotten difficult lately because GM has hired her husband and made him a manager, her two children, her niece, her son's girlfriend, GM's best friend (who then became the Assistant Manager), the friend's daughter, and a few of GM's daughter's friends. They all work on the same shifts, too. This is illegal, right? Plus, GM has been taking HUGE advantage of her position. I could go on and on, but here are some highlights:\n\n\\-GM's family and friends get very obviously special treatment. For example, GM's daughter and her friends will show up literally hours late, but GM will clock them in so it looks like they were there on time and get paid for it. \n\n\\-GM and Assistant Manager clocked in last week, left to get their nails done on the clock, and lied about it. GM actually regularly leaves for hours while clocked in, and I tried to call her on it once, but she said, \"I'm the boss, I can do that.\" Her husband and Assistant do this frequently, too. \n\n\\-GM demoted a manager in training because GM heard that she disagreed with so much of our staff being GM's friends and family. Everyone who isn't friends or family complains about this, though, not just the one person. Also, we aren't, like, sworn into some weird loyalty oath and I don't think the trainee deserved to be demoted for disagreeing with the GM. Punishing someone for this seems manipulative and power-hungry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has all come to a head now that GM heard from Assistant Manager's kid that I said something pretty serious that I really didn't, and GM is now starting rumors about me like it's middle school, calling me messy and fake and \"warning\" people about me. I've known her to do this with other employees too based on gossip, and it's caused huge problems and caused multiple people to quit.

Jan knows almost nothing about Christianity except for the idea of Christmas.  I know nothing about said Asian culture except maybe the basis of Lunar New Year.  We both love cooking and make cultural food for each other constantly.  We also talk about everything in relation to food trends, like Atkins, Paleo, intermittent fasting, etc.   Anything food.

She wondered what Lent was and I said it was a time that people in my religion remember those who sacrificed for us and make sacrifices of our own to remember that we are going to die and so we fast and choose a sacrifice to remember that.

We were graciously gifted a John Deere TRS 32 snowblower by his father. The other day while driving home from grocery shopping we were talking about how my father said our snowblower was too big for our 4 car single garage driveway. My SO said how my father was just jealous since my Dad\u2019s snowblower was so much smaller, which honestly it is and he probably is jealous. I replied that ours needed to be so heavy duty with chains on the wheels since our driveway is on a hill. To give you and idea, I have to use the e-brake when I park so as to not slide down or have a jolt when I switch transmission and when it\u2019s icy it\u2019s dangerous getting the mail. \n\nMy SO then said that without a doubt no female can safely handle that thing. Quickly he corrected himself almost in the same breath that some women could probably do it, but not me. He then said the test of usage depends on whether or not he can overtake my bicep muscles with just his three fingers. For reference I\u2019m about 5\u20193 and weigh 125lbs, can carry about 40-50lbs for a few minutes and then have to take a break. \n\nNow I\u2019ve been the most DIY and fixer-upper of our home and previous apartment. I used to mow my dads half acre lawn using a rider mower and also snowblow during the winter all myself since 18. I\u2019m a highly capable individual, or so I think. I believe that I could use the snowblower even with my current strength (which is not currently passing the usage test) just by using common sense and the mechanics of the blower (ie. use the proper speeds to navigate and turn the machine as well as the reverse to slow down). He is telling me that there is no way I\u2019d be able to stop the machine from rolling down into the street if I were to snowblow by myself. He\u2019s concerned about the momentum and condition of the driveway preventing me to stop it from moving. With all the functions in mind, he still thinks I could not stop an uncontrolled slide down the driveway since I lack the muscle strength.  \n\nSo I called him sexist and was offended that he had so little faith in me to properly handle this machinery given my previous experience. I feel like he was being an asshole for using my gender and then lack of physical strength as the reason I can\u2019t help clear our driveway. He thinks I\u2019m being an asshole for being illogically upset at his resistance to me using it due to failing his strength test, and insists it\u2019s not because I\u2019m female, but because I don\u2019t have the required muscle strength in his opinion.\n\nSo, AITA for being offended? \n\n\n", "output": "getting offended by my SO's refusal to let me snowblow our driveway", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

She had it pretty hard during the early years and it was a huge struggle for her to balance work, school and her son. She made it work and is now in law school. (The kid\u2019s dad made a change about three years back when his own father died and has since been helping.) We\u2019ve been together for a year and two months and I really do love her. \n\nHowever when we first got together she did mention that she doesn\u2019t see herself having other kids because it was incredibly hard, she values her time alone when her kid is away, and she wants to travel with her son being that he\u2019s bigger now.

My logic is that any future children we produce will be secure and she won\u2019t be alone or have to struggle. for background, I have 4 siblings while she has one sister who lives in another state.

The link showed a dog and their owner giving them their vegan meal. The next pictures said that while some defended the owner, many disagreed and essentially showed someone arguing that a vegan diet is *absolutely* bad for dogs (they said that no dog could eat a vegan diet).\n\nThe whole conversation is on WhatsApp and I'll try to break it down while still getting both sides correct (everything quoted is a rough translation from German to English):\n\nMy first response was: \"Why do you hate vegans?\", because they sent similar things before, all mocking vegans. Their response: \"Can you read?\" and \"I don't hate vegans, I love animals\". So I said: \"That's why you eat them\".\n\nNext I just wanted her to stop sending me those things: \"Just stop sending me nonsense like this\", I wrote.\n\nAfter that they asked me if I would feed my dog a vegan diet and I said yes, as long as I don't see them getting unhealthy/having problems with it. They got mad because I even considered feeding them vegan food (so it seemed to me) and implying that I \"let them suffer\".\n\nThey asked \"Why is it so hard to believe that dogs need meat?\" and I said that not all dogs necessarily need meat. So they asked why I would even set them on a vegan diet, even though in nature they would still hunt other animals and eat them. I responded that I thought that it is hypocritical: feeding one animal by killing another (and also supporting the meat industry) and also that it would reduce the CO2 emissions too.\n\nAfter that the next topic seemed to occur: environment\n\nThey asked if I knew who the top CO2 emission producers are and answering their question themselves: big industries.\n\nI said that while this is true that also 18 to 40 percent of all CO2 emissions come from the meat industry (also milk and egg industries, but I forgot to write that).\n\nThey sarcastically said that I shouldn't buy cotton anymore (I only buy cotton clothes), because it's also bad for the environment. Basically I said that I can't do everything and I purposefully made a strawman saying \"Huh? You want to protect the environment, but not doing this, this, this, this, this and this? What an a-hole you are\"\n\nAfter all of that they said that I was more of a \"anti meat eater\" than they are a \"anti vegan\" or \"whatever I am\". They also wrote that I want everyone to be vegan (misunderstanding an older conversation we had), forcing it on everyone. I asked if I was a JW, going from door to door and forcing my believes onto them (sorry JWs).\n\nThis was about it. They also sometimes asked if I \"can read\" or if I'm \"a little\" stupid, though they never said stupid, just implying it.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "output": "saying that some dogs can eat a vegan diet", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

I later payed the $5 for the bet, and our friend group was staying neutral. A few hours later on the drive home from school I sent a text apologizing for breaking the earbuds and that it was an accident. Within seconds he said \"F you. I'm blocking you.\" After that I told my friends that I would not pay for new earbuds unless he apologized, and made my friends promise not to tell him this .That is the story so far, my friends are trying to get him to cool off, but I don't know how it is going.

One of those things being ambiance. I love me the soft glow and flicker of a candle and its gentle wafting scent.

I completely understood her frustration, and offered to pay for the blinds, but she declined. Since then, however, she's been unrealistically paranoid about mishaps occurring in her home. One of those things being a candle. I asked her if I could get a candle for my room (as I still live with her while going to school), and she said no, because she didn't want me to burn the house down. You know, maybe if I were 10-years-old, I'd agree. At the tender age of nineteen, though, I think I can handle a small Glade candle. She claimed I am easily distracted, which offended me firstly because of the lack of trust, and secondly because she couldn't offer an instance where I've demonstrated an irresponsibility equivalent to forgetting to burn out a candle. Her concerns stem from the three animals we have, namely the cat. My cat is constantly knocking things over, as many cats do. I am aware that this is, of course, not great for having a candle, but I also have a rather tall dresser that she's not yet jumped on or knocked anything off of. I stated that I could either keep the door closed while I had the candle burning or just keep a watchful eye that my cat doesn't jump on the dresser, where I'd keep the candle. Any solution I offered was shut down with, \"accidents happen. That's why they're called accidents.\" Either way, it's not like I'd have a candle going in my room without me in it. But okay!\n\nAnyway, I get that it's her house, so it's her rules. She does a lot for me, and I'm super appreciative. At the same time, I think it's a little excessive to not let me use one small candle in my room. I realize a candle is actually a risk, but lots of things can be slightly risky. And yes, you should try to minimize risk, but to what degree is it too much?  I also get that it's not worth being mad about; most people would just say, \"dude, it's just a candle. You can live without burning a candle.\" But sometimes it's nice to come home after a stressful day and light up that delightful smelling ball of wax. I was really looking forward to getting one for my room. Lastly, I want to stress that I'm not, like, super upset at her or anything. More slightly annoyed. I love her so much, and she's an amazing mom, so this isn't something that'd affect the relationship or anything.\n\nTLDR; my mom is paranoid that I'll burn the house down by accidentally forgetting to blow out a candle, so she won't let me have a candle in my room.

A bit of background..... My wife and I got married pretty young. We both belonged to a very conservative religion where that was normal.  But sexual repression was also a part of the religion, and thus we were both pretty in the dark as to what our sexual needs were/ had some serious guilt complexes about some \"experimenting\" we did while we were dating.  The first couple years of our marriage were pretty rocky, with both of us doing some things that although most people wouldn't consider infidelity, definitely damaged our marriage (I had a problem with porn, she drunkenly experimented with another girl).  \n\nWe both avoided the discussion we should have had for a long time, but we eventually had some serious talks.  We both knew rebuilding trust was going to be a huge issue, but decided we were going to try to make things work.  \n\nShortly after that, she told me that her depression was pretty bad and that her PTSD had been pretty unbearable (she experienced sexual abuse), and she told me she would like to move closer to her parents, partially for support and partially because they have health problems that would require someone to care for them eventually anyway.   I agreed to the move, and began slowly preparing.  Then she calls me a few weeks later crying, telling me that she quit her job because her co-workers were treating her badly, and her manager was siding with them.  I told her it was ok, and assured her I wasn't mad.  She asked if we could just rush the move, since we were planning to anyway, and just stay with her parents for a month or two while we got things in order.  Against my better judgement I agreed, and within a week we were there. \n\nWell both got jobs right away, and everything was going ok.  But right before we were going to move into the place we had found, a serious health emergency caused me to have to leave work for a couple months, setting us back a bit.  We were starting to get back into a good position when we found out she was pregnant.  This was a complete surprise, because she had been told that she would probably never be able to have kids. I didn't know quite how to feel, but I supported her through the whole thing.  Facing the prospect of so much added expense kind of delayed our plans to move though, so we put life on hold for a bit.\n  Eventually she approached me with the idea of buying a house with her parents, since she would inevitably be caring for them eventually anyway, and them splitting expenses with us so it wouldn't be so hard on us or them.  Again, against my better judgement I agreed (I really just wanted her to be happy, and I was ok doing whatever would achieve that goal.  So we did, and our baby was born shortly after.  \n\nThings were ok for the first few months, and although we had a few arguments I thought things were ok.  But a few days after our anniversary I found out she had been talking to some other (married) guy.  I found it because she left her phone at home and when I picked it up I saw the messages.  I confronted her, and she admitted it.  She swore it hadn't been going on long, and that they had never been intimate.  But then she started blaming me, saying she was lonely, and that's why she turned to someone else.  I reminded her that I had spent our entire anniversary day (only a few days before) trying to talk to her, and she lied and said that her friend was having some kind of crisis and needed her, when the reality was that she was ignoring me for this guy.  \n\n  At first after this I tried to fix things, and she told me she would cut all contact with the guy.  But she then started saying that she wasn't happy, and that she couldn't let the problems we had in the past go.  She bounced back and forth between wanting to end things and wanting to try and repair things, and since we now had a child I patiently waited, hoping we could fix it.  But eventually it came out that she never even cut contact with the guy, and that a week or so later HE told HER he wanted to cut contact and try to fix his marriage. \n\n We were still living together at this point, since we had her parents living with us.  But she said she wanted to just end things.  At this point I  agreed with her completely, and we decided we would just slowly figure stuff out, and separate when we had everything in order.  Later, come to find out, she had been seeing another married guy during this time, and although I wasn't horribly upset, when she told me and asked me if I had been, I told her \"no, I have enough respect for you to at least wait until we aren't living together before I do that\". It's one of the few times I said something pretty hurtful, and it definitely made my point.  She confessed that she felt like an awful person, and I just kind of told her honestly that I thought her breaking up two marriages and two families just to have what she wanted was pretty shitty.   \n\n We are finally at the tail end of the whole thing, her parents resent her for forcing them to move (she can't afford the house on her own, even with their help, and neither can I) and for basically making a promise to help take care of them that she's now going back on.   And for my part, I'm just angry that she took so long to decide she didn't want this, and couldn't let the past go.  Was I a perfect husband..... Not by a long shot!  We both fucked up, and agreed to put that behind us.  I resent her, not for wanting a divorce, but for putting me, her parents, and our child in this situation, and waiting until the point that she did to decide she didn't want to be together.

I noticed, however, that she was getting anxious because she wasn't getting money in from her work that she was supposed to (something about papers that were supposed to be forwarded in time).  I told her not to worry about it-- I had enough money, and that she could pay me back anything when we got back to her place and sorted it out.\n\na major part of our trip that I had wanted to do was visit a big city near where we were going to be.  she knew this (we'd made a rough plan of everything we were going to do on this trip), and knew that we were going to take a bus into the city from a smaller town so as we weren't driving in an unfamiliar city with millions of people in it.  well the day we were going to the city her grumpiness and agitation had begun to get to head.  she didn't speak the entire bus ride there, so I let her be, thinking maybe when we got there she'd be in a better mood (after all, we had lots of fun stuff planned for the city!).  once in the city, however, she immediately declared how much she hated it, and how everyone there was always so stupid and angry and how the city smelled funny and went on and on.  I snapped and asked her why she didn't say something \\*before\\* we'd gotten there.  no response.  regardless, we went to our first destination.  she noticed how much this place cost to go to, and said she didn't have enough money.  I said that was fine, that I'd pay for it.  she said no-- told me to go by myself.  I was angry at this point, and said that was ridiculous and began to walk away.  she said she was just going to stand there and wait for me to go to which I retorted 'fine', and just continued walking.  \n\nI ended up walking only about thirty feet to a nice fountain where I was able to sit and relax and calm down a bit.  I looked over and saw her a few minutes later walk away; she obviously didn't see me.  I bit later she text me asking me where the hell I was.  I told her where I was, and she was \\*furious\\*, saying she'd already walked all the way back to the bus station. (I will add here that we are, despite the immaturity this may all seem-- fully grown adults).  I went back to the bus station, and she wouldn't say two words to me.  when we got back to where the car was she said she was calling her boyfriend to pick her up (we were about 400km from her house only), and that I should just leave and go home (a nice 2500km drive... by myself with no warning).  not that I objected as I was \\*very\\* angry at that moment-- I'd spent a lot of money on that trip, and I didn't understand why she was so furious at me.  \n\nand since that day she hasn't talked to me since-- nor has any of our mutual friends as, apparently, I am an asshole.  \n\n...am I?

I loved the spooky, weird, and strange nature of it. I loved how it took the supernatural and made it seem like a mundane part of life. I loved the format, a community radio station. Since I lived in a desert town in New Mexico for a few years, I could relate to it. \n\nAlso during that summer, maybe a couple months after I started binging WTNV, I wrote a sarcastic and witty post on my hometown\u2019s (Florida, not New Mexico) Facebook page after some funny things happened (dude was arrested for being naked at a kid\u2019s splash pad, a couple were caught having sex behind the McDonald\u2019s Dumpster, and brief power outages that no one could explain). It was, in my mind, a real life episode of WTNV. The post was an absolute hit. Everyone loved it and asked for me to write weekly reviews of everything that happens in town. Its a humor bit I write every Sunday night. Mostly make fun of the weird shit that happens, or play on the repeated complaints people make on Facebook about our town. It\u2019s still going strong even to today. I\u2019m about 14 weeks from celebrating my 100th post, and my two year anniversary is coming up in June as well. \n\nEvery now and then I have comments saying how much my format reminds them of Welcome to Night Vale, to which I will reply that the podcast was my initial inspiration for my work in the beginning, but I strive to make it unique, to make it mine, to make it special to my hometown. I do have all my posts saved up in a compilation. I don\u2019t plan on actually publishing it for monetary gain, so I\u2019m not pushing on copyright infringement with many other things (posts mention certain businesses and people). \n\nHowever, last night I got the comment that I AM infringing on copyright, and that I need to stop posting. It was one comment, one hater, which I do get every now and then. When it comes to usual haters I just ignore them. More often than not my supporters will take care of them for me. Like my Christmas special when I wrote The 12 Day of Christmas (but with things only my hometown will get). One comment said I need to move if I\u2019m so negative about the town. Sadly, my being negative is a literal joke on all the people who post negative complaints all the freaking time. I\u2019m just making fun of them. I love my (Florida) town. I moved away for 5 years and learned to love it again when I moved back.\n\nBut this one person has been consistently negative towards me in the last few weeks, often saying I\u2019m not funny, annoying, and unoriginal (claiming I\u2019m stealing Night Vale\u2019s bit).

Other than that, I strive to be original and creative, but mostly it\u2019s just to have fun. It\u2019s strengthened my ability as an aspiring writer, and the support I get is a total confidence boost I needed. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m an asshole, but I just wanted to ask just in case.

I also have arthritis, the first major episode of which occurred when I was 14. Since then, it has only gotten worse, with occasional flares that sometimes leave me unable to walk, but it was always fine, because I had my violin.\n\nI went to college, and one of my majors was music. As time went on, I started feeling pain in my fingers whenever I played, but I usually just ignored it. Eventually, though, it got to the point where I lost the use of my pinkies. I spent my last semester relearning how to play my instrument, still in pain, without 2 of my fingers.  At this point, my fingers and hands and wrists hurt all the time, whether or not I was using them.\n\nAfter graduation, I completely lost the ability to play, it just hurt too bad. I spent two months searching for answers, for a solution to my pain; I was given restricting plastic casts, horribly painful cortisone shots in the nodes in my palms, even a round of steroids that made me increasingly manic. I had to go on antidepressants, because I was sinking into a terrible depression.\n\nFinally, a doctor finally realized that I'm double jointed, and the hyperextension was causing inflammation in my fingers, which was causing the locking and clicking sensations that were causing me so much pain. The solution was simple- custom fitted splints (interlocking silver rings) that prevent my fingers from hyperextending. I was fitted, and a few weeks later, the splints arrived. I put them on, and suddenly, I had the use of my hands back. Never mind the thousands of dollars in medical bills I would have to pay, or the years of pain that were now behind me- I could play again!\n\nFast forward to more recent times. I took on a temporary job in retail, which I'll be leaving this Saturday for unrelated reasons. At least 5 times a shift, somebody comments on my rings. Sometimes, it's a compliment, sometimes, it's a question, and sometimes, it's an insult. The latter happens a lot more frequently than you would expect.\n\nAt first, I just sort of went along with it, chuckling and saying 'Thanks!' in that cheery, fake, retail voice. However, as months passed, I became more and more frustrated by it, to the point where I started pointing out to customers who openly insulted my splints that they are medical devices I have to wear in order to avoid immense pain, if just in an attempt to get them to realize that insulting strangers for literally no reason is not okay.\n\nEven the compliments sting. I know they aren't meant to be hurtful, but they are. People compliment me on something that I did not choose, that I cannot change, that, to be honest, really sucks. They're complimenting me on having such debilitating arthritis that I cannot get through the day without these splints on my fingers, splints that have caused callouses and other such annoyances (for example, I can't pick up a glass of water without the entire restaurant turning to stare at the sudden percussion). They don't mean it that way, but that's how it is.\n\nThe questions are somehow worse than both. People inquiring as to why I wear these splints feels like a really personal violation. Would you ask somebody why they're in a wheelchair? Of course not! These splints look kind of similar to jewelry... in the same way that a wheelchair looks kind of similar to a chair. They are medical devices, and they're actually not that uncommon. But people asking about them is really uncomfortable, because I have three options: 1) Deflect the question, and potentially anger the customer 2) Lie, and potentially anger the customer (I'm a bad liar) 3) Tell the truth, and violate my own privacy.\n\nWhenever a complete stranger says something about my 'rings', whether it's an insult or a compliment or a question, it really upsets me. I tend to get short with them, just saying whatever I'm required by store policy to say, hurrying up to get the transaction over with. I'm not openly rude, or mean, or loud, or anything, just blunt and brief. I stop putting on the happy retail worker facade, and try to just get it over with. The only time I've ever gotten visibly upset was when a customer yelled at me about how 'you stupid millennials waste all your money on jewelry and other nonsense, no wonder your a\\*\\* is in retail!' I was shaken, and told the customer to have a nice day after the transaction was over, and asked if I could go on a break. I then spent my fifteen minutes sobbing in my car.\n\nI've had people grab my hands to look at my fingers- again, complete strangers, while I am working- or even try to take my rings off to look at them. That's quite rare, but still, immensely upsetting.\n\nI'm leaving retail, hopefully for good, but I'm still worried about my past reactions to people questioning my splints. When I'm out in the real world, not working, people have never asked me about them, except at places like jewelry stores, and at rehearsals, for understandable and legitimate reasons. I don't think this will be a problem once I'm no longer working at the store, but still, I am not sure if I'm in the right here for being upset.\n\nMy rings don't look like jewelry, really, because of the way they are fitted to my fingers (extremely tight so as to properly maintain my knuckles, not like rings), and because of their shape, and because they lack any ornamentation at all. Though I do understand the curiosity, I don't think it's an excuse to ask a stranger about it. To me, it's like asking someone why they have a cast, or crutches, or a hearing aid, or any other medical apparatus. It doesn't make sense to me that people should be excused for ignorance, because my splints are just that- splints. Medical apparatuses. And, why would you openly insult or question someone's fashion choices? Is it okay to criticize a tattoo, or to ask someone why on earth they need to wear those shoes?  That side of it doesn't make sense to me either, for reasons of common courtesy.\n\nI will have to wear these reminders of a time of incredible physical and psychological pain for the rest of my life, or I will return to that point of pain.

There's two friends here, I'll call them Rachel and Lily. Rachel has been one of my best friends since sophomore year in HS and Lily and I became pretty good friends senior year, but those two were super close too. These friendships carried on into college and they met some new friends with people on their floors and this group of 10ish girls would party together, go to football games together, etc. This group includes Rachel's roommate.\n\nAfter a night of partying, Rachel was going to one of the girls' dorms where they were all were. (Rachel stayed out later). She opened the door, and out of nowhere, one girl started going off on her while everyone else, including Lily and Rachel's roomie, just sat back in silence and let it happen. The girl accused her of \"shit talking\" everyone (it was like tiny complaints that aren't worth making a big deal over) and exiled her from the friend group. Rachel was hurt that no one had talked to her reasonably before humiliating her in front of everyone while she was drunk and couldn't comprehend the situation.\n\nRachel was the most upset about Lily who was her best friend out of all of them. Lily is the one who Rachel would go to when she had complaints about someone, meaning it was her who ratted her out. After all of that, Rachel texted Lily who said she didn't want to be friends anymore. She and the group of girls continued to shit talk Rachel and made her feel horrible.\n\nI was there for Rachel, took her side, and supported her whenever she wanted to rant. I'm not a confrontational person so I didn't call Lily out but I made it a point to keep my distance from her. Rachel's roommate still remains super close friends with Lily. There are also friends of ours who have stayed close with Lily and while it makes her upset, she never calls them out.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, all the drama happened 4 months ago, which is the last time I had spoken to Lily. I was at Starbucks doing homework and I got up and I see someone waving at me, it's Lily. She's a very enthusiastic, high energy person so she goes \"Hi I haven't seen you in forever I miss you so much I love you!!!!!\" I'm the type of person to match people's energies (if that makes sense) so I go \"omg hi!!!\" I give her a hug, compliment her hat, and then carry on. The interaction lasted 10 seconds. I felt weird being nice to her but would feel even worse if I ignored her or was mean when she acted so excited to see me.\n\nI thought that was the end of it, but Rachel's roomie told Rachel about the interaction and now Rachel won't talk to me.

I often meet them in the backyard. \n\nHowever, my problem starts here: the mom sent them outside without a jacket in winter and they stayed outside for 4 hours (because she got male visitors) She always screams at them for (often) no reason, like the boy touching the dog or stuff. It's very loud, neighbors two blocks away complained already. The mom often throws her trash and dog shit into the backyard - which we by the way share - and the staircase looks a bit like she's a horder. The girl had bruises on her arm and when I asked her she said she bumped her arm on a chair. Her male visitors are very aggressive too, I saw one of them scream at the children too. \n\nI feel like if I don't do anything the kids will get serious problems. I watched them play a game, named \"kill the cat\". We have a stray cat and she often comes to visit us and to get some food. She formerly was a cat of a granny that lived in our neighborhood too and since the granny passed, she strays around the neighborhood. The kids ran after the cat and wanted to catch her (to maybe beat her?). I told the mother and she just shrugged it off and said, that this is none of her business. \n\nNow, why anonymously? Because she got a letter by somebody in the neighborhood telling her not to scream till late nights and she rang the door of that neighbor like a maniac and threatened to beat the sh*t out of him.

I started talking with this one girl enough to the point where we started dating. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell my parents about this, because I was unsure of how they would react to me having a girlfriend. I didn\u2019t want to date a girl then have to break up with her a day later because my parents said no. At no point did I think it was a good idea to ask my parents before we started dating for some reason. This ended unfortunately in my demise as my parents eventually found out and forced me to break up with her. \n\nThis left us pretty depressed since we really felt a connection with each other we never experienced with someone else. Anyways I got my phone and most of my privileges taken away for a good amount of time for lying to my parents. I was also not allowed to speak to this girl until I was pretty much over her and had no romantic feelings for her. Of course, being dumb teens who didn\u2019t know better, we decided to proceed to lie again and get back together once I regained my privileges. We pretty much made a promise to each other to get back together later on. This promise was later broken. \n\nFast forward to the point where I am completely unrestricted, I hit her up to see if we could catch up on the time we were away from each other. From inspection of her social media profiles, she had a date written all over her bios with a heart next to it. A date that was only weeks after we first broke up. I confront her about this and she responds with,  \u201che helped me through tough times\u201d and \u201cno one could replace you, but...\u201d that type of stuff. She had found a boyfriend during the time I was stripped of my privileges. I was mildly infuriated about this since we made a promise to each other, but we carried on and continued to be friends. My thought process was that you can\u2019t expect feelings for someone to remain after you don\u2019t interact with them for a while, so I got over it not too long after.\n\nFast forward a couple months or so, my parents decide I should be able to have a girlfriend as long as I don\u2019t hide anything from them and I still prioritize school. I was a little upset since they could have said this months before and it would have saved me from tears. At this point my ex girlfriend was still dating another guy, so I didn\u2019t try to get back with her. Some time later, I start dating another girl, one that my parents liked. We kept our relationship pretty lowkey to avoid drama and stuff like that, but our parents knew and were fine with it. \n\nDays later, and I mean DAYS later, I find out that my ex had broken up with her boyfriend because she had cheated on him (cheating at age 15, I know). She then approached me for what at first glance seemed like support and comfort. I delivered on this, considering I didn\u2019t want to be a shitty person and we were still pretty cool with each other. I didn\u2019t exactly agree with her cheating, but I supported her regardless as she seemed like she understood the mistake she made and didn\u2019t want to repeat it. As we continue to talk, she brings up that old promise we made to each other a while back that she had broken. She had wanted to get back with me once again. Please keep in mind that this was the same day she broke up with someone because she cheated on them. I declined and explained to her that I had been in a relationship already. She then went on rambling about \u201cbut we made a promise to each other\u201d and \u201cyou should\u2019ve told me you were in a relationship\u201d. She seemed to have forgotten the fact that she had broken the promise first. We go back and forth, and it ends with her calling me an asshole and me calling her a whore. \n\nDays after that, all of her friends started giving me dirty looks and started going up to me to call me a dickhead. My food at lunch was spat in because she was friends with a student cafeteria worker. I was constantly harassed when I was by myself to the point where I had to make sure I had a friend by me at all times. I didn\u2019t want to approach the staff because at the end of the day I wanted to avoid drama, and I thought that it would eventually go away over time. Also I called her a whore still so that could\u2019ve gotten me in trouble as well lmao. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I feel like I was sort of an ass to her, because at the end of the day she was a really nice and caring person who made a some mistakes, albeit some really stupid ones but mistakes that I had thought she might have learned from. I also hurt her pretty bad when the first break up happened, and she probably feels like shit considering I\u2019m happy with another girl and she is left lonely.

I never really have time to relax as my entire life is split between school and work. \n\nAnyways, today my sister, who is back at my mom and I\u2019s house for the holidays, made a comment about how much it sucks that I\u2019m going to a community college instead of being able to enjoy the college experience. She said this in a very condescending way and I snapped. I yelled at her about how she\u2019s extremely entitled and has always had everything handed to her on a silver platter and that not everyone is as lucky as her. I told her that she needed to get over her superiority complex and to enjoy her time now before the real world gives her an extremely harsh awakening. \n\nMy mother yelled at me for my response and while I\u2019m not one to snap at people, but I don\u2019t really feel guilty for what I said. I guess I was just wondering if i was justified or if me snapping at her was me just being an asshole. \n\nI apologize for any formatting as I\u2019m on mobile!

Their relationship in my eyes is too close and I've discussed this with her before but she thinks I'm being an over protective and reading into things. \n\n\n I don't know much about Bill, other than that they met through facebook before I knew her. He's in a relationship I think, and works in a carehome with kids.\n\n\nTheir relationship has always been a point of arguments for us. Bill often sends her money, and pays for gifts for her (like phones) and even drives 2+ hours each way to see her sometimes, as we moved to a different city recently. He even got a tattoo of a line from one of her poems on his arm.\n\n\nThey use to send each other messages daily and talk about very emotional stuff. They'd send lots of kisses at the end of each message and she told me they even say they love each other. She insists this is all platonic and they both only see each other as friends. She's never hidden any of this from me which leads me to believe she isn't lying. However, she has hidden Bill sending her money before and almost seems to deliberately move away when they message sometimes. She says this is because I try to read the messages over her shoulder, but he's the only person I've noticed her do it for. Also, when he comes up to visit her, it's when I'm busy or they go out alone together. Even if I'm free, and I'd be willing to go with them. She said it was because she wants to spend time with her friend alone.\n\n\nWe'd argued about this before and ended up arguing about it a few times more, but finally we came to a kind of conclusion where I thought she agreed with me that my insecurities were valid and she'd lower the level of the relationship. From then she stopped messaging him as much.\n\n\nHowever, from before all this ( before me and my SO met even) they'd arranged to go to a gig in another city (Bill is paying for everything, tickets, hotel and anything like food). Now, this is not all I am concerned about. Initially I was weary about this, had said to her I was anxious as well, but was going to be ok with her going. \n\n\nHe's driving the 2+ hours (out of the way I should add) to pick her up and then they are driving to the other city ~2 hours from here. This is on a Friday. It turned out my friend who lives in that city wanted to meet up with me and her, so I said it would be convenient if I could go with my SO and Bill as they drive down. I'd meet up with our friends as they see the gig and then me and her spend the rest of the weekend with our friends and get the train back. (Note: my SO is the one who told me they wanted to meet up, and I said it was the same weekend she was going away so it would work. She didn't realise it was the same weekend.)\n\n\nShe said sure at first, but we didn't actually talk about it. As it's coming up closer I was trying to figure out what we're meant to be doing and she didn't really seem like she wanted to talk about it. Then she started saying how she'd feel bad about ditching Bill on the Saturday. I said we wouldn't meet our friends until the evening anyway and that me and her could spend the day with Bill. She said she didn't want me there and would rather spend the day with him alone, as Bill has spent all this money on her and Bill know I'm not his biggest fan. Then she started saying how she felt like me saying I should go down with them was me keeping an eye on them, and that it would be awkward for all three of us to go together. I was a bit upset by this, and I really need to know if I'm being a dick by being anxious about all this? The argument got a bit heated and now she's said she wants to go down to see her family a few days before.\n\n\nAITA for being concerned by all this?\n\n\nHappy to elaborate or answer any questions people may have!

I wanted to early on, but she didn\u2019t. Reason being, she wasn\u2019t ready and/or didn\u2019t want to put a label to what we had. I really liked her so I was okay with this. Honestly, we were practically girlfriends, just without the label. One thing to note is that when we first started talking, we established that we could both talk to other girls since we weren\u2019t official. I told her it was a personal choice of mine to exclusively be talking to her and I was okay with her talking to other girls if she wanted to. I only asked that she tell me, although I also mentioned that that was her choice. Well, fast forward about a year and out of the blue, she wanted to be exclusive. I was obviously ecstatic and didn\u2019t think twice about it.\n\nOne day, a few months into our relationship, she hopped into the shower while I was watching a show on her laptop. Up until this moment in time, she would always want to know what I told my friends about her and vice versa. I usually either told her or showed her my conversations, but she always kept it vague or a secret. I trusted her enough though and didn\u2019t think twice about it. But for whatever reason on this particular day, I was curious as to what she would tell her friends about me so I opened up her messages and searched my name. In hindsight, I probably should not have snooped. \n\nAnd cue the whole cliche of snooping and finding something bad. I found out that she had been talking to another girl (let\u2019s call her Ashley) for the majority of the first year we were talking. In fact, I found out that she had also lied to me multiple times by saying she was going on a trip with her fraternity when she was actually going to see Ashley. When her friends asked if she was going to tell me, she said no.\n\nI was obviously sad about this and when she came out of the shower, I was honest about snooping and we talked about it for a while. Since I had told her from the beginning that I was okay with her talking to other girls, I accepted it and got over it quickly. The only thought that lingered though was: \u201cdid she only decide to become official with me because it didn\u2019t work out with Ashley?\u201d \n\nAnyway, we broke up a few months later for other reasons. A few more months later, I got invited to a party and Ashley was attending. We talked. \n\nTurns out, my ex had told Ashley about me prior, but wanted to become official with Ashley. When Ashley asked about me, my ex replied back saying that she would \u201cdrop me in a heartbeat\u201d if Ashley wanted to take things further. After hearing this, I asked Ashley about the timeline and I realized that this had all happened a few weeks before my ex wanted to make it official with me. I was so sad/livid that I decided to cut my ex out of my life without telling her what I found out.\n\nAITA for suddenly cutting my ex out even though I said it was okay to be dating multiple people in the beginning?", "output": "cutting my ex out of my life", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

By 'close' I mean platonically so. I did have feelings for him but he didn't feel the same way. We spent a lot of time together, spoke a lot, and seemed to think very highly of each other. \n\nI got a big red flag when he tried to make out with me at a party we were both at. This wasn't uncommon behaviour for him, but I took issue with it being directed at me. I forgave him -- he was drunk, after all -- but asked him not to do it again because it was messing with my feelings a little bit. He tried it twice more on two separate occasions before I finally decided I needed some space to deal with my feelings properly. The decision to distance myself was a complicated one; I knew our mutual friends were fed up with him and were on the brink of ditching him, but at the same time I felt suffocated in the relationship and wanted that to end. The problem was that he would be completely alone (he didn't have much of a family at the time) and I didn't want that for him. Nonetheless, I chose to distance myself anyway and made it clear why. I thought that the least helpful thing would be to freeze him out without explanation and that knowing would perhaps make things easier to process. \n\nThis lasted for a week. It turned out we were, once again, both present at the same house party. I avoided talking to him and generally stuck to chatting with random people and seeing how it went. Little did I know he was going to try to hang himself in the home-owners garage, or at least that is what it looked like. After seeing him stumble in there, I figured I ought to check on him because I knew there were loads of dangerous tools in rather precarious places and he might knock something over and hurt himself or something. Well, I caught him as I did and we ended up having a long -- rather touchy, on his side of things -- conversation about what was going on. He blamed me for all of it and told me that it was because I'd made him feel guilty. He explained that he loved me, that things could be different if he wasn't afraid of his sexuality, and how he wanted me to promise I wouldn't leave him. Foolishly, I made that promise, if only because I wanted it to make him feel better.\n\nThe next day I spoke to him about it because I couldn't really sleep after seeing him all strung up like that. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help. He said no, but that he would consider the account of everything I'd told him and get back to me. In spite of saying very little about anything else, he told me to discount what he said about loving me. At this point, I just rolled my eyes and waited patiently for a reply that I didn't get. Instead, I heard three different versions of that same story from our mutual friends all over the course of the next month, all which painted me in a bad light. I began to wonder if there was something terrible I'd done but deluded myself into thinking I hadn't. This time I was a little more direct and asked him about it straight up. He then admitted that he was self-harming and blamed it on me, again. From that point onwards I have had recurrent dreams about it and have not been able to absolve my guilt for something which, I can reason now, was not my responsibility. Our mutual friends speculated that he was self-harming, based on something they'd noticed, and I confirmed it for them hoping they'd treat him a little better.\n\nA week later all of our mutual friends had ditched him, and to this day I don't really know why. I can make some educated guesses, but I've never heard any proper explanations. Either way, I thought it was unfair for them to ditch him despite knowing what they did. This meant that I was the only person he really had any more, which wasn't great for me but I accepted that and tried to help. I stayed up night after night to keep him company and, combining that with the guilt of what he'd accused me of, I became very depressed. I gradually isolated myself from everybody but him and neglected the advice of all the friends who told me to stop helping him. I wasn't going to, though, because they were unwilling to give him a second chance and he'd still be all alone. \n\nSuddenly he froze me out and started trying very hard to get back in with these mutual friends again. My poor judgement in isolating myself meant that it was now I who had nobody I was particularly close to anymore and, having become rather unpersonable and irritable in person, nobody was particularly interested in my company. Most of all, I felt betrayed. I'd tried to help him the best I could and after all they'd done to him he was in the process of ditching me in favour of them. I spoke to him about it and he called me selfish for talking about my feelings. I warned him about them -- they'd not only hurt him but countless people in the past, and I think they're pretty callous -- to which he accused me of attempting to manipulate him because, apparently, I wanted control over him. It was at this point I learned that he'd turned to drugs to cope. I told an official trained in pastoral support because I was no longer in a position to help at all and I didn't want to see him running himself into the ground like that. I know it has helped him in the long-run, and it has also meant that his family are looking out for him a lot more now and making sure they're present in his life.\n\nWe argued at this point more than we talked normally. I often got angry and was generally scathing to him in these instances, and he'd accuse me of doing all sorts of heinous things that I wouldn't even dream of doing. Depression worsened and my feelings for him hadn't gone, neither had the guilt or the dreams, and any attempt to talk to him about any of this he took severe issue with. On one occasion I lashed out verbally and, I'm told, really hurt him. I remember that I was not pleasant whatsoever and I take responsibility for that. After this, he nearly hit me at another house party and I decided I'd had enough. He ended up in with our mutual 'friends' -- who, at this point, had ditched me -- and I wondered if I'd been so unreasonably terrible that this was what I deserved. I decided to go see a counsellor from this point onwards.\n\nI hadn't spoken to him in four months and have only recently been in contact with him again. The dreams haven't gone and neither has the guilt, and I've asked him if I can talk to him about it. I understand it might be hard for him to talk about all of that stuff, but I feel that if I can reconcile what happened and understand my place in it all I might be able to sleep properly again. Having asked him, he refused on the basis that I'd try to manipulate him again (not that I see where I did this in the first place) and try to turn him against his friends. I pushed for it and he's finally agreed. I'm asking here if I'm the arsehole in this situation because my current friends all become very shifty when I ask them for advice. I don't want to push him, but I'm at a point in my life where I can't afford to be losing sleep over something I think can be ended like this. \n\nThanks in advance.", "output": "seeking closure with a 'friend' who believes I tried to manipulate him", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

Literally everyone at our table, black, white, or Hispanic/Asian were laughing at them. It\u2019s not something to laugh at, but we all knew he wasn\u2019t being serious. At least, I think that. I used to be his friend (before he starting being really racist with the N-word) and I thought I\u2019d share some of my racist jokes with him. Not because I particularly liked that he was racist, just because he used to be my friend. Oddly enough, he gets offended whenever someone says something about Chinese people. \n\nI whispered my jokes, and he started laughing. I laughed too, they were (kinda) funny. \nNow believe me when I say I don\u2019t support racism, because it\u2019s disgusting, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s racist (unless you mean it to be) to tell jokes and laugh at them.

Not saying he molested or did anything illegal, but he would watch porn with titles like \"daughter banging dad\" \"dad having sex with daughter\" and so on... and I didn't learn from my mom this info no no no... I learned from Joel's (my now new step dad) daugher, which in turn learned from my brother....\n\nBasically she told everyone about it, exept me... \n\nAnd so after learning that, and after a second visit to the hospital, my mom told the truth about my biological dad, and how he was actually killed because he owned people money and he didn't have any...

I started hating her, doubting her, rebelling against her...\n\nI wouldn't talk to her, look at her, and even let her touch me...  \n\nHer exude of not telling me/ drifting me away from the truth was that she wanted to protect me, she wanted to not let the outside world hurt me.

We would have them over for holidays and even if my husband was working I'd go hang out with them without him. \n\nMe and his coworker really became good friends more than me and his wife because we had a lot in common and the main thing was we had the same sense of humor.

She said yes. However, this time, I didn't ask for her permission. I know, I realized that I was at fault for not informing my roommate but I felt like a child having to ask for her parent's permission to have someone over.

I brought up the discussion again with her and asked if my guy can stay overnight for one night a week. (I would be completely fine staying over at his place, but he lives with his parents). She was really hesitant in answering and suggested that I should consider other options before asking her, such as camping outside, airbnb, and a motel. Her reasons for being uncomfortable with my guy staying at our place overnight constitutes: \n\n1. **Noise level:** she mentioned that she can hear our conversations, and it felt to her that she was forced to be involved in our relationship, because she knows what we're talking about.\n2. **Her privacy**: Having him over = invasion to her privacy. She does not want to run into him in the middle of the night. She wants him to only come during the day. \n3. **My privacy**: This is her main reason. She claims that she's concerned about me and wanting me to progress my relationship with this guy. By booking a hotel room/airbnb to perform FACs,, I can have the most privacy I can possibly get without having to worry about my roommate hear what is going.. \n\nIs it honestly too much for me to ask of my roommate to allow my guy to stay over for one night a week? He comes around midnight anyways, so we'll only spend at the most 8/9 hours together (11am non)  (half of which will be spent just sleeping). \n\nPlease note that my roommate does not have a car, so she's always going to be home. She has not yet offered to leave the apartment to give me some privacy. She said that if I had told her before that he was coming overnight, she would be more compliant to agree.. Please help!

One day, he suddenly stopped talking to me. I never found out why but apparently something I did triggered it. He never explained even though I asked several times so I still don't know if I did something bad. That period of time really upset me.

He'd make a big deal of avoiding me/whispering/being strange when I was in the room so I started being very vocal about how I hated him. He'd try to get \"his friends\" to be super exclusive and cut off people who were \"my friends\", which was a real dick move, but it just ended up backfiring on him and most people disliked him. We graduated that way. \n\nFast forward several years. I am now rather blunt and sarcastic. I attended an award ceremony/ball event that usually doubled as an alumni reunion. I ran into him and he tried to strike up a conversation. I don't hold a grudge anymore.

Not enough to be drunk, but we were both speaking quite candidly. He says he has been struggling to find a relationship because none of the girls he gets along with are \"his type\" physically.

For example, college talks for the niece recently came up between the four of us (wife, sister-in-law, niece and I) and my wife asked what she was thinking of doing. The niece said her desired field in IT possibly, and my sister-in-law immediately chimed in with a thinly veiled acerbic tone of \"Oh, you can be just like your uncle\" - dead silence for a few moments until my wife attempted to make it into a nice comment. For a little background, I was at a small party where we all were and I remember one of my sister-in-law's friends come up and start speaking to me about my job being \"low-tier IT\" with a lot of assumptions. I've never spoken with this person before. I had to explain to him that I was a database manager at a big company and he had heard this stuff from the sister-in-law, so naturally I attribute the silence to some behind the scenes talks. Since then I have noticed that the sister-in-law's friends have been very awkward towards us any time we are at joint gatherings. On a few occasions within the last year our niece has hugged my sister-in-laws friends but did not hug either my wife or I. She still seems to enjoy our company and speak to us but it is very strange. \n\nOutside of the sister-in-laws circle we have a very healthy social life with and appreciate our people. Though my wife has had her own observations that have bothered her for the last year, but hasn't done anything about it because she doesn't know what to do. Am I the asshole for trying to have her do/say anything about it? I feel crazy and am doubting myself.\n", "output": "trying to get my wife to confront my sister-in-laws manipulative behavior", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

My mother on the other hand is a very extroverted, motivated and tenacious person and so is my sister. Needless to say this can cause multiple problems and arguments in the home.

I detest this and this caused conflict, a few weeks ago, which ended up with her and my sister crying and calling me an asshole, and today, we finally hit boiling point.

They came back for Christmas, and now my daughter remembers that her little cousin bit her and doesn't want to play with her. My wife and I are working with her to get over it and explaining that she's been bitten before and that her cousin didn't mean anything by it, she's just going through a phase and learning that it isn't ok.

As she's said every other day that she's been here since she got bitten. My mother-in-law then said she was going to go home if my daughter couldn't be nice. I got upset by that, but knowing that my wife was on the way home, I just told her about it and decided to let her take care of it when she got here. Then a few minutes later she asked why my daughter wasn't happy. I told her it was probably something to do with the fact that you told her you were going home for, in the four year old's mind, no reason. Then a few minutes later she is asking her more questions about why she doesn't want to play with her cousin and my daughter keeps telling her it's because she doesn't want her to bite her again. My mother-in-law keeps asking like she hopes the answer is going to change and I can tell my daughter is getting frustrated, so I snapped and told her in a not so nice tone of voice that it was because her cousin bit her and she doesn't want it to happen again. Now everybody, including my wife, is pissed at me, and I'm hanging out in the basement doing house work instead of spending time with my family. My wife is upset because she thinks I'm intentionally upsetting her family every time they come over because her sister got upset with me a few weeks ago and said I yelled at her when I answered the same question for the fifth time in a row.\n\nI told my wife I would apologize, but honestly don't feel like I did anything wrong.

I reminded him of the rule, and we left it at that. Afterwards, I got a message from an online friend that wanted to talk to me/show me something real quick in a game. So I went into the game, and immediately I get messages from both A and B saying \"Wow, you said no to playing ealier but now you're in-game? Ok.\" I tell them that I was going into the game for a quick thing, and that didn't go against the rule since it was about playing together. I said they're the ones upset over nothing. I also mentioned that friend A would usually listen to study material while gaming, so them being upset for me going into a game for 5 minutes was really hypocritical.\n\nThat's when the argument broke out. They argued for the fact that it was rude for me to say no to playing and then immediately after going into another game alone. I said I was in it for 5 minutes max, and that me playing shouldn't bother them. I then mentioned that I'm even ahead of my study schedule and asked if they can say the same, and that it should be none of their business that I procastinate. \n\nI then got a bit petty (unusual for me) and decided to say that it's always you two against me, and that I didn't appreciate how they always had shade to throw at me. I critisised friend A for breaking the rule we had come up with, and he excused it with I forgot. When I said the study schedule thing he mentioned that he's sick and couldn't study. Fair enough, I wished him \"Get well\".\n\nAfter a bit more arguing that my procastination and solo gaming should be none of their business, friend B (who wasn't involved in most of the arguing) sent us an all caps message and told us to shut up, since she can't concentrate due to the notifications. I responded \"If I don't want to?\" She then responded that I should respect her studying, again in all caps. I told her about the scheduled do not disturb feature on the phone and left it at that. Later she sent a voicemail where she sobbed and said that I ruined her day.\n\nYou can do two judgements here: Was I an asshole from the start and was I an asshole by the end? I feel like somewhat of an ass by the end, but I didn't really do anything to upset her before the end, since the argument mainly ran between me and A.\n\nTLDR: Friend A asks us to game, I remind him of a rule between us against that.

No contract, I just give her money each month. When i moved in, I told her that my girlfriend stays overnight twice a week. She said no problem to this. My girlfriend and I are both very quiet and friendly, and we mostly keep to ourselves by watching TV in my room. She's been spending more time during the day on Saturdays (like she'll be in my room Saturday afternoon - Sunday afternoon), but she's actually only stayed overnight once a week since I've lived here. We try to invite my roommate to go places whenever we go out, but she always says no. When I first met my roommate my girlfriend did nOT spend this much time at my old apartment, but since I've moved closer to her we now can spend more time together. So my life has just slightly changed since moving to this apartment, I promise I didn't intentionally omit how much she spends in the apartment.

No problem, I'm happy to do it if it'll make her happy and make the apartment look nice. I've also driven dinner over to her office when she's been stressed about work. i've tried to be nice.\n\nWe're both super busy so my girlfriend comes over once during the weekday from 8:30 - 10:30, and then she comes over to my room on Saturday afternoon around 2, we'll go get some food for a few hours because it stresses my roommate that my girlfriend is in my room. Then we'll come back and watch TV for the rest of the night in my room. GF's then there until Sunday around 3 PM. For context, we're now in my room the ENTIRE time with the door closed and the TV on low, but we used to occasionally do homework in the living room or eat in the kitchen. At first, she didn't like us eating in the kitchen or being in the living room (common spaces) when she got home which I totally understood, so she asked us to eat in my room and not cook in the kitchen so no big deal, we now order out and eat in my room. Also, my girlfriend has never showered here, she showers before at her home so she doesn't have to use our water/shower while she's here.\n\nRoommate has confessed that she often can't tell if we're in my room or not unless my gf's car is out on the street because we're quiet.  Fast forward, my roommate's work has gotten really stressful and she now tells me that it bothers her that my girlfriend is in my room on Saturday because she \"can't focus with more than one person in the apartment\" and she asked that my girlfriend leaves by 12 PM. She also asked that I tell her my schedule of when she is and isn't in the apartment. I now give her 24 hours notice and try to tell her our schedule. I'm a little annoyed at this point because I'm trying to be accommodating, but whatever.  We normally leave at like 2 PM now to go to the library on Sundays because i'm not gonna have a curfew imposed on me at 23, but i'm doing my best.\n\nNow the kicker. What really hurt was that one of my students (I teach 2nd grade in a bad neighborhood) was shot and killed instantly on a Friday. I text my roommate that my gf and I will be in my room all day Saturday because I'm mourning and crying and grieving because you know, my kid was a victim of gun violence. She says she's sorry and blah blah blah, she's nice.

My job is really hard sometimes ( re: my student died) and my girlfriend is my rock through it all. I can't do this without her.

So it doesn't really affect the roommate in anyway. \n\nTL;DR Roomate was ok with gf staying over twice a week, she's actually not. She gave me a list of 50 things to clean every week and I do them. She didn't like us in common spaces so we don't hang out there anymore. She told me to give her my schedule so she know's when we'll be in the apartment and I've done that. I've tried to be accommodating to my roommate about my girlfriend, and roommate was ok with my girlfriend until her work got stressful. She sent a really cold heartless text to me about my girlfriend being in my room 2 days after one of my 7-year-old students was shot. AITA?

Anyway, she told me she has depression. I know, not from experience however, that mental disorders are very difficult to get through and it helps to have someone there to be with you. That is what I'm trying to do, seeing as I'm her friend and all. During this post, I'll call her F (random letter).\n\n\nHowever, at the moment if feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her. From early on in the friendship, she has gone into these moods where she doesn't talk to anyone, and seems to be angry at everyone. She is allowed to take a friend in past the queue at lunchtimes because of her diabetes (unrelated), but sometimes we sit there not talking at all, or she's just complaining about everything I say/do. For example:\n\nMe- *spills food accidently*\n\nF- *rolls eyes*. \n\nOr:\n\nMe- what lesson have you got next?\n\nF- physics. With Mr randomteacher, who doesn't like me.\n\nMe- why? \n\nF- *rolling eyes* I come in late every day because I need to check my blood sugar.\n\nMe- He won't hate you for that, he knows why you're late.\n\nF- *rolls eyes again, gives yes/no or silent answers for rest of day*. \n\nOne time, she blatantly ignored me all day. The reason? \"I didn't feel like talking\". \n\n\nI'm quite shy, so I struggle to make friends, but I am quite bubbly when I feel comfortable with someone, aka my good friends. So I happen to have another few friends, who aren't my best friends, but I can chat and have a laugh with them. We share a pe class. F is also in my pe class. If I go over to them for a couple minutes, and laugh with them, I get death glares off F for the rest of the day, which triggers a mood. Sometimes I feel like I can't be around those people if she's nearby, but I don't want to sit and mope with her during pe. \n\n\nMy phone is shit. Sometimes texts do not go through, the WiFi cuts out during a WhatsApp conversation, and I go offline. Sometimes it can take ages until everything's working again. It takes ages sometimes to post a simple comment on reddit. One time, I was asked by F to send her the notes from a lesson she missed due to an absence, and I said I'll try to get them to you via WhatsApp. She doesn't have Facebook messenger or anything other than WhatsApp, and my phone charges me for pictures over normal SMS. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the photos over due to having to do my homework, have my dinner and go out shopping with my mam, all after school. When I returned home, my phone broke again. I explained this to her the next day, and she started ranting about how I never reply to her. I've explained the issue.\n\n\nOne day in pe, she was whispering to another girl about something. I get on with this other girl, and she basically told me it's personal between F and her, but she wanted F to tell me and asked me to talk to her. F had seemed distant, so I asked her, and basically said I wouldn't ever judge her if there was a secret she was hiding from me. Then I was told by F that I would be ok if I went to leave her during lunch to use the computers. I had no homework to do, F knew this, and she was hinting at me to go away. \n\nI got a text later on that night, with F asking me exactly when she seemed distant, and why I was asking her about it. \nIn summary of the 10pm conversation:\nMe- You've seemed distant for a while. \n\nF- What about last Wednesday? Was I not distant then? Why are you asking me now?\n\nI got upset, as I felt like I had to ask her every time she seemed upset, but if I do that it's wrong, because she'll roll her eyes.\n\nToday: what made me want to post this. \nI went out during the weekend to meet a friend. It was a school-type event so lots of people from school would be there and I texted F and another friend if they wanted to come the same day, but I would understand if they couldn't, as it was spontaneous. Remember the phone situation? Only one message went through, as I sent them individually and locked the screen as F's message was going through, so hers didn't get through without me knowing until today, when my other friend told me why she couldn't come, and F glared at me. I suddenly realised that she may not have received the message, and I apologised and told her that my phone was still acting up. She was silent, whenever I said hi all day she'd storm past me. Now I think she was talking crap about me because she was whispering with this boy in my class, and glancing at me, trying to be subtle. I don't know if this was true, or it was me becoming paranoid after what's happened in the past. I noticed I can't talk to my friends, but she's still talking to who she wants to.\n\nI'm trying my hardest to understand/ not be a jerk about her depression, but it's tough. I feel emotionally drained at this point, as I just want to get through school with good grades, as well as enjoying parts of it, but I feel like F is taking over my life. I want to separate myself from her, but I don't know her experience.\n", "output": "stopping being friends with someone, partly because of her depression", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

She\u2019s blond, kind of short and good looking, she\u2019s a bit nerdy and the type to say sorry to a fly after she squashed it she has the \u201ccute girl next door\u201d look.\n\n**Mark:** My friend. He\u2019s tall has dark hair and glasses, he\u2019s very funny a bit dorky but one of my very best friends. He\u2019s a country boy and usually dresses more practically then anything else.\n\n**Michael:** Me. I\u2019m blond, average height, pretty good looking (if I do say so myself) though rather skinny and usually wear a dress shirt and some nice pants.\n\n**Background:** \n\nFrey, Mark and I all started in the same class some years ago. Mark and I quickly became friends as we have the same kind of humour. The first time I talked to Fray was in German, we had to work in groups, Fray and I were paired. a bit later we got to catch up at a preparty and ended op kissing at most of the night at the party the day after I really didn\u2019t know what to text her as I had only been in one previous relationship, while I was pondering she ended up texting me a bit later we ended up discussing what we actually where, after being asked by almost all of the school, we came to the conclusion that she would like to be my girlfriend and I would very much like to be her boyfriend. \n\nJust before we began in school my little sister was diagnosed with cancer and she was in the hospital for over 9 months only coming home a handful of times. It really took a toll on me and I got kind of depressed thought I did my best to hide it from everyone, I hate talking about my problems and didn\u2019t want to make it even harder for my parents or my little brother if they also had to worry about me. Fray was exactly what I needed, finally something good happens to me. I don\u2019t know if it really played a role, but I thought I would include it just in case.\n\nThe relationship for the next long time went great, she loved me, and I loved her more then anything, until she ended it. I followed her to her bus almost every day (a 20-minute walk) there we could talk, complain about school, hold hands and I could get a goodbye kiss. One day she wouldn\u2019t hold my hand, she kept her hands in her pockets, I didn\u2019t think anything of it as it was cold. The day after that again she wouldn\u2019t hold my hand and I could the something was bothering her, but she wouldn\u2019t tell me what, when her bus came, I said \u201cgoodbye, I love you\u201d as I always did, her response? \u201cmmhhmm\u201d this broke my heart, it wasn\u2019t a big deal but damnit that hurt. The day after our school held a large party (the same kind that we hooked up at) and I hosted a preparty at my house for the class, she would avoid me the whole day I just drank some more and tried to have fun. When we got home to me after the party and went to bed, she would lie almost over the edge of the bed aka. As far away from me as possible. By this time, I had begun to see what was coming and just wishing she would just rip the bandage off and get it over with instead of this torture. The next morning, she said we had to talk and she broke up, she began crying so I did my best to comfort her while dying inside I send her on her way home and just sat thinking why she broke up, she never gave me a reason, so I felt I was something I had done or said but I couldn\u2019t think of anything. I had difficulty sleeping as I felt guilty because of whatever I had done, and it didn\u2019t help that I had to see her every day in school. Just to say the breakup was very hard on me, I still loved her, but I knew she didn\u2019t feel the same way anymore.\n\nTime went and I started getting over her. After a rather large party I hosted an after party for a small group of friends, Mark asks me if its okay he invites Fray, I couldn\u2019t see a reason she shouldn\u2019t be aloud to come so of course I say she could. Half an hour after she arrived her and Mark were not to be found anywhere, I had just emptied my last beer, so I headed down to my room to fetch my Gin for a Gin n\u2019 Tonic. Then I open my door the first thing I see is Fray and Mark in my bed, they weren\u2019t doing anything just lying side by side talking, I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just said hey got my liquor and went op to the others. I know I wasn\u2019t a lot, but it really got to me seeing my ex, with my best friend, in my bed, the same bed I used to be with her in. some days later another good friend told me he saw it too and asked what I thought about it.\n\nI noticed them beginning to talk each other more and more I school, I even felt happy for them both. \n\n**Now to the reason I write this in the first place.**\n\nsome time ago I got invited to a small house party by one of the girls in the class, she lives in the country and I in the middle of the city so it was a good bit away so I arrange with my mother that she would drive me home when I called, she was happy to do so but of course it would take some time. All the girls invited arrived a couple of hours before so they would have some girl time before the guys came, but as the only dude Mark was also invited to come early, I thought it was strange but maybe transport would be easier if he came early. When I arrive, I was greeted by everyone with a hug, apart from Mark and Frey as Fray had leached on to Marks arm, I give him a handshake and a pad on the shoulder. The party went smoothly and it was fun to let loose, talk and play drinking games with all the others. Most of the party leave early and take a taxi to the dance club, I can barely eat with a fork let alone dancing especially drunk, so I thought Id stay a bit see what happens and maybe call my mother soon. We ended up being only Mark, Fray, the girl who hosted the party and me. We sat in the sofa watching Die hard and eating leftover pizza from earlier and let me tell you Mark and Fray did not watch any of the movie, they were cuddled up exactly the way we always used to when \u201cwatching movies\u201d aka. Making out. This really fucking hurt! I called my mom and she came after like half an hour.\n\nIt might not true seeing I was drunk, but I swear se glanced at me all the time, I tried to ignore it as I didn\u2019t want to course any drama.\n\nThe day after I text Mark something like \u201cHey, listen I don\u2019t get to say who you can and can not be in a relationship with, but you have to see this from my angle and understand it isn\u2019t easy seeing my ex being together with my best friend. If you really like each other of course you should be allowed to, but damn it hurt watching you and Fray yesterday lying exactly as we used to. I think you deserve to know how I feel and I hope you respect me enough to have this in the back of the head when I am near\u201d he said he was happy I texted him and of course he would.\n\nSince this they slowly stopped talking as much as they did before, I don\u2019t know If I really did end their relationship before it started, however I feel like shit knowing it\u2019s a possibility, so I must ask am I the asshole in this situation? \n\n**TL-DR:**\n\nMy long-term girlfriend broke up with me and quickly after start baking on my friend, so I text him that it hurts seeing them together.

She said \u201care you kidding\u201d and then said she didn\u2019t want to talk to me, before actually being unable to talk due to work. \n\nWhen she comes back I call her a pet name, and she tells me not to call her that. I apologize, use another, only to be told not to call her anything, to which I apologize again, not only for using pet names when she\u2019s not in the mood but also for previously upsetting her. I do, however, say that I was just trying to make a joke, and she goes into how she thought she could trust me in talking about her sexuality with me and how I have never called her straight as a joke before, and it hurts because while she\u2019s fine with hella gay being that gay is a blanket term, being called straight reminds her of people who say bi people in straight relationships are just straight. I repeat that I was just mocking that behavior, and say that I had previously made the exact joke, and recently. She says she doesn\u2019t remember, so I find a screenshot from the weekend where she said she felt gay and I said \u201cand you find me hot? That\u2019s pretty fuckin\u2019 straight\u201d to no ill effects. She then said \u201cfuck you\u201d and \u201cyou always have to be right\u201d before telling me not to talk to her. \n\nI oblige for a bit, then text her a paragraph of apology which she responds by saying she can\u2019t forgive me until I apologize in person. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole?", "output": "saying it's pretty fuckin' straight for my girlfriend to date me", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

TLDR at bottom. \n\nSince kindergarten I've been in Speech Therapy, for about 2/3's of the Alphabet, and a slew of problems such as talking too fast, volume control, etc. It isn't anything mentally wrong, just never really learned correctly so they had to reteach me. Finally, at the end of 8th grade I \"graduated\" from Speech, after (mostly) learning my R's and working with speed control. \n\nMy odd way of talking has given me a British accent, and I constantly get asked about it. But, I also never fully learned my R's and honestly I kinda backslided a little when I stopped being taught. So, from the time my kid brain could process it to now, I've always dealt with the fear of not being understood, and it never goes way. It's always the back of my mind. That, coupled with my mom constantly making me say words/pointing it out, makes me absolutely hate people pointing anything out near it.\n\nBut, I've also grown up with it so I'm pretty used to it. With my friend group we roast each other a lot so it comes up decently often. And while it bugs me, I usually just joke back a little and then change the subject quickly. They are my friends and they are just making lighthearted jokes, I'm not gonna blow up from it. \n\nBut this time, I don't know. My bf(of almost one year) knows how insecure I am about it, and we were just hanging out when he kept (jokingly) making fun of me; using a British accent, telling me to say certain R-heavy words, etc. I tried to keep it lighthearted and keep it to telling him to stop, but when that wasn't working I did turn to guilt tripping him, telling him about how awful and embarrassed it was making me feel.\n\nNormally, he'd apologized or stop. But this time he said something along the lines of \"Calm down, I'm just messing around\" and I fucking lost it.\n\nLong story short, I shoved him away(we were lounging around together on his bed) and told him he was being a dick and super inconsiderate of my feelings, and that I felt like he didn't even care that I was telling him to stop. I was pretty angry, so this was all yelled. This led to him being pretty shocked and said that I never really minded it before, and he didn't realize that I was getting generally upset over it. \n\nI told him I didn't want to hear it and that it isn't an excuse since I told him to stop. He apologized, but the night was ruined so I just went home after telling him I'd text him in the morning when I've had time to cool down.\n\nWell now I have and now I can't tell who was really in the wrong. He was the one mocking me and I had told him to stop, but at the same time he didn't know I was actually upset since normally I never really appear to be so my reaction seemed out of line. \n\nSo who was the asshole in the this situation? \n\nTLDR: I grew up with a speech impediment that made me insecure. Bf was jokingly roasting me about it, and I lost it when he didn't stop upon being asked. Bf didn't realize I was being serious since normally I don't appear to be bothered by it.

SO and I are playing video games when he gets a call at 9:30pm from a work friend who lives one street over, asking if we want to go over to his house to drink and hang out with some other friends.\n\nI'm really not in the mood to go over there. I take medication every night for nausea and it doubles as a sleeping pill. I'd already taken this medication, plus I'm in my pajamas, about ready for bed. I told him he should go without me and that i was going to bed instead.\n\nAs he's leaving, I tell him not to do anything with any girls. He has never done anything with another woman as long as he's been with me, so I have no reason to think that he would tonight. I was mostly joking, but I'm also feeling a little self conscious. I'm in my second trimester of pregnancy, so I've started to get a little bit of a bump, plus I'm not pooping regularly and I'm extra gassy today. I just feel really unattractive and my anxiety brain was telling me he might think this as well. He obviously didnt find my comment funny, however.\n\nCut to about 10 minutes after he left. I'm in bed, getting settled in, and I hear glass breaking. I automatically imagine someone watching my SO leave and, thinking the house is empty, break in through a window. I jump up to lock the bedroom door and immediately call my SO, asking if he was in the house because I heard glass shatter. He didnt even seem phased by this, from what I could tell. He tells me he'll walk back and for me to get his gun by our bed. \n\nWhile I'm waiting for him to get back, I start to realize a couple things. 1.) We have a dog who barks if he hears anything strange at night. He w as s suspiciously quiet. 2.) The shattering noise definitely wasnt loud enough to be something big, like a window breaking. I started to feel pretty stupid right as my husband walks into the apartment.\n\nHe clears the house and doesn't see anyone, so I go to check the living room. Yup. Our dog licked a bowl off the coffee table and it shattered. He *never* does this, but the table was pulled a little closer to the couch tonight, so I guess he took his chance.\n\nAs we're cleaning up the mess, my SO says \"there aren't even any girls there!\" I was sincerely confused by this, so he explains that the only women at the party are there with their husbands. The way he says all this to me, I can tell that he thinks I broke the bowl so that he would have to come home. I told him, \"I didnt do this so you would have to come back!\" But he just muttered something that didnt make sense and then left for the party again. Didnt seem like he was in a great mood.\n\nI do feel pretty stupid about not checking the house to actually see if someone was breaking in, but was I really being that big of an asshole to put him in a bad mood like this?\n\nTL;DR: SO went to a party while I stayed home and I told him not to do anything with any women there, even though i have no reason to say this. After he leaves, I think I hear someone breaking into the apartment, so I call him home to check. After finding out it was just our dog, he thinks I tricked him into coming home and leaves again in a bad mood.", "output": "making my husband come home from a party", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

This kid that I'm gonna name Mario was one of my only two friends at school, I'm gonna call my other friend Luigi. So the reason I had only two friends on my last year of elementary school it's because I'm on the spectrum so I always been having these issues to get to communicate with people. Mario and Luigi were 12 years old and I was 11 yrs old. This is a long one :&lt; sorry.\n\nSo me and Mario decided to make our science project together, Luigi pretty much decided to make his project alone bc he belongs to r/iamverysmart. And I don't quite remember what Mario and I were trying to acomplished but we kinda needed a wood little table, bleach and some other things I don't remember by now. We decided to make a test of our experiment at my house, the same day of the exposition (We had to go to classes from 12:10 m.d to 5:10 p.m that day) so he came to my grandma's house and we went to the backyard to get to work (We were basically home alone since the only adult at home was my uncle that has down syndrome). \n\nWe use some cheap gloves from a random supermarte to cover our hands, but after mixing everything the gloves started to melt so I got scared and took them away. Now, Mario takes one the gloves that are still melting and says something like: \"Don't be a coward!\" and throws the glove at me.\n\nMe, obviously, a kid with asperger and no reflexes just received the glove in the face. More precisely mi right eye (For anyone that may wonder, My eye still works, but not as a perfect healthy eye, I wear glasses with a hell of an augment on the right side and a .5 on the left side). When I was hitted by the glove it hurted of course (mostly I felt my eye was on fire) and started screaming and crying, my uncle had a wonderful response to this, he took me to the shower (clothes still on me), go me into the water and made me wash my eye (Wich I did terribly bad but neither of us notice that).\n\nAfter a couple of hours I decided it didn't hurt anymore and I was ready to go to present my project, but I was mad, I was gonna do it alone and without amy evil glove. Since the only two persons at home were a kid with autism and an adult with down, so we thought I was fine and cool for school (My eyebrows and skin around my eye were white, YES, fucking white).\n\nWhen I got to the school the rest of my clasmmates were asking me:\n\n\"What happened to you?\"\n\"What is it with your eye?\"\n\nAnd I didn't have a reason to lie so I just told them (Especific words, I remember using these ones):\n\n\"Mario threw bleach in my eye\". \n\nAfter that I went to sit down but the teacher called my mom to take me home. Mom decided it was cool to not take me to the hospital that day. Later that night my mom sended me to sleep but I felt uncomfortable and told her my eye was still hurting (I kept that to myself the whole day), she freaks out and takes right away to the hospital, doctor tell us I'm gonna need glasses for life and told my mom to not wait thatany hours the next time bc if she made sleep and took me to the hospital the next day I probabbly would have only one eye working by now.\n\nThe following year (The rest of it, from august to november if I'm not wrong) everyone stopped talking to Mario bc they were afraid of him bc I never explained how the bleach situation ocurred. I was mad at him for a week or so and then we started to play Pok\u00e9mon together bc kids. \n\nAm I the asshole for ruining the reputation of the kid that nearly made me lost an eye or did he deserve it?\n\nThe next year Mario moved to El Salvador, I stayed in Costa Rica and I don't know what has been of Luigi, probabbly showing off his 28000 IQ and claiming to be more powerful than Shaggy.\n\nSorry for any grammar error, as said, I'm from Costa Rica so I don't speak english that much.", "output": "destroying my clasmmate reputation when he threw bleach at my right eye", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

I am a pretty blunt person, very type A, and am often considered the asshole. \n2. I only care about what other people think of me to the extent that I use it as a self modifying tool (if I am the asshole I then identify what it is that I need to adjust in myself)\n3. I am constantly working on bettering myself for others for myself (see statement 2). I know this does not excuse any behaviors I do, but it explains why I am here asking about this. \n\nIt is possible he might find this post as he does sometimes browse reddit but I doubt it since he's not really aware of this sub. But if he does I hope he knows I am asking because of genuine care for him and our friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's get down the the question. I have noticed over the several years we have been friends that my friend (let's call him George) has some peculiarities that could put him as very high functioning Aspergers. I majored in a branch of psychology which was not enough to by any means diagnose him, but enough that I notice some tendencies and know that since George is so high functioning a diagnosis could have been missed or overlooked. Most of his \"quirks\" are acceptable and do not hinder our friendship or his social interaction in general. He understands that sometime things are  considered inappropriate in general social situations, but does not really know what those are specifically, so he just goes into \"safe mode\" where he doesn't say anything controversial at all, even to those he considers friends. I do not think this is by any means a bad thing, but it means he is uncomfortable opening up to us and therefore limits our friendship. I do not say this because I am assuming I say it because after several years of friendship with George he expressed to a mutual friend that he is afraid that I will \"be done with him\" and then he will lose all his friends because of it. Let me explain this statement. I run a meetup group where most of our interactions and socializing are done through there or with the \"core\" people and those that have been removed from the meetup group are usually no longer invited to things that are off meetup. I then had a discussion with George about how I hope he trusts the strength of our friendship enough that he can talk to me about things that bother him, concern him, or he is wary about and he, by the end of it, agreed that he felt he could. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night we were playing a game and as I was setting up the arena he kept running over the traps I placed consuming them before their intended purpose. This in itself is not a problem or even a deal let alone big deal or small deal. But it is a habit of his. When Diablo 2 was a thing, one of his self proclaimed favorite things was to min/max a character, join a group of hardcore characters (when you die you lose everything, even the character) and help them quest and such and then drop a bunch hydras (stationary \"pets\" that do damage for you), port back to town, and then enable PVP having the hydras kill the whole party and everyone loses all their things and their characters become unplayable. Again, it's a game so it's not like people's lives were ruined or anything but people still put considerable amount of time and effort into leveling these characters. He did it just to have them lose everything, he did not gain experience, loot, or anything else from them dying. A second example is how a friend just discovered an elephant sanctuary that was taking volunteers. Let's call this friend Jane. Jane was never going to go to this sanctuary as she could not afford to stop work to volunteer all her time. This was very clear, even to George. Regardless, he spent about 10 minutes going back and forth with Jane about how \"you'll just be shoveling poop. It's not like they're just going to let you play with the elephants\" to which Jane would tell George \"I know that, but like, why do you have to ruin my nice fantasy?\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last night when he did the very very minor running over my traps just to waste them because he knew that I only had a limited amount of them I made a comment/question of \"why do you do that? Does it make you feel nice to ruin things for people or do you get some sort of something else out of it?\" to which re flippantly replied \"yes, clearly I just like to ruin peoples lives because I'm just evil\". So, a non-answer. \n\nMy question is this: would I be the asshole to press him again today about it? I don't really think this behavior is so bad that it would really interfere with our friendship (or if it did, would be very minimal) but I also want to address a thing that I see as unhelpful in his learning to better interact with friends and strangers. Also, it irritates me a little bit. But the big ass caveat is, that is not my place to make him address a thing that he does not want to address himself. He did not come to me asking me for help, so WIBTA for offering this advice anyway?

This guy in a fancy Mercedes SUV is waiting to make a right turn but he has to wait for me to cross first. Meanwhile, across the street, a large group of pedestrians are coming towards us. He begins turning into the crosswalk while I'm still totally in front of him, and by the time I'm about to pass him, he's fully in the crosswalk about 2 feet away from me, with his car pointed at me. I can tell he's going to try to get through the crosswalk before the group of pedestrians coming the other way get to him, but if he does that he'll be driving through a gap in pedestrians that's only slightly wider than his car, basically getting really close to pedestrians in the crosswalk.\n\nSo instead of continuing walking, I just stop. Just long enough that the group of pedestrians approaching from the other direction are now in front of his car too, forcing him to come to a stop and yield as he's supposed to. At no point was his car even stopped to wait for me, he was inching forward the entire time, so when I stop walking he has to abruptly apply the brakes while partially in the crosswalk still.

We have bigs and littles it\u2019s co Ed. Anyways, my roommates and I have the biggest house because it\u2019s off campus so we usually have parties and kick backs here. Anyways, I posted here awhile ago about this same girl. Story is she cheats on her boyfriend, she cheated emotionally and physically on her boyfriend with ME. She then got too fucked up one night with her best friend and they crashed in my bed and because I was in the same room as them she falsely implied I sexually assaulted her friend(there were witnesses who have my back and know I didn\u2019t). \n\nFast forward to today one of my roommates has a bday and she\u2019s coming because she\u2019s part of the \u201cfamily\u201d he\u2019s in since we have four separate families within the .org. I\u2019m totally fine with her coming today even though her boyfriend came to town. However, I kinda want to ask my roommates if next time she\u2019s not allowed in my house especially with her boyfriend. The reasoning I have is because I met him before he was cool, she told me she liked me more than a friend and hinted their relationship was bad then she said she loves her bf and now she\u2019s posting on Instagram, she also accused me of sexual assault yet still asks me to buy her alcohol? \n\nI don\u2019t want her in my house because of what she did to me, I especially don\u2019t want her boyfriend here because I feel bad for him. I\u2019m not the first guy she\u2019s cheated on him with and in my head why would you bring your boyfriend to the house of the guy you were fucking and also accused of \u201cpossibly\u201d assaulting her best friend.\n\nI know she\u2019s a part of my organization and I hate to exclude someone(not really) I don\u2019t want to be a dick tho. Knowing her she would act like I\u2019m excluding her for some other reason. But it\u2019s just I KNOW it will be awkward when I see the boyfriend because I DONT want to act like nothing happened. I somewhat want to be distance from him so he knows something is off. She\u2019s never going to tell him and even tho I\u2019m an asshole for sleeping with her boyfriend I do feel bad because no guy deserves it. I think she\u2019s also dangerous to be around if she\u2019s so scared of being found out she\u2019s cheating she\u2019s willing to potentially ruin someone\u2019s life. \n\nI\u2019m wondering maybe I can just let her come over sometimes if there\u2019s an event but restrict her form alcohol yet I still would not want her boyfriend over ever again.

Just didn't seem super important to know just to hang out with them in a group you know? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway fast forward, towards the end of college and out of college, and occasionally these people come up in conversation.

It's not that I find their situations to be illegitimate or anything, that part I couldn't care less about. It just seems cumbersome to have to remember to alter my speech patterns for this one specific circumstance to avoid being accidentally offensive or something. I understand \"they\" can be used both as a plural and singular, but at least the way I speak I only use it as a singular referring to someone I don't really know, or speaking to someone about someone they don't know (see how I used they there talking about this hypothetical person that you don't know?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know, it's a nuanced thing and I understand it can work, but it's awkward to pause mid-sentence and change he or she to they just to seem super PC.

We met on Tinder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a pretty introverted person and reserved if I don't know somebody. However, I'm a very social person when I want to be, especially with my friends. I basically have different modes I can go into, but most of the time I'm pretty quiet and introspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we started dating she was great! Awesome personality, very caring, loyal, etc. and would come to see me almost every weekend (we went to colleges right next to each other, about 40 minutes away). I did not have a car so I would also try to come out and see her with the resources I had, whether it be housemates, her picking me up, etc. the first 4-5 months were awesome! She would occasionally throw in a political jab for no reason as I am a moderate conservative (who does not like Trump) and she's an EXTREMELY progressive liberal feminist. We've had our arguments recently about her saying she wants me to move in with her once she graduates and move out to her home city. I've told her listen, I don't know about that quite yet, I need a stable job first and I need to evaluate the situation. I can't just quit and find something else in a week...

Are you kidding me?

Should I be doing something differently? She isn't always like this but some days she can honestly be a complete and utter bitch over any slight difference of opinion. She also goes through my phone (only when I'm with her) because if I say no, I'm not hiding anything (which I'm not) and she'll go, \"OH okay then let me see it if you aren't hiding anything then!\" Ahhhh... Okay, cool. Lose-Lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then she'll read all my group chats, texts that she wants to, and finds nothing of me talking shit about her or bad mouthing her.

I told her that I did not think any of these things were an issue but she's always asking me if I love her, if I think she's ugly, if I'm mad at her, etc. which leads me to believe she's a very insecure person.

My last one of the day was to drop off a purse my boyfriend's mom gave me to a coworker. I didn't like the purse, but it was a really nice one, so I wanted to give it to someone who'd like it instead of tossing it. My work parking lot is a shitshow, and well known in my town for being poorly designed. Mix that with all the new discount retailers that opened up there and the fact it's the holiday season, and the lot was an absolutely crowded mess.

I pull out to leave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main entrance/exit for the shopping center is a 3 way stop. Entrance traffic does not stop, but exiting traffic in all three ways do. Both the left turn and the straight stops were backed up a while, but I pulled right up to the stop on the right turn side. People going straight just kept going straight, not letting anyone else in. In California, the person to the far right would have the right of way at such a stop (after all incoming traffic). But, it's So Cal, everyone thinks they're the most important person in the world and that everyone else comes last. A lot of people in my suburb have a first come, first serve mentality when it comes to stop signs. Finally, some incoming traffic drives in with his left turn signal on, so the people going straight have to stop. Because this guy is turning left, the people waiting for the left turn can't quite go until he's cleared the intersection. This lead me to believe I was good to turn, so I started my right turn as soon as I see him start his left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat happens next is a loud honk, right behind me. I look in my review mirror and a car is right up my ass. I guess the lady turning left to the exit had started her left turn as the guy had started his, instead of waiting. So we both ended up turning at the same time! And of course, the light to get out of the shopping center takes forever and she's right behind me, glaring, the whole time. I know technically the rules of the road say she was in the wrong, but from a nonlegal perspective, am I suffering from the same mindset I described before?

She visits my city, which happens to be both our hometown, the weekend before her birthday. I was asked by one mf to get one of her gifts as planned by the bf and I was told that I would be reimbursed. It was sort of an expensive gift, not exorbitant but definitely over the budget one would spend for a friend's birthday gift. So we went shopping, stopped by a place for the gift and I asked her to pick the one she liked. She selects one, loves it and I think, fine maybe we should get this. We decide to grab a bite before buying it. And while we were at the restaurant, I receive a call from the mf asking me to abort the plan and that the bf wanted to get it himself. So I forgot about it and when we were done shopping she stopped at the gift shop again, took the one she had picked first and was just kinda admiring it. So this is where I know I screwed up. I went ahead and got it for her anyway. My reasoning being anyway the initial plan was to have me get it so it should be fine and if the bf doesn't want that, it can still be a gift from me. That blew up. I understand that he wanted to get it for her, but it's not such a gift that you can have only one of it.(think handbag, shoes, plush toy).

I know there are people that have had it way worse but to me the things he put my through are the main reasons for the MH issues I have today. He continually berated me, and gaslighted me to the extreme of I actually thought I was having delusions and I would have my phone on record everytime I thought he would do something to me.

I didn\u2019t think abt the fact that he had me all over his Insta back then, so I was like ok ig.\n\n(3) Then one day I noticed an emoji by her name on Snap I hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cMutual #1 bffs\u201d my bff of course being my bf.

I had a friend in elementary school, let's call her A, that was basically my best friend for a good two years. I'd transferred into the elementary in 2nd grade because my family had moved (we changed houses a fair bit cause my parents were good at gauging the housing market). I ended up staying there all through the rest of elementary.\n\nAnyway, early days of 2nd grade she introduced herself and we became pretty good friends. (We'd always go over to her house to play because at the time her family was a little better off than mine and could afford things like a new Wii and a big dollhouse and lots of toys.) So up until about early fourth grade, A was my best friend in the world. We'd play together after school (eventually at either of our houses cause my mom got a better job and we could afford nicer toys), have dinner at each other's houses, all the usual best friend kit stuff. \n\nBut for some reason, as we got a little older I become more stereotypically \"nerdy\" and not to mention I was a probably bit of a mess of a kid with unruly hair and the same 10 t-shirts all the time (I liked em, don't judge). A, however, started dressing nicer and even I think started wearing a little makeup to school (I wasn't allowed to touch makeup till I was 16, so I was pretty bad a recognizing it on people till like 7th-8th grade). \n\nOne day at recess, I went to find A to play something together cause that'd what we did, and she just starts asking me all these weird questions. I don't remember most of them, but one that always stands out in my mind is \"What's your favorite animal?\" I'm not good at picking favorites and thought she might like if we had the same favorite as her's was a tiger (plus I've always been a cat person) so I said tiger like her.\n\nA FLIPS OUT yelling at me that I can't have the same favorite animal as her because that means I'm copying her etc. etc. I remember crying as she was yelling at me and then never being able to talk to her again after that (I was lucky to find another couple of friends that were really sweet and one I still catch up with from time to time to this day) because she and her new friend group (all the classically popular girls) would always leave when I came around.\n\nSo yeah, you'd think that's it, dumb grudge from elementary school. But no, it gets kinda worse.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be placed in the 'accelerated learning' program or whatever (puzzles for smart kids) classes in 3rd grade, of which there were two sections each for 4th and 5th graders. A was in the other section in my grade, and I learn on the day we \"graduated\" that we both got into the same local magnet school (only one in the county, so there was no avoiding her). I remember actually getting to talk to her once after the ceremony, saying how it was great she got in. I also gave her one to the two Webkinz animals I'd managed to win from the lottery prizes that day as an olive branch of sorts I think.\n\nSIDENOTE: I loved Webkinz as a kid, cause I'm allergic to dogs and the one cat we had was super mean to everyone and we thought would probably kill any other pet we got (which proved true when she tried to kill our rescue kitten a few years later). I asked for one for every holiday/special event for a while. Birthday? Webkinz. Christmas? Webkinz. Special family vacation souvenir? Webkinz (and luckily that time a few postcards from Las Vegas cause my parents were smart enough to know I wasn't always going to have an expensive stuffed lizard). I ended up collecting a fair few of them from family gifts and such over the years, and it was A who introduced me to them so I thought she'd like it and we'd settle our differences.\n\nWell my, in hindsight, buying of her friendship lasted a good month and a half maybe. She glared at me in the halls less and wouldn't catch my gaze only to shoot me a nasty look and then ignore me as often. I found some new friends I'm fortunate enough to still know in college but A never changed. Our middle school and high school were in the same building and we both got back into the school for our last four years (high school classes were more varied so I saw her less).\n\nThe thing that irritates me is so many people tell me to forget about it. My parents don't think our breakup (and subsequent encounters) could've been that bad, and my friends who had projects/classes with her in high school said she was pretty cool and that I should've tried to hang out with her on occasion. And if they didn't suggest that they'd just kinda nod at my explanation and change the subject. But A has never stopped looking at me like she wants to rip my soul out and feed it to her dogs. She never stopped ignoring my polite nods in public or excuse me's when I squeeze past her in the hallway (there was one occasion where I think she might've mocked me for it at her locker before school with others, but I might just be overreacting there idk).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr A girl burned our friendship in elementary, ignored all my attempts at making peace, and proceeded to ignore me/glare at me just to make a point all through middle and high school.\n\nAm I the asshole for never wanting to forgive her even though everyone said she's probably fine and I should maybe try to hang out with her?", "output": "never wanting to forgive her", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

We made it clear that we were not going to be friends anymore or associate in any way.\n\nHowever, we still have to see each other all the time because we operate in the same professional spaces. He's a coach, I work at the front desk of his studio, so he has to pay me every time he has a lesson, and he and his girlfriend/partner have to sign in whenever I'm here. He has repeatedly expressed what I personally viewed as an overt lack of professionalism: when I would contact him with a professional request he wouldn't respond, he would interfere with my search for a dance partner, he would ignore procedures at the studio because it meant he would have to approach the front desk, he would wait until I was no longer on shift to pay, or if I didn't leave eventually and worked until closing then he would throw the money at me and walk out. If I was simply practicing in the studio and his practice bag was in my vicinity he wouldn't approach it until I got up to do something.\n\nTo be fair, he made it clear that he didn't want to be contacted, but sometimes my job necessitated it, and sometimes I just wanted the awkward tension to end.\n\nI sent him a text requesting more professionalism, he said my presence in his life was negative for his mental health. He blocked my number and then my Facebook page. I sent him this message: \"I don't quite know what I've done to warrant this, because we haven't spoken in months and I have sent you two (2) texts in that amount of time, but if you are as uncomfortable with my presence as you seem to be I can stop practicing as \\[dance studio name\\] and quit my job there.

Mine was the single, my roomate took the double.\n\nI found my sheets tossed in a basket with some other dirty laundry that didn't belong to me. Then I saw my bed occupied with some other sheets (this guy).\n\nWell, I didn't ask for permissions, it was my house, so I removed those sheets and placed mine. (And, after all in a fairness, no one told me that my bed has been occupied without my permission).\n\nI took this guy sheets, folded them as well and putted aside, in a cool and clean spot. (because, I'm not a barbarian). \n\nAfter this, things seem to be fine. \n\nP.S\u00b3 I'm a nurse student. At the time I was in a General Medicine Ward Internship, so I had to wake up at 6 AM, every morning. We had two little drawers, that we used to recharge our phones and other things.\n\nWell, this guy snored like a broken tractor and I have a very light sleep. So, I bought earplugs. \n\nThese earplugs helped me a lot with sleeping but I had a hard time hearing my alarm going off. It would take me some time to hear it and turning it off (on my phone).  \n\nOne morning, he decided that my alarm had to be taken out. So he turned it off and I woke up late that morning.\n\nLast straw. I returned home and faced the guy. I asked if he turned off my alarm, and he said yes. I went furious. I don't tolerate people invading my personal space. He replied with \"I found my bed without my sheets and clothes out of my drawer\". \n\nAnyways, I replied to him that that was my bed, my drawer and my house and if the princess wanted to sleep in the morning, he could've as well taken his things and changed house. \n\nHe said \"how so, I'm a guest, you're acting like this is only your place, shut up\" and things along those lines.\n\nMy roomate, his friend, didn't say a thing and this made me EVEN more furious. What the fuc*? \n\nSo I kicked him, with the help of the other roommate that was also bothered by this guy behavior (the roommate that helped me had his own room, and he wasn't the guy's friend).\n\nIn my country, there is a saying: a guest is like a fish. After 2 days, it stinks. \n\nTL:DR: \"princess guest\" was too bothered by my alarm, took possession of my bed without my permission and acted like it was normal, so I kicked him. \n\nThings worsened between me and the guy's friend roomate so eventually I moved to another house one month after, even if the guy wasn't there anymore.  \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?

Then, tbh i really didn\u2019t understand where i went wrong so i didnt feel apologetic either. She said she appreciates my honesty but she never thought it would come to this between us.\n\nA few days later, we spoke and i apologised. I opened up about my relationship (i had just broken up here) told her the details, i was crying and telling her about how i have changed since 2 years and i dont recognise myself anymore. In all honesty, i wasnt thinking about my actions towards her. And she goes \u2018yea i agree, i hate to bring this up rn but what you said that day was so out of line for you, i dont feel the same way about our friendship anymore\u2019 she also said something like \u2018dont cry now, we will have to become ok if you cry now\u2019 and i was honestly stunned and obviously couldnt cry even if i wanted to.\n\nAnyway i told her \u2018i cant blame everything on my toxic relationship, i realise i went wrong and i can only apologise at this point\u2019\n\nShe is also probably mad at me for taking so long to let go off this guy. Another thing that amused me was she going \u2018you call exbf like crazy when things go south but you can\u2019t do that for me\u2019 which felt like another jab at this point.\n\nIt\u2019s been a month now and we have tried to get to each other but the timing always seems off (long distance). I messaged her asking if i really screwed everything up and she replied saying no and that she will get back to me but we never really actually spoke.

Obviously that's something to take very seriously, but as far as I know, everything I did was consensual. I asked if he wanted to watch porn, and then when he got uncomfortable I put it away. Sure it may be an uncomfortable question, but that is why I asked. Communication, right? And when I realized that I wasn't really getting anything out of the hookup, I told him that I was tired, and he took it as a signal to leave. So that's also consent. Just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean that I didn't get his consent at every step, and same for him. He got my consent at every step. How was I supposed to know that it wasn't going to go well. The whole point of getting consent is to avoid giving people trauma. But how am I supposed to get consent if simply asking a question (while we're already having sex mind you!) triggers the trauma?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I let him talk about his opinions and feelings, and he did mine.

I\u2019ve never met X in person because she usually leaves before Friday. I got there around 9ish and my girlfriend had just showered (she tries to get in a morning run every other day to de-stress). So while we\u2019re packing up some of her stuff to leave, X starts saying some shit about cardio being stupid. Keep in mind, both my girlfriend and I were/are runners. But then she starts specifically targeting my girlfriend\u2019s BODY, saying that running will make her scrawnier and less attractive than she already is. My girlfriend, of course, just laughed it off. And not that it would matter, but my girlfriend\u2019s body fucking *rocks*. She\u2019s got nice toned legs and a cute little butt, not to mention that beautiful smile.\n\nAt that point hearing her do this shit in person sent me off the edge. I told her to fuck off and to focus on herself because my girlfriend wasn\u2019t the one who needed fitness advice. They both just looked at me and then X walked into the bathroom, slamming the door.

Sorry if its long. TLDR at bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time of this incident, I was about 23(m) and she was about 21. Lets call her Sarah. We worked together and she was dating another guy at the office, whom we shall call Tom. We became fast friends. She was into all the nerdy stuff I was into and we got along great. I was attracted to her, but because she had a BF I kept things purely platonic. Eventually she started some flirting. I felt uncomfortable because I knew her boyfriend and he was a really nice guy, and I didn't want to break up any relationship. But I play along in a joking way and try to keep it as friendly as possible.\n\nAfter a while she started to complain about issues with Tom. He was getting a bit jealous, and in her words ,'controlling'. I let her vent and tried to be as diplomatic as possible. I even defended him at times, saying that while some of the things she was doing may seem innocent to her, they might not seem that way to him. I told her to try and see things from his perspective, and just try to communicate better. She thanked me for being honest, and started saying things like \"you're such good listener\" and \"I wish I had a guy like you\". Fast forward a month and she calls me to say they broke up.  She comes over and cries on my shoulder. Now, I would be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me that was happy that they broke up. But again, Tom is a great guy and I do feel bad about the situation. Because of this, I make any moves. \n\nOver the next couple weeks, the flirting ramps up at work. We do hang out a couple of times, but I haven't made a move yet. There are two reasons for this. Being a nerd, at the time I was very inexperienced with this sort of thing and was nervous. Secondly, my Dad was suffering with cancer, so a lot of my time and thoughts were devoted to helping him and the family. About a week later, my Dad takes a turn for the worst and we rush him to the hospital. He eventually passes away that night. Over the next week, Sarah was now my shoulder to cry on. She even helps out with a couple things for the funeral, which was great. \n\nThe last few weeks been very clandestine at work. Not hiding all the flirting, but not advertising it either. But now a lot of my friends saw us together at the funnel. I later get warnings from a few people that she and Tom broke up because he thought she was cheating on him. Tom even came to me and told me his side of things. Tom is from a very traditional and conservative family, which also contributed to a lot of their issues. I do get a little suspicious, but having now heard both sides of things, I decide that he may just have been overly jealous after all. I spoke with him at length and he gave me his blessing about pursuing things with Sarah, as he was done with her. \n\nNext time Sarah and I hang out I thank her for everything, I end up making a move and I get shut down. She tells me that she has been seeing someone for a couple of weeks and she they are now official. WTF? All that flirting and she was seeing this other guy while being with me a my Dads funeral? I am obviously upset, but its not like we were together, so I don't get mad or anything. I do feel a little like a fish on a catch a release, but whatever. I don't see her for a few weeks. I wasn't ghosting her, just taking time off to help my Mom get my Dads affairs in order. After that we remain friends, and even start a small band together (it didn't go anywhere, but that had nothing to do with this).  \n\nOver the next six months she breaks up with this guy and starts dating another guy. We all have our suspicions that this new guy started during the last guy. Whatever, not my business. She is still a little flirty sometimes, which I find weird. But I just joke around, ignore anything too flirty and just change the subject. I then start to feel like she is taking advantage of me a little. Always asking for rides, watching her cat for her all the time when she goes out of town to visit family, I even lent her a little money (she did pay me back). But whenever we planned to do things as friends she ends up cancelling because she is too busy. But she still msgs me sometimes and ends up trying to flirt again. At this point I am pretty much done. I don't hate her or anything, just realise that the warnings my friends gave me about her were right and decide to just let the friendship die on its own.\n\nI then find out through the grapevine that she is banging one of my colleagues at work, who is over twice her age, and they have even done it in the office! I didn't believe it at first but one our mutual friends (that Sarah had a falling out with), showed me the messages to her from Sarah, talking about the whole thing. I debate telling her current BF, who I have only met a couple times. But I decide its not my business and leave it be.\n\nA few days later I get a message from her being a flirty again. I snapped. I didn't swear or call her a whore or anything, at least not directly. I just bluntly called her out on all the above shit. How I thought she was a terrible person for leading my on while I was dealing with my Dad passing, screwing over her last three boyfriends, and how it was gross to be having sex with a guy twice her age, in the office. I finished it all by saying that she doesn't owe me an explanation, I'm not her boyfriend, but I just don't want to be associated with her anymore. \n\nAfter that, she obviously avoided me at work. I got a new job a few months later, and that was that. She has attempted to make contact on facebook a couple times in the years since, but I have ghosted all her attempts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do sometimes feel bad about it. I mean, she did deserve it, but I heard from others that she was REALLY upset about it. I sometimes think I may have been too harsh. What do you guys think?

One was relatively well-polished, perhaps a bit too strong, but it was clear that the developers had tested him rather thoroughly and that he was in a state ready for release. The other... about as polished as 12-grit sandpaper.\n\nIt's hard to go into detail without explicitly revealing the game or the developer, but take my word for it when I say the character was a buggy, unbalanced mess. She had a move that could easily be abused in a way that could kill almost anyone from 0 damage after landing it just once, making it completely overpowered. At the same time, almost every other move she had was incredibly underpowered, making it so that players had no choice but to use the overpowered move if they didn't want to be completely crushed. (Note that this isn't just my opinion; just about everyone, including the people I was arguing against, agree that this character was a complete mess on release day.)\n\nThese were on top of numerous bugs, and even crashes related to the patch as a whole, one in particular making so that one of the most popular adapters for one of the most popular controllers used by the community just *outright stopped working*.\n\nShortly before the update, the lead developer had started a week-long trip to Hawaii with his family. He gave the very small group of beta testers for the game only ONE day to test the second character before she released, whereas the first had been available to them for a few months by that point. This being an indie game, *he* was the one who decided to organize things this way; not any publisher, not some board of directors, just this one guy. Some tired to argue that the developer worked hard and deserved a break, excusing the vacation's timing. While I agree that him taking a vacation is not an issue in of itself, he had total freedom to delay his product as long as he needed in order to finish it, but he chose to shove it out the door right before he'd be gone for a full week. This caused a some significant problems for the other dev team members, as they were unable to start working on a new patch without the lead developer, leaving the players with a buggy mess of a game for over a week.\n\nNow to his credit, the lead developer did get to work on fixing things as soon as he got home from Hawaii, but he was completely silent about the situation. Going through his posts on Twitter, Reddit, and the game's official Discord server, you'd think that the whole thing never happened. The community seemed to just forget the issue as well as soon as the new patch came out a few days later. I'll admit I didn't even think much about it at the time, but now I really wish I had.\n\nAfter taking a break from the game for a few months, I came back and realized the lead developer seemed to have mostly gotten away with this without any real consequences I could see. The character he released was in a much, much better place, and the controller issues had long since been fixed, but I couldn't help but feel that the fact that the developer didn't seem to have anything to say over his decisions didn't seem right to me. The game is not an early access/beta title, but it is still being actively developed, and has a bonus/deluxe edition and Nintendo Switch port coming out sometime next year. In my eyes, because the lead developer sold us unfinished content once and never seemed to show any sort of regret over it it, the community should be skeptical of those future releases and and any other games he makes further down the line, because he can get away with doing it again if people will pay for it anyway.  Now when I tried and tell people in the game's community all this, they defended him and claimed I was being unreasonable.\n\nParaphrased, the arguments they used against me included:\n\n* Because it's been 7 months now, it's no longer relevant to bring up.\n* The issues with the character have been fixed, so it doesn't matter if they were released in a bad state or not.\n* The lead developer has learned his lesson, and the proof is that he has since released another DLC character that was actually finished and much more polished than the previous one.\n* If the lead developer addressed it now, it'd just create a lot unnecessary drama, which will distract him from further improving the game.\n* I'm focusing far too much on the negative and should be grateful for the good things the developer has done.\n* The DLC was only $5, so it's not worth getting worked up over.\n\nAnd my respective counter arguments are:\n\n* The topic is still relevant to the game's continued development and upcoming re-releases. What happened 7 months ago with that highly anticipated character can happen again with the new editions/ports if we let the developers get away with it, and it'll be our money on the line.\n* We were still sold an incomplete character. Even if they're much more polished now, we didn't pay for a polished character six months from release. We paid for a complete character the day it was released.\n* Just because the lead developer released *one* good character after selling us a blatantly unfinished one doesn't mean he learned anything, especially since that particular character is licensed from a third party, so there was more reason to make them not complete garbage at launch in order to stay friendly with the original owners. Unless the developer himself explicitly says he won't do it again, we won't know whether or not he will.\n* If people react badly to what he did, he probably deserves it. It's not right to knowingly sell people a product that isn't finished while pretending that it is finished. And as far as distracting him, I'll bet money that any real conflict caused by an apology would go away after about two weeks at the longest. Honestly, by the end of it he even might get praise for admitting to a poor decision.\n* I focus on the negative because this wasn't just some simple mistake, but a very deliberate decision on the part of the lead developer. It's true that the developer has far more good on his track record than bad, but it was him who decided it was a good idea to release that character as they were and charge his fans for them. If he was willing to do that to people who are so incredibly loyal to him and his game, that gives plenty of reason to be skeptical of his business practices in the future.\n* It's not very expensive, sure, but $5 is still $5. Besides, there's still the moral issue of misleading your customers even if the cost is low. The character was presented as finished in the trailer they made for them, despite that not at all being the case. Regardless of the price, if you take someone's money and don't provide what you said you would, it's not right.\n\nIn the end the debate went nowhere and I was told to just drop it, but I can't but feel baffled by how much these people are defending this developer. I'm pretty sure a more well known studio would get roasted alive over something like this, but people just don't seem to care, or get genuinely upset by the idea of being critical of this developer. Are my arguments valid? Am I the asshole for thinking that we should criticize and be skeptical of the developer?", "output": "calling out an indie game developer for going on vacation while releasing and charging money for unfinished/unpolished content", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

I came out of the closet about two years ago in a pretty liberal country. Virtually everyone in my area accepted it.\n\nWhen I told my classmates that I like men, noone really had a problem with it except this one guy, who was really shocked. It was the prankster of the classroom and was into football, which made him behave a tad macho. He told me that he had difficulties with me being gay, but liked me as a person so he would try to get over it. I said I respected that, we made a lot of jokes about it, we talked to eachother sometimes and untill he changed class, we had regular contact.\n\nThis valentine there was an event at our school that made it possible to buy roses for people you liked. You could send them and write a little card attached to it that said who it was from and a reason why you sent it. I send some to a few friends and decided to send one to that guy too as a prank. I wrote my name on it and a little heart.\n\nI always used to joke with it a tad, but have told him many times that I could never be into him, so I thought it would be a good prank. He apparently didnt think so.\n\nWhen I was walking past them that day, his entire friend group was staring at me. I asked (already laughing on the inside): \"Did you like the rose?\"\nHe exclaimed \"So it was really you?!\" And I laughed loudly and walked away, signaling that it was a joke. I didnt see him again that day (school was ending at that time) and went home. The next day everybody in that clique was staring at me again. When I went away I heard someone whispering \"dirty faggot\". Some friends (who thought it was a hillarious joke) also said they heard them insulting me loudly in frond of a lot of pupils.\n\nI honestly don't care about the insults.

The local grocery store chain has always employed a few mentally challenged employees for getting carts, bagging groceries, etc. totally cool. Thanks for giving people jobs. For the last year or so thay have been hiring more and putting them as cashiers as well. It\u2019s to the point now where every cashier and bagger has challenges. Some of them just seem to have social issues but it\u2019s making it difficult as a customer. If I just have a simple order and everything goes smoothly then it\u2019s usually OK except for the bagging. They tend to not really understand how stuff should be bagged and my groceries sometimes end up mangled ( bread shouldn\u2019t go under the big bottle of shampoo, right?) I\u2019ve offered to bag but that seems to be upsetting for them at times and they just stand there and stare at me while I bag because they don\u2019t know what else to do. I stopped bringing my own cloth bags because they often don\u2019t know how to handle that and will put one or two items in my bags and then bag the rest in plastic. If I have any kind of issue or request for the cashier, they often can\u2019t handle it and need to call for the manager. This slows everything down and so I usually just won\u2019t say anything if my items ring up wrong because I just don\u2019t want to hassle anyone or hold up the line even more. As it is, it takes forever to get out of the store now. \nThese employees seem to be pretty young and maybe don\u2019t have all of the social stuff down. The conversation is often awkward and more than once I have walked up to an empty line and found the cashier scratching their ass or picking their nose and then they want to just jump right in and touch my groceries. I\u2019m sure that kind of atuff happens all the time but to see it happen is kind of weird. \nI kind of feel like an asshole for fussing about being inconvenienced because I am happy the store is giving them a job. I am not happy because I have seen how some of the \u201cnormal\u201d staff treats some of them. Once I saw a customer drop a container of fruit and the manager told one girl to go pick it up. No broom. So she just got down on her hands and knees and chased down blueberries. At the time I just didn\u2019t know how to handle that. Looking back, I see a bunch of different ways I could have stepped in and spoken up for the girl. I would do it very differently if I saw something like that. I once saw one of them trying to talk to a manager but he just kept saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it. Stop talking to me\u201d. From my perspective he seemed to be frustrated at having to try to manage the guy\u2019s behaviors. He was trying to work but was just being pestered and interupted. \nMy other issue is that the store is union. I know how much these staff members are paying out of their check and it\u2019s really not ok. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to manage any of this. I don\u2019t know how to approach a manager and ask why they have chosen this approach. I\u2019m sure they do not give a shit about losing me as a customer because they really are the only store around except Walmart. I don\u2019t know if there is any point to me explaining they are treating all of their employees unfairly and making it harder for customers. \n\nI feel like an asshole but IDK how to help the situation.

TLDR at bottom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was visiting my local tabletop/boardgame store in our town with my ex (we're still good friends - were together for 3 years, known eachother for 6+ and broken up almost 2 - 3 months now) because there was a MTG tournament and thought we'd drop by for a moment to say hello. \n\nImmediately as we walked in we got greeted by a lot of people we all know, and proceeded to sit next to some friends who were playing. One of our mutual friends was playing against R, my ex already knew R and is sort of friends with him (the kind of friend you see at lot at gatherings with other mutual friends). We started up a conversation during their match because it was nothing too serious and they can play very well while holding a conversation. \n\nR asked in a little bit of a condescending tone \"oh hey so RJ (ex), this is your girlfriend right?\". My ex and I looked at eachother and I said \"it's a long story\" and he filled in with \"we're exes now, but still good friends\". R immediately responded with \"oh that's even better for me, that means I have a chance!\" with the creepiest smile ever on his face. I laughed it of and tried to turn the conversation in a whole other direction. \n\nAfter only half a minute or so my ex and I switched over to another table to \"annoy\" other people during their match, we weren't planning on staying for longer than 10 minutes anyway, just having some smalltalk. My ex eventually held a conversation with someone for a little time (talking about the trip to england they're on now for a MTG tournament) and I just looked at the match from another table. R thought it was a good idea to (literally) corner me and start a conversation, I already had some creepy vibes from him but the way he talked to me was so rude. \n\nA little bit of information: I fucking HATE playing magic the gathering, I've tried it, didn't like it, I'm a sore loser, it's all on me but I really HATE playing this fucking game, but I do like watching in and people can talk about how much they love it to me and I will listen to you for HOURS!\n\nDuring the \"conversation\" between R and I, the only thing he said was \"oh hey do you wanna play MTG sometime? Can I show you how to play MTG sometime? Can I give you some MTG cards then? \\[these are not the cheap cards mind you\\] Don't you want to play a quick game right now then, it'll only be 20 minutes!? When are you visiting the store again? do you come here often\" I (kindly) declined everything and told him I don't visit that often, only when I need painting supplies for warhammer and started fidgeting a little with my phone. He just kept going on, eventually I wiggled my way closer to my ex because I feel very safe near him and hoped he'd join into this conversation. \n\nMy ex is quite oblivious to signals btw. I tried signalling him that I really wanted someone to join this conversation, and eventually my ex and his conversation partner joined into our conversation. When they did, R just left?!? When my ex and his conversation partner started talking without me again R came back with.....  A WHOLE FUCKING DECK OF MAGIC THE GATHERING CARDS ?!?! Appearantly he went to the counter of the store and got one for me, even though I told him that 1) I didn't like playing magic the gathering. Heck even my ex and his conversation partner told him so (they've tried several times already)! 2) wasn't interested in learning magic the gathering more 3) don't want another hobby/game to play!\n\nWhen the conversation (finally) ended after I told my ex to his face several times \"hey RJ I really want to go, we should get going, we have more stuff to do this afternoon, we're running a bit late\" we still ended up 2 or 3 more minutes in the store. I told my ex that I was really uncomfortable talking with R (I almost whispered while saying this to him) and that he should've picked up all the signals I was giving him. He told me he was sorry that he didn't pick up on any signal. I said it was okay, but told him that \"R is really sending me some nice guy vibes and it's creeping me out a lot, I really want to go home\" , not knowing I said this a little bit louder than intended.

Everyone involved with this story is over 20 years old. I work with a girl and her mother. Until today I had assumed we were friends. We usually talked in the mornings before work started. Today me and her was sitting in the break room talking and this nosy old harmless man was looking at us. I told her somebody was watching us and she said that she didn't care and that I was her friend. I sat with her and ate lunch and talked to her. This evening at second break I went to where she usually goes for break and waited on her. Apparently she had texted her mother and asked her to tell me that she had a boyfriend and that people were starting to ask if we were dating and could I stop spending so much time around her. She has never said anything to me about wanting time alone. If she had I would have accepted her request. While it's true that I had a slight crush on her I've never tried to be anything but friends with her because I know she's happy in her relationship and I respect that. I've never asked her out and I've never even tried to do anything romantic. All I wanted was a friend. What I take away from this is that she's embarrassed to be seen with me in public and only wants to know me when it's convenient for her.

We are 12000 km away from our hometown. We\u2019re located in Europe now and our parents are living on a tiny island, lost somewhere in the Indian Ocean. \nWe don\u2019t go home often because the plane ticket is quite expensive and the fly is very long (11-12h or so). \n\nYou gotta know that, at home, we would have very big family gathering (30-40 people) for Christmas Eve and NYE. They\u2019re so much fun because everyone\u2019s here feeling and sharing the Christmas Spirit. \n\nThis year, John moved out from home after a few years of struggling with health issues, forcing him to quit his studies and stay home for a while.

We may have got back home twice and we see our parents once once a year. \n\nNow, our parents are very worried for all of us. Parents will be parents. They just wish the best for us and wish we could spend more time together. So our dad booked a plane ticket for the holidays. Our mom couldn\u2019t come along for financial reasons. The plan was then to spend Christmas Eve and NYE together and our dad would go back home right after the first of January. \nBut... a few days ago, long after the booking, Jack and John informed us they will spend NYE with their respective friends.

For the uninitiated, sometimes the recipient of anal sex needs to prepare by cleaning out their rectum (not always necessary if you have the right diet for the record). He told me he was prepared, so we went at it, and one thing leads to another, and I look down and see his shit squirted out a little.

I (F) met this girl at college last semester. Let's call her Dani. I began talking to her because she started hanging out with some of my friends, after they met her at some student organization. Dani seemed nice, witty, smart, and was fun to hang out with. After a week or so, she added me on Facebook. After a month, Dani and I started opening up and talking about our hobbies, friends, and families both online and irl. One of the things that Dani got to know about me from our talks, was that my roommate and best friend, let's call him Vlad, lives with schizophrenia (this will be important later on). It seemed to me that she was an understanding, trustworthy person whom I could talk about a ton of things with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few weeks and she starts complimenting me (frequently) on my hair, eyes, freckles, etc. I tried to seem oblivious to her advances, given that I wasn't attracted to her, I only thought she was a cool person that I had just met, whom I could maybe become good friends with. I thought that if I didn't compliment her back, she would figure out that I wasn't interested in her in *that* way. Besides, she hadn't said directly that she was interested in me, so I couldn't really 'reject' her. The only sort of obvious hint was that she had asked me a couple of times if I thought Vlad was handsome. Both times I replied something along the lines of ''Yeah, why not''. \n\n\\[By then, Dani knew how important Vlad is in my life, as I had talked to her about taking him to the ER when he started feeling sick (he's asthmatic), or about a sleepless night trying to calm him down a bit after he saw some frightening shadow-like being coming towards him (visual hallucinations)\\]. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, Dani kept trying to make advances on me, without directly asking me out. I started to drop not-so-subtle hints that I was not interested in her (encouraging her to go on a date with that cute girl that she told me had asked her out) while also distancing myself from her, to avoid giving her mixed signals. I didn't ignore her messages nor ignored her in person. I just kept our conversations short and avoided talking about deeper subjects. \n\n**This is where Dani's odd behavior started.** One day, she hit me up on Facebook messenger with this message and a picture of a stuffed toy: ''*Hey, onesocktwobrains, guess what? I saw one of the campus counselors today, and I told her that I scream, shout at people and hit things out of nowhere, so she prescribed this toy to me, so I can bring it to class and hug it when I feel the need to scream or hit''.* It came across as strange to me that a therapist would prescribe stuffed toys for a 20 year-old to bring to college and hug, but ok. I just told Dani I hoped that this treatment plan would work well for her, without asking her for more details. The conversation ended there, but she pushed the topic whenever she could, and I just tried to brush it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, like a week or so later, Dani sends me a message that read: ''Are you free this Tuesday at 8? I need to talk to you about something. It's important''. I agreed to meet her at that time in campus, and turns out she wanted to talk to me about her feelings. Long story short, I told her I didn't feel the same way. She said that there were no hard feelings, and that she still wanted to keep talking to me. I made it clear that I think of her as a nice girl, but that I didn't want to be too close to her as friends either, that we were just too different (I didn't want to straight up tell her that I was a little creeped out and suspicious of her stuffed animal story).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the coming months after that, we've been messaging back and forth, intermittently.  To clarify, she was the one to always initiate contact, except when I wave and say hi if I see her around campus. I don't want to be rude to her, because I see her as a nice person, but I also don't want to feed any sense of closeness between her and me. We make small talk via Facebook, and she seems overly interested in Vlad and how he is doing. She says she wants to meet him and hang out with him and me at our apartment. Everything seems innocuous but I feel something is off. Dani always turns the conversation around and makes it gravitate towards her *therapy stuffed animal*, her frequent urge to scream and kick out of nowhere (although my friends who hang out with her much more than me, told me they've never witnessed one of these episodes). And suddenly she has started speaking about allegedly having hallucinations too, just like Vlad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after that (like two weeks ago), Dani got fed up with the college counselor because she wouldn't diagnose her with anything besides stress (her words). She eventually found a psychiatrist who diagnosed her with an anxiety disorder, and put her on meds. Since then, she makes sure to mention her meds every time she finds an opportunity. For example: I tell her that I'm stuck on traffic, and she replies that she can't drive because she's on meds. She sends me pictures of her prescription, to complain about how she can't find her meds at the pharmacy. I feel like she is pushing the topic on purpose, no matter how much I try to talk about something else. \n\n**Yesterday**, I got a bit too tired of it, and told her that I'm not qualified nor comfortable to give her advice about her condition, and that I would appreciate it if she stopped talking to me about her mental health, because I really don't think I can be of much help regarding that. She went bonkers and called me insensitive and selfish, among other things. She topped off her rant saying that she wasn't attracted to me anymore, as if that had something to do with the main issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, I haven't replied to her messages. I don't even know what to make of the whole situation, given that I don't quite believe her stories of her screaming and kicking episodes, nor the tale of the therapeutic stuffed animal. It's also a big coincidence that she began having visual hallucinations shortly after learning that Vlad had them. She says she has psychosis even though the meds she was prescribed are for anxiety. I have also spoken to her closest friend from college and explained the situation to her, and she told me that Dani has never spoken to her about having these issues. Why would she share sensible information with me about her mental health but not with her closest friend?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like an asshole for thinking she is faking mental illness in order to win my sympathy, but I'm starting to think this is the case. I really just want to ghost her without providing further explanation, because when I tried to explain how I felt with her oversharing, she just shifted the blame on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I feel like an asshole because I believe that a girl I met 4 months ago, who used to have a crush on me is faking mental illness to win my sympathy. My roommate and best friend has schizophrenia. I take care of him. After learning this, she started to make every conversation about her mental health issues, and I tried to explain to her that I can't help her with that, and that I would appreciate if she stopped talking to me about it. She called me selfish and insensitive.

The practices have been going well for months, until this one kid shows up.\n\nLet's call him Stu. Stu is a sophomore, and all of a sudden he wants to join the team. The first practice that he's there, he really just stands there and laughs, runs into people, kicks balls across the road, and tries to steal our training equipment by shoving it into his bag while giggling to himself.

One of my teammates tells me that this time he ate a bunch of edibles before practice so that he could mess with me and the other captain, who helped convince me to talk to him the previous time.

Apologies for poor grammar, still fuming.\n\nMy dad and I have a very poor relationship. He has this thing about weight and being thin.

Anyway, my dad has always called me fat. I remember one time, I was eight and in public with my thin as a pin niece and he kept making jokes about my weight, (i was thick set as a kid but never \u2018fat\u2019 or even overweight. I had a normal BMI since I was quite tall). He kept calling me chubby, fat and people kept turning round and looking at me and I started crying. So he said \u2018I\u2019ll buy you a chocolate bar, that will make you feel better, won\u2019t it fatso?\u2019 \n\nYup. \n\nHe disguised these kinds of comments behind the need to be healthy, emphasising the need to exercise etc but it always had that undercurrent of \u2018you are not good enough\u2019. He used to weigh me every day and make comments like, we need to improve this etc etc. \n\nAnyway, when I became a teenager, the thoughts came. I thought I wasn\u2019t good enough and my dad reaffirmed it every single day. I developed bulimia and anorexia for a eight year period.

Plus, most of us were nice people, and no matter how rude K was, we thought we'd be just as rude by unfriending her \n\nThe final straw was when she used two of her characters to hospitalize and traumatize two of mine\n\n\"But they're fictional characters\"\n\nYeah I know that but it isn't the point here.

We\u2019re both on our last year of college and we\u2019ve been together for 4 years, we were even about to get married but called it off for now because of money/college issues. Her college is out of the city she normally lives in (which is where I live as well) so it takes me 5 hours to get to her and 5 hours to get back each time I want to see her and unless it\u2019s the midterm/finals week I usually go to her place every weekend to stay for the weekend and return home. This semester of college, my schedule is a bit fucked up so my school starta at 8 in the morning on my mondays and ends at 7 in the afternoon at my fridays. This makes it so that I can only go to her on saturdays and return 1 day later on sundays. Which means I spend around 10 hours on the road in 48 hours to be with her for 24 hours every weekend. I\u2019m telling you this because these numbers are important.\n\nI never whine about this or resent her for this since she did the same things for me on our first year but we decided that it\u2019s better for me to go to her being because of me being male and all.\n\nAnyways back to the situation. This week our female cat got in hear for the first time, she lives with my gf as she was a present from me for her. Anyways she\u2019s in heat but also it turns out her fur is somehow full of lice as well even though she never leaves the house and we had her get a lice bath (or whatever it\u2019s called) from our veterenarian. I tell my gf to go back to them and get our cat shaved there and etc.\n\nShe gets the lice situation done with no problems on last saturday. But since Bubbles (our cat) is in heat she tells me that the cat is screaming and meowing like a maniac and she couldn\u2019t sleep the whole night. Cue the same thing happening on sunday as well. So it\u2019s monday now and she was able to sleep like a total of 8-9 hours when Bubbles was asleep as well.\n\nNow to the problem:\n\nI told her that I can come over on Monday and stay and look after Bubbles till Wednesday so she can get her sleep and relax a bit she says that it\u2019s not necessary and she can handle it.  I ask her again to make sure and she says you don\u2019t need to come over again. (Note that she\u2019s not doing this for me to not miss out on my lectures because my lessons and at 12 in the morning on mondays, my tuesdays are empty and my lectures start at 5 in the afternoon on wednesdays so I could go to her and back without missing anything) Ok, so I\u2019ll see her at saturday right? WRONG.\n\nToday at 2 PM she messages me asking if I could come over. Now, this is really fucky because I don\u2019t have a car and I use a ferry to go over the sea and then get on a bus to get to her, Next ferry is leaving at 4 PM and it takes me an hour and half (if I\u2019m lucky) to get to the ferry. I have 2 hours to take a shower, get ready to go to her, pack some clothes and make it to the ferry which is impossible. Next ferry is at 7 PM so I can make it to that one but what\u2019s the point then? I get on that ferry and I\u2019ll be at her place at 10 in the evening. I\u2019ll need to be back before 5 PM tomorrow so I\u2019ll be going over there to be there and look after Bubbles for 11 hours.\n\nI ask her why didn\u2019t she tell me to come over when I asked her and she says that she thought she could handle it and couldn\u2019t and says that she thought I could just come over to her and drop by (the fuck?). I\u2019m getting pissed now but not saying anything about it I ask her why she doesn\u2019t ask some of her female besties (that she always goes on and on about) to come over and look after Bubbles while she sleeps. Them coming from 10 mins away to help her out when she needs makes more sense than a guy coming over from 5 hours away right?

For context i (m 30s) have been friends with this woman (also in her 30s) for a long time. Both of us have had our difficulties but it came to a head a couple of years ago. In the interests of full disclosure our friendship had become sexual for a short period prior to this but we were able to end it satisfactorily without resentment (at least that is how it seemed at the time). Conversations via text since then would also support this. \nThe issue was that she has a habit of calling me at odd times (1am on a saturday night for example) and trying to offload her problems. Both of us work difficult stressful jobs where we come into contact with people at their worst. Both of us are tired and stressed. Her more so because she has children. She can be quite intrusive and insistent with these calls and i have learned not to pick up. \nI asked her for the first time over 2 years ago to stop doing this. I trusted her at the time as we had been friends for a long time. However when i started standing my ground she leaves abusive messages on my voicemail or sends abusive texts or texts telling me about her mental health issues. Over time i stopped trying to reason with her and have now just flat out asked her to leave me alone and blocked her number. Despite numerous times where she has said she won't contact me she continues to do so. For the most part i do not respond but on the very infrequent occasions when i do I have tried to keep level (no insults,  keeping it to the point and respecting both mine and her boundaries) because i get the sense that what she really wants is a fight and i have better things to do. I know i am not innocent here because i probably was in a cycle of this behavior with her when we were younger (i have my own mental health issues namely bpd traits and depression) and i identified to her that i am equally responsible for contributing to how our friendship has panned out. I have also been persistent when wanting to talk to people in the past but have learned it is best to let go when it is clear my attention is unwanted and generally err on the side of caution because i hate imposing on people. \n\nIn short am i being a heartless asshole for not wanting to go through the fight she seems to be demanding from me or repair this friendship or am i respecting myself and my boundaries by not responding to the abuse and text barrage?

I was relatively new to drinking, having only had my first alcoholic beverage 4 months previous, and only having drunk a handful of times since then. I'd never been seriously drunk. She was an experienced drinker who drank several times a week (because college I guess) She asked me to bring a bottle of tequila, limes and salt, which I got from another friend.\nI'd also recently had a breakup, like 2 months previous, with a girl that I'd swore up and down was my soulmate, having dated for 2 years up to that point. the ex was the only person I'd had sex with at the time. My friend, we'll call her Sara, had helped me get through it. We'd been friends for (I think) 7 years. It's hard to remember exactly how long because I have terrible memory for a lot of my childhood/adolescence. We'd always had a lot of fun together- we made each other laugh more than anyone else I've spent time with, and she helped me with a lot of personal problems. (We'd never considered a romantic or sexual relationship up to this point, though)\n\n\nWhen I first got there, Sara's friend, we'll call her Amanda, was also there, but wasn't going to drink. Sara and I did a couple shots while shooting the shit, talking about dumb stuff that people make small talk about. When Sara invited me, she said said she'd make dinner but when I got there she just wanted to start drinking. Amanda left after about an hour and we started watching New Girl on her couch. She wanted to do shots, so I did more with her. In the course of just 4 episodes+the time that Amanda was there, I personally had done 7 shots. I think she did 5. I'm a 200 pound guy and she's a 160 pound girl, just to give an idea of how drunk we were.\nIt had been a really long day for me, so I kinda leaned on her while we watched NG, and at some point I fell asleep. We had always been pretty comfortable with consensual touching like hugs and light cuddling etc (but nothing sexual)  so I don't feel this was inappropriate of me. I guess she kept watching New Girl, but I woke with my head on her lap and her hand in my pants. Being very drunk, I took this as a sign that she wanted to get frisky. So I sat up and we sloppily made out. Since her hands were all up in my business, I assumed that reciprocating would be okay, and clumsily tried to start fingering her. She grabbed my hand and pulled it away, but kept making out with me. I thought she was teasing me, as she was still playing with my bits, so I tried to do it again a few minutes later. She pulled my hand away again and kept laughing at me. I'm really confused at this point. Does she want to have sex with me or not? So I kept kissing her, and she kept kissing me. I should mention she was biting and sucking my neck, which left EIGHTTEEN different hickeys (yes, I counted the next day. I was absolutely humiliated at work). After a while, she says \"I can't have sex with you Jared\", so I stop kissing her, stumble over to another room, and fall asleep on the floor.\nThe next day, everything seemed fine when I woke up except I had the worst hangover I'd had up to that point or ever since, so I woke her up. she kicked me out as soon as she woke up. \nWe didn't talk for a long time. We had one short conversation a year later over text where everything seemed fine. But whenever I've seen her around, she gives me a nasty look then ignores me. I regret this event deeply- it ruined a strong friendship that I'd had for a long time. It's also ruined friendships with mutual friends that we had, one of which thinks I tried to rape Sara and won't even listen to my side of the story.AM I the asshole for trying to have sex with Sara?", "output": "trying to have sex with my female friend", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

Sometimes the fastest group (with correct answers) gets candy. \n\nIn my class are about 8 people I know and talk to maybe once a week in school. I definitely wouldn\u2019t call us friends but we do talk and joke around occasionally.  Anytime my teacher mentions something about group work or a group test, these people will look at me and say, \u201cUm _______ can sit over here!\u201d while pointing at a seat next to them and laughing.\n\nNow, I am happy to help people on stuff and I have given answers to these people but, some of the people expect me to cheat and give them all the answers all the time.\n\nNow for the real story:\n\nYesterday in math we were going over a new unit and, like always, I am one of the only ones who learns anything. \n\nBecause are class is one topic ahead, our teacher gave us a worksheet that she would count as extra credit for our unit test if we finished before the end of class. It was a pretty straight forward sheet and we had to do all the even problems 1-20. We had already gone over a couple during the lesson and we had about 30minutes of class left.\n\nI was sitting at my table with one other person (the rest of our group was absent).This guy I\u2019ll call Tom is known for being bad at school and generally not paying attention. On our last test he got 2/64 right.\n\nI was going through this worksheet and then two of Tom\u2019s friends came and sat at my table. Our class was really low on attendance and we are already a small class so I was the only \u201csmart person\u201d there at the time. \n\nThe first guy I\u2019ll call Dan is one of the people I occasionally talk to. He always tries my patience and never pays attention when I try to help him. The other guy I\u2019ll call Jake, is worse at math than Tom. He purposefully shouts out random answers thinking it\u2019s funny. He is in algebra 2 and algebra research.\n\nThe first thing these guys say is, \u201cHey, can you give us all the answers.\u201d \n\nI just kind of stare at them thinking how they have the audacity to ask that since they never pay attention and the teacher would know that if they had all the right answers, they were cheating. \n\nI asked them if they even tried and they said no. \n\nI told them to let me finish the problem I was on and then I would help them, not give them the answers. They start talking and being a bit rowdy. I asked them to stop and they just looked at me like I was being rude.\n\nAt this point, our teacher had said at least 4 times we are doing even, she had written it on the board and said to right it on the sheet. \n\nI was almost done when Jake says, \u201cAre we doing odd or even?\u201dMy response was basically that he can ask someone else or just pay attention next time. \n\nI am on the very last step when Jake starts to mutter stuff under his breath where he knows I can hear him. Saying things like \u201cI don\u2019t like rude people\u201d \u201cwhy you being such a b***ch\u201d \n\nI finished the problem while saying \u201cI don\u2019t like ignorant people who don\u2019t pay attention and expect to people to give them all the answers and cheat\u201d \n\nJake starts saying that he doesn\u2019t care if he learns. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter as long as I pass the test.\u201d \n\nThen I ask him how he\u2019s gonna do that if he didn\u2019t learn any of the material that\u2019s gonna be on the test. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Cheat, I guess.\u201d was his response.\nDan was laughing the whole time.\n\nI said, \u201cWell cheat off someone else cause I\u2019d rather not\u201d and moved onto the next problem.\n\nHe starts his muttering again and I just ignore him. \n\nDan says something along the lines of \u201cgreat, now we\u2019re gonna fail. No one else has the answers\u201d I don\u2019t know if he was saying it to me or Jake.\n\nI am working silently when Dan, Tom and Jake steal each other\u2019s papers. They are being more rowdy and I just go and sit at a table by myself. \n\nThe teacher yelled at them and all of them kept glancing angrily at me like I did something.\n\n\nThe whole situation was dumb and I don\u2019t think I owe it to them to sit there and deal with that.

We dated for a few years but our breakup last year was mutual. We both suffer from depression and that was the major catalyst in the end of our relationship although everything is still practically the same between except for the emotional stuff. He checks out of the conversation anytime it heads that way. \n\nAfter our break up, I moved back home about 1,000 miles away. We text a lot, and game a lot together when we have the free time. This week I've been laid up after a minor surgery and asked him to game with me since I was bored and unable to work for 5 days, or even walk around for that matter. Yesterday he said he would hop on in a bit but he had a stressful day so he was just relaxing. I chalked it up to just a long day at work and didn't think much of it.\n\n A few hours later he invited me to a game but he didn't actually want to do anything, he told me that his car had been towed earlier that day and he had been dealing with that  but didn't say much else. I got quiet and he asked if I was upset and I told him \"no\" but he could tell. I felt like a jerk because I had pestered him when he was dealing with other stuff but I just didn't know.  He apologized for inviting me for nothing and  he said that he might be back on later but I just logged out after he did and went to bed early. \n\nToday I texted him and apologized about my reaction the day before and he accepted my apology but he said that I had been hurtful towards him. I told him that I would just like a little more communication because I have no idea when he works or what's happening in his life. I had to ask his roommate to check in with him a couple weeks ago because he had been really depressed, anytime I asked how he was doing I just got \"eh\" as a response. This had gone on for over a week and I was worried and she had noticed it too.\n\nI expressed my concern about his depression and told him that he can't rely on weed all the time to fix things and ignoring his problems and shutting his friends out isn't going to do anything either.

I told him that I didn't want any commitments I just want him to talk to me. I feel like I start  up a lot of our conversations and all I tend to get from him is an \"lol\" or \"nice\" unless we're talking about a subject he  brings up. A lot of it feels really one sided.

The last year of those two years we were long distance (he dropped out of university and moved home) and his family weren't too keen on the whole long distance thing. By the end we were seeing each other 1 day a month. \n\nDuring our relationship he lied, stole money from me, always victimised himself, cheated on me ... when I called him out on it, his answer was 'I'm a 21 year old boy. If another girl gives me attention, I cant help it' \n\nI should of seen the warning signs ! But I'm kind of old fashioned and i like the idea of working at and fixing relationships when they go wrong. \n\nSo I was leaving University and our plan was for me to move up to live with him. It had got to 6 weeks before I was moving up. I saw him on the weekend and left on the Sunday... and on the Monday he calls to break up with me, saying things didnt feel the same.\n\nThis was devastating as suddenly I had no future stability ! It was strange but after being sad for 3 days, I realised I had gotten over him. \n\nCue 6 months later where I have fallen in love with B (his best friend). We would hang out a lot as best friends during mine and A's relationship cos we lived close and there was never a single sexual intent. \n\nIt hit me like a ten tonne truck when, after I became single and A broke up with me, that all these feelings would rush into me regarding B. We would continue hanging out as friends and my crush for B would grow and grow. Like the most organic love that I have ever felt.\n\nSo me and B fell deeper and deeper in love (honestly 4 years later and he is still the perfect man) and decided to be in a relationship. \n\nSo B had to ring A and explain what had happened. Obviously A did not take it well at all. I was travelling at the time and didnt get the full scoop... and didnt want to pry. \n\nSo a year later I contacted A saying things about extending an olive branch, and him telling me he went to therapy over the whole thing. And friendship between him and B was beyond repairing. \n\nFast forward another year, A keeps sending me this cryptic messages at 3am and 4am that dont make much sense. About him being unhappy. He asked me next time I'd be in London so he could talk about his life and stuff and I replied 'but I thought you didnt like me much ?? And he replied 'yea maybe I dont.' And then said he broke up with his current gf and I said 'ouch :(' and he snapped 'I dont need sympathy from you.'\n\n He even tried to call me twice but I didnt pick up. \n\nI ended all these messages by telling him harshly to leave me alone and delete my number and let me live my life. \n\nI mentioned it to a friend the other week and she laughed said I really screwed A over. \n\nBut from time to time I still think back and wish things ended differently...\n\nAm I the asshole ???", "output": "getting with my boyfriends best friend", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

Yesterday after work, I met a friend there to enjoy a casual round. There was a group of 12 younger dudes playing in foursomes. Totally normal. Then I see them teeing off from different areas than the actual tee box, elongating the holes (longest holes are 110 yards.) Ok, whatever. They kept a decent pace. However if a player didn't hit the green on their first shot, they would hit a second and third ball. When my friend and I got to the greens after them, they were peppered with ball marks. This happened on every green. Some folks like, 'oh its just a municipal course, i dont have to treat it nice.' I hate those people. \n\nI play at this course all the time and I would describe my game somewhere in between bad and fair.

After teeing off, we passed each other and I called out to them. \"Hey, are you guys on a team or something?\" I asked. I was thinking for several holes how to approach these guys.

Now first off I will say that I completely understand that a certain amount of noise from your neighbors is unavoidable and not their fault, I have lived in several apartments and I understand that people cannot help that the building makes noise when they walk around and do daily tasks.  However it has become imo, really excessive.  I have a large dog and so do they.   When my Landlord told me that two people were moving upstairs with the dog, she assured me it was part of their lease to put carpeting down for the dog and to please let her know if there were any issues.  Trying to be nice I texted them and let them know they are welcome to share the dog poop in outside as long as they do their part in taking it to the garbage etc.  Not one time have they taken it out or changed the bag, but they use it twice daily for his poop, I do it every week.  We share laundry, and when they do their laundry they tend to leave it in for a minimum of 48 hours until I text them that I have to do laundry as well.  I am the only one who ever cleans the back staircase that we share.  These are all issues I could easily ignore if not for the noise.  I am aware that I make noise, and my dog barks, and my TV is turned up too loud.  But most of the time my dog is barking at the ceiling wondering what the fuck is going on, and my TV is turned too loud to try to drown out the noise so that I can get some fucking sleep sometimes.  Let\u2019s get to the noise.  \n\nTheir dog has a certain habit of chewing a bone directly on the wood floor which makes my ceiling fans shake, my walls shake, is so unbearably loud that my dog will actually start to shake and cry because it sounds like somebody is breaking in through the ceiling.  I have texted them about this no less than four separate times, it continues to be a daily issue.  In addition to that they are constantly slamming furniture around, throwing things at the ground, throwing the ball across the apartment and there are 90 pound dog runs around jumping and playing for hours at a time( we have a fenced in yard).   They are yelling frequently.  I get about 2 to 3 hours of sleep a night before work and I\u2019m tired and crabby all the time. The noise is CONSTANT and way louder than somebody just walking around having a normal day.  I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m losing my fucking mind, so I finally texted my landlord and asked if I could and my lease early and move somewhere else.  She said no and asked me why I wanted to leave because she knows I love my apartment and I told her only about the noise and laundry issue.  I told her I would prefer for her to not contact them yet as I would like to trade a few more times for them to resolve it so we can remain friendly however she was angry because apparently it was part of their lease to put rugs down for their dog and they clearly have not so she insisted on emailing them And told me if I have any further issues with noise or the laundry to contact her again.  \n\nI now feel really awkward and I\u2019m nervous seeing these people around, and I do feel badly about contacting the landlord but at the same time my quality-of-life has gone down significantly since they moved in, I pay a lot of money to live here and I can\u2019t sleep or rest ever and I have to do my laundry on their schedule of when I can get them to fucking finish theirs. \n\nI feel like I was a dick, I am a 27-year-old person acting like a grandmother complaining about noise but I can\u2019t sleep and I\u2019m going nuts!  I feel like I pay to live here as well and I shouldn\u2019t have to be miserable all the time because they act like they live in their own house.

They were not been very 'close' because she lived with her mom in another state. When E was 14, her mother relinquished her parental rights but E didnt want to move here, so she moved with her grandmother (my MIL). Two years ago, E finished high school and she decided to move in with us so she could go to college here in the city.\n\nSix months living here, fiance and E started constant fights about teenage behaviour: rude, inconsiderate, disrespectful. I understand it's normal but the bad attitude has been escalating. I never try to act like her mom because I'm not but I constantly try to give her emotional support though she rarely accepts my help. The rules here are very clear and we have spoken with her a million times about unacceptable behaviour and she had been warned that the constant escalating 'will result in her not being welcome here anymore'.\n\nThis happened last week:\n\nFriday, fiance called E at 11:30 pm because she knows she needs to ask for permission before going out with friends, especially if she will be out until late or staying over at a friend's house. He sent her a message asking her whereabouts and so. She just said 'We'll talk tomorrow' then stopped responding. This was not the first time but other times she would apologize and recognize she did wrong.

That day she continously disrespected both me and my fiance with plain rude remarks. \n\nSunday: discussion regarding an important document she lost escalated quickly to her telling fiance to 'fuck off' and screaming, to which he (wrongly) reacted screaming louder and throwing her out of the house (she is not a minor).

I told him that he was the main asshole, but that's another story.\n\nE is back home, she apologized to her dad (and he apologized too) but I have not spoken to her because I work funny hours so I haven't seen her.

I was the resident crafter and I guess the money maker in the FC. The majority of the FC consisted of just about a light party's worth of people (4 or 5) our IRL friends mostly. I was a generous dude giving a few thousand or mil gil to  them when  they needed it since they didn't wanna level crafting, I didn't really care and still don't since it was forever ago. \nFast forward to Stormblood, the current expansion. We wanna to save our money for a shirogane house when they were released. They saved a bit but I was the majority of the money. We met another group, similar size and play times. Overall awesome dudes. We decided to merge our Free Companies into one so we could A.) Finally make a static, and B.) Merge our saved up money and buy the best mansion for sale. We would enjoy 6 to 9 months worth of playing together before we all mostly went offline for awhile due to content dry spell. During that time I stayed online a bit to craft and garden and such.\nDuring this time, my friend and I who founded the original FC went thru a huge fight. The fight was serious enough to break the entirety of our friendship making our side of the group a little wack. Without going into too much detail he just showed how shitty a person and friend he was. I kicked him from the FC without a second thought. This person has mooched off me for most of my life in game and out and I didn't want another second with to go by with him. Also informed our side of the group since the others went afk and couldn't really reach them. \nMy computer would later get fried and I was offline for a bit myself, about 2 months. After I returned I saw they returned and they also had inherited the FC Leader rank since it transfer after 35 days of being offline. It was tossed around a lot, no one seemed to care. After I return I inform them about what happened. Later they would reinvite my friend and put us in special powerless ranks till this was sorted out. I told them that this wasn't negotiable and that he was not allowed back. They didn't care about what I said and believed this was a load of needless drama. I stated my side and he stated his but they got two different stories. I told them simply I can't be with him any longer and also informed them he was even planning to keep the FC in it's entirety since they were offline for a long time. Which is true but from what I gather he had stated other things. I've invested a decent deal of no life time into the house and the money I spent on the house (20 mil). Basically the entire half of my groups payment for the house. I told them there isn't a middle ground, I can't be with him another second and don't plan on talking to him again. The current FC Leader and I fought over several things and was closer to my now ex friend. I told him since I spent a lot and crafted a lot for the house I felt it was fair to be reimbursed 20 mil which is still less than what I put in since I was the only crafter I did a lot for the house. He agreed and gave me 6 mil at the time and asked if I'd give them a couple days to sell things, I agreed. I also asked for several items I had in the house storage, they agreed to this also. \nFast forward to present, I never received a dime since the first payment and never got my items since I was kicked. I asked again and was told I was being an entitled asshole who is \"barking up the wrong tree for fake pixelmoney\" this was the last message I received about this matter.\n\nAm I the asshole despite them agreeing to it prior and even giving me, essentially, a down payment?", "output": "asking for 20 mil gil in FFXIV", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

That conflict doesn't jive for me. So she was getting more in the mood, but I refused to go there. We kept kissing and cuddling but no clothes came off. **I never told her she had reacted that way.

I have a phobia of snow, specifically icy roads. This is because of an incident last year when our neighbourhood froze over and my mum's car got stuck in the ice when she was lifting me and my brothers from school. Our car was 11 years old with worn down tires and my mum nearly broke the engine trying to get traction on the ice. She even crashed the car TWICE on this occasion. Once into another car and once into the pavement. She just couldn't get up the hill and we were stuck for an hour circling the neighbourhood trying to gain enough momentum to get up the hill to our house.\n\nBecause of this, whenever the weather forecast predicts temperatures below freezing, I get into a panic. I live in Ireland, where it rains 75% of the year, so the ground is always wet, which then freezes over. Also, the roads in my area are never salted since they are the suburbs and not the main roads.\n\n This day last week, we got stuck in another ice patch because some idiot tried to melt the ice on the roads by throwing hot water onto it. Which is the WORST way to melt ice. It's like trying to put out a fire with fire. It just creates more fire.\n\nI'm very open about my fear of snow and ice and always pray for none of it during the winter. My brothers mock me for this, calling me a 'fun sponge' and saying things like 'Only demons don't like snow. They constantly call me 'paranoid' as well. They want as much snow as possible so they can get a day off from school and are always praying for the roads and pavements to be caked in the white stuff. \n\nI think this is a terrible idea. Why? BECAUSE OUR SCHOOLS DON'T CLOSE IN COLD WEATHER. The last snow day we had was in 2015 which was 4 years ago. Last year, the snow was so bad that people living up in the Sperrin Mountains and other higher places couldn't even leave their homes because the roads were covered in so much ice and snow that their cars couldn't get through. My friend who lives up there missed all of her Mock GCSE Exams because she was snowed in. Not me though. I had to come in through the ice and snow and sit through three exams a day for a week because the school didn't want to close despite half of their teachers and countless students being unable to come to school.\n\nMy point of view is that if we do get enough snow to close most of the schools in Northern Ireland, my school and my brothers' wouldn't close because they are stubborn b\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. And then we would have to come to school anyway through the horribly icy roads with a car that can't handle it.

He broke up with his ex two years ago, after he cheated on her with me (it was a one time thing, not a long-term affair). I know, asshole move from both of us. It sucked, they split. After about a year, BF and I reconnected and decided to start over and date. We have been serious for almost a year now and are very happy. We don't live together, he has a apartment, that he shares with two roommates.\n\nOne of his roommates had planned a birthday party for this weekend. A couple of days ago she told my BF that she had invited his ex. He was pretty surprised, but apparently the roommate had kept it secret that she was still good friends with her (she is super non-confrontational and avoids uncomfortable talks if she can manage). She asked whether my BF had told her about our relationship and he said no. Neither had she (avoiding the unpleasant topic). So she told my boyfriend: \"Then make sure that \"dirtysecret\" doesn't show up, I don't want any drama.\"\n\nBF told her that he really didn't want to hang out with his ex to which she said:\" Well, you could sort it out beforehand.\" He said, he wasn't interested and he would rather stay away that night after which she joked: \"At least, you don't have to get a hotel, you can stay at \"dirtysecret\" 's house. \"\n\nEver since then me and my boyfriend have been feeling pretty uncomfortable around his apartment. It feels like our relationship is some dirty secret that she has to hide from our friends. As the person, BF once cheated with, I am admittedly pretty sensitive about that. I know, it was a shitty thing to do but I feel like we moved past that. I don't want to her to make me feel like some slut that hangs around her apartment makes her friends uncomfortable by my sheer presence.\n\nThis is why I want this secrecy to stop. She made it clear that she doesn't want to bring it up to the ex (I personally would absolutely tell my friend something like that so she doesn't get in a really awkward situation if she finds out some other way) . My BF is not in contact with her anymore and doesn't want to contact her just to tell her this. So I wanted to do it. I told my boyfriend and asked him to give me her number. He was hesitant at first but then said: \"Whatever, do what you think is right.\"\n\nSo I sent her a message yesterday. She just responded that she doesn't give a fuck and the conversation ended with that. But my boyfriend is upset now that I actually went through with it. He thinks, I should have waited until after the party. He fears, I might have ruined the evening for his roommate and now the mood in the apartment will be even worse. I just didn't want to be treated like the dirty secret any longer. I really don't think she will care after two years. The party isn't until tomorrow, so she has two days to get over it and neither me and my boyfriend will even be there to trigger any unpleasant situations. \n\nSo AITA?

My sister is, understandably, incredibly upset with my reaction and thinks I'm trying to be controlling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother has given my sister and her husband tens of thousands of dollars, despite being newly retired. This is from the time during their wedding, to the items in their current flat. For example, the air-conditioners in their flat all broke down due to it being an older flat and the AC units were a bit old. Now, in all the time that my sister and I lived together, she was not the sort who would ever go through a night without turning on the AC due to the humid climate we live in. But she suffered through it until my mother offered to foot the bill to renew all the ACs in their flat. This came up to some thousands. I offered this as an example to her when explaining that if she has trouble replacing the ACs, how could she afford to have a child? She insisted that she could have afforded to pay for the ACs herself, but since our mother offered, she took it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother is the sort of person whose money comes with emotional strings, i.e. when she and my sister have a fight, she would bring up all the times she has bailed my sister out financially. It's not a good thing, but that is who she is. So, we all know that my mother has been consistently giving her money e.g., buying for her stuff for their flat (e.g. a new bed, bathroom fixtures, etc), and also recently giving her a few thousands to settle her credit card debts. To me, these are all red flags that my sister is not in a financially stable place. She earns more than her husband, in fact, her husband can sort of be considered  low-income worker. However, my sister spends a considerable amount of her salary on her daily commute to work. She's been trying to get a transfer to a nearer location where she wouldn't have to spend 2 hours on public transport each direction from her home to her workplace, but it's not been working out so well. She takes a daily hitch ride both ways to save on time, but it all adds up to a major chunk of her salary. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all this in mind, I was not optimistic about her financial position.

I am not married but I am also saving up to buy my own home in a few years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs such, I told my sister that it might be wiser for her and her husband to wait a little while longer to get their footing and save a little bit more before having a kid.

She knew what I'd been through and was extremely supportive, we've helped eachother through a lot and have overall had a great marriage.\n\nThe other night we had a major blow-up. We've both been dealing with family issues and work related problems and had been short with eachother for a few days. We went out for a date which helped, and she asked to go the next night as well. I had already committed to helping a friend move that day, so I told her we could the day after. In retrospect I know this was wrong of me.\n\nFor the first time she start swearing at me, pushing chairs, telling me to leave.

What if we had a kid [my name], would it take letting them die too before you smarten up?\"\n\nI left that night and came back the next day. We talked and she was extremely apologetic and said she's just been stressed from work, but it came out that she had always been jealous of my first wife which she never mentioned before. I told her I wanted wasn't sure if I could be with her, she's been staying with her sister but begging me for a chance to work through it.\n\nFriends are mixed.

(Charming again, i know)\nI tried to explain to bf that those were just jokes, M said to sleep in his bed precisely because at parties i always sleep on the couch and not in his bed because i have a bf.  The drawing was because second friend drunkenly told he liked to smell ass. Why not.\n\nSo i have no feelings but friendship for these guys, nothing sketchy ever happened with them! And IF they wanted me they wouldn't say such things would they?

He doesn't make a lot and also has a dog, which made finding an affordable place difficult. I felt bad and let him stay with us which was a move that I now think I made too quickly. It was agreed that this would be temporary. He said he needed till the end of 2019. He said his goal was to move to BC and find a place of his own. I was hesitant to agree to this. My fiancee and I are getting married in August and well, I thought this would be kind of weird?? But I said okay, hoping this time would give him a chance to form a plan for himself. I've known him for a long time and I know he isn't the most responsible financially. He has a ton of credit card debt, adopted a dog when he probably shouldn't have and tends to spend frivolously when he probably should be saving etc etc etc...\n\nA little background info: We share a common group of friends. For the last 10 years since his parents kicked him out, he's been living in one of our basement's. His rent is $360/month utilities included. His rent has NEVER INCREASED. He got kicked out of one friends basement and then moved to another. Was kicked out again and now he is here with me. I never knew why but I think I might now...\n\nFast forward to today: Over the last few months, he's argued with me on a few things and it's really rubbed me the wrong way. When he moved in, he misunderstood me saying, \"we don't really use our basement\" to mean he gets to take over our entire basement. After he moved in, he had quite literally taken over the whole basement. His stuff was EVERYWHERE. He'd moved my stuff so his stuff without asking so that his stuff would fit. He installed stuff all over my walls in the basement without asking. He basically turned the basement into his own living room. When I told him he had to move as much of his stuff into the room he was renting, he threw a tantrum. He was so fixated on my comment and felt I was taking back something we had agreed upon (which we did not). To this day, he still has stuff all over my basement...\n\nHe says he enjoys hosting guests. Which would be fine if it were once in a while and maybe a few guests at a time. But this is not the case. Ex. One weekend, he showed up unannounced with 8 friends in tow, had 4 guests over the next day, then 6-7 guests the day after. He argued with me that he should be able to host guests 1-2x a week. And he often hosts 6+ guests at a time. This has been very hard for me as I'm a very busy person and coming home to a quiet place is my time to relax. \n\nHe likes to host D&amp;D. But they come over Sunday nights...and then they stay over late. Like 11pm. I work early in the mornings and often have to be AT work for 7:30 am. Getting him to agree to a 10:00 curfew was like pulling teeth. I had to compromise with 10:30...\n\nHis dog sheds a LOT. It's been so frustrating because I end up having to do the bulk of the cleaning. When I asked him to pitch in to sweep once a week. He told me I just have a really high standard of cleanliness...\n\nLast but not least, he smokes marijuana. A LOT of it. I don't have a problem with it, but I do have a problem with the smell.

We've come to some agreements and compromises, but it's his attitude about discussing things that has me really stressed out. It's been a few months and I honestly don't know if I can handle him being here for another whole year. **Long story short? I feel taken advantage of**. $360/month rent is unheard of. In my area for something similar would easily go for at least double that amount. I did it because we are friends and I hoped it would help him save up and make a plan for himself. But so far, he hasn't made ANY plans for himself and instead continues to spend frivolously, eating out, buying things he doesn't need...and of course all of the issues above. \n\nSo I told him this morning that I think he needs to re-consider his deadline and move out in August when my fiancee and I are getting married. We just want to move forward with married life and have kids after the wedding and I don't really want to deal with the stress of him being here. He threw another tantrum and flipped out on me.
