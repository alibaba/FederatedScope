The recently identified RV-C seems to be associated with asthma exacerbations and more severe disease, but results vary. We studied the prevalence and severity of infection with RV in an unselected birth cohort. Children with respiratory symptoms entered the symptomatic arm of the cohort and were compared with asymptomatic children. Severity of wheezing and other respiratory symptoms was registered. Respiratory viruses were evaluated using throat and nasopharyngeal swabs on first presentation and after recovery (wheezing children). RV genotyping was performed on RV-PCR positive samples. RV was the most prevalent respiratory virus and was found in 58/140 symptomatic children (41%), 24/96 (25%) control children and 19/74 (26%) wheezing symptomatic children after recovery (p <0.05) and did not differ between wheezing and non-wheezing symptomatic childrendrespectively, 42% (38/90) and 40% (20/50). RV-A was the most commonly detected species (40/68, 59%), followed by RV-C (22/68, 32%) and RV-B (6/68, 9%). RV-B was more frequently detected in asymptomatic children (5/6, p <0.05). There was no significant difference in the frequency of RV species between wheezing and non-wheezing symptomatic children. Children with RV mono-infection had more severe symptoms, but no association between RV species and severity of disease was seen. In an unselected birth cohort from the Netherlands with mild respiratory disease RV was the most prevalent respiratory virus. RV(-C) infection was not associated with more severe disease or wheezing.

The protein can be translocated to the cell surface and is partially associated with lipid rafts. Further biochemical characterization of the protein reveals that it is posttranslationally modified by palmitoylation on all three cysteine residues.

All CNS resident cell types are equipped with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to respond to viruses. The resulting activation of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines is dependent on the virus replication strategy, tropism and PRR distribution. Although IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induced antiviral mediators are essential to restrict initial viral spread, adaptive immunity promoted by chemokines, cytokines and metalloproteinases is equally critical in lowering viral burden. Recognition of viral antigen presented by MHC molecules is critical for T cell retention and function. Non lytic clearance mechanisms mediated by IFN-\u03b3 and antibodies prevail in providing protection. Targeted intervention can be achieved by PRR stimulation, chemokine-receptor blockade and immune modulation of T cell function. However, due to the extensive positive and negative feedback signaling cascades linking innate and adaptive immune responses, enhanced anti-viral functions will have to be counterbalanced to avoid pathology. \n Title: Neuroimmunology of central nervous system viral infections: the cells, molecules and mechanisms involved", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

This new CVTree web server provides a faster and stable research platform. Users can upload their own sequences to find their phylogenetic position among genomes selected from the server's inbuilt database. All sequence data used in a session may be downloaded as a compressed file. In addition to standard phylogenetic trees, users can also choose to output trees whose monophyletic branches are collapsed to various taxonomic levels.

At that time, London faced a public health crisis, with an inadequate scientific base in that the role of rats and their fleas in disease transmission was unknown. Nonetheless, this crisis was faced with good intentions by the top medical and political figures of the community. Daniel Defoe made an observation that could apply to many public health interventions then and today, \"This shutting up of houses was at first counted a very cruel and unchristian method\u2026 but it was a public good that justified a private mischief\" (1). Then, just as today, a complex relationship existed between the science of public health and the practice of public health and politics. We address the relationship between science, public health, and politics, with a particular emphasis on infectious diseases. Science, public health, and politics are not only compatible, but all three are necessary to improve the public's health. The progress of each area of public health is related to the strength of the other areas. The effect of politics in public health becomes dangerous when policy is dictated by ideology. Policy is also threatened when it is solely determined by science, devoid of considerations of social condition, culture, economics, and public will. When using the word \"politics,\" we refer not simply to partisan politics but to the broader set of policies and sys-tems.

A requirement for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was implied by our previous demonstration that cerulenin, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, impaired vaccinia virus production. Here we show that additional inhibitors of this pathway, TOFA and C75, reduce viral yield significantly, with partial rescue provided by exogenous palmitate, the pathway's endproduct. Palmitate's major role during infection is not for phospholipid synthesis or protein palmitoylation. Instead, the mitochondrial import and b-oxidation of palmitate are essential, as shown by the impact of etomoxir and trimetazidine, which target these two processes respectively. Moreover, the impact of these inhibitors is exacerbated in the absence of exogenous glucose, which is otherwise dispensable for infection. In contrast to glucose, glutamine is essential for productive viral infection, providing intermediates that sustain the TCA cycle (anaplerosis). Cumulatively, these data suggest that productive infection requires the mitochondrial b-oxidation of palmitate which drives the TCA cycle and energy production. Additionally, infection causes a significant rise in the cellular oxygen consumption rate (ATP synthesis) that is ablated by etomoxir. The biochemical progression of the vaccinia life cycle is not impaired in the presence of TOFA, C75, or etomoxir, although the levels of viral DNA and proteins synthesized are somewhat diminished. However, by reversibly arresting infections at the onset of morphogenesis, and then monitoring virus production after release of the block, we determined that virion assembly is highly sensitive to TOFA and C75. Electron microscopic analysis of cells released into C75 revealed fragmented aggregates of viroplasm which failed to be enclosed by developing virion membranes. Taken together, these data indicate that vaccinia infection, and in particular virion assembly, relies on the synthesis and mitochondrial import of fatty acids, where their b-oxidation drives robust ATP production.

Objectives: To investigate the detection rates of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in feces of healthy and diarrheic calves and to describe the usefulness of a pancoronavirus reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR (PanCoV-RT-PCR) assay to identify BCoV in samples of diarrheic calves. Animals: Two hundred and eighty-six calves <21 days. Calves with liquid or semiliquid feces, temperature >39.5\u00b0C, and inappetence were considered as cases, and those that had pasty or firm feces and normal physical examination were designated as controls. Methods: Prospective case-control study. A specific BCoV-RT-PCR assay was used to detect BCoV in fecal samples. Association between BCoV and health status was evaluated by exact and random effect logistic regression. Fecal (n = 28) and nasal (n = 8) samples from diarrheic calves were tested for the presence of BCoV by both the PanCoV-RT-PCR and a specific BCoV-RT-PCR assays. A Kappa coefficient test was used to assess the level of agreement of both assays. Results: BCoV was detected in 55% (157/286) of calves; 46% (66/143), and 64% (91/143) of healthy and diarrheic calves, respectively. Diarrheic calves had higher odds of BCoV presence than healthy calves (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.26 to 3.83, P = 0.004). A good agreement between PanCoV-RT-PCR and BCoV-RT-PCR to detect BCoV was identified (j = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.392 to 0.967; P < 0.001). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: BCoV was more likely to be detected in diarrheic than healthy calves.

The M protein is integrated into the viral envelope with three transmembrane domains flanked by a short amino-terminal ectodomain and a large carboxy-terminal endodomain. In this study, we showed co-purification of the M protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with actin. To understand the cellular factors that may be involved in virion assembly, budding and maturation processes, IBV M was used as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, resulting in the identification of b-actin as a potentially interacting partner. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy in mammalian cells, and mutation of amino acids A159 and K160 on the M protein abolished the interaction. Introduction of the A159-K160 mutation into an infectious IBV clone system blocks the infectivity of the clone, although viral RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription were actively detected. Disruption of actin filaments with cell-permeable agent cytochalasin D at early stages of the infection cycle led to the detection of viral protein synthesis in infected cells but not release of virus particles to the cultured media. However, the same treatment at late stages of the infection cycle did not affect the release of virus particles to the media, suggesting that disruption of the actin filaments might block virion assembly and budding, but not release of the virus particles.

HIV-1 can prompt metabolic encephalopathy with the addition of neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis. Recently, we reported that HIV-1 enhances the expression and secretion of bioactive cathepsin B in monocyte-derived macrophages, ultimately contributing to neuronal apoptosis. In this research, we request if microglia respond to HIV infection similarly by modifying the expression, secretion, neurotoxic potential of cathepsin B and the in vivo relevance of these findings. METHODS-HIV-ADA infected human primary microglia and CHME-5 were assessed for expression and activity of cathepsin B, its inhibitors, cystatins B and C, and neurotoxicity associated with these changes. Human primary neurons were exposed to supernatants from HIVinfected and uninfected microglia in the presence of cathepsin B inhibitors and apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL. Microglial expression of cathepsin B was validated in brain tissue from HIVE patients. microglia secreted significantly greater levels of cathepsin B, cystatin B, and cystatin C compared to uninfected cells. Increased apoptosis was observed in neurons exposed to supernatants from HIV-1 infected microglia at days 12 post-infection. The cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 and cathepsin B antibody prevented neuronal apoptosis. Increased microgliaderived cathepsin B, cystatin B, and cystatin C and caspase-3+ neurons were detected in HIVE brains compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS-Our results suggest that HIV-1-induced cathepsin B production in microglia contributes to neuronal apoptosis and may be an important factor in neuronal death associated with HIVE.

For microglia, brain tissue was supplemented with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ and then digested with 0.25% trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Trypsin was neutralized with fetal bovine serum (FBS), and the tissue was further dissociated to obtain single-cell suspensions. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma), supplemented with a mixture containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1,000 U of purified recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) per ml, penicillin and streptomycin (50 mg/ ml), and 100 mg/ml of neomycin. The mixed culture was maintained under 5% CO 2 for 7 days, and the medium was fully replaced to remove any cell debris. The microglia cells released with further incubation were collected and purified by preferential adhesion. Microglia were seeded as an adherent monolayer at a density of 3 \u00d7 10 6 cells/well in a 6well plate and floating cells were removed after 4h. For neurons, tissue in HBSS was digested with papain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Tissue was then dissociated to obtain single-cell suspensions by repeated pipetting with small bore fire polished glass Pasteur pipettes. Cells were plated in poly-D lysine-coated dishes at a density of ~ 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 cells/60mm dish in neurobasal media with B27 supplement, horse serum, and gentamicin (Invitrogen). After 2hr of attachment, media was replaced with fresh complete neurobasal media. Twenty-four hours later, cultures were replaced with neurobasal media without horse serum. Four days later, one fourth of the media was removed and replaced with neurobasal media supplemented with fluorodeoxyuridine (FDU) and uridine. Following FDU treatment, neurons were cultured in neurobasal medium with Glutamax and B27 supplement. One half volume of media was replaced every 48h.

However, due to its complex nature, the ways to achieve this important organisational capability in firms are still not clearly understood. Hence, the present study is an attempt to 'open this black box' and examine the relevant issues through a case study of M.com, one of the largest e-commerce firms in China. The findings of this case study emphasise that the ability to coordinate organisational interdependencies and asset orchestration according to the needs of business processes is challenging but necessary in order to achieve business integration in e-commerce firms. It is found that asset orchestration in a firm is contingent on the organisational interdependencies such that different interdependence types demand different coordination methods at the very least. It also shows the significant role of IT in asset orchestration and the coordination of organisational interdependencies during business integration.

Typical CBD symptoms include stunting due to internodal shortening, leaf rolling, intense green foliage, and yellowing veins. Atypical CBD symptoms, including reddish and withered leaves, were also observed in Brazilian cotton fields in 2007. Recently, a Polerovirus named Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) was shown to be associated with CBD. Results: To understand the distribution and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed 23 CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties originating from five of the six most important cotton-growing states, from 2004-2007. Here, we report on CLRDV diversity in plants with typical or atypical CBD symptoms by comparing viral coat protein, RNA polymerase (RdRp), and intergenic region genomic sequences. The virus had a widespread distribution with a low genetic diversity; however, three divergent isolates were associated with atypical CBD symptoms. These divergent isolates had a CLRDV-related coat protein but a distinct RdRp sequence, and probably arose from recombination events. Based on the taxonomic rules for the family Luteoviridae, we propose that these three isolates represent isolates of a new species in the genus Polerovirus. \n Title: Virology Journal Widespread distribution and a new recombinant species of Brazilian virus associated with cotton blue disease", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Disease severity was defined as need for mechanical ventilation. Results: Seventy-nine children < 5 years-old were included; 33(41.8%) received mechanical ventilation. No associations between virus type, viral load or co-detections and severity of disease were observed. Detection of IL-33 and sST2 in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) on admission were associated with higher risk for mechanical ventilation (RR = 2.89 and RR = 4.57, respectively). IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were higher on Day 5 in mechanically ventilated children. IL-6 NPA concentrations decreased from Day 1 to Day 5 in children who did not receive mechanical ventilation. Increase in sST2 NPA concentrations from Day 1 to Day 5 was associated with longer hospital length of stay (p < 0.01).

In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about bacterial and viral co-infections of the respiratory tract and focus on potential experimental models suitable for mimicking this disease. Transmission of IAV and pneumonia is mainly modeled by mouse infection. Few studies utilizing ferrets, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and non-human primates are also available.

To determine if the N protein is involved in the regulation of cellular signal transduction, an ELISA-based assay on transcription factors was used. We found that the amount of transcription factors binding to promoter sequences of c-Fos, ATF2, CREB-1, and FosB was increased by the expression of SARS-CoV N. Since these factors are related to AP-1 signal transduction pathway, we investigated whether the AP-1 pathway was activated by SARS-CoV N protein using the PathDetect system. The results demonstrated that the expression of N protein, not the membrane protein (M), activated AP-1 pathway. We also found that SARS-CoV N protein does not activate NF-jB pathway, demonstrating that activation of important cellular pathways by SAS-CoV N protein is selective.

Past studies have shown that the perceived susceptibility, the perceived severity of being afflicted with life-threatening diseases, and the perceived benefits of using a facemask are predictors of a person's use of a facemask. However, I argue that people wear a facemask not merely for infection prevention, and various sociocultural reasons have been motivating people to wear (and not wear) a facemask. Facemasks thus have sociocultural implications for people. Research on the sociocultural meanings of facemasks is scant, and even less is known on how the shifting sociocultural meanings of facemasks are related to the changing social environment, which, I argue, serve as remarkable underlying factors for people using (and not using) facemasks. As new infectious diseases such as avian influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have been emerging, threatening people's health worldwide, and because facemasks have been documented to have substantial efficacy in the prevention of infection transmission, understanding the sociocultural meanings of facemasks has significant implications for public health policymakers and health care providers in designing a socially and culturally responsive public health and infection control policy for the community. Methods: A qualitative research design involving the use of 40 individual, in-depth semistructured interviews and a phenomenological analysis approach were adopted. Results: The sociocultural meanings of the facemask have been undergoing constant change, from positive to negative, which resulted in the participants displaying hesitation in using a facemask in the post-SARS era. Because it represents a violation of societal ideologies and traditional Chinese cultural beliefs, the meanings of the facemask that had developed during the SARS outbreak failed to be sustained in the post-SARS era. Conclusion: The changes in meaning not only influenced the participants' perceptions of the facemask but also influenced their perceptions of people who use facemasks, which ultimately influenced their health behavior, preventing them from using facemasks in the post-SARS era. These findings have critical implications for designing a culturally responsive infection prevention and facemask usage policy in the future. \n Title: Qualitative study on the shifting sociocultural meanings of the facemask in Hong Kong since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak: implications for infection control in the post-SARS era", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Wildlife trade can facilitate zoonotic disease transmission and represents a threat to human health and economies in Asia, highlighted by the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak, where a Chinese wildlife market facilitated pathogen transmission. Additionally, wildlife trade poses a serious threat to biodiversity. Therefore, the combined impacts of Asian wildlife trade, sometimes termed bush meat trade, on public health and biodiversity need assessing. From 2010 to 2013, observational data were collected in Lao PDR from markets selling wildlife, including information on volume, form, species and price of wildlife; market biosafety and visitor origin. The potential for traded wildlife to host zoonotic diseases that pose a serious threat to human health was then evaluated at seven markets identified as having high volumes of trade. At the seven markets, during 21 observational surveys, 1,937 alive or fresh dead mammals (approximately 1,009 kg) were observed for sale, including mammals from 12 taxonomic families previously documented to be capable of hosting 36 zoonotic pathogens. In these seven markets, the combination of high wildlife volumes, high risk taxa for zoonoses and poor biosafety increases the potential for pathogen presence and transmission. To examine the potential conservation impact of trade in markets, we assessed the status of 33,752 animals observed during 375 visits to 93 markets, under the Lao PDR Wildlife and Aquatic Law. We observed 6,452 animals listed by Lao PDR as near extinct or threatened with extinction.

Therefore, a better understanding of the signals controlling migration of neutrophils as well as evaluating the role of these cells in demyelination is important to define cellular components that contribute to disease in MS patients. In this study, we examined the functional role of the chemokine CXCL1 in contributing to neuroinflammation and demyelination in EAE. Using transgenic mice in which expression of CXCL1 is under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter active within glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells, we have shown that sustained CXCL1 expression within the CNS increased the severity of clinical and histologic disease that was independent of an increase in the frequency of encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells. Rather, disease was associated with enhanced recruitment of CD11b + Ly6G + neutrophils into the spinal cord. Targeting neutrophils resulted in a reduction in demyelination arguing for a role for these cells in myelin damage.

Studies in yeast have identified >30 autophagy-related (ATG) proteins, many of which have identified mammalian orthologues. The canonical process of autophagy begins with initiation at the phagophore assembly site, mediated by the UNC51-like kinase (ULK) complex, which is composed of the ATG proteins ULK1/2, ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101. The ULK complex supports the activation of a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex consisting of Beclin 1 (ATG6), ATG14, and VPS34 to produce phosphatidylinositol triphosphate, which serves as the initial membrane mark recognized by early autophagic effector proteins. Phagophore membrane expansion is mediated by the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems involving multiple ATG proteins that ultimately lead to the lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), the mammalian orthologue of ATG8. LC3 is recognized by autophagy cargo receptors that promote the selective capture and engulfment of proteins, organelles, or microbes. The closed autophagosome is then trafficked to and fuses with the lysosome to degrade its cargo (Stolz et al., 2014; Kaur and Debnath, 2015) . ATG proteins traditionally have been studied for their roles in autophagosome formation and maturation, but we have recently begun to appreciate that they may have pleiotropic roles beyond autophagy (Bestebroer et al., 2013) . In this issue, through a comprehensive functional screen for ATG proteins in the control of viral replication, Mauthe et al. highlight the importance of the nontraditional functions of ATG proteins in the host viral response. In a tour-de-force study examining multiple models of viral infection, Mauthe et al. (2016) interrogated the individual roles of ATG proteins in the replication of herpes simplex virus type 1, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), vaccinia virus (VaV), semliki forest virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, and influenza A virus. The authors generated a curated siRNA library to target all ATG proteins individually as well as functionally redundant groups concurrently to evaluate how they promote the replication of these six viruses in two model cell lines (HeLa and U2OS). Indeed, their screen reveals that unconventional functions of ATG proteins are widespread; overall, 16 out of the 44 tested ATG proteins (36%) appear to have unconventional functions. Rarely does knockdown of individual ATG genes result in concordant effects on viral replication, arguing against a general role for autophagy. Moreover, the authors fail to identify any single ATG protein that regulates viral replication in all of the tested viruses; rather, specific ATG genes influenced the replication of each virus. Remarkably, most of the ATG proteins show a beneficial role for VaV replication in U2OS cells yet negatively impact VaV replication in HeLa cells. Overall, the effect of ATG loss of function on viral replication is exquisitely ATG specific, virus specific, and cell line specific. To demonstrate functions of ATG proteins independent of autophagy, the authors scrutinized ATG13 and FIP200, two ULK complex proteins that initiate formation of the autophagosome, and found that these proteins exert effects on viral replication distinct from the effects of other ULK complex components. Mauthe et al. (2016) demonstrate that depletion of ATG13 and FIP200 reduces the replication of two picornaviruses, encephalomyocarditis virus and coxsackievirus (CV) B3, whereas the other ULK complex components promote their replication. Furthermore, a principal upstream regulator of ULK complex activity, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, showed no changes in activity during infection or knockdown of the ULK complex components. Altogether, this evidence indicates that ATG13 and FIP200 act independently of the ULK complex to modify picornaviral replication outside the context of autophagy. Although the precise mechanism of this unconventional function of ATG13 and FIP200 remains to be elucidated, Mauthe et al. (2016) uncovered that these proteins control viral replication as opposed to viral entry or viral translation. However, ATG13 and FIP200 do not interact with any CV proteins or affect the morphology of CV replication structures, suggesting Autophagy-related (ATG) proteins have increasingly demonstrated functions other than cellular self-eating. In this issue, Mauthe et al. (2016. J. Cell Biol. http ://dx .doi .org /10 .1083 /jcb .201602046) conduct an unbiased RNA interference screen of the ATG proteome to reveal numerous noncanonical roles for ATG proteins during viral infection. \n Title: At the crossroads of autophagy and infection: Noncanonical roles for ATG proteins in viral replication", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Study objective: We compare the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of oral prednisolone/acetaminophen and oral indomethacin/acetaminophen combination therapy in the treatment of acute goutlike arthritis in patients presenting to an emergency department (ED).

Patients older than 17 years and presenting between February 1, 2003, and June 30, 2004, with a clinical diagnosis of goutlike arthritis were randomized to receive either oral prednisolone/acetaminophen or oral indomethacin/acetaminophen combination therapy. Primary outcome measures were pain scores, time to resolution of symptoms and signs, and adverse effects. Secondary outcome measures were the need for additional acetaminophen and relapse rate. Results: There were 90 patients randomized: 46 patients to the indomethacin group and 44 patients to the prednisolone group. Baseline characteristics, including pain scores, were similar in the 2 groups. Both treatment groups had a similar decrease in pain score in the ED. The mean rate of decrease in pain score with activity for indomethacin was \u03ea1.7\u03ee1.6 (SD) mm per day and for prednisolone was \u03ea2.9\u03ee2.0 (SD) mm per day (mean difference 1.2 mm/day; 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.0 mm/day; P\u03ed.0026). Although these differences were statistically significant, at no time was the difference in mean pain score greater than 13 mm. Therefore, it is unclear whether these differences are clinically significant. The mean total dose of acetaminophen consumed by the prednisolone group was significantly more than in the indomethacin group (mean 10.3 g, range 1 to 21 g versus mean 6.4 g, range 1 to 21 g). Twenty-nine patients in the indomethacin group and 12 patients in the prednisolone group experienced adverse effects (P\u03fd.05). The commonest adverse effects in the indomethacin group were nausea, indigestion, epigastric pain, dizziness, and gastrointestinal bleeding (N\u03ed5; 11%). None of the patients in the prednisolone group developed gastrointestinal bleeding. The relapse rate for both groups was similar. Conclusion: In the treatment of acute goutlike arthritis, oral prednisolone/acetaminophen combination is as effective as oral indomethacin/acetaminophen combination in relieving pain but is associated with fewer adverse effects. \n Title: Comparison of Oral Prednisolone/Paracetamol and Oral Indomethacin/Paracetamol Combination Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Goutlike Arthritis: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Trial", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Herein, we report three highly conserved G-quadruplex motifs (SE-PGQ -1, 2, and3) in genome of all the 412 strains of Salmonella enterica. Bioinformatics analysis inferred the presence of SE-PGQ-1 in the regulatory region of mgtA, presence of SE-PGQ-2 in the open reading frame of entA and presence of SE-PGQ-3 in the promoter region of malE and malK genes. The products of mgtA and entA are involved in transport and homeostasis of Mg 2+ and Fe 3+ ion and thereby required for bacterial survival in the presence of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species produced by the host macrophages, whereas, malK and malE genes are involved in transport of maltose sugar, that is one of the major carbon source in the gastrointestinal tract of human. The formation of stable intramolecular G-quadruplex structures by SE-PGQs was confirmed by employing CD, EMSA and NMR spectroscopy. Cellular studies revealed the inhibitory effect of 9-amino acridine on Salmonella enterica growth. Next, CD melting analysis demonstrated the stabilizing effect of 9-amino acridine on SE-PGQs. Further, polymerase inhibition and RT-qPCR assays emphasize the biological relevance of predicted G-quadruplex in the expression of PGQ possessing genes and demonstrate the G-quadruplexes as a potential drug target for the devolping novel therapeutics for combating Salmonella enterica infection. \n Title: G-quadruplex stabilization in the ions and maltose transporters inhibit Salmonella enterica growth and virulence", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Recent studies have focused on the potential antitumor activity of lycorine. In our previous study, we found that lycorine decrease the cell viability of leukemia HL-60 cells and multiple myeloma KM3 cells and induces cell apoptosis. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of lycorine on human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells has yet to be determined. Methods: Human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells K562 were treated with lycorine. Cell viability was monitored using the method of CCK-8. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity was detected by HDAC colorimetric assay, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of cell-cycle related proteins were identified using Western blot. Results: In the present study, we further revealed that lycorine can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells. Analysis of HDAC activity showed that lycroine decreases HDAC enzymatic activities in K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of HDAC activity has been associated with cell-cycle arrest and growth inhibition. We evaluated the cell cycle distribution after lycorine treatment and found that lycorine causes cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. To investigate the mechanism behind this cell cycle arrest, G1-related proteins were assayed by Western blot. After lycorine treatment, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expressions were inhibited and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation was reduced. Lycorine treatment also significantly upregulated the expression of p53 and its target gene product, p21. Conclusions: These results suggest that inhibition of HDAC activity is responsible for at least part of the induction of cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by lycorine and provide a mechanistic framework for further exploring the use of lycorine as a novel antitumor agent. \n Title: Lycorine induces cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase in K562 cells via HDAC inhibition", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Although their presence is a prerequisite for subsequent infections, viruses and bacteria may be present in the nasopharynx without causing any respiratory symptoms. The upper respiratory tract hosts a vast range of commensals and potential pathogenic bacteria, which form a complex microbial community. This community is assumed to be constantly subject to synergistic and competitive interspecies interactions. Disturbances in the equilibrium, for instance due to the acquisition of new bacteria or viruses, may lead to overgrowth and invasion. A better understanding of the dynamics between commensals and pathogens in the upper respiratory tract may provide better insight into the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases. Here we review the current knowledge regarding specific bacterial-bacterial and viral-bacterial interactions that occur in the upper respiratory niche, and discuss mechanisms by which these interactions might be mediated.

Editor: Akio Nakane The OmpA-like protein domain has been associated with peptidoglycan-binding proteins, and is often found in virulence factors of bacterial pathogens. The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila encodes for six proteins that contain the OmpA-like domain, among them the highly conserved uncharacterized protein we named CmpA. Here we set out to characterize the CmpA protein and determine its contribution to intracellular survival of L. pneumophila. Secondary structure analysis suggests that CmpA is an inner membrane protein with a peptidoglycan-binding domain at the C-teminus. A cmpA mutant was able to replicate normally in broth, but failed to compete with an isogenic wild-type strain in an intracellular growth competition assay. The cmpA mutant also displayed significant intracellular growth defects in both the protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii and in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, where uptake into the cells was also impaired. The cmpA phenotypes were completely restored upon expression of CmpA in trans.

Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the \"Severe\" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the \"Mild to Moderate\" group (p<0.001).

Methods: A behavioral observation study was undertaken involving medical students at the University of New South Wales. Their face-touching behavior was observed via videotape recording. Using standardized scoring sheets, the frequency of hand-to-face contacts with mucosal or nonmucosal areas was tallied and analyzed. Results: On average, each of the 26 observed students touched their face 23 times per hour. Of all face touches, 44% (1,024/2,346) involved contact with a mucous membrane, whereas 56% (1,322/2,346) of contacts involved nonmucosal areas. Of mucous membrane touches observed, 36% (372) involved the mouth, 31% (318) involved the nose, 27% (273) involved the eyes, and 6% (61) were a combination of these regions. Conclusion: Increasing medical students' awareness of their habituated face-touching behavior and improving their understanding of self-inoculation as a route of transmission may help to improve hand hygiene compliance. Hand hygiene programs aiming to improve compliance with before and after patient contact should include a message that mouth and nose touching is a common practice.

Isothermal amplification techniques, such as reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for the development of a rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) because they are quick, easy to perform and do not require complex, dedicated equipment and laboratory space. In this study, we assessed the ability of the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay to detect acute HIV infection as compared to a representative rapid antibody test and several FDA-approved laboratory-based assays. The HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay detected seroconverting individuals one to three weeks earlier than a rapid HIV antibody test and up to two weeks earlier than a lab-based antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combo enzyme immunoassay (EIA). RT-LAMP was not as sensitive as a labbased qualitative RNA assay, which could be attributed to the significantly smaller nucleic acid input volume. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of detecting acute HIV infection using the RT-LAMP assay.

About 80% of Ethiopians are dependent on agriculture and have direct contact with livestock or other domestic animals. As a result, the country is vulnerable to the spread of zoonotic diseases. As the first step of the country's engagement in the Global Health Security Agenda, a zoonotic disease prioritization workshop was held to identify significant zoonotic diseases of mutual concern for animal and human health agencies. Methods: A semi-quantitative tool developed by the US CDC was used for prioritization of zoonotic diseases. Workshop participants representing human, animal, and environmental health ministries were selected as core decision-making participants. Over 300 articles describing the zoonotic diseases considered at the workshop were reviewed for disease specific information on prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and DALYs for Ethiopia or the East Africa region. Committee members individually ranked the importance of each criterion to generate a final group weight for each criterion. Results: Forty-three zoonotic diseases were evaluated. Criteria selected in order of importance were: 1)severity of disease in humans, 2)proportion of human disease attributed to animal exposure, 3)burden of animal disease, 4)availability of interventions, and 5)existing inter-sectoral collaboration. Based on the results from the decision tree analysis and subsequent discussion, participants identified the following five priority zoonotic diseases: rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and echinococcosis. Discussion: Multi-sectoral collaborations strengthen disease surveillance system development in humans and animals, enhance laboratory capacity, and support implementation of prevention and control strategies. To facilitate this, the creation of a One Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit is recommended. Enhancement of public health and veterinary laboratories, joint outbreak and surveillance activities, and intersectoral linkages created to tackle the prioritized zoonotic diseases will undoubtedly prepare the country to effectively address newly emerging zoonotic diseases.

Since IFN response represents an early host defense event against viral infection and the fact that treatment with meliacine, a plant antiviral, ameliorate the severity of the herpetic infection in female mice infected intravaginally with HSV-2, we wanted to investigate whether the administration of meliacine to HSV-2 infected mice could altered the homoestasis of IFNs host response. For this purpose we studied the effect of the compound 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM), which is the responsible for meliacine antiviral action, on the HSV-2 inhibition exerted by IFN \u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 or their combination. We have found that like HSV-1, IFN-\u03b3 synergizes with IFN-\u03b1 to inhibit HSV-2 replication in Vero cells. While treatment with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 alone has weak antiviral action, HSV-2 plaque formation, viral replication and the onset of viral CPE in Vero cells are synergistically inhibited by interferon combination. In addition, CDM treatment contributes to protect cells from virus cytopathic effect and causes a strong inhibition of HSV-2 titer. Moreover, the presence of CDM for 2 h before IFN induction, during the 16 h induction period, only for 24 h after infection or during the complete IFN treatment period, reduces virus yields in an additive way without affecting IFN antiviral action. The results reported here indicated that the presence of CDM did not alter the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 or the synergism exerted by their combination. As a result we can envision that the administration of CDM in vivo could not affect the biological activity of IFNs, which are so important mediators of the innate resistance to HSV-2 infection. \n Title: Virology Journal The synergistic effect of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 against HSV-2 replication in Vero cells is not interfered by the plant antiviral 1-cinnamoyl-3, 11-dihydroxymeliacarpin", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

It is known to play an important role in innate immunity, inflammatory regulation, and female fertility. PTX3 is synthesized by specific cells, primarily in response to inflammatory signals. Among these various cells, neutrophils have a unique PTX3 production system. Neutrophils store PTX3 in neutrophil-specific granules and then the stored PTX3 is released and localizes in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Although certain NET components have been identified, such as histones and anti-microbial proteins, the detailed mechanisms by which NETs localize, as well as capture and kill microbes, have not been fully elucidated. PTX3 is a candidate diagnostic marker of infection and vascular damage. In severe infectious diseases such as sepsis, the circulating PTX3 concentration increases greatly (up to 100 ng/mL, i.e., up to 100-fold of the normal level). Even though it is clearly implied that PTX3 plays a protective role in sepsis and certain other disorders, the detailed mechanisms by which it does so remain unclear. A proteomic study of PTX3 ligands in septic patients revealed that PTX3 forms a complex with certain NET component proteins. This suggests a role for PTX3 in which it facilitates the efficiency of anti-microbial protein pathogen clearance by interacting with both pathogens and anti-microbial proteins. We discuss the possible relationships between PTX3 and NET component proteins in the host protection afforded by the innate immune response. The PTX3 complex has the potential to be a highly useful diagnostic marker of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. \n Title: Host-protective effect of circulating pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and complex formation with neutrophil extracellular traps", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Here, we show that similar to yeast, human IRE1a's ER-lumenal domain (hIRE1a LD) binds peptides with a characteristic amino acid bias. Peptides and unfolded proteins bind to hIRE1a LD's MHC-like groove and induce allosteric changes that lead to its oligomerization.

A look back at virus detection results in NPWs from the same 83 individuals at the time of tonsillectomy revealed that 73.5% (61/83) were positive for one or more viruses. The overall frequency of respiratory virus detection in posttonsillectomy NPWs was 58.8%.

Recently, Chase and collaborators showed that the interaction between vRNPs and the nuclear export machinery takes place in dense chromatin domains that allow IAV to \"snatch\" Crm1-RanGTP nuclear export complexes to the detriment of cellular substrates 13 . These results, together with other observations, highlight the involvement of host nuclear compartmentalization and chromatin territories in regulating nuclear traffic of IAV vRNPs [14] [15] [16] [17] . Several investigations, including ours, have revealed that IAV induce a strong remodeling of nuclear architecture with marked modifications of the nucleoli ultrastructure and compartments 3,17-20 . The nucleolus, known as the site of ribosome biogenesis, is also a sensor of cellular stresses and is involved in several cellular pathways, such as cell-cycle regulation or apoptosis 21-23 . Several DNA and RNA viruses, including cytoplasmic viruses are known to induce nucleolar alterations that contribute towards optimal infection 24-26 . In the context of IAV, their interplay with nucleolus and selective interactions with several nucleolar components appears to be decisive in the outcome of infection 17, 20 . Ozawa and colleagues demonstrated that dynamic nucleolar localization of NP is functionally significant by contributing to efficient viral replication and transcription 27 . Moreover, different studies have demonstrated a subtype dependent interaction between viral non-structural protein (NS1) and cellular nucleolin, suggesting a role of the nucleolar targeting functions of NS1 in IAV pathogenesis 28, 29 . Proteomics-based approaches have revealed changes in the nucleolar proteome of IAV infected cells 5,30 and identified several nucleolar components, such as nucleolin, nucleophosmin (B23) and ribosomal proteins, as putative interactants of reconstituted IAV vRNPs 7 . In addition, high-throughput RNAi approaches have highlighted the functional requirement of several of these nucleolar components in viral replication 31-33 . Nucleolin is a multifunctional protein that contributes extensively to DNA and RNA regulatory mechanisms, including ribosome biogenesis, chromatin remodeling, mRNA stability and translation, nuclear export of RNA and protein complexes, and microRNA processing 34, 35 . In this way, nucleolin takes part in several cellular functions, such as gene silencing, senescence, cell proliferation and growth 23,35-37 , and continuously shuttles between nucleolar/nuclear compartments and the cytoplasm up to the cell surface 38,39 . Moreover, through its ability to associate with diverse target RNAs, nucleolin is implicated in various pathological processes, particularly cancer and viral infection 40 . In this context, different functional interactions with nucleolin have been described for several DNA viruses, such as poliovirus 41 , adenovirus 42 , HSV 43, 44 or CMV 45, 46 , and several RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C and delta viruses 47,48 , coronavirus 49 , hPIV-3 50 , papillomavirus HPV9 51 , Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus 52 , HIV1 53 , noroviruses 54 and notably the infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) which belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, as IAV 55 . Altogether, these studies highlight nucleolin as a key interacting factor that is crucial, in some cases, for viral replication and involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic export of viral genome or viral egress 44 . At first, we observed the dynamic redistribution of nucleolin from a nucleolar to a very specific nuclear polarized pattern during infection. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the functional relationship between IAV and nucleolin with regards to the nuclear traffic of vRNPs and their targeting to the dense chromatin compartment 13 and in the context of the viral remodeling of the host nuclear architectures 17,20 . We first characterized NP, the main component of IAV vRNP, as co-localizing and interacting with endogenous nucleolin during infection. Moreover, using cell fractionation and RNAi approaches, we suggest that nucleolin contributes to efficient vRNP trafficking and viral replication. Based on our results, we propose nucleolin as an essential host factor for the chromatin targeting of the nucleocytoplasmic export complex of vRNPs during infection. \n Title: Nucleolin interacts with influenza A nucleoprotein and contributes to viral ribonucleoprotein complexes nuclear trafficking and efficient influenza viral replication OPEN", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

In total, we recovered approximately 700 clones, comprising over 300 independent genes. Sequence analyses revealed multiple hits for over 100 genes, including two encoding the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L.

It appears that the promise of the ''magic bullet'' has largely been realized. There are currently 22 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use and hundreds are in clinical trials for treatment of various diseases including cancers, immune disorders, and infections. The revenues from the top five therapeutic antibodies (Rituxan, Remicade, Herceptin, Humira, and Avastin) nearly doubled from $6.4 billion in 2004 to $11.7 billion in 2006. During the last several years major pharmaceutical companies raced to acquire antibody companies, with a recent example of MedImmune being purchased for $15.6 billion by AstraZeneca. These therapeutic and business successes reflect the major advances in antibody engineering which have resulted in the generation of safe, specific, high-affinity, and non-immunogenic antibodies during the last three decades. Currently, second and third generations of antibodies are under development, mostly to improve already existing antibody specificities. However, although the refinement of already known methodologies is certainly of great importance for potential clinical use, there are no conceptually new developments in the last decade comparable, for example, to the development of antibody libraries, phage display, domain antibodies (dAbs), and antibody humanization to name a few. A fundamental question is then whether there will be another change in the paradigm of research as happened 1-2 decades ago or the current trend of gradual improvement of already developed methodologies and therapeutic antibodies will continue. Although any prediction could prove incorrect, it appears that conceptually new methodologies are needed to overcome the fundamental problems of drug (antibody) resistance due to genetic or/and epigenetic alterations in cancer and chronic infections, as well as problems related to access to targets and complexity of biological systems. If new methodologies are not developed, it is likely that gradual saturation will occur in the pipeline of conceptually new antibody therapeutics. In this scenario we will witness an increase in combination of targets and antibodies, and further attempts to personalize targeted treatments by using appropriate biomarkers as well as to develop novel scaffolds with properties that are superior to those of the antibodies now in clinical use. \n Title: Chapter 1 Therapeutic Antibodies: Current State and Future Trends -Is a Paradigm Change Coming Soon?", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

One component of this selectivity is the MHV packaging signal (PS), an RNA structure found only in genomic RNA and not in subgenomic RNAs. It was previously shown that a major determinant of PS recognition is the second of the two RNA-binding domains of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. We have now found that PS recognition additionally depends upon a segment of the carboxy-terminal tail (domain N3) of the N protein. Since domain N3 is also the region of N protein that interacts with the membrane (M) protein, this finding suggests a mechanism by which selective genome packaging is accomplished, through the coupling of genome encapsidation to virion assembly. \n Title: A key role for the carboxy-terminal tail of the murine coronavirus nucleocapsid protein in coordination of genome packaging", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Despite this, patients with respiratory tract infections often receive antibiotics, fuelling the rise of antibiotic resistance.

Lozenges containing amylmetacresol and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA lozenges) as well as lozenges containing hexylresorcinol have been shown to provide effective symptomatic relief for sore throat. In this study, we investigated whether these lozenges also have virucidal effects in vitro against two viruses associated with respiratory tract infections, parainfluenza virus type 3 and cytomegalovirus. Both viruses were incubated with AMC/DCBA lozenge, placebo lozenge or the active ingredients (AMC/DCBA) as free substances, and parainfluenza virus type 3 was incubated with hexylresorcinol lozenge, placebo lozenge or hexylresorcinol as a free substance.

The virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) is responsible for both viral attachment and release. Similarity to bovine and porcine torovirus hemagglutinin-esterase (BToV HE, PToV HE), bovine coronavirus HE (BCoV HE) and influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (InfC HEF) proteins were exploited in a computational homology-based structure analysis of ISAV HE. The analysis resolved structural aspects of the protein and identified important features of relevance to ISAV HE activity. By recombinant expression and purification of secretory HE (recHE) proteins, receptorbinding and quantitative analyses of enzymatic activities displayed by ISAV HE molecules are presented for the first time. Three different recHE molecules were constructed: one representing a high virulent isolate, one a low virulent, while in the third a Ser 32 to Ala 32 amino acid substitution was introduced in the enzymatic catalytic site as inferred from the model. The three amino acid differences between the high and low virulent variants, of which two localized to the putative receptor-binding domain and one in the esterase domain, had no impact on receptor-binding or -release activities. In contrast, the Ser 32 amino acid substitution totally abolished enzymatic activity while receptor binding increased, as observed by agglutination of Atlantic salmon red blood cells. This demonstrates the essential role of a serine in the enzyme's catalytic site. In conclusion, structural analysis of ISAV HE in combination with selected recHE proteins gave insights into structure-function relationships and opens up for further studies aiming at dissecting molecular determinants of ISAV virulence. \n Title: Structural and functional analysis of the hemagglutinin-esterase of infectious salmon anaemia virus", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

We predicted that all C proteins have a similar organization: a variable, disordered N-terminus and a conserved, a-helical Cterminus. We confirmed this predicted organization by biophysically characterizing recombinant C proteins from Tupaia paramyxovirus (measles group) and human parainfluenza virus 1 (Sendai group). We also found that the C of the measles and Nipah groups have statistically significant sequence similarity, indicating a common origin. Although the C of the Sendai group lack sequence similarity with them, we speculate that they also have a common origin, given their similar genomic location and structural organization. Since C is dispensable for viral replication, unlike PNT, we hypothesize that C may have originated de novo by overprinting PNT in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae. Intriguingly, in measles virus and Nipah virus, PNT encodes STAT1-binding sites that overlap different regions of the C-terminus of C, indicating they have probably originated independently. This arrangement, in which the same genetic region encodes simultaneously a crucial functional motif (a STAT1-binding site) and a highly constrained region (the C-terminus of C), seems paradoxical, since it should severely reduce the ability of the virus to adapt. The fact that it originated twice suggests that it must be balanced by an evolutionary advantage, perhaps from reducing the size of the genetic region vulnerable to mutations.

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay (multiplex-PCR) can detect dozens of pathogens simultaneously, greatly reducing turnaround time (TAT) and improving detection sensitivity. But as a double-edged sword, due to the high sensitivity of PCR, the type of respiratory specimens is critical to diagnosis. In this work, we performed a head-to-head comparison to evaluate the multiplex-PCR yields between two samples, sputum and flocked oropharyngeal swabs (OPS). Methods: Eleven common respiratory pathogens were tested in hospitalized children< 13 years of age who met the criteria for lower respiratory tract infection by GeXP-based multiplex-PCR of paired OPS and sputum. Results: From January to June 2018, 440 children with paired OPS and sputum were tested. The positive rate was 84% (369/440) for OPS and 88% (386/440) for sputum (p = .007). The frequency of detection of HRV, RSV, Influenza A virus, HMPV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, M. pneumoniae, coronavirus, bocavirus and C. pneumoniae in sputa was higher than that of OPSs (all p < .001). Both types of specimens had similarly very good kappa values for most of pathogens, except for Mycoplasma pneumonia (\u03ba = 0.61) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (\u03ba = 0.24). Additionally, 79.3% (349/440) of cases showed consistent results between the two types of samples, and they were significantly younger than patients with inconsistent results (p = .002). Conclusions: Flocked oropharyngeal swabs and sputum performed similarly for the detection of common respiratory pathogens in hospitalized children by multiplex-PCR, except for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae.

Probability density functions for generation intervals have been an important input for epidemic models and epidemic data analysis. In this paper, we specify a general stochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval decreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from multiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person has multiple potential infectors, there is a \"race\" to infect him or her in which only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the mean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We call this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid transmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can be caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global prevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors. Using simulations, we illustrate both types of competition. Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of generation intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive number in an epidemic. This approach leads naturally to partial likelihoods for epidemic data that are very similar to those that arise in survival analysis, opening a promising avenue of methodological research in infectious disease epidemiology. \n Title: Generation interval contraction and epidemic data analysis", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

We produced VSV pseudotypes containing the prototypical X-31 (H3) HA, either alone or with strain-matched or mismatched N2 NAs. We performed single-particle fusion assays using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to compare hemifusion kinetics among these pairings. Results illustrate that matching pseudoparticles behaved very similarly to native virus. Pseudoparticles harboring mismatched HA-NA pairings fuse at significantly slower rates than native virus, and NA-lacking pseudoparticles exhibiting the slowest fusion rates. Relative viral membrane HA density of matching pseudoparticles was higher than in mismatching or NA-lacking pseudoparticles. An equivalent trend of HA expression level on cell membranes of HA/NA co-transfected cells was observed and intracellular trafficking of HA was affected by NA co-expression. Overall, we show that specific influenza HA-NA combinations can profoundly affect the critical role played by HA during entry, which may factor into viral fitness and the emergence of new pandemic influenza viruses. \n Title: Viral fusion efficacy of specific H3N2 influenza virus reassortant combinations at single-particle level", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The currently available therapies are ineffective in improving the quality of life and reducing mortality rates. There exists a clear unmet medical need to treat this disease, which necessitates the discovery of novel therapeutic targets/agents for safe and successful therapy. An altered renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated as a causative factor in the pathogenesis of PAH. Angiotensin II (Ang II), a key effector peptide of the RAS, can exert deleterious effects on the pulmonary vasculature resulting in vasoconstriction, proliferation, and inflammation, all of which contribute to PAH development. Recently, a new member of the RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was discovered. This enzyme functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system by metabolizing Ang II to a putative protective peptide, angiotensin-(1-7). ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the lung tissue and emerging evidence suggests a beneficial role for this enzyme against lung diseases.

We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment.

Lung transplant recipients are frequently exposed to respiratory viruses and are particularly at risk for severe complications.

At 2 and 4 weeks of age, 21 of 22 (96%) and 7 of 14 (50%) examined infected piglets were still viremic, whereas PRRSV could not be detected in the six infected piglets examined at 6 weeks of age. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the phenotypic composition of leukocytes in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 2-, 4-and 6-week-old infected piglets and age-matched uninfected controls. The key observation in the present study is that high levels of CD8 \u00fe cells constitute a dominant feature in peripheral blood and BALF of piglets surviving in utero infection with PRRSV. In BALF, the average high level of CD8 \u00fe cells in 2-week-old infected piglets (33:4 AE 12:6%) was followed by a decline to 7:3 AE 3:0 and 11:1 AE 3:0% at 4 and 6 weeks of age. BALF of control piglets contained 1:6 AE 0:9, 2:3 AE 1:8 and 1:9 AE 0:5% CD8 \u00fe cells, only. In peripheral blood, however, the average number of CD8 \u00fe cells remained at high levels in the infected piglets throughout the post-natal experimental period (2:8 AE 1:9, 2:9 AE 1:8 and 3:2 AE 1:7 \u00c2 10 6 CD8 \u00fe cells/ml at 2, 4 and 6 weeks, respectively). In the controls, the average levels of CD8 \u00fe cells were 0:9 AE 0:2, 1:9 AE 1:7 and 1:6 AE 0:5 \u00c2 10 6 /ml, respectively. Furthermore, the numbers of CD2 \u00fe , CD4 \u00fe CD8 \u00fe and SLA-classII \u00fe cells, respectively, in peripheral blood, together with the levels of CD2 \u00fe and CD3 \u00fe cells in BALF were increased in the infected piglets infected in utero compared to the uninfected controls.

The observed changes are characterised by high levels of CD8 \u00fe cells supporting an important role of these cells in PRRSV infection. The present results, however, do not support the existence of post-natal immunosuppression following in utero infection with PRRSV. # \n Title: In utero infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus modulates leukocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar fluid of surviving piglets", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The complex interplay between host, pathogen and environment creates a challenge for conserving species, communities and ecosystem functions, while mediating the many known ecological and socio-economic negative effects of disease. Despite the clear ecological and evolutionary contexts of host-pathogen dynamics, approaches to managing wildlife disease remain predominantly reactionary, focusing on surveillance and some attempts at eradication. A few exceptional studies have heeded recent calls for better integration of ecological concepts in the study and management of wildlife disease; however, evolutionary concepts remain underused. Applied evolution consists of four principles: evolutionary history, genetic and phenotypic variation, selection and eco-evolutionary dynamics. In this article, we first update a classical framework for understanding wildlife disease to integrate better these principles. Within this framework, we explore the evolutionary implications of environment-disease interactions. Subsequently, we synthesize areas where applied evolution can be employed in wildlife disease management. Finally, we discuss some future directions and challenges. Here, we underscore that despite some evolutionary principles currently playing an important role in our understanding of disease in wild animals, considerable opportunities remain for fostering the practice of evolutionarily enlightened wildlife disease management. \n Title: Applying evolutionary concepts to wildlife disease ecology and management", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

This step invariably occurs by Env positioning itself in the host membrane at the location of viral budding and being incorporated along with the host membrane into the viral particle. In some ways, this step of the viral life cycle would appear to be imprecise. There is no specific sequence in Env or in the retroviral structural protein, Gag, that is inherently required for the production of an infectious Env-containing particle. Additionally, Env-defective proviruses can efficiently produce infectious particles with any of a number of foreign retroviral Env glycoproteins or even glycoproteins from unrelated viral families, a process termed pseudotyping. However, mounting evidence suggests that Env incorporation is neither passive nor random. Rather, several redundant mechanisms appear to contribute to the carefully controlled process of Env acquisition, many of which are apparently used by a wide variety of enveloped viruses. This review presents and discusses the evidence for these different mechanisms contributing to incorporation. \n Title: Mechanisms for Env Glycoprotein Acquisition by Retroviruses", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

A copy of the transcription regulatory sequence for ORF6 (TRS6) was inserted between the N protein and 3\u2032-UTR to drive the transcription of the EGFP gene and yield a general purpose expression vector. Successful recovery of PRRSV was obtained using an RNA polymerase II promoter to drive transcription of the full-length virus genome, which was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The recombinant virus showed growth replication characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus in the infected cells. In addition, the recombinant virus stably expressed EGFP for at least 10 passages. EGFP expression was detected at approximately 10 h post infection by live-cell imaging to follow the virus spread in real time and the infection of neighbouring cells occurred predominantly through cell-to-cell-contact. Finally, the recombinant virus generated was found to be an excellent tool for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compound screening. The newly established reverse genetics system for PRRSV could be a useful tool not only to monitor virus spread and screen for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compounds, but also for fundamental research on the biology of the virus. \n Title: A novel porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vector system that stably expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein as a separate transcription unit", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

G2 recognizes a conserved epitope on the MERS-CoV S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and neutralizes MERS-CoV by interfering with binding to host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4). The findings are relevant for understanding the viral attachment mechanism and for the development of S1-NTD-based vaccines. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged into the human population in 2012 and has caused substantial morbidity and mortality. Potently neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein have been characterized, but much less is known about antibodies targeting non-RBD epitopes. Here, we report the structural and functional characterization of G2, a neutralizing antibody targeting the MERS-CoV S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD). Structures of G2 alone and in complex with the MERS-CoV S1-NTD define a site of vulnerability comprising two loops, each of which contain a residue mutated in G2-escape variants. Cell-surface binding studies and in vitro competition experiments demonstrate that G2 strongly disrupts the attachment of MERS-CoV S to its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), with the inhibition requiring the native trimeric S conformation. These results advance our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of coronaviruses and should facilitate the development of immunotherapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV. \n Title: The Author(s)", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

In the face of these complex issues, risk assessments supported by quantitative information would facilitate evidence-based decision making. We propose a conceptual model for disease transmission risk analysis, inclusive of these multiple other facets. To quantify several processes included in this conceptual model we conducted questionnaire surveys with wildlife consumers and vendors in semi-urban centers in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, Laos) and direct observations of consumer behaviors.

These interactions have hindered the ability to distinguish the relative contributions of neutrophils, Th1 and Th17 cell-derived effector molecules from secondary mediators to tissue damage and morbidity. Methods: Encephalitis induced by a gliatropic murine coronavirus was used as a model to assess the direct contributions of neutrophils, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 to virus-induced mortality. CNS inflammatory conditions were selectively manipulated by adoptive transfer of virus-primed wild-type (WT) or IFN-\u03b3 deficient (GKO) memory CD4 + T cells into infected SCID mice, coupled with antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion and cytokine blockade. Results: Transfer of GKO memory CD4 + T cells into infected SCID mice induced rapid mortality compared to recipients of WT memory CD4 + T cells, despite similar virus control and demyelination. In contrast to recipients of WT CD4 + T cells, extensive neutrophil infiltration and IL-17 expression within the CNS in recipients of GKO CD4 + T cells provided a model to directly assess their contribution(s) to disease. Recipients of WT CD4 + T cells depleted of IFN-\u03b3 did not express IL-17 and were spared from mortality despite abundant CNS neutrophil infiltration, indicating that mortality was not mediated by excessive CNS neutrophil accumulation. By contrast, IL-17 depletion rescued recipients of GKO CD4 + T cells from rapid mortality without diminishing neutrophils or reducing GM-CSF, associated with pathogenic Th17 cells in CNS autoimmune models. Furthermore, co-transfer of WT and GKO CD4 + T cells prolonged survival in an IFN-\u03b3 dependent manner, although IL-17 transcription was not reduced. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that IL-17 mediates detrimental clinical consequences in an IFN-\u03b3-deprived environment, independent of extensive neutrophil accumulation or GM-CSF upregulation. The results also suggest that IFN-\u03b3 overrides the detrimental IL-17 effector responses via a mechanism downstream of transcriptional regulation. \n Title: IFN-\u03b3 protects from lethal IL-17 mediated viral encephalomyelitis independent of neutrophils", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Producing rhinovirus (RV) inocula from nasal secretions has required prolonged observation of the virus donor to exclude extraneous pathogens. We produced a RV-A16 inoculum using reverse genetics and determined the dose necessary to cause moderate colds in seronegative volunteers. Methods. The consensus sequence of RV-A16 from a previous inoculum was cloned, and inoculum virus was produced using reverse genetics techniques. After safety testing, volunteers were inoculated with either RV-A16 (n = 26) or placebo (n = 10), Jackson cold scores were recorded, and nasal secretions were tested for shedding of RV-A16 ribonucleic acid. Results. The reverse genetics process produced infectious virus that was neutralized by specific antisera and had a mutation rate similar to conventional virus growth techniques. The 1000 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) dose produced moderate colds in most individuals with effects similar to that of a previously tested conventional RV-A16 inoculum. Conclusions. Reverse genetics techniques produced a RV-A16 inoculum that can cause clinical colds in seronegative volunteers, and they also serve as a stable source of virus for laboratory use.

A combined analysis of these results with a meta-analysis of two other large-scale RNAi screening data sets in PI3K mutant cancer cell lines converged on ribosomal protein translation and proteasomal protein degradation as critical nononcogene dependencies for PI3K-driven tumors.

Our previous study demonstrated that nsp1 induces RNA modification near the 59-end of a reporter mRNA having a short 59 untranslated region and RNA cleavage in the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) region of a dicistronic RNA template, but not in those IRES elements from hepatitis C or cricket paralysis viruses. By using primarily cellfree, in vitro translation systems, the present study revealed that the nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage mainly near the 59 untranslated region of capped mRNA templates. Experiments using dicistronic mRNAs carrying different IRESes showed that nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage within the ribosome loading region of type I and type II picornavirus IRES elements, but not that of classical swine fever virus IRES, which is characterized as a hepatitis C virus-like IRES. The nsp1-induced RNA cleavage of template mRNAs exhibited no apparent preference for a specific nucleotide sequence at the RNA cleavage sites. Remarkably, SCoV mRNAs, which have a 59 cap structure and 39 poly A tail like those of typical host mRNAs, were not susceptible to nsp1-mediated RNA cleavage and importantly, the presence of the 59-end leader sequence protected the SCoV mRNAs from nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. The escape of viral mRNAs from nsp1-induced RNA cleavage may be an important strategy by which the virus circumvents the action of nsp1 leading to the efficient accumulation of viral mRNAs and viral proteins during infection.

At 48 h post transfection, the culture medium was harvested and inoculated into 10-dayold specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs to replicate the rescued virus. This strategy was chosen to facilitate the rescue procedure and to ensure that the recombinant rYN virus will not require any cell culture adaptations. After only one in ovo passage, the recombinant YN virus (rYN) was successfully recovered and confirmed to possess the introduced silent marker mutation in its genome. Biological characteristics of rYN such as the EID 50 , TCID 50 , replication in ovo, and replication kinetcs in vitro were tested and all were similar to its parental strain YN. Our findings demonstrate the successful construction of highly-pathogenic QX-type IBV using a modified rescue procedure, allowing for future studies of the molecular biology and pathogenicity of IBV field strains. \n Title: Successful establishment of a reverse genetic system for QX-type infectious bronchitis virus and technical improvement of the rescue procedure", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Metapneumovirus fusion (F) protein mediates the fusion of host cells with the virus membrane for infection. Trypsin-and/or low pH-induced membrane fusion is a strain-dependent phenomenon for hMPV. Here, we demonstrated that three subtypes of aMPV (aMPV/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C) F proteins promoted cell-cell fusion in the absence of trypsin. Indeed, in the presence of trypsin, only aMPV/C F protein fusogenicity was enhanced. Mutagenesis of the amino acids at position 100 and/or 101, located at a putative cleavage region in aMPV F proteins, revealed that the trypsin-mediated fusogenicity of aMPV F proteins is regulated by the residues at positions 100 and 101. Moreover, we demonstrated that aMPV/A and aMPV/B F proteins mediated cell-cell fusion independent of low pH, whereas the aMPV/C F protein did not. Mutagenesis of the residue at position 294 in the aMPV/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C F proteins showed that 294G played a critical role in F protein-mediated fusion under low pH conditions.

Since macrophages act as the important defense line against invading pathogens in host innate immunity, we investigated the function and innate immune responses of chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after ALV-J infection in this study. Our results indicated that ALV-J was stably maintained in MDM cells but that the viral growth rate was significantly lower than that in DF-1 cells. We also found that ALV-J infection significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production, but had no effect on MDM phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, infection with ALV-J rapidly promoted the expression levels of Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx) (3 h, 6 h), ISG12 (6 h), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) (3 h, 12 h) at an early infection stage, whereas it sharply decreased the expression of Mx (24 h, 36 h), ISG12 (36 h), and made little change on IL-1\u03b2 (24 h, 36 h) production at a late infection stage in MDM cells. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) had sharply increased in infected MDM cells from 3 to 36 h post infection (hpi) of ALV-J. And, the protein level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was dramatically decreased at 36 hpi in MDM cells infected with ALV-J. These results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in host innate immune attack and ALV-J immune escape. \n Title: ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06 induces innate immune responses in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

To determine the localization of virus-specific RNA, serial sections of brains from infected and uninfected mice were annealed with a %-labeled antisense RNA probe and analyzed by film autoradiography. In the mice with acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA was present in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and thalamus. Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain.

In the United States, more than 3,00,000 patients are admitted and about 20,000 die from acute pancreatitis per year. In Taiwan, the incidence rate of acute pancreatitis is 0.03% and the mortality rate among severe acute pancreatitis is 16.3%. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the global budgeting system on health service utilization, health care expenditures, and quality of care among patients with acute pancreatitis in Taiwan. Materials and methods: The National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) was used for analysis. Data on patients with acute pancreatitis diagnosed during the period 2000 and 2001 were used as baseline data, and data from 2004 and 2005 were used as post-intervention data. The length of stay (LOS), diagnostic costs, drug cost, therapy costs, total costs, risk of readmission within 14 days, and risk of revisiting the emergency department (ED) within 3 days of discharge before and after implementation of the global budgeting system were compared and analyzed. Results: Data on 2810 patients with acute pancreatitis were analyzed in this study. There was a significant difference in mean LOS before and after introduction of the global budget system (7.34 \u00b1 0.22 days and 7.82 \u00b1 0.22 days, respectively; P < .001)). The mean total costs before and after implementation of the global budget system were Taiwan dollars (NT$) 28,290.66 \u00b1 1576.32 and NT$ 42,341.83 \u00b1 2285.23, respectively.

Chemical conjugation of PMO to arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides (CPP) such as (R-Ahx-R) 4 (with Ahx standing for 6-aminohexanoic acid) leads to sequencespecific splicing correction in the absence of endosomolytic agents in cell culture at variance with most conventional CPPs. Importantly, (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugates are effective in mouse models of various viral infections and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Unfortunately, active doses in some applications might be close to cytotoxic ones thus presenting challenge for systemic administration of the conjugates in those clinical settings. Structureactivity relationship studies have thus been undertaken to unravel CPP structural features important for the efficient nuclear delivery of the conjugated PMO and limiting steps in their internalization pathway. Affinity for heparin (taken as a model heparan sulfate), hydrophobicity, cellular uptake, intracellular distribution and splicing correction have been monitored. Spacing between the charges, hydrophobicity of the linker between the Arg-groups and Arg-stereochemistry influence splicing correction efficiency. A significant correlation between splicing correction efficiency, affinity for heparin and ability to destabilize model synthetic vesicles has been observed but no correlation with cellular uptake has been found. Efforts will have to focus on endosomal escape since it appears to remain the limiting factor for the delivery of these splice-redirecting ON analogs. \n Title: Delivery of steric block morpholino oligomers by (R-X-R) 4 peptides: structure-activity studies", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

However, the diagnosis of human coronavirus infections is not carried out routinely, primarily because the isolation and propagation of these viruses in tissue culture is difficult and time consuming. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of recombinant, bacterial expressed proteins in the serodiagnosis of coronavirus infections. Two proteins were examined: the human coronavirus 229E nucleocapsid protein (N), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pUR and the coronavirus 229E surface glycoprotein (S), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector PROS. The recombinant proteins were used as antigens in Western blot (WB) assays to detect the 229E-specific IgG antibodies and the results were compared with a standard serological method, indirect immunofluorescence. Serum samples of 51 paediatric patients, suffering from acute respiratory illness, and 10 adults, voluntarily infected with human coronavirus, were tested. The semm samples of the adult group had coronavims-specific IgG antibodies in both test systems. In contrast, only 8/51 sera of the paediatric group were positive for coronavirus-specific IgG by both WB and IF and 20/51 sera were positive by WB, but not by IF. The overall incidence of human coronavims infections in the paediatric age group was 55% evaluated by WB analysis and 16% evaluated by IF.

Zika virus can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus, thus leading to birth defects including more than microcephaly. It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika, but unfortunately no vaccine or medicine is available so far. Zika NS2B-NS3pro is essential for its replication and thus represents an attractive target for drug discovery/design. Here we characterized conformation, Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes by both experiments and MD simulations. The results unveil the unique properties of Zika NS2B-NS3pro which are very different from Dengue one. Particularly, CD and NMR studies indicate that unlike Dengue, the C-terminal region of Zika NS2B with a significant sequence variation is highly disordered in the open conformation. Indeed, MD simulations reveal that up to 100 ns, the Dengue NS2B C-terminus constantly has close contacts with its NS3pro domain. By a sharp contrast, the Zika NS2B C-terminus loses the contacts with its NS3pro domain after 10 ns, further forming a short \u03b2-sheet characteristic of the closed conformation at 30 ns. Furthermore, we found that a small molecule, previously identified as an active site inhibitor for other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro, inhibited Zika NS2B-NS3pro potently in an allosteric manner. Our study provides the first insight into the dynamics of Zika NS2B-NS3pro and further deciphers that it is susceptible to allosteric inhibition, which thus bears critical implications for the future development of therapeutic allosteric inhibitors. author/funder.

In the present study, mouse LB cells were treated with various concentrations of interferon (IFN) and/or BFA overnight and infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) after removal of IFN and BFA. Doses of BFA which neither inhibit the metabolism of the cell nor the infectivity of EMCV, decreased the IFN-induced antiviral activity against EMCV as demonstrated by virus titer from supernatants. Since 2-5A synthetase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) have been suggested to be involved in the antiviral action of IFN against EMCV, their activities were investigated in LB cells after BFA treatment. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed a decrease (2-3-fold) in the mRNA of 2'-5' oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase after BFA treatment.

Here, we study spatial organization of DNA synthesis during multiround transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV) using pulse-labeling with ethynyl nucleotides and cycloaddition of azide fluorophores. We report a hitherto unknown and unexpected outcome of virus-host interaction. Consistent with the current understanding of the single-step growth cycle, HSV suppresses host DNA synthesis and promotes viral DNA synthesis in spatially segregated compartments within the cell. In striking contrast, during progressive rounds of infection initiated at a single cell, we observe that infection induces a clear and pronounced stimulation of cellular DNA replication in remote uninfected cells. This induced DNA synthesis was observed in hundreds of uninfected cells at the extended border, outside the perimeter of the progressing infection. Moreover, using pulse-chase analysis, we show that this activation is maintained, resulting in a propagating wave of host DNA synthesis continually in ad- vance of infection. As the virus reaches and infects these activated cells, host DNA synthesis is then shut off and replaced with virus DNA synthesis. Using nonpropagating viruses or conditioned medium, we demonstrate a paracrine effector of uninfected cell DNA synthesis in remote cells continually in advance of infection. These findings have significant implications, likely with broad applicability, for our understanding of the ways in which virus infection manipulates cell processes not only in the infected cell itself but also now in remote uninfected cells, as well as of mechanisms governing host DNA synthesis.

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to (Coronavirus) CoV epidemics. Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs. Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets. In this study, we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins (PPIA, PPIB, PPIH, PPIG, FKBP1A, FKBP1B) as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). These molecules modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation. Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2, compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases. Conversely, inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera, including SARS-CoV, human CoV-229E and -NL-63, feline CoV, as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus. Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CspA might serve as broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable against emerging CoVs as well as ubiquitous pathogens of humans and livestock.

In the present study, a thermoanalytical approach previously developed for quantifying trace levels of polymorphic impurity (form II metastable nuclei) in commercial salmeterol xinafoate powders has been successfully applied with slight modifications to ribavirin, an antiviral drug exhibiting roughly similar polymorph-dependent crystallization kinetics in melts to that of salmeterol xinafoate. Essentially, the approach involved modeling of the crystallization kinetics of both tested and reference drug materials in melts using the Avrami-Erofe'ev (AE) rate expression, derivation of a mathematical equation for relating the AE kinetic constant to the composition of reference polymorph mixtures, and the use of this derived equation (in the form of a calibration curve) to calculate the impurity contents of the tested samples from their computed AE constants. For ribavirin, modification of the latter equation by incorporation of an empirical exponent was found necessary to account for the compositiondependent changes in crystallization kinetics of the reference mixtures. Such modification has made possible the determination of polymorphic impurity content of as low as 0.004% (w/w) in ribavirin samples induced by different forms of grinding treatment. \n Title: An improved thermoanalytical approach to quantifying trace levels of polymorphic impurity in drug powders", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

We have shown previously that spinal application of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors induces strong antihyperalgesic effect during inflammatory pain. In this study we observed low level of DPP4 mRNA in the rat spinal dorsal horn in physiological conditions, which did not change significantly either in carrageenan-induced inflammatory or partial nerve ligation-generated neuropathic states. In na\u00efve animals, microglia and astrocytes expressed DPP4 protein with one and two orders of magnitude higher than neurons, respectively. DPP4 significantly increased in astrocytes during inflammation and in microglia in neuropathy. Intrathecal application of two DPP4 inhibitors tripeptide isoleucin-prolin-isoleucin (IPI) and the antidiabetic drug vildagliptin resulted in robust opioid-dependent antihyperalgesic effect during inflammation, and milder but significant opioid-independent antihyperalgesic action in the neuropathic model. The opioid-mediated antihyperalgesic effect of IPI was exclusively related to mu-opioid receptors, while vildagliptin affected mainly delta-receptor activity, although mu-and kappa-receptors were also involved. None of the inhibitors influenced allodynia. Our results suggest pathology and glia-type specific changes of DPP4 activity in the spinal cord, which contribute to the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia and interact with endogenous opioid systems. DPP4 is a type II integral transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on many cell types, but appears also in soluble form in body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid 1 . As a serine protease, DPP4 cleaves dipeptides from oligopeptides and proteins containing proline/alanine in the penultimate position. DPP4 processes neuropeptides, hormones, cytokines and chemokines leading to their biological activation or inactivation.

Evidence shows that chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11 and their receptor CXCR3 are involved in severity of dengue, but their genetic association with the susceptibility of vascular leakage during dengue infection has not been reported. We genotyped 14 common variants of these candidate genes in 176 patients infected with dengue. rs4859584 and rs8878 (CXCL10) were significantly associated with vascular permeability of dengue infection (P < 0.05); while variants of CXCL11 showed moderate significance of association (P = 0.0527). Haplotype blocks were constructed for genes CXCL10 and CXCL11 (5 and 7 common variants respectively). Haplotype association tests performed revealed that, ''CCCCA'' of gene CXCL10 and ''AGTTTAC'' of CXCL11 were found to be significantly associated with vascular leakage (P = 0.0154 and 0.0366 respectively).

On the one hand, the established norm of sovereignty, particularly the principle of non-interference, had structured a regime for dealing with infectious disease outbreaks that provided ground rules of conduct but ascribed decision-making authority to member states alone. It explicitly ruled out foreign or supranational interference. On the other hand, the emerging norm of global health security was built on an understanding of infectious disease outbreaks as international security problems requiring supranational coordination and governance capacity. In effect, it implied the subordination of national economic and political interests to global disease detection and containment efforts. Its proponents thus sought a prominent role for the WHO in taking decisions in response to global health emergencies which would entail interference with state sovereignty. By the time of the SARS outbreak, this normative tension was far from being resolved. On the contrary, the two central actors in this episode, the Chinese government and the WHO secretariat, turned it into a manifest norm conflict by demonstrating incompatible positional differences over the relative priority of the two norms. 2 Intriguingly, however, neither China nor the WHO resorted to discursive modes of contestation by justifying their respective positions with reference to normative arguments. Almost exclusively, they displayed incompatible normative expectations in the way they put the norms into practice. The WHO acted as if the norm of global health security had already been widely accepted, supplanting those aspects of the sovereignty norm with which it conflicted. Without prior legal or political authorization to do so, the organization took a set of unprecedented measures. Most importantly, it issued travel warnings for affected regions, devised emergency recommendations, and put pressure on governments (the Chinese in particular) to comply-clearly challenging the non-interference 1 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. 2 On the manifestation of norm conflicts, see Michael Z\u00fcrn, Benjamin Faude and Christian Kreuder-Sonnen, Overlapping spheres of authority and interface conflicts in the global order: introducing a DFG research group, WZB \n Title: China vs the WHO: a behavioural norm conflict in the SARS crisis", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

In contrast, Snead et al. find that when scaffold proteins assemble, bulky disordered domains within them become acutely concentrated, generating steric pressure that destabilizes tubules, driving fission. Cellular membranes are continuously remodeled. The crescent-shaped bin-amphiphysinrvs (BAR) domains remodel membranes in multiple cellular pathways. Based on studies of BAR domains in isolation, the current paradigm is that they polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds that stabilize lipid tubules, preventing membrane fission. But in nature BAR domains are often part of multi-domain proteins that contain large intrinsically-disordered regions. Using in vitro and live cell assays, here we show that full-length BAR domaincontaining proteins, rather than stabilizing membrane tubules, are instead surprisingly potent drivers of membrane fission. Specifically, when BAR scaffolds assemble at membrane surfaces, their bulky disordered domains become crowded, generating steric pressure that destabilizes lipid tubules. More broadly, we observe this behavior with BAR domains that have a range of curvatures. These data challenge the idea that cellular membranes adopt the curvature of BAR scaffolds, suggesting instead that the ability to concentrate disordered domains is the key requirement for membrane remodeling and fission by BAR domain-containing proteins.

Although the type 1 interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) is a well-known antiviral cytokine, the role of IFN-\u03b1 in antipneumococcal host defense and its therapeutic potential remain poorly understood. We have investigated these issues by using a murine transgene expression model. We found that in control animals, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection caused severe weight loss and excessive lung inflammation, associated with rapid bacterial outgrowth. In contrast, the animals that received a single dose of an adenoviral vector expressing IFN-\u03b1 prior to pneumococcal infection demonstrated rapid and effective control of bacterial replication and lung inflammation and improved clinical outcome. Enhanced protection by IFN-\u03b1 was due to increased activation of neutrophils and macrophages with increased release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and bacterial killing. Furthermore, we found that raised levels of IFN-\u03b1 in the lung remained immune protective even when the gene transfer vector was given at a time postpneumococcal infection. Our study thus shows that the classically antiviral type 1 IFN can be exploited for enhancing immunity against pneumococcal infection via its activating effects on innate immune cells.

Relaxing this assumption can be challenging though, due to the difficulty of acquiring detailed knowledge about the non-random nature of encounters. Here, we fitted a mathematical model of dengue virus transmission to spatial time-series data from Pakistan and compared maximum-likelihood estimates of 'mixing parameters' when disaggregating data across an urban-rural gradient. We show that dynamics across this gradient are subject not only to differing transmission intensities but also to differing strengths of nonlinearity due to differences in mixing. Accounting for differences in mobility by incorporating two fine-scale, density-dependent covariate layers eliminates differences in mixing but results in a doubling of the estimated transmission potential of the large urban district of Lahore. We furthermore show that neglecting spatial variation in mixing can lead to substantial underestimates of the level of effort needed to control a pathogen with vaccines or other interventions.

RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, and fever and high rates of abortions in livestock. A nonstructural RVFV NSs protein inhibits the transcription of host mRNAs, including interferon-b mRNA, and is a major virulence factor. The present study explored a novel function of the RVFV NSs protein by testing the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD) or a-amanitin, both of which served as a surrogate of the host mRNA synthesis suppression function of the NSs. In the presence of the hosttranscriptional inhibitors, the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs protein, but not that carrying NSs, induced doublestranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-mediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2a phosphorylation, leading to the suppression of host and viral protein translation. RVFV NSs promoted post-transcriptional downregulation of PKR early in the course of the infection and suppressed the phosphorylated eIF2a accumulation. These data suggested that a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-induced host transcriptional suppression induces PKR-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation, while the NSs facilitates efficient viral translation by downregulating PKR and inhibiting PKR-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation. Thus, the two distinct functions of the NSs, i.e., the suppression of host transcription, including that of type I interferon mRNAs, and the downregulation of PKR, work together to prevent host innate antiviral functions, allowing efficient replication and survival of RVFV in infected mammalian hosts. \n Title: Rift Valley Fever Virus NSs Protein Promotes Post-Transcriptional Downregulation of Protein Kinase PKR and Inhibits eIF2a Phosphorylation", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Symptoms of this rare interstitial pulmonary disease can be either acute or sub-acute and it can rapidly progress to death. Diagnosis should be considered in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) if patients' symptomatology and radiology correlates with non-responding or progressive pneumonia and when morphology, on biopsies, encompasses criteria of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and organizing pneumonia (OP) balancing in between. Three clinical cases of patients presenting severe lung disease requiring mechanical ventilation and prolonged intensive care fitted on the variable spectra of AFOP histopathology and had poor outcome: a 23 year-old women had AFOP in the context of antiphospholipid syndrome pulmonary compromise; a 35 year-old man developed a letal intensive care pneumonia with AFOP pattern registered in post-mortem biopsy; and a 79 year-old man died 21 days after intensive care unit treatment of a sub-pleural organizing pneumonia with intra-alveolar fibrin, seen in post-mortem biopsy. The predominance of acute fibrin alveolar deposition pattern is helpful in raising AFOP differential diagnosis while organizing pneumonia pattern establishes a wider range of diagnosis that can go till solitary pulmonary nodule, remaining indefinite to suggest diagnosis.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the HRCT scans of 71 patients (38 females and 33 males) with H1N1 infection, confirmed through laboratory tests, between July and September of 2009. The HRCT scans were interpreted by two thoracic radiologists independently, and in case of disagreement, the decisions were made by consensus. Results: The most common HRCT findings were ground-glass opacities (85%), consolidation (64%), or a combination of ground-glass opacities and consolidation (58%). Other findings were airspace nodules (25%), bronchial wall thickening (25%), interlobular septal thickening (21%), crazy-paving pattern (15%), perilobular pattern (3%), and air trapping (3%). The findings were frequently bilateral (89%), with a random distribution (68%). Pleural effusion, when observed, was typically minimal. No lymphadenopathy was identified. Conclusions: The most common findings were ground-glass opacities and consolidations, or a combination of both.

Although numerous hypotheses have attempted to explain viral origins, none is backed by substantive data. We take full advantage of the wealth of available protein structural and functional data to explore the evolution of the proteomic makeup of thousands of cells and viruses. Despite the extremely reduced nature of viral proteomes, we established an ancient origin of the \"viral supergroup\" and the existence of widespread episodes of horizontal transfer of genetic information. Viruses harboring different replicon types and infecting distantly related hosts shared many metabolic and informational protein structural domains of ancient origin that were also widespread in cellular proteomes. Phylogenomic analysis uncovered a universal tree of life and revealed that modern viruses reduced from multiple ancient cells that harbored segmented RNA genomes and coexisted with the ancestors of modern cells. The model for the origin and evolution of viruses and cells is backed by strong genomic and structural evidence and can be reconciled with existing models of viral evolution if one considers viruses to have originated from ancient cells and not from modern counterparts. \n Title: A phylogenomic data-driven exploration of viral origins and evolution", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Viral RNA quantification was performed at 7 sampling days post-laboratory inoculation (d 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 42) and infectivity was assessed via bioassay with 10-d-old pigs. There was a tendency for treatment \u00d7 feed matrix \u00d7 day interaction (P = 0.094), in which the cycle threshold (Ct) value increased over time in FEED when treated with both feed additives, whereas there was no increase over time observed in SDPP treated with both feed additives. There was a feed matrix \u00d7 day interaction (P < 0.001) in which Ct increased over time in FEED, whereas very little increase over time was observed in SDPP. A tendency for a treatment \u00d7 feed matrix effect (P = 0.085) was observed where FEED treated with the combination of EO and BA had a greater (P < 0.05) PEDV Ct value than other FEED treatments, and all SDPP treatments had the lower PEDV Ct values compared to FEED treatments (P < 0.05). Overall, the combination of both feed additives was most effective at reducing the quantity of genetic material as detected by qRT-PCR (P < 0.001) compared to either additive alone or no feed additive. Virus shedding was observed in the d 7 postinoculation SDPP treatment that was treated with both feed additives, as well as d 0 untreated FEED and d 0 FEED treated with both feed additives. No other treatment bioassay room had detectible RNA shed and detected in fecal swabs or cecal contents. In summary, the combination of EO and BA enhanced the degradation of PEDV RNA in feed but had little impact on RNA degradation in SDPP. Both untreated feed and feed treated with the combination of EO and BA resulted in infection at d 0 post-laboratory inoculation; however, neither set of samples was infective at d 1 postinoculation. In addition, SDPP harbored greater levels of quantifiable RNA for a longer duration of time compared to FEED, and these viral particles remained viable for a longer duration of time indicating differences in viral stability exist between different feed matrices. \n Title: Determining the impact of commercial feed additives as potential porcine epidemic diarrhea virus mitigation strategies as determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis and bioassay 1", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The RBD of the SARS spike protein is responsible for virus attachment to its receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 (ACE2), on human cells. The RBD of the human epidemic strain differs from that of the animal virus by just two amino acids. Harrison and colleagues determined the complex of the interacting segments of these proteins, which consists of residues 19-615 of the peptidase domain of human ACE2 and residues 323-502 of the RBD, to 2.9-\u00c5 resolution. The ACE2 peptidase domain comprises two lobes that close during substrate binding, and the spike RBD contacts the tip of one lobe when ACE2 is either open or closed. The RBD has a five-stranded, antiparallel \u03b2-sheet core, and an extended-loop subdomain that lies along one edge of the core. A two-stranded \u03b2-sheet in this loop forms a concave surface that cradles the N-terminal helix of ACE2, and ridges along either side of the loop interact with structural features of ACE2. This loop (residues 424-494) was named the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and makes the only contacts with ACE2, producing a 1,700 \u00c5 2 interface that is consistent with the high binding affinity of these proteins (K d ~10 -8 ). The detailed analysis of the contacts between these two proteins provides useful information for rational vaccine design. REFERENCE Li, F. et al.

Several multiplex molecular assays are costly. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens. Methods: A GeXP-based multiplex RT-PCR assay (GeXP assay) was developed to detect simultaneously sixteen different respiratory virus types/subtypes. Seventeen sets of chimeric primers were used to initiate the RT-PCR, and one pair of universal primers was used for the subsequent cycles of the RT-PCR. The specificity of the GeXP assay was examined with positive controls for each virus type/subtype. The sensitivity was evaluated by performing the assay on serial ten-fold dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA of all RNA viruses and the plasmids containing the Adv and HBoV target sequence. GeXP assay was further evaluated using 126 clinical specimens and compared with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay. Results: The GeXP assay achieved a sensitivity of 20-200 copies for a single virus and 1000 copies when all of the 16 pre-mixed viral targets were present. Analyses of 126 clinical specimens using the GeXP assay demonstrated that GeXP assay and the RVP Fast assay were in complete agreement for 109/126 (88.51%) of the specimens. GeXP assay was more sensitive than the RVP Fast assay for the detection of HRV and PIV3, and slightly less sensitive for the detection of HMPV, Adv, RSVB and HBoV. The whole process of the GeXP assay for the detection of 12 samples was completed within 2.5 hours. Conclusions: In conclusion, the GeXP assay is a rapid, cost-effective, sensitive, specific and high throughput method for the detection of respiratory virus infections. \n Title: The development of a GeXP-based multiplex reverse transcription-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of sixteen human respiratory virus types/subtypes", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

An emerging theme is that the AT 1 R generates G protein dependent as well as independent signals and that these transduction systems separately contribute to AT 1 R biology in health and disease. Regulatory molecules termed arrestins are central to this process as is the capacity of AT 1 R to crosstalk with other receptor systems, such as the widely studied transactivation of growth factor receptors. AT 1 R function can also be modulated by polymorphisms in the AGTR gene, which may significantly alter receptor expression and function; a capacity of the receptor to dimerize/oligomerize with altered pharmacology; and by the cellular environment in which the receptor resides.

It was recently proposed to be involved in RNA metabolism because it was shown to associate with some cellular mRNA.

We first confirmed the binding of ANXA2 to IBV pseudoknot RNA by ultraviolet crosslinking and showed its binding to RNA pseudoknot with ANXA2 protein in vitro and in the cells. Since the RNA pseudoknot located in the frameshifting region of IBV was used as bait for cellular RBPs, we tested whether ANXA2 could regulate the frameshfting of IBV pseudoknot RNA by dual luciferase assay. Overexpression of ANXA2 significantly reduced the frameshifting efficiency from IBV pseudoknot RNA and knockdown of the protein strikingly increased the frameshifting efficiency. The results suggest that ANXA2 is a cellular RBP that can modulate the frameshifting efficiency of viral RNA, enabling it to act as an antiviral cellular protein, and hinting at roles in RNA metabolism for other cellular mRNAs. \n Title: Annexin A2 Binds RNA and Reduces the Frameshifting Efficiency of Infectious Bronchitis Virus", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Therefore the objective of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on bovine respiratory pathogen Histophilus somni. Four, 30-mer peptides corresponding to the functional region of NK-lysin helices 2 and 3 were synthesized and assessed for antibacterial activity on four bovine pneumonic H. somni isolates. Although there were some differences in the efficiency of bactericidal activity among the NK-lysin peptides at lower concentrations (2-5 \u03bcM), all four peptides effectively killed most H. somni isolates at higher concentrations (10-30 \u03bcM) as determined by a bacterial killing assay.

Using a genome-wide screening strategy, we identified the plasma membrane calcium ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2) as a potential downstream target of the CaR. We show that PMCA2 expression in the mouse mammary gland increases during lactation and that PMCA2 is localized solely to the apical plasma membrane of mammary epithelial cells. In milk from deafwaddler mice, which have mutations in the gene encoding PMCA2, calcium concentrations were reduced, confirming its importance in calcium transport into milk. Furthermore, in cultured primary and EpH4 mouse mammary epithelial cells, CaR stimulation up-regulated calcium-dependent ATPase ac-tivity in plasma membrane preparations. By small interfering RNA-mediated gene knockdown of PMCA2, we show that PMCA2 accounts for the preponderance of calcium-ATPase activity. We also show that reduction of CaR expression with small interfering RNA eliminates the ability of extracellular calcium to elicit an increase in calcium-dependent ATPase activity in EpH4 cell membranes. These results demonstrate that activation of the CaR increases PMCA2 activity in mouse mammary epithelial cells, providing a mechanism for the regulation of transepithelial calcium transport by calcium in the lactating mouse mammary gland.

Here, we aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection in eastern China. Active surveillance for hospitalized ALRI patients using a broad case definition based on symptoms was performed from 2009-2013 in 12 sentinel hospitals in eastern China. Clinical and epidemiologic data pertaining to hospitalized patients of all ages with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection by PCR assay were collected and analyzed in this study. From 2009 to 2013, 1046 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection were enrolled in this study, and 14.7% of patients had subtype A, 24.2% of patients had subtype B, 23.8% of patients with subtype not performed, and 37.3% of patients had RSV coinfections with other viruses. RSV and influenza coinfections (33.3%) were the most common coinfections noted in this study. Moreover, young children aged <5 years (89.1%, 932/1046), particularly young infants aged <1 year (43.3%, 453/1046), represented the highest proportion of patients with RSV infections. In contrast, older adults aged !60 years (1.1%, 12/1046) represented the lowest proportion of patients with RSV infections among enrolled patients. The peak RSV infection period occurred mainly during autumn and winter, and 57% and 66% of patients exhibited symptoms such as fever (body temperature !38\u02daC) and cough separately. Additionally, only a small number of patients were treated with broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, and most of patients were treated with antimicrobial PLOS ONE | drugs that were not appropriate for RSV infection. RSV is a leading viral pathogen and a common cause of viral infection in young children aged <5 years with ALRIs in eastern China. Effective vaccines and antiviral agents targeting RSV are needed to mitigate its large public health impact.

The three tryptophans in the peptide are all essential for FPR binding, just as they were essential for antiviral activity (Giannecchini, S. et al., J. Virol. 77 (2003) 3724). Formyl-NleWEDWVGWI behaved as a weak partial agonist with FPR W190/N192 but a stronger partial agonist with FPR R190/K192 and FPR R190/N192. Formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI behaved as a full agonist toward all three FPRs but exhibited a much higher EC 50 with W190/N192 FPR (300\u00b145 nM) than for R190/K192 FPR (40\u00b13 nM) or R190/N192 (60 \u00b18 nM).

The first step in the arenavirus life cycle is attachment of viral particles to host cells. While virus-cell attachment can be measured through the use of virions labeled with biotin, radioactive isotopes, or fluorescent dyes, these approaches typically require high multiplicities of infection (MOI) to enable detection of bound virus. We describe a quantitative (q)RT-PCR-based assay that measures Junin virus strain Candid 1 attachment via quantitation of virion-packaged viral genomic RNA. This assay has several advantages including its extreme sensitivity and ability to measure attachment over a large dynamic range of MOIs without the need to purify or label input virus. Importantly, this approach can be easily tailored for use with other viruses through the use of virus-specific qRT-PCR reagents. Further, this assay can be modified to permit measurement of particle endocytosis and genome uncoating. In conclusion, we describe a simple, yet robust assay for highly sensitive measurement of arenavirus-cell attachment. The video component of this article can be found at http://www.jove.com/video/53682/ 15, 23 . The qRT-PCR-based assay described here can detect attachment events using as few as 20 plaque forming units (PFUs) of virus, which translates into an MOI of 0.0004 for a 48-well plate.

The purpose of the present study was to explore the modulation of gene expression of some immuneinflammatory markers in buffaloes suffered from various digestive disorders. For this reason, 50 native breed water buffaloes were studied. Forty of these buffaloes showed various symptoms of digestive disorders and were allocated into 4 groups of equal sizes (group 1: uncategorized stomatitis; group 2: acute traumatic reticuloperitonitis [TRR]; group 3: acute rumen impaction; and group 4: undifferentiated enteritis). Ten apparently healthy buffaloes were randomly selected and considered as a control group. RNA was firstly extracted from the whole blood then a reverse transcription kits was used to convert the RNA to cDNA. Real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of mRNAs of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IgG, and IgA, while glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) used as an internal reference.

Vaccines have greatly improved the therapeutic landscape for treating infectious diseases and have significantly reduced the threat by therapeutic and preventative approaches. Furthermore, the advent of recombinant technologies has greatly facilitated growth within the vaccine realm by mitigating risks such as virulence reversion despite making the production processes more cumbersome. In addition, seroconversion can also be enhanced by recombinant technology through kinetic and nonkinetic approaches, which are discussed herein. Recombinant technologies have greatly improved both amino acid-based vaccines and DNA-based vaccines. A plateau of interest has been reached between 2001 and 2010 for the scientific community with regard to DNA vaccine endeavors. The decrease in interest may likely be attributed to difficulties in improving immunogenic properties associated with DNA vaccines, although there has been research demonstrating improvement and optimization to this end. Despite improvement, to the extent of our knowledge, there are currently no regulatory body-approved DNA vaccines for human use (four vaccines approved for animal use).

Coronaviruses (CoVs) represent a family of zoonotic viruses with wide variety of animal hosts, including birds and humans. The infections caused by coronaviruses vary from mild to severe, depending on the viral species and the host. Since the coronaviruses exhibit extraordinary large RNA genome, also the rate of homologous recombination is high, which in turn contributes to the genetic diversity and interspecies host-switches of CoVs. The emergence of novel CoVs has been rich during the last decades, and wild birds seem to serve as reservoirs for a variety of CoV strains. We examined the CoVs circulating among wild birds in Finland. Materials and methods: Samples (cloacal swab, tracheal swab, oropharyngeal swab, or tissue) representing 61 bird species were collected during 2010-2013, and examined by RT-PCR targeting the RdRp gene for the presence of CoV RNA. Results: Altogether 51/939 (5.4%) of the examined birds were found positive by RT-PCR. Diverse gamma-and deltacoronavirus sequences were detected.

Methods: We included infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis from 2004 to 2014. All infants underwent a nasal washing for virus detection. A regional agency network collected meteorological data (mean temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity) and the following air pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, benzene and suspended particulate matter measuring less than 10 \u00b5m (PM 10 ) and less than 2.5 \u00b5m (PM 2.5 ) in aerodynamic diameter. We obtained mean weekly concentration data for the day of admission, from the urban background monitoring sites nearest to each child's home address.

However, its general application has been hampered by difficulty in identifying a specific ligand-responsive pseudoknot that also functions as a ligand-dependent -1 PRF stimulator. We addressed this problem by using the \u22121 PRF stimulation pseudoknot of SARS-CoV (SARS-PK) to build a ligand-dependent \u22121 PRF stimulator. In particular, the extra stem of SARS-PK was replaced by an RNA aptamer of theophylline and designed to couple theophylline binding with the stimulation of \u22121 PRF.

Then MDBK, GFP-LC3-MDBK and shBCN1-MDBK cells were infected with CP or NCP BVDV strains. The LC3-II turnover rate was estimated by western blot, autophagosomes were visualized by confocal microscopy, and ultrastructural analysis was performed using electron microscopy. Autophagy flux was observed using chloroquine as an inhibitor of the autophagic process. The influence of autophagy on BVDV replication and release was investigated using virus titration, and its effect on cell viability was also studied. The effect of BVDVinduced autophagy on the survival of BVDV-infected host cell, cell apoptosis, and interferon (IFN) signalling was studied by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-(q)PCR using shBCN1-MDBK cells. we found that infection with either CP or NCP BVDV strains induced steady-state autophagy in MDBK cells, as evident by the increased number of double-or single-membrane vesicles, the accumulation of GFP-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) dots, and the conversion of LC3-I (cytosolic) to LC3-II (membrane-bound) forms. The complete autophagic process was verified by monitoring the LC3-II turnover ratio, lysosomal delivery, and proteolysis. In addition, we found that CP and NCP BVDV growth was inhibited in MDBK cells treated with high levels of an autophagy inducer or inhibitor, or in autophagy deficient-MDBK cells. Furthermore, our studies also suggested that CP and NCP BVDV infection in autophagy-knockdown MDBK cells increased apoptotic cell death and enhanced the expression of the mRNAs for IFN-\u03b1, Mx1, IFN-\u03b2, and OAS-1 as compared with control MDBK cells. Our study provides strong evidence that BVDV infection induces autophagy, which facilitates BVDV replication in MDBK cells and impairs the innate immune response. These findings might help to illustrate the pathogenesis of persistent infection caused by BVDV. Abstract Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an important pathogen of cattle that plays a complex role in disease. There are two biotypes of BVDV: non-cytopathic (NCP) and cytopathic (CP). One strategy that has been used to treat or prevent virus-associated diseases is the modulation of autophagy, which is used by the innate immune system to defend against viral infection; however, at present, the interplay between autophagy and BVDV remains unclear.

For this purpose, 21 and 48 street dust samples were collected for TPH analysis and PAH analysis, respectively, in Asaluyeh County. Moreover, seven air dust samples were taken for PAH analysis. TPH concentrations ranged between 240 and 4400 mg kg \u22121 , with a mean of 1371.43 mg kg \u22121 . The maximum \u2211PAH concentration (6016.3 mg kg \u22121 ) was detected in a petrochemical complex while the minimum \u2211PAHs content (16.93 mg kg \u22121 ) was measured in an urban area. The mean concentrations of total PAHs in street dust particles were 491.35 mg kg \u22121 in summer and 304.04 mg kg \u22121 in winter. The results indicated that PAH concentration in summer was higher. PAH sources were identified using both PAHs ratios and robust statistical methods such as Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), backward GEE, logistic regression, principal components analysis (PCA) in conjunction with multiple linear regression (MLR) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). The results showed that PAH species generally originate from pyrogenic sources and about 0.08% of TPH was typically PAHs. However, petrogenic sources of PAHs in the industrial areas were 11.2 times more abundant than in urban areas. Also, backward GEE model demonstrated that TPH is more influenced by HMW PAHs, particularly indene.

Both assays were conducted under isothermal conditions (61\u00b0C-62\u00b0C). Using the Isothermal Mastermix of OptiGene Ltd., amplification times ranged from 4 and 39 min with a sensitivity of 35.3% and a specificity of 94.6% for the reported sample group. Using the PCRun\u2122 Molecular Detection Mix of Biogal, amplification times ranged from 18 to 77 min with a sensitivity of 58.8% and a specificity of 97.3%. Although the RT-LAMP assay is less sensitive than real time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), it can be performed without the need of expensive equipment and with less hands-on time. Further modifications of primers might lead to a suitable in-house test and accelerate the diagnosis of FIP. \n Title: Detection of feline Coronavirus in effusions of cats with and without feline infectious peritonitis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Recent studies suggest that mutation rates are selected for optimal viral fitness and that modest variations in replicase fidelity may be associated with viral attenuation. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are unique in their requirement for host cycling and may necessitate substantial genetic and phenotypic plasticity. In order to more thoroughly investigate the correlates, mechanisms and consequences of arbovirus fidelity, we selected fidelity variants of West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) utilizing selection in the presence of a mutagen. We identified two mutations in the WNV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase associated with increased fidelity, V793I and G806R, and a single mutation in the WNV methyltransferase, T248I, associated with decreased fidelity. Both deepsequencing and in vitro biochemical assays confirmed strain-specific differences in both fidelity and mutational bias. WNV fidelity variants demonstrated host-specific alterations to replicative fitness in vitro, with modest attenuation in mosquito but not vertebrate cell culture. Experimental infections of colonized and field populations of Cx. quinquefaciatus demonstrated that WNV fidelity alterations are associated with a significantly impaired capacity to establish viable infections in mosquitoes. Taken together, these studies (i) demonstrate the importance of allosteric interactions in regulating mutation rates, (ii) establish that mutational spectra can be both sequence and strain-dependent, and (iii) display the profound phenotypic consequences associated with altered replication complex function of flaviviruses. mutable and exists in nature as genetically diverse mutant swarms. Although many recent studies have investigated the relationship between virus mutation rate and viral fitness, this had not previously been determined for WNV or other flaviviruses. We identified WNV mutations associated with variation in mutation rate using cell culture passage in the presence of a mutagen and engineered these mutations into an infectious WNV clone in order to investigate the causes and consequences of altered fidelity. Our results demonstrate that interactions among proteins which comprise the WNV replication complex can significantly alter both the extent and types of mutations that occur. In addition, we show that both increasing and decreasing WNV fidelity has host-specific effects on replication in cell culture and is associated with nearly complete ablation of WNV infection in mosquito vectors. These results have significant implications for our understanding of arbovirus evolution, replication complex function and arboviral fitness in mosquitoes, and identify important targets to study the determinants and mechanisms of vector competence and arbovirus fidelity.

Therefore, computational tools for reliably predicting linear B-cell epitopes are highly desirable. We evaluated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained utilizing five different kernel methods using fivefold cross-validation on a homology-reduced data set of 701 linear B-cell epitopes, extracted from Bcipep database, and 701 non-epitopes, randomly extracted from SwissProt sequences. Based on the results of our computational experiments, we propose BCPred, a novel method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using the subsequence kernel. We show that the predictive performance of BCPred (AUC \u00bc 0.758) outperforms 11 SVM-based classifiers developed and evaluated in our experiments as well as our implementation of AAP (AUC \u00bc 0.7), a recently proposed method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using amino acid pair antigenicity. Furthermore, we compared BCPred with AAP and ABCPred, a method that uses recurrent neural networks, using two data sets of unique B-cell epitopes that had been previously used to evaluate ABCPred. Analysis of the data sets used and the results of this comparison show that conclusions about the relative performance of different B-cell epitope prediction methods drawn on the basis of experiments using data sets of unique B-cell epitopes are likely to yield overly optimistic estimates of performance of evaluated methods. This argues for the use of carefully homology-reduced data sets in comparing B-cell epitope prediction methods to avoid misleading conclusions about how different methods compare to each other.

A population-based descriptive analysis was conducted to assess the changes in volume, market share, cesarean rate, and average LOS for each of the 4 provider levels, before, during and after the SARS epidemic. Results: Compared to the pre-SARS period, medical centers and regional hospitals dropped 5.2% and 4.1% in market share for childbirth services during the peak SARS period, while district hospitals and clinics increased 2.1% and 7.1%, respectively. For changes in cesarean rates, only a significantly larger increase was observed in medical centers (2.2%) during the peak SARS period.

Early intervention is a crucial prognostic factor and a HLA-haploidentical parental donor is often available. Haploidentical HSCT protocols utilizing extensively ex vivo T-cell depleted grafts (CliniMACs system) have proven efficient in preventing GvHD, but cause a delay in early T-cell recovery that increases the risk of viral infections. Here, we present a novel approach for treating SCID that combines selective depletion of GvHD-inducing alpha/beta (\u03b1/\u03b2) T-cells from the haploidentical HSCT graft with a subsequent donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) enriched for CD45RO+ memory T-cells. Results: Our patient was diagnosed with SCID (T-B + NK+ phenotype). At 9 months of age, he received a T cell receptor(TCR)\u03b1/\u03b2-cell depleted graft from his haploidentical mother, following a reduced intensity conditioning regimen with no additional GvHD prophylaxis. Engraftment was rapid with complete donor chimerism and no signs of GvHD. However, at 12 weeks post HSCT, the patient was still T-cell lymphopenic with clinical symptoms of multiple severe viral infections. Consequently, therapeutic DLIs were initiated for enhanced anti-viral immunity. The patient was treated with CD45RA+ depleted haploidentical maternal donor lymphocytes enriched from unmobilized whole blood, and a total T-cell dose of no more than 25 x10 3 CD3+ cells/kg with >99.9 % purity of CD3 + CD45RO+ memory T-cells was transferred. Following the DLI, a prompt increase in CD3 + CD4+ and CD3 + CD8+ counts was observed with a subsequent clearance of viral infections. No acute or chronic GvHD was observed. Conclusions: Automated depletion of CD45RA+ na\u00efve T-cells from unmobilized whole blood is a simple and rapid strategy to provide unmanipulated DLIs, with a potentially broad repertoire of pathogen specific memory T-cells. In the haploidentical setting, CD45RA+ depleted DLIs can be safely administered at low T-cell doses for efficient enhancement of viral immunity and limited risk of GvHD. We demonstrate the successful use of this approach following TCR-\u03b1/\u03b2-cell depleted HSCT for the treatment of SCID. \n Title: Novel treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency utilizing ex-vivo T-cell depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and CD45RA+ depleted donor lymphocyte infusions", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The most compelling reasons to develop rVSV as a vaccine vector include a very low seroprevalence in humans, the ability to infect and robustly express foreign antigens in a broad range of cells, and vigorous growth in continuous cell lines used for vaccine manufacture. Numerous preclinical studies with rVSV vectors expressing antigens from a variety of human pathogens have demonstrated the versatility, flexibility, and potential efficacy of the rVSV vaccine platform. When administered to nonhuman primates (NHPs), rVSV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag and Env elicited robust HIV-1specific cellular and humoral immune responses, and animals immunized with rVSV vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag and HIV Env were protected from AIDS after challenge with a pathogenic SIV/HIV recombinant.

In this study, the full-length genomes of eight avian gamma-coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates were sequenced and along with other full-length IBV genomes available from GenBank were analyzed for recombination. Evidence of recombination was found in every sequence analyzed and was distributed throughout the entire genome. Areas that have the highest occurrence of recombination are located in regions of the genome that code for nonstructural proteins 2, 3 and 16, and the structural spike glycoprotein. The extent of the recombination observed, suggests that this may be one of the principal mechanisms for generating genetic and antigenic diversity within IBV.

ABSTRACT 23 The 3\u00a2-to-5\u00a2 exoribonuclease in coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) 24 mediates RNA proofreading during genome replication. ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in 25 three motifs: I (DE), II (E), III (D). Alanine substitution of the motif I residues (AA-E-D, four 26 nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV yields viable mutants 27 with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. 28 Despite these impairments, MHV-and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have 29 not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound 30 fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA 31 with 1, 2 or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show 32 that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or 33 competitive fitness compared to MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low passage (P10) MHV-ExoN-34 AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. 35 Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-36 adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while 37 reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than 38 intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to 39 fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate 40 potential multi-protein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at 41 stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. 42 43 All rights reserved.

In this study, we identify multiple impediments to MHV-ExoN-47 AA reversion. We show that ExoN-AA reversion is possible but evolutionarily unfavorable. 48 Instead, compensatory mutations outside of ExoN-AA motif I are more accessible and beneficial 49 than partial reversion. We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term 50 passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a 51 reverted ExoN. Our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of ExoN-52 inactivating mutations, illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between 53 coronavirus replicase proteins, and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of ExoN-AA 54 coronavirus mutants. 55 All rights reserved.

In an analysis of published articles and those posted on preprint servers, the authors found that preprint posting increased during the 2015-17 outbreak of Zika in the Americas relative to the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and that preprints, while still used for only a small proportion of papers, provided much earlier access to scientific findings [1] . For medical journal editors who agreed in late 2015 and early 2016 that authors should not be penalized for sharing results in public health emergencies [2-4], these results signal gratifying progress over practices in 2003, when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was shown to have ended before 93% of journal articles on the epidemiology of SARS were published [5] . PLOS Medicine has long permitted the posting of preprints for research articles submitted to the journal, and this remains our policy. For the most part, posting of preprints has been occasional, undertaken on the initiative of authors without the journal's involvement. In the coming months, PLOS journals that handle research in more basic biological fields will begin facilitating preprint posts of journal submissions, with author approval, on the bioRxiv preprint server operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory [6] . PLOS Medicine will not initially be offering transfer of submitted manuscripts to bioRxiv as preprints. Because the journal's scope encompasses clinical and policy-related research, we believe it is important now to establish appropriate standards for the early sharing of research that has potential implications for human health but has not been peer reviewed. As preprint servers for clinically focused research become more widely available and preprint posting becomes more routine and more closely integrated with journal publishing, editors of medical journals should join the conversation about best practices for preprint sharing in medical research. In calling for wider use of preprints, Johansson and colleagues note the importance of protecting participant confidentiality, ensuring that posted research was ethically conducted, and guarding against misinterpretation of results that have yet to undergo peer review, either by traditional journal routes or through newer, more public venues [1] .

Infections of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine 25 parainfluenza virus-3 (BPI-3) are among the important contributing factors for the development 26 of pneumonia in young animals. These viral agents either primarily cause pneumonia or 27 predispose animals to the development of pneumonia. Although, the role of BRSV and BPI-3 in 28 the pathogenesis of pneumonia is well established, there are no reports of involvement of BRSV 29 and BPI-3 from Indian cattle and buffaloes suffering from pneumonia. In the present 30 investigation, we performed postmortem examinations of 406 cattle and buffaloes which were 31 below twelve months of age. Out of 406 cases, twelve (2.95%) cases were positive for BRSV 32 and fifteen (3.69%) cases were positive for BPI-3, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase 33 chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further, positive cases were confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-34 PCR amplicons and direct immunofluorescence antibody test (d-FAT) in paraffin-embedded 35 lung tissue sections. BRSV positive cases revealed characteristic findings of bronchiolar 36 epithelial necrosis, thickened alveolar septa by mononuclear cells infiltration and edema; 37 alveolar lumens were filled with mononuclear cells and numerous syncytial cells were seen 38 having intracytoplasmic inclusions. The BRSV antigen distribution was found to be in 39 bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells in the lung sections. In fifteen cases 40 where BPI-3 was detected, bronchointerstitial pneumonia in the majority of cases with thickened 41 alveolar septa by mild macrophage infiltration, hyperplasia of type-II pneumocytes and 42 bronchiolar necrosis along with syncytial cells having intracytoplasmic inclusions in the majority 43 of cases were observed. The BPI-3 antigen distribution was found to be in bronchiolar and 44 alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells in the lung sections. RT-PCR amplicons of BRSV and 45 BPI-3 obtained were sequenced and their analysis showed homology with already available 46 sequences in the NCBI database.

In the course of 67 development of livestock industry, the health of replacement progeny calves is an important 68 component of total operation profitability as the heifer calf is the foundation of the future herd 69 (Razzaque et al., 2009). However, calves are usually neglected as they do not bring any 70 immediate financial return and the cost of their maintenance considerably adds to the production 71 cost of milk. Pneumonia is associated with high morbidity and mortality of calves and incurs 72 great economic losses to the farmers due to the losses by death, treatment costs, reduced growth 73 and productivity (Mellado et al., 2014). It is estimated that calf mortality of 20% can reduce the 74 net profit of an enterprise by 40% (Blood and Radostits, 2007). 75 Some calf diseases can result of the complex interaction of the management practices, the 76 environment factors, infectious agents and the calf's immune system (Wudu, 2004). Pneumonia 77 is the second major cause of morbidity and mortality among calves after diarrhea and may 78 account for 50% mortality in the affected animals (Veena and Sumathi, 2011).

Therefore, this study is conducted to investigate the regulation of Beclin1-PI3K/AKT axis in reinfection of S. pneumoniae after influenza A virus in mice model of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Samples of sputum and BALF were collected from patients with SCAP for etiological detection. The expression of each gene was determined by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Influenza A/PR/8/34 and S. pneumoniae were used to establish the mice model of reinfection pneumonia. The virus quantity, expression levels of inflammatory factors, bacterial load, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were tested. HE staining was applied to observe histopathology of lung tissue. The expression of Beclin1 was downregulated and the PI3K/AKT pathway was activated in viral pneumonia. In vivo experiment, the reinfection of S. pneumoniae following influenza A virus infection increased the number of S. pneumoniae population, the activity of MPO, and the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 in BALF of mice.

An early and accurate diagnosis of dengue can support clinical management, surveillance and disease control and is central to achieving the World Health Organisation target of a 50% reduction in dengue case mortality by 2020. Methods 5729 children with fever of <72hrs duration were enrolled into this multicenter prospective study in southern Vietnam between 2010-2012. A composite of gold standard diagnostic tests identified 1692 dengue cases. Using statistical methods, a novel Early Dengue Classifier (EDC) was developed that used patient age, white blood cell count and platelet count to discriminate dengue cases from non-dengue cases. The EDC had a sensitivity of 74.8% (95%CI: 73.0-76.8%) and specificity of 76.3% (95%CI: 75.2-77.6%) for the diagnosis of dengue. As an adjunctive test alongside NS1 rapid testing, sensitivity of the composite test was 91.6% (95%CI: 90.4-92.9%). We demonstrate that the early diagnosis of dengue can be enhanced beyond the current standard of care using a simple evidence-based algorithm. The results should support patient management and clinical trials of specific therapies. Dengue is a very common acute infectious disease in the tropical world. Health care professionals are able to better care for dengue patients if they can make an early diagnosis and make a plan for case management. This current study investigated fever in 5729 children in Vietnam with 3 days or less of fever and identified 1692 dengue cases using advanced, gold standard methods. We systematically collected a range of medical and laboratory findings on each patient when they entered the study and used statistical tools to determine if these medical and laboratory findings could enable early diagnosis, independent of sophisticated, gold-standard laboratory tests. Our results, called the Early Dengue Classifier, had performance characteristics suggesting it could improve the diagnostic proficiency of health care professionals. However the performance of the Early Dengue Classifier is not perfect and likely will not change the practice of experienced doctors in dengue endemic settings. Our study highlights the need for 2 nd generation, easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests that can accurately diagnose dengue in the first few days of fever. \n Title: Tien Giang Provincial Hospital, My Tho, Tien Giang Province, Vietnam, 6 Dong Nai Children's Hospital", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

For coronaviruses, these organelles take the form of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) interconnected by a convoluted membrane network. We used electron microscopy to identify murine coronaviruses with mutations in nsp3 and nsp14 that replicated normally while producing only half the normal amount of DMVs under low-temperature growth conditions. Viruses with mutations in nsp5 and nsp16 produced small DMVs but also replicated normally. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed that the most strongly affected of these, the nsp3 mutant, produced more viral RNA than wild-type virus. Competitive growth assays were carried out in both continuous and primary cells to better understand the contribution of DMVs to viral fitness. Surprisingly, several viruses that produced fewer or smaller DMVs showed a higher fitness than wild-type virus at the reduced temperature, suggesting that larger and more numerous DMVs do not necessarily confer a competitive advantage in primary or continuous cell culture. For the first time, this directly demonstrates that replication and organelle formation may be, at least in part, studied separately during infection with positive-stranded RNA virus. DMVs is why they exist in the first place. In this study, we looked at thousands of infected cells and identified two coronavirus mutants that made half as many organelles as normal and two others that made typical numbers but smaller organelles. Despite differences in DMV size and number, all four mutants replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus. To better understand the relative importance of replicative organelles, we carried out competitive fitness experiments. None of these viruses was found to be significantly less fit than wild-type, and two were actually fitter in tests in two kinds of cells. This suggests that viruses have evolved to have tremendous plasticity in the ability to form membraneassociated replication complexes and that large and numerous DMVs are not exclusively associated with efficient coronavirus replication.

The bindings of eight natural components in DHI between bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy technology and molecular docking. According to the results, the quenching process of salvianolic acid B and hydroxysafflor yellow A was a static quenching procedure through the analysis of quenching data by the Stern-Volmer equation, the modified Stern-Volmer equation, and the modified Scatchard equation. Meanwhile, syringin (Syr) enhanced the fluorescence of BSA, and the data were analyzed using the Lineweaver-Burk equation. Molecular docking suggested that all of these natural components bind to serum albumin at the site I location. Further competitive experiments of SaB confirmed the result of molecular docking studies duo to the displacement of warfarin by SaB. Base on these studies, we selected SaB as a research target because it presented the strongest binding ability to BSA and investigated the influence of the multi-components coexisting in DHI on the interaction between the components of the SaB-BSA binding system.

We have previously shown that encapsidation of DNA expressing the model antigen M/M2 from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HPV pseudovirions (PsV) is immunogenic when delivered intravaginally. Because the HPV capsids confer tropism for basal epithelium, they represent attractive carriers for vaccination targeted to the skin using microneedles. In this study we asked: 1) whether HPV16 VLP administered by microneedles could induce protective immune responses to HPV16 and 2) whether HPV16 PsVencapsidated plasmids delivered by microneedles could elicit immune responses to both HPV and the antigen delivered by the transgene. Mice immunized with HPV16 VLP coated microneedles generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and were protected from HPV16 challenge. Microneedle arrays coated with HPV16-M/M2 or HPV16-F protein (genes of RSV) were then tested and dose-dependent HPV and F-specific antibody responses were detected post-immunization, and M/M2-specific T-cell responses were detected post RSV challenge, respectively. HPV16 PsV-F immunized mice were fully protected from challenge with HPV16 PsV and had reduced RSV viral load in lung and nose upon intranasal RSV challenge. In summary, HPV16 PsV-encapsidated DNA delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing antibody responses against HPV and primed for antibody and T-cell responses to RSV antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids. Although the immunogenicity of the DNA component was just above the dose response threshold, the HPV-specific immunity was robust. Taken together, these data suggest microneedle delivery of lyophilized HPV PsV could provide a practical, thermostable combined vaccine approach that could be developed for clinical evaluation. \n Title: Vaccination with Human Papillomavirus Pseudovirus-Encapsidated Plasmids Targeted to Skin Using Microneedles", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

We report a molecular method allowing for the detection of HCoV-HKU1 and also report the clinical presentation of 6 infected patients. Methods. We screened 141 specimens (135 nasal samples and 6 stool samples) received in February and March 2005 in our laboratory and obtained from 135 hospitalized patients (61.5% of whom were !5 years old and 34.1% of whom were 120 years old) for HCoV-HKU1. Results. HCoV-HKU1 was detected in 6 (4.4%) of the 135 nasal specimens and in 2 (33.3%) of the 6 stool samples; the positive samples were obtained from 6 patients (5 children and 1 adult).

Rotavirus likely represses the IFN response by at least 4 mechanisms. First, the rotavirus protein NSP1, most likely functioning as an E3 ligase, can induce proteasome-dependent degradation of the transcription factors IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 to prevent their induction of IFN. Second, NSP1 can induce proteasome-dependent degradation of the ubiquitin ligase complex protein \u03b2-TrCP, resulting in stabilization of I\u03baB and concomitant failure of virus to activate NF-\u03baB for induction of IFN. Third, rotavirus may sequester NF-\u03baB in viroplasms. And fourth, rotavirus can prevent STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation. The predominant mechanism for rotavirus inhibition of the IFN response is likely both rotavirus strain-specifi c and cell type-specifi c. The mammalian reoviruses also display strain-specifi c differences in their modulation of the IFN response. Reovirus activates RIG-I and IPS-1 for phosphorylation of IRF3. Reovirus-induced activation of MDA5 also participates in induction if IFN-\u03b2, perhaps through activation of NF-\u03baB. Reovirus likely inhibits the IFN response by at least 3 virus strain-specifi c mechanisms. First, the reovirus \u03bc2 protein can induce an unusual nuclear accumulation of IRF9 and repress IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, most likely by disrupting IRF9 function as part of the heterotrimeric transcription factor complex, ISGF3. Second, the reovirus \u03c33 protein can bind dsRNA and prevent activation of the latent antiviral effector protein PKR. And third, genetic approaches have identifi ed the reovirus \u03bb2 and \u03c32 proteins in virus strain-specifi c modulation of the IFN response, but the signifi cance remains unclear. In sum, members of the family Reoviridae have evolved a variety of mechanisms to subvert the host's innate protective response. Yue Z, Shatkin AJ. 1997.

We conducted a nationwide inpatient cohort study based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2011. A total of 40,876 ARDS patients (68% male; mean age 66 years) were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition coding and further analyzed for clinical characteristics, medical costs, and mortality. The overall crude incidence of ARDS was 15.74 per 100,000 person-years, and increased from 2.53 to 19.26 per 100,000 personyears during the study period. The age-adjusted incidence of ARDS was 15.19 per 100,000 person-years. The overall in-hospital mortality was 57.8%. In-hospital mortality decreased from 59.7% in 1997 to 47.5% in 2011 (P < 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was lowest (33.5%) in the youngest patients (age 18-29 years) and highest (68.2%) in the oldest patients (>80 years, P < 0.001). The overall 1-year mortality rate was 72.1%, and decreased from 75.8% to 54.7% during the study period. Patients who died during hospitalization were older (69 AE 17 versus 62 AE 19, P < 0.001) and predominantly male (69.8% versus 65.3%, P < 0.001). In addition, patients who died during hospitalization had significantly higher medical costs (6421 versus 5825 US Dollars, P < 0.001) and shorter lengths of stay (13 versus 19 days, P < 0.001) than patients who survived. We provide the first large-scale epidemiological analysis of ARDS incidence and outcomes in Asia. Although the overall incidence was lower than has been reported in a prospective US study, this may reflect underdiagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition code and identification of only patients with more severe ARDS in this analysis. Overall, there has been a decreasing trend in in-hospital and 1year mortality rates in recent years, likely because of the implementation of lung-protective ventilation.

Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an \"easy-to-use\" mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R 0 = 2.92 and latent period \u03c4 = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R 0 (1.4), if the R 0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases. 2 .

The aim of this study was to discover and identify potential biomarkers specific for TB. The surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) combined with weak cation exchange (WCX) magnetic beads was used to screen serum samples from 180 cases of TB and 211 control subjects. A classification model was established by Biomarker Pattern Software (BPS). Candidate protein biomarkers were purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), identified by MALDI-TOF MS, LC-MS/MS and validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: A total of 35 discriminating m/z peaks were detected that were related to TB (P < 0.01). The model of biomarkers based on the four biomarkers (2554.6, 4824.4, 5325.7, and 8606.8 Da) was established which could distinguish TB from controls with the sensitivity of 83.3% and the specificity of 84.2%. The candidate biomarker with m/z of 2554.6 Da was found to be up-regulated in TB patients, and was identified as a fragment of fibrinogen, alpha polypeptide isoform alpha-E preproprotein. Analysis in 22 patients with TB showed increased fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) (5,005 \u00b1 1,297 vs. 4,010 \u00b1 1,181 ng/mL, P < 0.05) and in 142 patients showed elevated plasma fibrinogen levels. Conclusions: A diagnostic model for TB with high sensitivity and specificity was developed using mass spectrometry combined with magnetic beads.

This current review evaluates if drainage systems can cause infections and thus be of clinical concern. Method: A review of the literature was analyzed. Papers, guidelines, and quality management systems have been considered. Results: Adequate sanitation is fundamental and a prerequisite for safe life and productivity. In contrast, malfunctioning sanitation has been reported to cause outbreaks all over the world. In areas with no sanitation, diarrheal mortality is high and has been shown to decrease by 36% after interventions to improve sanitation. Often, infections are faeces associated and when present in wastewater and sewage sludge poses a high risk of infection upon exposure. Hence, there are working safety guidelines and in industries where infection reduction is essential strict quality assurance systems, i.e. HACCP (hazard analysis critical control points) and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) must be complied. Healthcare has recently taken interest in the HACCP system in their efforts to reduce healthcare associated infections as a response to increasing number of ineffective antibiotics and the threat of mortality rate like the pre-antibiotic era. The last few years have called for immediate action to contain the emergence of increasing resistant microorganisms. Resistance is obtained as a result of overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both healthcare and agriculture. Also, by the discharge of antibiotics from manufacturers, healthcare and society. One mechanism of development of novel resistant pathogens has been shown to be by effortless sharing of genetic mobile elements coding for resistance from microbes in the environment to human microbes. These pathogens have been sampled from the drainage systems. These were noticed owing to their possession of an unusual antibiotic resistance profile linking them to the outbreak. Often the cause of sanitation related outbreaks is due to inadequate sanitation and maintenance. However, in general these infections probably go unnoticed. Conclusion: Drainage systems and its maintenance, if neglected, could pose a threat in both community and healthcare causing infections as well as emergence of multi-resistant bacteria that could cause unpredictable clinical manifestations. \n Title: Drainage systems, an occluded source of sanitation related outbreaks", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

In this study, we investigate the role of disulfide bond formation in the folding, assembly, and stability of BVDV glycoproteins. We provide molecular evidence that intact disulfide bonds are critical for the acquirement of a stable conformation of E2 monomers. Forcing the E2 glycoproteins to adopt a reduced conformation either co-or post-translationally before assembly into dimers, determines their misfolding and degradation by proteasome. In contrast, dimerization of E2 glycoproteins results in a conformation resistant to reducing agents and degradation. Furthermore, inhibition of the ER-a-mannosidase activity leads to impairment of misfolded E2 degradation, demonstrating the involvement of this enzyme in targeting viral proteins towards proteasomal degradation. \u00d3 \n Title: Role of disulfide bond formation in the folding and assembly of the envelope glycoproteins of a pestivirus", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Our study introduces a novel approach to identification of contributors to EMS environment contamination and development of infection control strategies, using a bacteriophage surrogate for pathogenic organisms. Methods: Bacteriophage FX174 was used to trace cross-contamination and evaluate current disinfection practices and a hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) wipe intervention within emergency response vehicles. Prior to EMS calls, 2 surfaces were seeded with FX174. On call completion, EMS vehicle and equipment surfaces were sampled before decontamination, after decontamination per current practices, and after implementation of the intervention. Results: Current decontamination practices did not significantly reduce viral loads on surfaces (P \u00bc .3113), but H 2 O 2 wipe intervention did (P \u00bc .0065). Bacteriophage spread to 56% (27/48) of sites and was reduced to 54% (26/48) and 40% (19/48) with current decontamination practices and intervention practices, respectively. Conclusion: Results suggest firefighters' hands were the main vehicles of microbial transfer. Current practices were not consistently applied or standardized and minimally reduced prevalence and quantity of microbial contamination on EMS surfaces.

The worldwide incidence of asthma has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, over 300 million children and adults worldwide currently suffer from this incurable disease and 255,000 die from the disease each year. It is now well accepted that asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome and many clinical subtypes have been described. Viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (hRV) have been implicated in asthma exacerbation in children because of their ability to cause severe airway inflammation and wheezing. Infections with atypical bacteria also appear to play a role in the induction and exacerbation of asthma in both children and adults. Recent studies confirm the existence of an infectious asthma etiology mediated by Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) and possibly by other viral, bacterial and fungal microbes. It is also likely that early-life infections with microbes such as CP could lead to alterations in the lung microbiome that significantly affect asthma risk and treatment outcomes. These infectious microbes may exacerbate the symptoms of established chronic asthma and may even contribute to the initial development of the clinical onset of the disease. It is now becoming more widely accepted that patterns of airway inflammation differ based on the trigger responsible for asthma initiation and exacerbation. Therefore, a better understanding of asthma subtypes is now being explored more aggressively, not only to decipher pathophysiologic mechanisms but also to select treatment and guide prognoses. This review will explore infection-mediated asthma with special emphasis on the protean manifestations of CP lung infection, clinical characteristics of infection-mediated asthma, mechanisms involved and antibiotic treatment outcomes. \n Title: Infection-mediated asthma: etiology, mechanisms and treatment options, with focus on Chlamydia pneumoniae and macrolides", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% & 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low. .

The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors. \n Title: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies Identify Important Features of Dengue Virus pr-E Protein Interactions", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

For coronaviruses, this critical step is governed by the virally-encoded spike (S) protein, a class I viral fusion protein that has several unique features.

Recent advances in structural, biochemical and molecular biology of the coronavirus S protein has shed light on the intricacies of coronavirus entry, in particular the molecular triggers of coronavirus S-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore, characterization of the coronavirus fusion peptide (FP), the segment of the fusion protein that inserts to a target lipid bilayer during membrane fusion, has revealed its particular attributes which imparts some of the unusual properties of the S protein, such as Ca 2+ -dependency. These unusual characteristics can explain at least in part the biphasic nature of coronavirus entry.

Here, we demonstrate for classical swine fever virus, a member of the Flaviviridae, that this process is much more efficient in terms of interferon-alpha induction when compared to direct stimulation by virus particles. By employment of virus replicon particles or infectious RNA which can replicate but not form de novo virions, we exclude a transfer of virus from the donor cell to the pDC. pDC activation by infected cells was mediated by a contact-dependent RNA transfer to pDC, which was sensitive to a TLR7 inhibitor. This was inhibited by drugs affecting the cytoskeleton and membrane cholesterol. We further demonstrate that a unique viral protein with ribonuclease activity, the viral E rns protein of pestiviruses, efficiently prevented this process. This required intact ribonuclease function in intracellular compartments. We propose that this pathway of activation could be of particular importance for viruses which tend to be mostly cell-associated, cause persistent infection, and are non-cytopathogenic. \n Title: Efficient Sensing of Infected Cells in Absence of Virus Particles by Blasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Is Blocked by the Viral Ribonuclease E rns", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4 -/mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4 -/mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4 -/mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4's impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis.

Despite the observation of autonomous replication and the detection of low levels of viral genome after two passages, the insertion of green fluorescent protein and Renilla luciferase reporter genes negatively impacted virus rescue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using a DENV infectious clone under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter to facilitate the recovery of recombinant viruses without the need for in vitro transcription. This novel molecular clone will be useful for establishing the molecular basis of replication, assembly, and pathogenesis, evaluating potential antiviral drugs, and the development of vaccine candidates for attenuated recombinant viruses. \n Title: Development of a novel DNA-launched dengue virus type 2 infectious clone assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Instead of commonly used micro particles an optical tagging of the flow has been performed by using a caged dye. The pattern generation is done by imaging a mask for the first time. This allows to generate nearly any imaginable pattern. The flow induces a deformation of the optically written pattern that can be tracked by laser induced fluorescence. The series of raw images acquired in this way were analyzed quantitatively with a novel optical flow based technique. The reference measurements have been carried out allowing to draw conclusions about the accuracy of this procedure. A comparison to the standard technique of lPIV has also been conducted. Apart from measuring flow velocities in microfluidic mixing processes, the spatial distribution of concentration fields for different species has also been measured. To this end, a new technique has been developed that allows spatial measurements from Planar Spontaneous Raman Scattering (PSRS). The Raman stray light of the relevant species has been spectrally selected by a narrow bandpass filter and thus detected unaffectedly by the Raman stray light of other species. The successful operation of this measurement procedure in micro flows will be demonstrated exemplary for a mixing process of water and ethanol. \n Title: Micro-flow analysis by molecular tagging velocimetry and planar Raman-scattering", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

To overcome those issues, for the first time, authors presented a novel parallel structural dsDNA/recombinant azurin (PSD/rAzu) hybrid structure for the general nucleic acid detection. The PSD was designed and introduced by the optimized 8 Ag + ions to have greater conductivity than the canonical dsDNA, and conjugated with rAzu to develop a general platform for electrochemical detection of miRNAs and viral DNAs with high reproducibility and ultra-sensitivity towards single base pair mutation. Thanks to the bifunctional rAzu as the selective spacer and electrochemical signal mediator, in the presence of the target strand, the imperfect PSD switched rapidly to the upright position where the Ag + ions intercalated between C-C mismatches of dsDNAs at the top of each structure brought further from the electrode surface resulting in a significant electrochemical signal drop of the Ag + ions. The charge transfer (CT) mechanism across the hybrid structure was simply clarified on the basis of the redox potential location of the species. The electrical conductivity of DNAs were measured using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) at the molecular scale and cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique based on the reduction of Ag + ion. The proposed PSD/rAzu hybrid structure with a great capability of single mutation recognition and miRNA expression level profiling in cancer cells holds a very promising platform to be studied for further development of various kinds of nanoscale biosensors, bioelectronic devices. \n Title: Electrochemical nucleic acid detection based on parallel structural dsDNA/recombinant azurin hybrid", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

A questionnaire was designed and piloted prior to its administration to veterinarians at the annual Australian Veterinary Association Conference in May 2011. The questionnaire comprised 21 closed, semi-closed and open questions. Data from the questionnaire were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression analyses to determine significant factors for veterinarians' use of personal protective equipment (PPE). A total of 344 veterinarians completed the questionnaire of which 63.7% were women, 63.2% worked in small/companion animal practice, and 79.9% worked in private veterinary practice. Of the respondents, 44.9% reported contracting a zoonosis during their careers with 19.7% reporting a suspected case and 25.2% reporting a confirmed incidence. Around 40-60% of veterinarians perceived exposure to zoonosis likely or very likely in a variety of situations. With reference to current national industry guidelines, the reported use of PPE was less than \"adequate\" for most scenarios except for performing postmortems, surgery or dental procedures. No PPE was used by 60-70% of veterinarians for treating respiratory and neurological cases and by 40-50% when treating gastrointestinal and dermatological cases. Workplace conditions need improvement as 34.8% of workplaces did not have isolation units for infected animals, 21.1% did not have separate eating areas for staff, and 57.1% did not have complete PPE kits for use. Veterinarians were more likely to use PPE if they had undertaken postgraduate education, perceived that zoonosis exposure from animals and procedures was likely, consciously considered PPE use for every case they dealt with and believed that liability issues and risks encouraged use of PPE. In contrast, those working in private practices, those who tended to 'just hope for the best' when trying to avoid zoonotic diseases, and those who were not aware of industry guidelines were less likely to use PPE. The results suggest that veterinarians' perceptions and workplace policies and culture substantially influence their use of PPE. Efforts should be made to encourage veterinarians and their workplaces to use infection control practices to protect themselves and their staff from zoonotic diseases. \n Title: Zoonotic disease risk perceptions and infection control practices of Australian veterinarians: Call for change in work culture", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

To elucidate the evolution of MERS-CoV-related viruses and their interspecies transmission pathway, samples were collected from different mammals in China. A novel coronavirus related to MERS-CoV, Erinaceus amurensis hedgehog coronavirus HKU31 (Ea-HedCoV HKU31), was identified from two Amur hedgehogs. Genome analysis supported that Ea-HedCoV HKU31 represents a novel species under Merbecovirus, being most closely related to Erinaceus CoV from European hedgehogs in Germany, with 79.6% genome sequence identity. Compared to other members of Merbecovirus, Ea-HedCoV HKU31 possessed unique non-structural proteins and putative cleavage sites at ORF1ab. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Ea-HedCoV HKU31 and BetaCoV Erinaceus/VMC/DEU/2012 were closely related to NeoCoV and BatCoV PREDICT from African bats in the spike region, suggesting that the latter bat viruses have arisen from recombination between CoVs from hedgehogs and bats. The predicted HKU31 receptor-binding domain (RBD) possessed only one out of 12 critical amino acid residues for binding to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor. The structural modeling of the HKU31-RBD-hDPP4 binding interphase compared to that of MERS-CoV and Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) suggested that HKU31-RBD is unlikely to bind to hDPP4. Our findings support that hedgehogs are an important reservoir of Merbecovirus, with evidence of recombination with viruses from bats.

The SINS model system has been introduced and adopted in 1,721 BSL-2 laboratories in Zhejiang Province, and thus lead to an increase in the number of biosafety committees from 20% to more than 95% from 2007 to 2018, and the number of biosafety laboratory managers who knows biosafety-related laws and regulations increase from 52.7% to 83.7% from 2009 to 2017.

Suppressing the level and transcriptional activity of cccDNA might have anti-HBV effect. Although cellular transcription factors, such as CREB, which mediate HBV transcription, have been well described, transcriptional coactivators that facilitate this process are incompletely understood. In this study we showed that CREBregulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) is required for HBV transcription and replication. The steady-state levels of CRTC1 protein were elevated in HBV-positive hepatoma cells and liver tissues. Ectopic expression of CRTC1 or its homolog CRTC2 or CRTC3 in hepatoma cells stimulated the activity of the preS2/S promoter of HBV, whereas overexpression of a dominant inactive form of CRTC1 inhibited HBV transcription. CRTC1 interacts with CREB and they are mutually required for the recruitment to the preS2/S promoter on cccDNA and for the activation of HBV transcription. Accumulation of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and cccDNA was observed when CRTC1 or its homologs were overexpressed, whereas the levels of pgRNA, cccDNA and secreted HBsAg were diminished when CRTC1 was compromised. In addition, HBV transactivator protein HBx stabilized CRTC1 and promoted its activity on HBV transcription.

Suspected cases were detected through fever screening, medical inspection, self-declaration, and reporting by on-board staff. Participants completed a standardised questionnaire with questions about demographics, their travel itinerary (including detailed information about all countries or regions visited), and clinical manifestations. Nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum samples, faecal samples, vomitus, blood, and serum were collected as appropriate for diagnoses. Diagnosis was made by specific laboratory tests according to the national technical guidelines. Infections were classified as respiratory, gastrointestinal, vector-borne, blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted, or mucocutaneous. We divided arriving travellers into two groups: travellers coming from countries other than China, and travellers coming from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. We integrated surveillance data for 2014-16, calculated incidences of travel-related infections, and compared the frequency of infections among subgroups. Findings Between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2016, 22 797 cases were identified among 805 993 392 arriving travellersan overall incidence of 28\u00b73 per million. 45 pathogens were detected in participants: 18 respiratory (19 662 cases), ten gastrointestinal (189 cases), seven vector-borne (831 cases), seven blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted (1531 cases), and three mucocutaneous (584 cases). Both the overall number and incidence of infection were more than five times higher in 2016 than in 2014. Case numbers and incidences also varied substantially by province, autonomous region, and municipality. Overall, 17 643 (77%) infections were detected by fever screening, but 753 (49%) blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections were identified through medical inspection. 14 305 (73%) cases of respiratory infection and 96 (51%) of gastrointestinal infections were in tourists. Tuberculosis, hepatitis A virus, vector-borne, and blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections were common among Chinese labourers who worked abroad.

Urinary ACE2 levels increase in diabetes, suggesting that ACE2 may be shed from tubular cells. The aim of this study was to determine if ACE2 is shed from proximal tubular cells, to characterize ACE2 fragments, and to study pathways for shedding. Studies involved primary cultures of mouse proximal tubular cells, with ACE2 activity measured using a synthetic substrate, and analysis of ACE2 fragments by immunoblots and mass spectrometry. The culture media from mouse proximal tubular cells demonstrated a time-dependent increase in ACE2 activity, suggesting constitutive ACE2 shedding. ACE2 was detected in media as two bands at ,90 kDa and ,70 kDa on immunoblots. By contrast, full-length ACE2 appeared at ,100 kDa in cell lysates or mouse kidney cortex. Mass spectrometry of the two deglycosylated fragments identified peptides matching mouse ACE2 at positions 18-706 and 18-577, respectively. The C-terminus of the 18-706 peptide fragment contained a non-tryptic site, suggesting that Met 706 is a candidate ACE2 cleavage site. Incubation of cells in high D-glucose (25 mM) (and to a lesser extent Ang II) for 48-72 h increased ACE2 activity in the media (p,0.001), an effect blocked by inhibition of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17. High D-glucose increased ADAM17 activity in cell lysates (p,0.05). These data indicate that two glycosylated ACE2 fragments are constitutively shed from mouse proximal tubular cells. ACE2 shedding is stimulated by high D-glucose, at least partly via an ADAM17-mediated pathway.

Our work indicates that, although various forms of LC3B possess an inherent ability to associate with forming macropinosomes, LC3B-II is critical for internalization of macropinocytic vesicles and, therefore, EBOV from the cell surface. \n Title: The Journal of Infectious Diseases Autophagy-Associated Proteins Control Ebola Virus Internalization Into Host Cells", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The abundance on the virion and the major stimulus for the virus-neutralizing antibodies makes gD a predominant candidate for cure of HSV infection. In this study, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb), termed m27f, targeting to glycoprotein D (gD) of HSV-2, which also has cross-reactivity against HSV-1 gD. It has a high level of neutralizing activity against both HSV-1 and HSV-2, and binds to a highly conserved region (residues 292-297) within the pro-fusion domain of gD. It can effectively block HSV cell-to-cell spread in vitro. The pre-or post-attachment neutralization assay and syncytium formation inhibition assay revealed that m27f neutralizes HSV at the post-binding stage. Moreover, therapeutic administration of m27f completely prevented infection-related mortality of mice challenged with a lethal dose of HSV-2. Our newly identified epitope for the neutralizing antibody would facilitate studies of gD-based HSV entry or vaccine design, and m27f itself demonstrated a high potential for adaptation as a protective or therapeutic drug against HSV. \n Title: A novel glycoprotein D-specific monoclonal antibody neutralizes herpes simplex virus", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Furthermore, a series of LB management documents, including laws, regulations, standards, and guidelines, have been developed and published. This gradually maturing LB system has played a pivotal role in emerging infectious disease control and prevention, as well as in research, which in turn contributes to public health. In recent years, international collaboration between China and other countries has also been accelerated. Despite these achievements, we are still facing many challenges and opportunities in the field of LB.

We sought to investigate CEACAM1 expression on mouse tumor and immune cells, characterize CC1 mAb binding, and evaluate CC1 in syngeneic mouse oncology models as a monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 mAb. CEACAM1 expression was observed at high levels on neutrophils, NK cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), while the expression on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells was low. Unexpectedly, rather than blocking, CC1 facilitated binding of soluble CEACAM1 to CEACAM1 expressing cells. No anti-tumor effects were observed in CT26, MBT2 or A20 models when tested up to 30 mg/kg dose, a dose that was estimated to achieve >90% target engagement in vivo.

To implement prevention strategies it is important to gain information on management and to point out risk factors. The objective of this internet based survey was to describe calf management practices on registered dairy breeding farms in Austria and to estimate differences in calf disease incidences depending on farm structure and management practices. Results: A total of 1287 questionnaires were finally analysed (response rate 12.2 %). Herd characteristics and regional distribution of farms indicated that this survey gives a good overview on calf management practices on registered dairy farms in Austria. The median number of cows per farm was 20 (interquartile range 13-30). Significant differences regarding farm characteristics and calf management between small and large farms (\u226420 vs >20 cows) were present. Only 2.8 % of farmers tested first colostrum quality by use of a hydrometer. Storing frozen colostrum was more prevalent on large farms (80.8 vs 64.2 %). On 85.1 % of the farms, whole milk, including waste milk, was fed to the calves. Milk replacer and waste milk were more often used on large farms. In accordance with similar studies from other countries, calf diarrhoea was indicated as the most prevalent disease. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that herd size was associated with calf diarrhoea and calf respiratory tract disease, with higher risk of disease on large farms. Furthermore, feeding waste milk to the calves was associated with increasing calf diarrhoea incidence on farm. In the final model with calf respiratory tract disease as outcome, respondents from organic farms reported less often a respiratory tract disease incidence of over 10 % compared with conventional farms [odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.75] and farmers that housed calves individually or in groups after birth significantly reported more often to have an incidence of respiratory tract disease >10 % compared with farms where all calves were housed individually (OR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.16-4.48).

Three mAbs, HJ16, HGN194 and HK20, were obtained from patients within the HIV-1 cohort of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM). Our aim was to generate immunization antibodies equivalent to those seen in plasma. Here, we describe the selection and characterization of patient plasma and their mAbs, using a range of neutralization assays, including several peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) based assays and replicating primary viruses as well as cell line based assays and pseudoviruses (PV). The principal criterion for selection of patient plasma was the activity in an 'extended incubation phase' PBMC assay. Neutralizing Abs, derived from their memory B cells, were then selected by ELISA with envelope proteins as solid phase. MAbs were subsequently tested in a high-throughput HOS-PV assay to assess functional neutralization. The present study indicates that the strong profiles in the patients' plasma were not solely due to antibodies represented by the newly isolated mAbs. Although results from the various assays were divergent, they by and large indicate that neutralizing Abs to other epitopes of the HIV-1 envelope are present in the plasma and synergy between Abs may be important. Thus, the spectrum of the obtained mAbs does not cover the range of cross-reactivity seen in plasma in these carefully selected patients irrespective of which neutralization assay is used. Nevertheless, these mAbs are relevant for immunogen discovery because they bind to the recombinant glycoproteins to which the immune response needs to be targeted in vivo.

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped RNA virus, which contains several structural proteins. Among these proteins, spike (S) protein is responsible for binding to specific cellular receptors and is a major antigenic determinant, which induces neutralizing antibody. In order to analyze the antigenicity and receptor-binding ability of SARS-CoV S protein, we expressed the S protein in Escherichia coli using a pET expression vector. After the isopropyl-b-D D -thiogalactoside induction, S protein was expressed in the soluble form and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography to homogeneity. The amount of S protein recovered was 0.2-0.3 mg/100 ml bacterial culture. The S protein was recognized by sera from SARS patients by ELISA and Western blot, which indicated that recombinant S protein retained its antigenicity. By biotinylated ELISA and Western blot using biotinlabeled S protein as the probe, we identified 130-kDa and 140-kDa proteins in Vero cells that might be the cellular receptors responsible for SARS-CoV infection.

In the current study, we first examined the efficacy of UDA on the replication of different SARS-CoV strains in Vero 76 cells. UDA inhibited virus replication in a dose-dependent manner and reduced virus yields of the Urbani strain by 90% at 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 g/ml in Vero 76 cells. Then, UDA was tested for efficacy in a lethal SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model. BALB/c mice were infected with two LD 50 (575 PFU) of virus for 4 h before the mice were treated intraperitoneally with UDA at 20, 10, 5 or 0 mg/kg/day for 4 days. Treatment with UDA at 5 mg/kg significantly protected the mice against a lethal infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (p < 0.001), but did not significantly reduce virus lung titers. All virus-infected mice receiving UDA treatments were also significantly protected against weight loss (p < 0.001). UDA also effectively reduced lung pathology scores. At day 6 after virus exposure, all groups of mice receiving UDA had much lower lung weights than did the placebo-treated mice. Thus, our data suggest that UDA treatment of SARS infection in mice leads to a substantial therapeutic effect that protects mice against death and weight loss. Furthermore, the mode of action of UDA in vitro was further investigated using live SARS-CoV Urbani strain virus and retroviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike (S). UDA specifically inhibited the replication of live SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus when added just before, but not after, adsorption. These data suggested that UDA likely inhibits SARS-CoV infection by targeting early stages of the replication cycle, namely, adsorption or penetration. In addition, we demonstrated that UDA neutralizes the virus infectivity, presumably by binding to the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein. Finally, the target molecule for the inhibition of virus replication was partially characterized. When UDA was exposed to N-acetylglucosamine and then UDA was added to cells just prior to adsorption, UDA did not inhibit the virus infection. These data support the conclusion that UDA might bind to N-acetylglucosamine-like residues present on the glycosylated envelope glycoproteins, thereby preventing virus attachment to cells. (D.L.

By solving 2.1-2.5\u00c5 resolution crystal structures of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B, an RdRP with a unique naturally fused N-terminal domain (NTD), we identified high-resolution intramolecular interactions between the NTD and the RdRP palm domain.

When crystallized, some of these NS5B interface mutants maintained the interface, while the others adopted an 'open' conformation that no longer retained the intra-molecular interactions. Data from multiple in vitro RdRP assays indicated that the perturbation of the NTD-RdRP interactions clearly reduced the fidelity level of the RNA synthesis, while the processivity of the NS5B elongation complex was not affected.

We designed a one-step triplex real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) protocol using TaqMan probes for detecting RSV and hMPV. The plasmid clones containing RSV nucleoprotein gene and hMPV fusion gene were established as reference standards. We used virus culture supernatants from 86 known pediatric RTI patient to test the specificity and sensitivity of our assay. Then we used total 222 nasopharyngeal aspirates specimens from pediatric patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms to evaluate our assay. Results: Our one-step triplex qRT-PCR assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in testing RSV and hMPV in 86 known virus culture supernatants, with excellent linearity (R 2 > 0.99) and reliable reproducibility (CV lower than 1.04%). This assay has a wide dynamic range 10 2 -10 9 copies/reaction (limit of detection; LOD = 100 copies/reaction). A total of 222 patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms were enrolled for clinical evaluation. In these samples, our qRT-PCR assay detected 68 RSV positive and 18 hMPV positive cases. However, standard virus culture only detected 8 RSV positive cases and 0 hMPV cases. Based on this improved triplex qRT-PCR assay, we found that RSV infection was associated with severe inflammation by chest X-ray and occurrence of pneumonia which were not observed previously. In summary, we have developed a highly specific and sensitive one-step triplex qRT-PCR assay to detect hMPV and RSV simultaneously. This assay offers a valuable tool for routine diagnosis. \n Title: Simultaneous detection of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus by one-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR in patients with respiratory symptoms", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The prevailing view is that the IC evolved as a specialized organelle to mediate long-distance endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi communication in metazoan cells, but is lacking in other eukaryotes, such as plants and fungi. However, this distinction is difficult to reconcile with the high conservation of the core machineries that regulate early secretory trafficking from yeast to man. Also, it has remained unclear whether the pleiomorphic IC components-vacuoles, tubules and vesicles-represent transient transport carriers or building blocks of a permanent pre-Golgi organelle. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that the IC maintains its compositional, structural and spatial properties throughout the cell cycle, supporting a model that combines the dynamic and stable aspects of the organelle. Moreover, the IC has been assigned novel functions, such as cell signaling, Golgi-independent trafficking and autophagy. The emerging permanent nature of the IC and its connections with the centrosome and the endocytic recycling system encourage reconsideration of its relationship with the Golgi ribbon, role in Golgi biogenesis and ubiquitous presence in eukaryotic cells. \n Title: Intermediate compartment (IC): from pre-Golgi vacuoles to a semi- autonomous membrane system", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory infections, including acute otitis media (AOM), but the knowledge on the significance of HBoV1 in upper respiratory tract infections (URI) and AOM in relation to other respiratory viruses is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of detection of HBoV1 to that of other respiratory viruses in specimens from children with URI, with and without AOM complication. Methods. Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected during URI from healthy children (6-35 months) followed prospectively for 1 year; specimens have been previously analyzed for broad spectrum of respiratory viruses. Archived NPS were analyzed for HBoV1 using a high-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Results. Seven hundred and seven NPS samples collected during URI episodes from 201 children were studied for HBoV1. A total of 94 (47%) children tested positive for HBoV1 DNA during 172 (24%) URI episodes; HBoV1 was present as the only virus in 44 (6%) URI episodes. Overall, 37% of URI episodes were complicated by AOM. Of URI associated with single virus (n = 303), the rate of AOM complicating URI associated with HBoV1 only was 52% (23 of 44); this was a higher AOM rate, compared to that of other respiratory viruses. Conclusions. Among URI associated with single respiratory virus, HBoV1-URI was commonly associated with AOM complication. The important role of HBoV1 on AOM pathogenesis needs to be studied further. \n Title: Role of Human Bocavirus in Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Acute Otitis Media", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as SARS-CoV, can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system. Herein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibodybinding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells.

A common point in many of past studies is, however, that there is only one peak of infected density in each single epidemic spreading episode. At variance, real data from different cities over the world suggest that, besides a major single peak trait of infected density, a finite probability exists for a pattern made of two (or multiple) peaks. We show that such a latter feature is distinctive of a multilayered network of interactions, and reveal that a two peaks pattern may emerge from different time delays at which the epidemic spreads in between the two layers. Further, we show that the essential ingredient is a weak coupling condition between the layers themselves, while different degree distributions in the two layers are also helpful.

RESULTS: During the 26-month study, there were 357 blood cultures obtained for LOS evaluations, 29 (8%) had a respiratory virus detected. Only 88 (25%) of infants evaluated for LOS also had clinical suspicion for a respiratory viral infection. RSV (14 of 29; 48%) was the predominant virus detected. Almost all infants (13 of 14; 93%) with RSV required increased respiratory support.

Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that basal promoter activity of the mutated LTR was higher than that of the wildtype LTR in Crandell feline kidney (CRFK) cells. The mutated LTR was introduced into an infectious molecular clone of FIV and the clone was transfected into CRFK cells. The virus production of the mutant in the cells was as high as that of the wildtype when determined by the reverse transcriptase activity assay. The growth of the mutant virus obtained from the transfected CRFK cells was examined in feline T lymphoblastoid cell lines (MYA-1 and FeL-039 cells) and primary feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (fPBMCs). The growth was delayed when compared with that of the wild-type virus in all the cells used. Upon examination by polymerase chain reaction, the length of the LTR of the mutant virus was shortened in both MYA-1 cells and fPBMCs. Sequence analysis revealed that the insertion was completely deleted 39 days after infection in the MYA-1 cells. T. Miyazawa et al. several putative binding sites for enhancer proteins such as AP-1, AP-4, C/EBP are present [13, 14, 26] . Previously we reported that by deletion of AP-1 and AP-4 related sequences in the LTR, promoter activity was reduced in Crandell feline kidney (CRFK) andfelis catus whole foetus-4 (fcwf-4) cells using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay [11, 19] . Recently, Thompson et al. [29] reported that protein(s) present in the nuclear extract from feline T cells (F422 cells) which are permissive for FIV replication bind to the putative AP-1 and AP-4 binding sites. These findings suggest that the AP-1 in feline cells can bind to the AP-1 binding site in the L T R and is critical for the basal promoter activity of the LTR. Conversely, a m u t a n t virus which lacks the AP-1 and AP-4 binding sites replicated in feline T lymphoblastoid cell lines (MYA-1 and FeL-039 cells) [19] and primary feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (fPBMCs) [17] . These data indicate that the AP-1 and AP-4 binding sites are not necessary for the efficient replication of FIV in feline T lymphocytes. In this study, we introduced an oligonucleotide containing multiple AP-1 binding sites adjacent to the original AP-1 binding site in the U3 region of the L T R and examined the effects of the insertion on the promoter and growth activities of the mutant.

Traditionally, most transmission models have assumed that all purchased cattle carry the same risk of generating outbreaks in the destination herd. Using data on bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in Scotland as a case example, this study provides empirical and theoretical evidence that the risk of disease transmission varies substantially based on the animal and herd demographic characteristics at the time of purchase. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that purchasing pregnant heifers and open cows sold with a calf at foot were associated with an increased risk of beef herds being seropositive for BVDV. Based on the results from a dynamic within-herd simulation model, these findings may be partly explained by the age-related probability of animals being persistently infected with BVDV as well as the herd demographic structure at the time of animal introductions. There was also evidence that an epidemiologically important network statistic, \"betweenness centrality\" (a measure frequently associated with the potential for herds to acquire and transmit disease), was significantly higher for herds that supplied these particular types of replacement beef cattle. The trends for dairy herds were not as clear, although there was some evidence that open heifers and open lactating cows were associated with an increased risk of BVDV.

However, patients with advanced liver disease and those after liver transplantation represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of COVID-19. In addition, the current pandemic requires unusual allocation of healthcare resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with chronic liver disease that continue to require medical attention.

The virus poses a significant global public health threat with potentially devastating effects. In this study, a recombinant adenoviral-based vaccine encoding the spike 1 (S1) subunit of the MERS-CoV genome was constructed, and its humoral, and cellular immune responses were evaluated in mice. Mice were immunized initially by intramuscular injection and boosted 3 weeks later by intranasal application. Expression of the S1 protein in the lungs and kidneys was detected using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) targeting specific regions within the S1 subunit at weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6 after the first vaccination. Antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in serum and in cell culture following in vitro stimulation with a specific 9-mer epitope within the S1 protein (CYSSLILDY). Results: S1 protein expression was only detected by IHC in the kidneys of the Ad-MERS-S1 group at week 6 from first immunization, and in both lungs and kidneys of Ad-MERS-S1 group by conventional PCR at weeks 3 and 5 post-prime. The vaccine elicited a specific S1-immunoglobulin G antibody response, which was detected in the sera of the vaccinated mice at weeks 4 and 6 from the onset of the first immunization. There was a significant increase in the amount of Th1-related cytokines (interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin [IL] 12), and a significant decrease in the Th2-related cytokine IL-4 in splenocyte cell culture of the vaccinated group compared with the control groups. The results of this study suggest that this recombinant adenovirus vaccine encoding the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV elicits potentially protective antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.

We followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods. Findings Fever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8\u00b79 (SD 3\u00b71) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7\u00b75 (2\u00b73) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7\u00b74 (2\u00b72) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8\u00b76 (3\u00b70) days. In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission. Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0\u00b7001).

To investigate the influenza-induced innate immune response in those cells, we measured the global gene expression profile of highly differentiated ATII cells infected with the influenza A virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 at 4 hours and 24 hours after inoculation. Infection with influenza stimulated a significant increase in the mRNA concentrations of many host defense-related genes, including pattern/pathogen recognition receptors, IFN, and IFN-induced genes, chemokines, and suppressors of cytokine signaling. We verified these changes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. At the protein level, we detected a robust virusinduced secretion of the three glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (ELR)negative chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, according to ELISA. The ultraviolet inactivation of virus abolished the chemokine and cytokine response. Viral infection did not appear to alter the differentiation of ATII cells, as measured by cellular mRNA and concentrations of surfactant proteins. However, viral infection significantly reduced the secretion of surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D. In addition, influenza A virus triggered a time-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in ATII cells. The inhibition of this pathway significantly decreased the release of infectious virus and the chemokine response, but did not alter virusinduced cell death.

NSDV is closely related to the human pathogen Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, which also causes a haemorrhagic disease. As with other nairoviruses, replication of NSDV takes place in the cytoplasm and the new virus particles bud into the Golgi apparatus; however, the effect of viral replication on cellular compartments has not been studied extensively. We have found that the overall structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi were unaffected by infection with NSDV. However, we observed that NSDV infection led to the loss of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), an oxidoreductase present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and which assists during protein folding, from the ER. Further investigation showed that NSDV-infected cells have high levels of PDI at their surface, and PDI is also secreted into the culture medium of infected cells. Another chaperone from the PDI family, ERp57, was found to be similarly affected. Analysis of infected cells and expression of individual viral glycoproteins indicated that the NSDV PreGn glycoprotein is involved in redistribution of these soluble ER oxidoreductases. It has been suggested that extracellular PDI can activate integrins and tissue factor, which are involved respectively in pro-inflammatory responses and disseminated intravascular coagulation, both of which manifest in many viral haemorrhagic fevers. The discovery of enhanced PDI secretion from NSDV-infected cells may be an important finding for understanding the mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of haemorrhagic nairoviruses.

A warning system capable of anticipating social disruptions resulting from disease outbreaks is urgently needed to help decision makers prepare appropriately. We designed a system that operates in near real-time to identify and predict social response. Over 150,000 Internet-based news articles related to outbreaks of 16 diseases in 72 countries and territories were provided by HealthMap. These articles were automatically tagged with indicators of the disease activity and population reaction. An anomaly detection algorithm was implemented on the population reaction indicators to identify periods of unusually severe social response. Then a model was developed to predict the probability of these periods of unusually severe social response occurring in the coming week, 2 and 3 weeks. This model exhibited remarkably strong performance for diseases with substantial media coverage. For country-disease pairs with a median of 20 or more articles per year, the onset of social response in the next week was correctly predicted over 60% of the time, and 87% of weeks were correctly predicted. Performance was weaker for diseases with little media coverage, and, for these diseases, the main utility of our system is in identifying social response when it occurs, rather than predicting when it will happen in the future. Overall, the developed near real-time prediction approach is a promising step toward developing predictive models to inform responders of the likely social consequences of disease spread.

The three classic stages of pertussis include an initial catarrhal stage, characterized by nonspecific upper respiratory infection symptoms, which may advance to the paroxysmal stage, revealing the distinctive \"whooping cough.\" This cough can persist for weeks to months leading into the convalescent stage. Household contacts of patients with suspected pertussis or other asymptomatic, high-risk populations (infants, pregnant women in their third trimester, and childcare workers) may benefit from post-exposure prophylactic therapy.

The pathological findings most commonly recorded in the untreated lambs were suggestive of a generalized inflammatory process attributed to colibacilosis, while the lesions in the treated lambs might correspond to an enterotoxoemic process. The overproduction of P. mirabilis might be consequence of the antibiotic treatment and it would be the most probable cause of the endotoxemia, the high mortality rate and the pathological findings in the treated lambs. Therefore, a supportive care without antibiotics does not lead to a poorer chance of survival in lambs with diarrhoea attributed to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli. \n Title: Relationship between the treatment and the evolution of the clinical course in scouring Merino lambs from \"La Serena\" (Southwest Spain)", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection are poorly understood. In 2010, 108 DENV3-positive cases were enrolled in a pediatric hospital-based study in Managua, Nicaragua, with 61 primary and 47 secondary infections. We analyzed DENV-specific neutralization titers (NT 50 ), IgM and IgG avidity, and antibody titer in serum samples collected during acute and convalescent phases and 3, 6, and 18 months post-infection. NT 50 titers peaked at convalescence and decreased thereafter. IgG avidity to DENV3 significantly increased between convalescent and 3-month time-points in primary DENV infections and between the acute and convalescent phase in secondary DENV infections. While avidity to DENV2, a likely previous infecting serotype, was initially higher than avidity to DENV3 in secondary DENV infections, the opposite relation was observed 3-18 months post-infection. We found significant correlations between IgM avidity and NT 50 in acute primary cases and between IgG avidity and NT 50 in secondary DENV infections. In summary, our findings indicate that IgM antibodies likely play a role in early control of DENV infections. IgG serum avidity to DENV, analyzed for the first time in longitudinal samples, switches from targeting mainly cross-reactive serotype(s) to the current infecting serotype over time. Finally, serum avidity correlates with neutralization capacity. \n Title: Correlation between Dengue-Specific Neutralizing Antibodies and Serum Avidity in Primary and Secondary Dengue Virus 3 Natural Infections in Humans", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

During 2000During -2005, five dog and one human rabies cases were imported into France, a rabies-free country since 2001. The Summer 2004 event led to unprecedented media warnings by the French Public Health Director. We investigated medical practice evolution following the official elimination of rabies in 2001; impact of subsequent episodic rabies importations and national newspaper coverage on demand for and delivery of antirabies prophylaxis; regular transmission of epidemiological developments within the French Antirabies Medical Center (ARMC) network; and ARMC discussions on indications of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (RPEP). Methodology/Principal Findings: Annual data collected by the National Reference Center for Rabies NRCR (1989NRCR ( -2006 and the exhaustive database (2000-2005) of 56 ARMC were analyzed. Weekly numbers of patients consulting at ARMC and their RPEP-and antirabies-immunoglobulin (ARIG) prescription rates were determined. Autoregressive integrated movingaverage modeling and regression with autocorrelated errors were applied to examine how 2000-2005 episodic rabies events and their related national newspaper coverage affected demand for and delivery of RPEP. A slight, continuous decline of rabies-dedicated public health facility attendance was observed from 2000 to 2004. Then, during the Summer 2004 event, patient consultations and RPEP and ARIG prescriptions increased by 84%, 19.7% and 43.4%, respectively. Moreover, elevated medical resource use persisted in 2005, despite communication efforts, without any secondary human or animal case. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated appropriate responsiveness to reemerging rabies cases and effective newspaper reporting, as no secondary case occurred. However, the ensuing demand on medical resources had immediate and longlasting effects on rabies-related public health resources and expenses. Henceforth, when facing such an event, decisionmakers must anticipate the broad impact of their media communications to counter the emerging risk on maintaining an optimal public health organization and implement a post-crisis communication strategy. \n Title: Imported Episodic Rabies Increases Patient Demand for and Physician Delivery of Antirabies Prophylaxis", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Study design: Both sensitivity and specificity were assessed using 12 samples containing different viral loads of MERS-CoV or common coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1). Results: The panel was sent to more than 106 participants, of which 99 laboratories from 6 continents returned 189 panel results.Scores ranged from 100% (84 laboratories) to 33% (1 laboratory). 15% of respondents reported quantitative results, 61% semi-quantitative (Ct-values or time to positivity) and 24% reported qualitative results. The major specific technique used was real-time RT-PCR using the WHO recommended targets upE, ORF1a and ORF1b. The evaluation confirmed that RT-PCRs targeting the ORF1b are less sensitive, and therefore not advised for primary diagnostics. Conclusions: The first external quality assessment MERS-CoV panel gives a good insight in molecular diagnostic techniques and their performances for sensitive and specific detection of MERS-CoV RNA globally. Overall, all laboratories were capable of detecting MERS-CoV with some differences in sensitivity. The observation that 8% of laboratories reported false MERS-CoV positive single assay results shows room for improvement, and the importance of using confirmatory targets. \n Title: First international external quality assessment of molecular diagnostics for Mers-CoV", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Healthy broilers are resistant to inhaled E. coli, but previous infection with vaccine or virulent strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) predisposes birds for severe colibacillosis. We investigated whether IBV affects recruitment and function of phagocytic cells and examined NO production, phagocytic and bactericidal activity, and kinetics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and splenocytes. Moreover, we measured cytokine mRNA expression in lung and spleen samples. Broilers were inoculated with IBV H120 vaccine or virulent M41 and challenged 5 days later with E. coli 506. A PBS control and E. coli group without previous virus inoculation were also included. Birds were sacrificed at various time points after inoculation (h/dpi). Inoculation with IBV induced extended and more severe colibacillosis than with E. coli alone. At 4 dpi, the number of KUL-01 + PBMC in all E. coli-inoculated groups was significantly higher than in PBS-inoculated birds, which correlated with lesion scores. From 1 to 4 dpi, NO production by PBMC from all E. coliinoculated animals was elevated compared to PBS birds. Bactericidal activity of PBMC in IBV-inoculated animals at 7 dpi was lower than in PBS-and E. coli-inoculated birds, but phagocytic capacity and recruitment were not severely impaired. In spleen samples of IBV-infected animals reduced expression of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18 and IFN-g mRNA was found 1 dpi.

In particular, the population of oldest-old individuals, those aged 80+, is projected to quadruple by 2050. The oldest-old represent a uniquely important group-they have high demand for personal assistance and the highest healthcare costs of any age group. Understanding trends in disability and longevity among the oldest-old-that is, whether successive generations are living longer and with less disability-is of great importance for policy and planning purposes. We utilized data from successive birth cohorts (n = 20,520) of the Chinese oldest-old born 10 years apart (the earlier cohort was interviewed in 1998 and the later cohort in 2008). Disability was defined as needing personal assistance in performing one or more of five essential activities (bathing, transferring, dressing, eating, and toileting) or being incontinent. Participants were followed for age-specific disability transitions and mortality (in 2000 and 2002 for the earlier cohort and 2011 and 2014 for the later cohort), which were then used to generate microsimulation-based multistate life tables to estimate partial life expectancy (LE) and disability-free LE (DFLE), stratified by sex and age groups (octogenarians, nonagenarians, and centenarians). We additionally explored sociodemographic heterogeneity in LE and DFLE by urban/rural residence and educational attainment. Results: More recently born Chinese octogenarians (born 1919-1928) had a longer partial LE between ages 80 and 89 than octogenarians born 1909-1918, and octogenarian women experienced an increase in partial DFLE of 0.32 years (P = 0.004) across the two birth cohorts. Although no increases in partial LE were observed among nonagenarians or centenarians, partial DFLE increased across birth cohorts, with a gain of 0.41 years (P < 0.001) among nonagenarians and 0.07 years (P = 0.050) among centenarians. Subgroup analyses revealed that gains in partial LE and DFLE primarily occurred among the urban resident population. Conclusions: Successive generations of China's oldest-old are living with less disability as a whole, and LE is expanding among octogenarians. However, we found a widening urban-rural disparity in longevity and disability, highlighting the need to improve policies to alleviate health inequality throughout the population. \n Title: Are China's oldest-old living longer with less disability?

Interactions between N proteins and RNA are thus crucial for the assembly of infectious virus particles.

Methods: Data from a case-control psychological autopsy (PA) study of 150 HK suicides were utilized. The reports of the PA cases from five major HK newspapers were collected and reviewed to identify whether or not there was a match in terms of the cases' profile and risk factors.

Deep RNA sequencing of C/OK virus found a matrix 1 (M1) protein expression strategy that differed from that of ICV. The novelty of C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether C/OK virus could exist in a nonswine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in U.S. bovine herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether swine/bovine C/OK viruses can undergo reassortment with human ICV, and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK, in vitro reassortment and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were conducted. In vitro reassortment using two human ICV and two swine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent split virions was observed in AGID between human and nonhuman viruses by using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive to cognate antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV. The classification of the new virus in a separate genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family is proposed. The finding of C/OK virus in swine and bovine indicates that this new virus may spread and establish infection in other mammals, including humans. Here, we show molecular and serological data demonstrating widespread circulation of similar viruses in bovines. Deep RNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and in vitro reassortment experiments demonstrate that animal ICV-like viruses are genetically distinct from human ICV. Antigenically, we show that ICV-like viruses are not recognized by ICV antibodies. En masse, these results suggest that bovine influenza virus warrants classification as a new genus of influenza virus. The finding of this novel virus that can infect multiple mammalian species warrants further research into its role in human health. . 2014.

On 49th day after the last immunization, splenocytes were prepared from mice immunized with surface-displayed mixture, secretory mixture and negative control to be stimulated by purified N and S protein, respectively. The results of ELISA analysis showed that N protein was capable of inducing a higher level of IL-4 (P<0.001) and IFN-\u03b3 (P<0.001) than S1 protein in the immunized mice. Taken together, Lc-expressed N protein as molecular adjuvant or immunoenhancer was able to effectively facilitate the induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses by Lc-expressing S1 region. \n Title: High-level mucosal and systemic immune responses induced by oral administration with Lactobacillus-expressed porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) S1 region combined with Lactobacillus-expressed N protein", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The prevalence of IBV in quail industry in Malaysia was not well documented; therefore, its actual role in the epidemiology of the disease is relatively unknown. This study was to determine the susceptibility of Japanese quail, as one of the species in commercial poultry industry, toward IBV. In addition, it will also give a potential impact on the overall health management in the quail industry even though it had been established that quail are resistant to diseases affecting poultry. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first experimental study on IBV inoculation in quail. In this experimental study, 20 quails were divided into 4 groups (n 5 5 for group A, B, and C, n 5 5 for control group). The quails in group A, B, and C were infected via intraocular and intranasal routes with 0.2 mL of 10 ! 5 EID 50 of the virus. Clinical signs, gross lesions, positive detection of virus, and trachea histopathological scoring were used to assess the susceptibility of these Japanese quails. The results have indicated mild ruffled feathers and watery feces in these inoculated birds. Trachea, lung, and kidney were subjected to onestep reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for virus detection. The virus was found from trachea and lung samples, whereas it was absent from all kidney samples. Only 3 quails were found with gross lesions. There was a significant difference of tracheal lesion by 0.009 6 0.845 (P , 0.05) within the treatment groups.

PEDV obtained after ten passages through the brains (MK-p10) had increased virulence for mice, and its fusion activity in cultured cells exceeded that of the original strain. However, the replication kinetics of MK and MK-p10 did not differ from each other in the brain and in cultured cells. The spike (S) protein of MK-p10 had four amino acid substitutions relative to the original strain.

The VAA protein previously identified in flounder is associated with a role in immune protection within these fish. In the present study, a recombinant DNA plasmid encoding the VAA gene of V. anguillarum was constructed and its potential as a DNA vaccine, to prevent the infection of V. anguillarum in flounder fish, investigated. We verified the expression of the VAA protein both in vitro in cell lines and in vivo in flounder fish. The protective effects of pcDNA3.1-VAA (pVAA) were analyzed by determination of the percentage of sIgM + , CD4-1 + , CD4-2 + , CD8\u03b2 + lymphocytes, and the production of VAA-specific antibodies in flounder following their immunization with the DNA vaccine. Histopathological changes in immune related tissues, bacterial load, and relative percentage survival rates of flounder post-challenge with V. anguillarum, were all investigated to assess the efficacy of the pVAA DNA vaccine candidate. Fish intramuscularly immunized with pVAA showed a significant increase in CD4-1 + , CD4-2 + , and CD8\u03b2 + T lymphocytes at days 9, 11, and 14 post-vaccination, reaching peak T-cell levels at days 11 or 14 post-immunization. The percentage of sIgM + lymphocytes reached peak levels at weeks 4-5 post-immunization. Specific anti-V. anguillarum or anti-rVAA antibodies were induced in inoculated fish at days 28-35 post-immunization. The liver of vaccinated flounder exhibited only slight histopathological changes compared with a significant pathology observed in control immunized fish. Additionally, a lower bacterial burden in the liver, spleen, and kidney were observed in pVAA protected fish in response to bacterial challenge, compared with pcDNA3.1 vector control injected fish. Moreover, the pVAA vaccine confers a relative percentage survival of 50.00% following V. anguillarum infection. In summary, this is the first study indicating an initial induction of the T lymphocyte response, followed by B lymphocyte induction of specific antibodies as a result of DNA immunization of flounder. This signifies the important potential of pVAA as a DNA vaccine candidate for the control of V. anguillarum infection. \n Title: A DNA Vaccine Encoding the VAA Gene of Vibrio anguillarum Induces a Protective Immune Response in Flounder", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

There have been little critical analyses of the methodological approaches. Our objective is to review and summarize statistical and modelling methods used to investigate the effects of weather and climate on infectious diseases associated with water, in order to identify limitations and knowledge gaps in developing of new methods.

We found 102 full text papers that met our criteria and were included in the analysis. The most commonly used methods were grouped in two clusters: process-based models (PBM) and time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE). In general, PBM methods were employed when the bio-physical mechanism of the pathogen under study was relatively well known (e.g. Vibrio cholerae); TS-SE tended to be used when the specific environmental mechanisms were unclear (e.g. Campylobacter). Important data and methodological challenges emerged, with implications for surveillance and control of water-associated infections. The most common limitations comprised: non-inclusion of key factors (e.g. biological mechanism, demographic heterogeneity, human behavior), reporting bias, poor data quality, and collinearity in exposures.

We demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a transcutaneous vaccine formulation using a hydrogel patch in animal experiments. In the present study, we performed a clinical study to apply our TCI formulation for vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria in human. The TCI device was a hydrogel patch (antigen-free) applied to the left brachial medial skin of 22 healthy volunteers for 48 h. Next, the hydrogel patch, containing 2 mg tetanus toxoid (TT) and 2 mg diphtheria toxoid (DT) as the TCI formulation, was applied to 27 healthy volunteers for 24 h and some volunteers were vaccinated again by TCI formulation. For safety assessment, the patch application site was observed to assess local adverse events, and systemic adverse events were determined by a blood test. The antigen-free hydrogel patch and TCI formulation containing TT and DT did not induce local or systemic severe adverse events. For vaccine efficacy estimation, toxoid-specific serum antibody titers were determined by ELISA and the toxin-neutralizing activity of the induced antibody was evaluated in a passive-challenge experiment. The anti-TT IgG titer and the anti-DT IgG titer increased, and a significant effect was detected by paired t-test. The antibody titers were maintained at higher level than that before vaccination for at least 1 year. Moreover, toxoid-specific antibodies were produced by the second vaccination in some subjects. Antibodies induced by application of the TCI formulation neutralized the toxin and prevented toxic death in mice. In addition, changes in the skin condition due to application of the TCI formulation were observed under in vivo confocal Raman spectroscopy. The amount of water and patch components in the stratum corneum increased after application of the TCI formulation, suggesting that the change in the skin condition was related to antigen penetration. These data indicate that this easy-to-use TCI system induces an immune response without severe adverse reactions in humans.

Previous experimental FIPV infection studies suggested a role for cellmediated immunity in resistance to development of FIP. This experimental FIPV infection study in specific pathogen free (SPF) kittens describes longitudinal antiviral T cell responses and clinical outcomes ranging from rapid progression, slow progression, and resistance to disease. Results: Differences in disease outcome provided an opportunity to investigate the role of T cell immunity to FIP determined by T cell subset proliferation after stimulation with different viral antigens. Reduced total white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte and T cell counts in blood were observed during primary acute infection for all experimental groups including cats that survived without clinical FIP. Antiviral T cell responses during early primary infection were also similar between cats that developed FIP and cats remaining healthy. Recovery of antiviral T cell responses during the later phase of acute infection was observed in a subset of cats that survived longer or resisted disease compared to cats showing rapid disease progression. More robust T cell responses at terminal time points were observed in lymph nodes compared to blood in cats that developed FIP. Cats that survived primary infection were challenged a second time to pathogenic FIPV and tested for antiviral T cell responses over a four week period. Nine of ten rechallenged cats did not develop FIP or T cell depletion and all cats demonstrated antiviral T cell responses at multiple time points after rechallenge. Conclusions: In summary, definitive adaptive T cell responses predictive of disease outcome were not detected during the early phase of primary FIPV infection. However emergence of antiviral T cell responses after a second exposure to FIPV, implicated cellular immunity in the control of FIPV infection and disease progression.

Existing habitat-based models do not consider interspecies pathogen transmission, a primary route for emergence of new infectious diseases and reservoirs in wildlife and man. The modeling of interspecies transmission has the potential to provide more accurate predictions of disease persistence and emergence dynamics. The new models are motivated by our recent work on hantavirus in rodent communities in Paraguay. Our Paraguayan data illustrate the spatial and temporal overlap among rodent species, one of which is the reservoir species for Jabora virus and others which are spillover species. Disease transmission occurs when their habitats overlap. Two mathematical models, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model, are developed for spread of hantavirus between a reservoir and a spillover species. Analysis of a special case of the ODE model provides an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, \u211b 0 , such that if \u211b 0 < 1, then the pathogen does not persist in either population but if \u211b 0 > 1, pathogen outbreaks or persistence may occur. Numerical simulations of the CTMC model display sporadic disease incidence, a new behavior of our habitat-based model, not present in other models, but which is a prominent feature of the seroprevalence data from Paraguay.

Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has been used to detect viral RNA molecules because of its simplicity and high sensitivity for a number of viruses. RT-LAMP for the detection of Potato virus X (PVX) was developed and compared with conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to demonstrate its advantages over RT-PCR. RT-LAMP reactions were conducted with or without a set of loop primers since one out of six primers showed PVX specificity. Based on real-time monitoring, RT-LAMP detected PVX around 30 min, compared to 120 min for RT-PCR. By adding a fluorescent reagent during the reaction, the extra step of visualization by gel electrophoresis was not necessary. RT-LAMP was conducted using simple inexpensive instruments and a regular incubator to evaluate whether RNA could be amplified at a constant temperature instead of using an expensive thermal cycler. This study shows the potential of RT-LAMP for the diagnosis of viral diseases and PVX epidemiology because of its simplicity and rapidness compared to RT-PCR. \n Title: The Plant Pathology Journal Development of a Rapid Detection Method for Potato virus X by Reverse Tran- scription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The inactivation efficiency was deduced using aerosol-and colony-counting methods. Susceptibility constant (Z) was introduced for performance evaluation of DBD. Modified Z was suggested for evaluation of DBD reactors of different sizes. Our methodology will be used for design optimization and performance evaluation. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is a promising method to remove contaminant bioaerosols. The collection efficiency of a DBD reactor is an important factor for determining a reactor's removal efficiency. Without considering collection, simply defining the inactivation efficiency based on colony counting numbers for DBD as on and off may lead to overestimation of the inactivation efficiency of the DBD reactor. One-pass removal tests of bioaerosols were carried out to deduce the inactivation efficiency of the DBD reactor using both aerosol-and colony-counting methods. Our DBD reactor showed good performance for removing test bioaerosols for an applied voltage of 7.5 kV and a residence time of 0.24 s, with \u00c1 CFU , \u00c1 Number , and \u00c1 Inactivation values of 94%, 64%, and 83%, respectively. Additionally, we introduce the susceptibility constant of bioaerosols to DBD as a quantitative parameter for the performance evaluation of a DBD reactor. The modified susceptibility constant, which is the ratio of the susceptibility constant to the volume of the plasma reactor, has been successfully demonstrated for the performance evaluation of different sized DBD reactors under different DBD operating conditions.

Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were collected from 30 sentinel hospitals in Beijing and subjected to EV and EV-D68 detection by real-time PCR. The VP1 gene region and complete genome sequences of EV-D68 positive cases were analyzed. Of 21816 ARTI cases, 619 (2.84%) were EV positive and 42 cases were EV-D68 positive. The detection rates of EV-D68 were 0 (0/6644) in 2015, 0.53% (40/7522) in 2016 and 0.03% (2/7650) in 2017, respectively. Two peaks of EV-D68 infections occurred in late summer and early-winter. Ten cases (23.81%) with upper respiratory tract infection and 32 cases (76.19%) presented with pneumonia, including 3 cases with severe pneumonia. The phylogenetic analysis suggested 15 subclade D3 strains and 27 subclade B3 strains of EV-D68 were circulated in China from 2016 to 2017. A total of 52 amino acid polymorphisms were identified between subclades D1 and D3. These data suggest an upsurge of EV-D68 occurred in Beijing in 2016, the new subclade D3 emerged in 2016 and co-circulated with subclade B3 between 2016 and 2017. Enteroviruses (EV) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA in the family Picornaviridae 1,2 . The length of enteroviruses is approximately 7.5 kilobases, and divided into 15 species (EV-A to L and rhinovirus A to C) 3-6 . Seven species, including EV-A to D and rhinovirus (RV) A to C, caused a wide spectrum of diseases in human 7,8 . Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a member of the species EV-D, was first identified from bronchiolitis and pneumonia in California in 1962 9 . EV-D68 infections have been rarely reported until the worldwide outbreaks 10-18 . A nationwide outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory tract infection was reported in the USA from mid-August 2014 to January 15, 2015 and 1,153 cases were confirmed with clinical characteristics of patients mainly resembling pneumonia with severe dyspnea syndrome during this epidemic 19 . In China, sporadic cases of EV-D68 were reported between 2006 and 2014 13,20-23 . The similar results were found that few patients confirmed with EV-D68 infections during the surveillance among US 24 , China 21 in 2015. However, an upsurge of EV-D68 infections occurred in 2016, ranging from Europe to North America, including Netherlands, France, Sweden and United states 24-27 . In addition, sporadic cases have been reported in Hong Kong, Italy, Germany, Portugal and UK in 2016 28, 29 . Earlier phylogenetic analysis revealed that EV-D68 strains circulating worldwide during 1961-2013 were divided into three clades (clades A to C) or lineages (lineages 1 to 3) 10,11,29-31 . With the deepening of the study, the clades of EV-D68 were further refined. After the outbreak of the United States in 2014, EV-D68 was grouped into four clades and five subclades, including clade A, clade B (subclades B1 to B3), clade C and clade D (subclades D1 to D2) 32,33 . The subclade B1 and B3, as the major subclade, circulated around the world in 2014 and in 2016, respectively. To raise awareness of this upsurge of EV-D68 infection, we performed an EV-D68 surveillance study on ARTI cases from the Respiratory Virus Surveillance System (RVSS) in Beijing and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of EV-D68 infections from 2015 to 2017 in Beijing. Results A total of 21, 816 ARTI cases were collected from RVSS from January 2015 to December 2017. The median age of them was 36 years old (range: 1 day to 101 years). Among 21, 816 cases, 619 (2.84%) cases were enterovirus positive and 42 (0.19%) cases were EV-D68 positive. 359 cases were successfully amplified among 619 enterovirus positive cases, including 326 cases belonging to EV-A to D, 26 cases and 7 cases belonging to RV-A and RV-C respectively, and no case belonging to RV-B. Of 326 cases belonging to EV-A to D, they were genotyped to 30 serotypes including 9 of EV-A, 16 of EV-B, 4 of EV-C and 1 of EV-D and the dominant serotypes were CVA6, EV-D68, CVA4, CVA2, CVA10, CVA5 and CVA12, accounting for 16.27%, 12.88%, 11.83%, 11.54%, 8.28%, 5.62% and 5.03%, respectively (Fig. 1) . No samples of EV-D68 co-infected with other enteroviruses were found. The annual detection rates of EV-D68 were 0 (0/6, 644) in 2015, 0.53% (40/7, 522) in 2016 and 0.03% (2/7, 650) in 2017, respectively (Table 1) . Twenty cases were aged younger than 18 years, 15 were aged 18 to 60 years and 7 were aged over 60 years. No statistically significant difference of EV-D68 positive rates was identified in the different age groups in 2016 (P = 0.062). Statistical analysis. The differences of EV-D68 positive cases among different age groups were performed using chi-square test. The comparison of EV-D68 different subclades proportions in different age groups were performed using fisher's exact test. The comparison of respiratory diseases by different subclades of EV-D68 were performed using fisher's exact test. A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 17.0. \n Title: Upsurge of Enterovirus D68 and Circulation of the New Subclade D3 and Subclade B3 in Beijing OPEN", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Blood and buccal swab samples from 81 cats were collected in Rio de Janeiro. Plasma was serologically tested for FeLV. DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and buccal swabs was used to PCR detect FFV and FeLV. A qPCR was developed to detect and measure FFV proviral loads (pVLs) in cats. FeLV qPCR was performed using previous methods. The median log10 pVL of FFV mono-infected individuals was lower than found in FFV/FeLV co-infected cats in buccal swabs (p = 0.003). We found 78% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA in FFV mono-infected and FFV co-infected FeLV-progressive cats, while in FeLV-regressive cats (those without signs of disease) 22% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA (p = 0.004). Our results suggest that regressive FeLV infection may reduce FFV saliva transmission, the main mode of FV transmission.

We hypothesized that ACE2 is part of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its expression regulated by the other elements of this system. ACE2 immuno-staining was performed in transgenic mouse brain sections from NSE-AT 1A (overexpressing AT 1A receptors), R + A + (overexpressing angiotensinogen, and renin) and control (non transgenic littermates) mice. Results show that ACE2 staining is widely distributed throughout the brain. Using cell type-specific antibodies, we observed that ACE2 staining is present in the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies but not in glial cells. In the subfornical organ, an area lacking the blood brain barrier and sensitive to blood borne angiotensin-II, ACE2 was significantly increased in transgenic mice. Interestingly, ACE2 mRNA and protein expression were inversely correlated in the nucleus of tractus solitarius/dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the ventrolateral medulla, when comparing transgenic to non-transgenic mice. These results suggest that ACE2 is localized to the cytoplasm of neuronal cells in the brain, and that ACE2 levels appear highly regulated by other components of the RAS, confirming its involvement in this system.

Despite extensive research on the relationship between autophagy and virus infection, the concrete role of autophagy in porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection has not been reported. In this study, autophagy was demonstrated to be triggered by the effective replication of PEDV through transmission electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, and Western blot analysis. Moreover, autophagy was confirmed to benefit PEDV replication by using autophagy regulators and RNA interference. Furthermore, autophagy might be associated with the expression of inflammatory cytokines and have a positive feedback loop with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway during PEDV infection. This work is the first attempt to explore the complex interplay between autophagy and PEDV infection. Our findings might accelerate our understanding of the pathogenesis of PEDV infection and provide new insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Viruses 2017, 9, 53 2 of 16 damaged organelles are delivered to lysosomes for degradation and recycling [8, 9] . Autophagy can be induced by diverse intracellular and extracellular stimuli, such as nutrient starvation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and virus infection [10] . Increasing evidence indicates that autophagy plays both anti-viral and pro-viral roles in the life cycles and pathogenesis of a broad range of viruses [11] . Specifically, autophagy is an intrinsic host defense mechanism that inhibits viral replication or eliminates viruses by delivering them to the lysosomal compartment for degradation. Meanwhile, viruses develop many mechanisms to block autophagy or even hijack it for their own benefit, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [9, [12] [13] [14] . However, autophagy is also believed to serve as a platform for viral replication, especially for RNA viruses, such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and rotavirus (RV), utilizing the membranes of the autophagosome-like vesicles for their replication [15] [16] [17] . These polar characteristics reveal the complicated relationship between autophagy and viral infection. A previous proteomic study indicated that more differentially expressed proteins were mapped to the autophagy pathway, and the microtubule-associated protein 1B, a useful biomarker protein for autophagy was up-regulated in PEDV-infected Vero cells [18] . In addition, our previous study demonstrated that mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, which was closely associated with cellular autophagy, was down-regulated, and that the autophagy associated protein ATG5 was up-regulated during PEDV infection [19] . These studies indicated that autophagy might participate in PEDV infection, but the specific function of autophagy in the process of PEDV infection has not been elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that autophagy was triggered in Vero cells during PEDV infection to promote its replication. Moreover, autophagy might mediate the inflammatory responses induced by PEDV infection and have a positive correlation with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

Methods: Between February 15, 2011 and January 18, 2012, 371 pediatric patients with CAP were enrolled at Beijing Children's Hospital. Sixteen respiratory viruses and two bacteria were detected from tracheal aspirate specimens using commercially available multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) kits. Results: A single viral pathogen was detected in 35.3% of enrolled patients, multiple viruses in 11.6%, and virus/bacteria coinfection in 17.8%. In contrast, only 6.5% of patients had a single bacterial pathogen and 2.2% were infected with multiple bacteria. The etiological agent was unknown for 26.7% of patients. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (43.9%), rhinovirus (14.8%), parainfluenza virus (9.4%), and adenovirus (8.6%). In patients under three years of age, RSV (44.6%), rhinovirus (12.8%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.9%) were the most frequent pathogens. In children aged 3e7 years, S. pneumoniae (38.9%), RSV (30.6%), Haemophilus influenzae (19.4%), and adenovirus (19.4%) were most prevalent. Finally in children over seven years, RSV (47.3%), S. pneumoniae (41.9%), and rhinovirus (21.5%) infections were most frequent. Conclusions: Viral pathogens, specifically RSV, were responsible for the majority of CAP in pediatric patients. However, both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae contributed as major causes of disease.

Currently there are no licensed preventative measures for hMPV infections. Using a variant of hMPV/NL/1/00 that does not require trypsin supplementation for growth in tissue culture, we deleted the M2-2 gene and evaluated the replication of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 virus in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies showed that the ablation of M2-2 increased the propensity for insertion of U nucleotides in poly-U tracts of the genomic RNA. In addition, viral transcription was up-regulated although the level of genomic RNA remained comparable to rhMPV. Thus, deletion of M2-2 alters the ratio between hMPV genome copies and transcripts. In vivo, rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 was attenuated compared to rhMPV in the lungs and nasal turbinates of hamsters. Hamsters immunized with one dose of rhMPV/\u0394M2-2 were protected from challenge with 10 6 PFU of wild type (wt) hMPV/NL/1/ 00. Our results suggest that hMPV M2-2 alters regulation of transcription and influences the fidelity of the polymerase complex during viral genome replication. In the hamster model, rhMPV\u0394M2-2 is attenuated and protective suggesting that deletion of M2-2 may result in a potential live vaccine candidate. A more thorough knowledge of the hMPV polymerase complex and the role of M2-2 during hMPV replication are being studied as we develop a potential live hMPV vaccine candidate that lacks M2-2 expression. \n Title: Virology Journal Deletion of human metapneumovirus M2-2 increases mutation frequency and attenuates growth in hamsters", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Despite advances in prevention strategies, such as antibiotic therapies and intensive care, significant improvement in the mortality rate is still lacking. This high mortality is largely due to the limitations in current clinical practices and laboratory tests, which delay the timing of adequate antibiotic therapy. In recent years, many indicators (biomarkers) are present in scenarios where infectious pathogens invade into the body. These biomarkers, as reflected in specific biological responses to infections, have been reported to demonstrate the ability to facilitate the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of pneumonia. This review provides a schematic overview of these new potential biomarkers based on the categories of (1) microorganisms and their derivatives, (2) inflammation mediators, (3) inflammation response proteins, and (4) stress-sensing proteins. In addition, approaches to identifying new biomarkers are also briefly introduced.

Methods-We sought to determine prospectively the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in these children, using multiplexed-PCR. Results-We enrolled 253 children with upper, or lower respiratory tract infection (URTI/LRTI) during a one year period. A respiratory virus was detected in 193 (76%) patients; 156 (81%) patients had URTI. Human rhinovirus was the most common virus detected in 97 (62%) and 24 (65%) patients with URTI and LRTI, respectively. Leukemia or lymphoma (LL) was the most common underlying diagnosis in 95 (49%) patients followed by solid tumor 47 (24%), posthematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) 28 (15%), and brain tumor in 23 (12%) patients. By multiple logistic regression analysis hBoV was the most commonly detected respiratory virus in patients with LRTI (P = 0.008; odds ratio, 4.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-13.79). Coinfection with more than 1 virus was present in 47 (24%) patients, and did not increase the risk for LRTI.

However, the molecular diversity and epidemiology of PEDV in different provinces has not been completely understood. To determine the molecular diversity of PEDV in the Hubei Province of China, we collected 172 PED samples from 34 farms across the province in 2016 and performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Seventy-four samples were found to be PEDVpositive. We further characterized the complete spike (S) glycoprotein genes from the positive samples and found 21 different S genes with amino acid mutations. The PEDV isolates here presented most of the genotypes which were found previously in field isolates in East and South-East Asia, North America, and Europe. Besides the typical Genotypes I and II, the INDEX groups were also found. Importantly, 58 new amino acids mutant sites in the S genes, including 44 sites in S1 and 14 sites in S2, were first described.

Additionally, of those who survive, many are discharged to a subacute facility with persistent organ failure where they will eventually die. Furthermore, those discharged to a subacute care facility have a higher mortality rate compared to those discharged home (31 vs. 17%). The decision to admit an elderly patient to an ICU should be based not only on their comorbidities, acuity of illness, and prehospital functional status, including quality of life, but also on their preference for the use of life-sustaining treatments if it is known. The underlying disease process is not altered despite the use of invasive procedures in terminally ill patients, and potential harm or discomfort can occur if invasive procedures are used inappropriately. To avoid such unintended consequences and enhance optimal end-of-life decision making, healthcare providers need to identify, explain, and negotiate consensus therapeutic goals.

To resolve these alternative hypotheses, we isolated viral sequences from FCoV-infected clinically healthy and sick cats (8 FIP cases and 48 FECV-asymptomatic animals); 735 sequences from 4 gene segments were generated and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Viral sequences from healthy cats were distinct from sick cats on the basis of genetic distances observed in the membrane and nonstructural protein 7b genes. These data demonstrate distinctive circulating virulent and avirulent strains in natural populations. In addition, 5 membrane protein amino acid residues with functional potential differentiated healthy cats from cats with FIP. These findings may have potential as diagnostic markers for virulent FIP-associated FCoV. \n Title: Genetics and Pathogenesis of Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Four groups of 30 molecules each were considered: oxadiazolone, oxadiazolthione, thiadiazolone, and thiadiazolthione isomers. The compounds were categorized into six groups according to permutations of three heteroatoms in the five-membered ring. Additionally, each of the constitutional isomer was considered to have five tautomers conserving stable five-membered ring: two NH tautomers, two rotameric OH (or SH) forms and one CH 2 tautomer. It appeared that the largest difference between oxadiazolone O and S analogues is produced by the kind of chalcogen atom in the ring, which is strained when the O atom is in the ring while much less strained when the S-atom, of much larger van der Waals radius, is built into the ring. The external chalcogen is only modifying the general energetic factors. The comparison of energetics of analogous groups of molecules with thiadiazole and oxadiazole rings is done in details as well as differences resulting from different external chalcogen atoms are discussed as well. The presence of water surrounding was mimicked with the IEF-PCM implicit water model which did not change general isomer relative stability picture, but for some special cases indicated an extra stability of the forms with external OH or SH groups. The aromaticity monitored by the structural HOMA aromaticity index shows that the systems are not additionally stabilized by pi-electron delocalization. The fair linear correlation between the aromaticity indices of oxadiazolones and oxadiazolthiones shows that the pi-electron system in the studied systems is not sensitive to change of the external chalcogen group. \n Title: On constitutional isomers and tautomers of oxadiazolones and their mono- and disulfur analogues (C 2 H 2 N 2 XY; X, Y = S, O)", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in southern Africa necessitates the development of cheap, effective vaccines. One means of production is the use of plants, for which a number of different techniques have been successfully developed. HIV-1 Pr55Gag is a promising HIV-1 vaccine candidate: we compared the expression of this and a truncated Gag (p17/p24) and the p24 capsid subunit in Nicotiana spp. using transgenic plants and transient expression via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and recombinant tobamovirus vectors. We also investigated the influence of subcellular localisation of recombinant protein to the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on protein yield. We partially purified a selected vaccine candidate and tested its stimulation of a humoral and cellular immune response in mice. Both transient and transgenic expression of the HIV antigens were successful, although expression of Pr55Gag was low in all systems; however, the Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of p24 and p17/p24 yielded best, to more than 1 mg p24/kg fresh weight. Chloroplast targeted protein levels were highest in transient and transgenic expression of p24 and p17/p24. The transiently-expressed p17/p24 was not immunogenic in mice as a homologous vaccine, but it significantly boosted a humoral and T cell immune response primed by a gag DNA vaccine, pTHGagC. Conclusion: Transient agroinfiltration was best for expression of all of the recombinant proteins tested, and p24 and p17/p24 were expressed at much higher levels than Pr55Gag. Our results highlight the usefulness of plastid signal peptides in enhancing the production of recombinant proteins meant for use as vaccines. The p17/p24 protein effectively boosted T cell and humoral responses in mice primed by the DNA vaccine pTHGagC, showing that this plant-produced protein has potential for use as a vaccine. \n Title: Expression of HIV-1 antigens in plants as potential subunit vaccines", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Previously, we demonstrated that in the related cardiovirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, a programmed \u060a1 ribosomal frameshift (\u060a1 PRF) occurs at a conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence within the 2B-encoding region of the polyprotein open reading frame (ORF). Here we show that \u060a1 PRF occurs at a similar site during translation of the TMEV genome. In addition, we demonstrate that a predicted 3= RNA stem-loop structure at a noncanonical spacing downstream of the shift site is required for efficient frameshifting in TMEV and that frameshifting also requires virus infection. Mutating the G_GUU_UUU shift site to inhibit frameshifting results in an attenuated virus with reduced growth kinetics and a small-plaque phenotype. Frameshifting in the virus context was found to be extremely efficient at 74 to 82%, which, to our knowledge, is the highest frameshifting efficiency recorded to date for any virus. We propose that highly efficient \u060a1 PRF in TMEV provides a mechanism to escape the confines of equimolar expression normally inherent in the single-polyprotein expression strategy of picornaviruses. Many viruses utilize programmed \u060a1 ribosomal frameshifting (\u060a1 PRF) to produce different protein products at a defined ratio, or to translate overlapping ORFs to increase coding capacity. With few exceptions, \u060a1 PRF occurs on specific \"slippery\" heptanucleotide sequences and is stimulated by RNA structure beginning 5 to 9 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the slippery site. Here we describe an unusual case of \u060a1 PRF in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) that is extraordinarily efficient (74 to 82% of ribosomes shift into the alternative reading frame) and, in stark contrast to other examples of \u060a1 PRF, is dependent upon a stem-loop structure beginning 14 nt downstream of the slippery site. Furthermore, in TMEV-based reporter constructs in transfected cells, efficient frameshifting is critically dependent upon virus infection. We suggest that TMEV evolved frameshifting as a novel mechanism for removing ribosomes from the message (a \"ribosome sink\") to downregulate synthesis of the 3=-encoded replication proteins. \n Title: Characterization of Ribosomal Frameshifting in Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Control of these organisms has largely focused within individual hospitals. We examine the extent to which transfers of critically ill patients could be a vector for wide spread of highly resistant organisms, and compare the efficiency of different approaches to targeting infection control resources. analyzed the network of interhospital transfers of intensive care unit patients in 2005 U.S. Medicare data and 2004-2006 Pennsylvania all-payer data. We simulated spread of highly resistant hospital-acquired infections by randomly choosing a single hospital to develop a highly resistant organism and following spread of infection or colonization throughout the network under varying strategies of infection control and varying levels of infectivity. Results-Critical care transfers could spread a highly resistant organism between any two U.S. hospitals in a median of three years. Hospitals varied substantially in their importance to limiting potential spread. Targeting resources to a small subset of hospitals based on their position in the transfer network was 16 times more efficient than distributing infection control resources uniformly. Within any set of targeted hospitals, the best strategy for infection control heavily concentrated resources at a few particularly important hospitals, regardless of level of infectivity. Conclusions-Critical care transfers provide a plausible vector for wide-spread dissemination of highly resistant hospital-acquired microorganisms.

Using sequence alignments spanning a range of betacoronaviruses, we rank genomic regions by RNA sequence conservation, identifying 79 regions of length at least 15 nucleotides as exactly conserved over SARS-related complete genome sequences available near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. We then confirm the conservation of the majority of these genome regions across 739 SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported to date from the current COVID-19 outbreak, and we present a curated list of 30 'SARS-relatedconserved' regions. We find that known RNA structured elements curated as Rfam families and in prior literature are enriched in these conserved genome regions, and we predict additional conserved, stable secondary structures across the viral genome. We provide 106 'SARS-CoV-2conserved-structured' regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA. We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the 5\u00b4 UTR, frame-shifting element, and 3\u00b4 UTR.

Here, we reveal key features underlying the biochemical mechanism of target recognition and cleavage by the SOX endonuclease encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Using purified KSHV SOX protein, we reconstituted the cleavage reaction in vitro and reveal that SOX displays robust, sequence-specific RNA binding to residues proximal to the cleavage site, which must be presented in a particular structural context. The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of mRNA susceptibility observed in cells. Importantly, we establish that cleavage site specificity does not require additional cellular cofactors, as had been previously proposed. Thus, viral endonucleases may use a combination of RNA sequence and structure to capture a broad set of mRNA targets while still preserving selectivity. \n Title: Site specific target binding controls RNA cleavage efficiency by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus endonuclease SOX", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

With the continuing human outbreak of H5N1 beginning in 2003 and the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, focus on influenza and other respiratory viruses has been increased. It has been accepted for decades that international travel via jet aircraft is a major vector for global spread of influenza, and epidemiological differences between tropical and temperate regions observed. Thus we wanted to study how indoor environmental conditions (enclosed locations) in the tropics and winter temperate zones contribute to the aerosol spread of influenza by travelers. To this end, a survey consisting of 632 readings of temperature (T) versus relative humidity (RH) in 389 different enclosed locations air travelers are likely to visit in 8 tropical nations were compared to 102 such readings in 2 Australian cities, including ground transport, hotels, shops, offices and other publicly accessible locations, along with 586 time course readings from aircraft. Results: An influenza transmission risk contour map was developed for T versus RH. Empirical equations were created for estimating: 1. risk relative to temperature and RH, and 2. time parameterized influenza transmission risk. Using the transmission risk contours and equations, transmission risk for each country's locations was compared with influenza reports from the countries. Higher risk enclosed locations in the tropics included new automobile transport, luxury buses, luxury hotels, and bank branches. Most temperate locations were high risk. Environmental control is recommended for public health mitigation focused on higher risk enclosed locations. Public health can make use of the methods developed to track potential vulnerability to aerosol influenza. The methods presented can also be used in influenza modeling. Accounting for differential aerosol transmission using T and RH can potentially explain anomalies of influenza epidemiology in addition to seasonality in temperate climates. \n Title: Open Access RES EARCH Aerosol influenza transmission risk contours: A study of humid tropics versus winter temperate zone", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Our objectives were to define HMPV epidemiology and circulating strains and determine markers of severe disease in Jordanian children. Methods-We conducted a prospective study March 16, 2010-March 31, 2013 using quantitative RT-PCR to determine the frequency of HMPV infection among children <2 years old admitted with fever and/or acute respiratory illness to a major government hospital in Amman, Jordan. Results-HMPV was present in 273/3168 (8.6%) of children presenting with ARTI. HMPV A2, B1, and B2, but not A1, were detected during the 3-year period. HMPV-infected children were older and more likely to be diagnosed with bronchopneumonia than HMPV-negative children. HMPV-infected children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) had higher rates of cough and shortness of breath than children with LRTI infected with other or no identifiable viruses. Symptoms and severity were not different between children with HMPV only compared with HMPV co-infection. Children with HMPV subgroup A infection were more likely to require supplemental oxygen. In a multivariate analysis, HMPV subgroup A and age <6 months were independently associated with supplemental oxygen requirement. Conclusions-HMPV is a leading cause of acute respiratory tract disease in Jordanian children <2 years old. HMPV A and young age were associated with severe disease. Ninety percent of HMPV-infected hospitalized children were full-term and otherwise healthy, in contrast to high-income nations; thus, factors contributing to disease severity likely vary depending on geographic and resource differences. \n Title: Human Metapneumovirus Infection in Jordanian Children: Epidemiology and Risk Factors for Severe Disease", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Thus, it is important to expand our knowledge of the presence of viruses in bats which could represent a risk to humans. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been reported in bat species from Thailand, China, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. However no such work was conducted in Cambodia or Lao PDR. Between 2010 and 2013, 1965 bats were therefore sampled at interfaces with human populations in these two countries. They were tested for the presence of coronavirus by consensus reverse transcription-PCR assay. A total of 93 samples (4.7%) from 17 genera of bats tested positive. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of potentially 37 and 56 coronavirus belonging to alpha-coronavirus (\u03b1CoV) and beta-CoV (\u03b2CoV), respectively. The \u03b2CoVs group is known to include some coronaviruses highly pathogenic to human, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. All coronavirus sequences generated from frugivorous bats (family Pteropodidae) (n = 55) clustered with other bat \u03b2CoVs of lineage D, whereas one coronavirus from Pipistrellus coromandra fell in the lineage C of \u03b2CoVs which also includes the MERS-CoV. \u03b1CoVs were all detected in various genera of insectivorous bats and clustered with diverse bat \u03b1CoV sequences previously published.

Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an 51 important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these 52 interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma 53 has not yet been explored. This study aims to determine the levels of the IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, 54 IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association 55 between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The present, 56 a case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University 57 Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided 58 into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 59 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 60 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 61 (ELISA). 62 There was no significant correlation between the IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 levels and the lesions size 63 and disease duration, whereas levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were significantly correlated with 64 that. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of 65 mycetoma showed a significant negative association with IL-1\u03b2 cytokine, where a unit 66 increment in IL-1\u03b2 will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that occurred in Hong Kong in 2003 caused serious public health consequences. Its impacts on health-seeking behaviors of the general public have not been assessed. Methods. Two cross-sectional, random telephone surveys interviewed 1603 Hong Kong adult residents in the post-SARS epidemic period, June and September 2003 to investigate changes in the post-SARS period. Results. Noteworthy percentages of the respondents self-reported increased frequencies of practicing favorable health-seeking behaviors in June 2003, as compared with the pre-SARS period. Few respondents reported the opposite. This was observed in different dimensions: health services seeking, adoption of healthier lifestyle, spending more resources on health, adoption of good personal hygiene, mask use when ill with influenza, and avoidance of risk behaviors. The frequencies of practicing most of these health-seeking behaviors, as measured in June and September 2003, were comparable. Further increases in healthy diet and weight control, etc., were observed during that period. Those who worried about contracting SARS were more likely to have improved health-seeking behaviors.

Fifty-two infants <1 year old treated in the emergency department at University Hospital of Padova for acute bronchiolitis were enrolled (77% tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). Follow-up visits were conducted for 2 years after the episode of bronchiolitis.

Since the first report of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) outbreak, tremendous efforts to control this disease, including various national policies and plans incorporating the use of multiple modified live-virus vaccines, have been made. However, PRRSV is still a significant threat to the swine industry, and new variants continually emerge as a result of PRRSV evolution. Several studies have shown that pandemic PRRSV strains have enormous genetic diversity and that commercial vaccines can only provide partial protection against these strains. Therefore, effective anti-PRRSV drugs may be more suitable and reliable for PRRSV control.

We recently introduced Cavbase, a method for describing and comparing protein binding pockets on the basis of the geometrical and physicochemical properties of their active sites. Here, we present algorithmic and methodological enhancements in the Cavbase property description and in the cavity comparison step. We give examples of the Cavbase similarity analysis detecting pronounced similarities in the binding sites of proteins unrelated in sequence. A similarity search using SARS M pro protease subpockets as queries retrieved ligands and ligand fragments accommodated in a physicochemical environment similar to that of the query. This allowed the characterization of the protease recognition pockets and the identification of molecular building blocks that can be incorporated into novel antiviral compounds. A cluster analysis procedure for the functional classification of binding pockets was implemented and calibrated using a diverse set of enzyme binding sites. Two relevant protein families, the a-carbonic anhydrases and the protein kinases, are used to demonstrate the scope of our cluster approach. We propose a relevant classification of both protein families, on the basis of the binding motifs in their active sites. The classification provides a new perspective on functional properties across a protein family and is able to highlight features important for potency and selectivity. Furthermore, this information can be used to identify possible cross-reactivities among proteins due to similarities in their binding sites. \n Title: From the Similarity Analysis of Protein Cavities to the Functional Classification of Protein Families Using Cavbase Keywords: protein binding pockets; classification of protein binding pockets; cluster analysis of protein binding pockets; protein kinases; SARS protease", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Herein we describe a cohort of 57 patients (age 18-68 years) with secondary syphilis (SS) identified through a network of public sector primary health care providers in Cali, Colombia. To be eligible for participation, study subjects were required to have cutaneous lesions consistent with SS, a reactive Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR-titer $1:4), and a confirmatory treponemal test (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption test-FTA-ABS). Most subjects enrolled were women (64.9%), predominantly Afro-Colombian (38.6%) or mestizo (56.1%), and all were of low socio-economic status. Three (5.3%) subjects were newly diagnosed with HIV infection at study entry. The duration of signs and symptoms in most patients (53.6%) was less than 30 days; however, some patients reported being symptomatic for several months (range 5-240 days). The typical palmar and plantar exanthem of SS was the most common dermal manifestation (63%), followed by diffuse hypo-or hyperpigmented macules and papules on the trunk, abdomen and extremities. Three patients had patchy alopecia. Whole blood (WB) samples and punch biopsy material from a subset of SS patients were assayed for the presence of Tp DNA polymerase I gene (polA) target by real-time qualitative and quantitative PCR methods. Twelve (46%) of the 26 WB samples studied had quantifiable Tp DNA (ranging between 194.9 and 1954.2 Tp polA copies/ml blood) and seven (64%) were positive when WB DNA was extracted within 24 hours of collection. Tp DNA was also present in 8/12 (66%) skin biopsies available for testing. Strain typing analysis was attempted in all skin and WB samples with detectable Tp DNA. Using arp repeat size analysis and tpr RFLP patterns four different strain types were identified (14d, 16d, 13d and 22a). None of the WB samples had sufficient DNA for typing. The clinical and microbiologic observations presented herein, together with recent Cali syphilis seroprevalence data, provide additional evidence that venereal syphilis is highly endemic in this region of Colombia, thus underscoring the need for health care providers in the region to be acutely aware of the clinical manifestations of SS. This study also provides, for the first time, quantitative evidence that a significant proportion of untreated SS patients have substantial numbers of circulating spirochetes. How Tp is able to persist in the blood and skin of SS patients, despite the known presence of circulating treponemal opsonizing antibodies and the robust pro-inflammatory cellular immune responses characteristic of this stage of the disease, is not fully understood and requires further study. \n Title: Secondary Syphilis in Cali, Colombia: New Concepts in Disease Pathogenesis", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Cav-1 proteins are highly conserved during evolution from Caenorhabditis elegans to human and are capable of interacting with many signaling molecules through their caveolin scaffolding domains to regulate the activities of multiple signaling pathways. Thus, Cav-1 plays crucial roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in a cell-specific and contextual manner. In addition, Cav-1 is essential for embryonic development of vertebrates owing to its regulation of BMP, Wnt, TGF-\u03b2 and other key signaling molecules. Moreover, Cav-1 is mainly expressed in terminally differentiated cells and its abnormal expression is often associated with human diseases, such as tumor progression, cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis, lung regeneration, and diseases related to virus. In this review, we will further discuss the potential of Cav-1 as a target for disease therapy and multiple drug resistance. \n Title: New glimpses of caveolin-1 functions in embryonic development and human diseases", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Qingfei Xiaoyan Wan (QF), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, has been used clinically in China for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, acute or chronic bronchitis and pulmonary infection. In this study, the effects of QF on Pseudomonas aeruginosainduced acute pneumonia in mice were evaluated. The mechanisms by which four typical antiinflammatory ingredients from QF, arctigenin (ATG), cholic acid (CLA), chlorogenic acid (CGA) and sinapic acid (SPA), regulate anti-inflammatory signaling pathways and related targets were investigated using molecular biology and molecular docking techniques. The results showed that pretreatment with QF significantly inhibits the release of cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8 and RANTES), reduces leukocytes recruitment into inflamed tissues and ameliorates pulmonary edema and necrosis. In ;6(3):212-221 addition, ATG was identified as the primary anti-inflammatory agent with action on the PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK pathways. CLA and CGA enhanced the actions of ATG and exhibited synergistic NF-\u03baB inactivation effects possibly via the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, CLA is speculated to target FGFR and MEK firstly. Overall, QF regulated the PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK pathways to inhibit pathogenic bacterial infections effectively. \n Title: Qingfei Xiaoyan Wan, a traditional Chinese medicine formula, ameliorates Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced acute lung inflammation by regulation of PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK pathways-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Preliminary IRT imaging demonstrated that foot temperatures increased in FMDVinfected animals. The maximum foot temperatures of healthy (n = 53), directly inoculated (DI) (n = 12), contact (CT) (n = 6), and vaccine trial (VT) (n = 21) cattle were measured over the course of FMD infection. A cut-off value was established at 34.4\u00b0C (sensitivity = 61.1%, specificity = 87.7%) with the aim of detecting FMDV-infected animals both before and after clinical signs were observed. Seven of 12 (58%) DI and 3/6 (50%) CT animals showed maximum foot temperatures exceeding the 34.4\u00b0C cut-off before the development of foot vesicles. In contrast, only 5/21 (24%) VT animals displayed pre-clinical foot temperatures above this cut-off possibly indicating partial vaccine protection of this group. These results show IRT as a promising screening technology to quickly identify potentially infected animals for confirmatory diagnostic testing during FMD outbreaks. Further evaluation of this technology is needed to determine the value of IRT in detecting animals with mild clinical signs or sub-clinical infections.

Here, we explore the possibility that those species that tolerate or do well in human-modified environments, or 'synanthropic' species, are predominantly the hosts of zoonotic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). We do this using global wildlife conservation data and wildlife host information extracted from systematically reviewed emerging infectious disease literature. The evidence for this relationship is examined with special emphasis on the Australasian, South East Asian and East Asian regions. We find that synanthropic wildlife hosts are approximately 15 times more likely than other wildlife in this region to be the source of emerging infectious diseases, and this association is essentially independent of the taxonomy of the species. A significant positive association with EIDs is also evident for those wildlife species of low conservation risk. Since the increase and spread of native and introduced species able to adapt to human-induced landscape change is at the expense of those species most vulnerable to habitat loss, our findings suggest a mechanism linking land conversion, global decline in biodiversity and a rise in EIDs of wildlife origin. \n Title: Synanthropy of Wild Mammals as a Determinant of Emerging Infectious Diseases in the Asian-Australasian Region", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

We aimed to evaluate the difference of clinical features in children with MP, according to their age and chest radiographic patterns. The diagnosis of MP was made by examinations at both admission and discharge and by two serologic tests: the indirect microparticle agglutinin assay (\u22651:40) and the cold agglutinins titer (\u22651:32). A total of 191 children with MP were grouped by age: \u22642 years of age (29 patients), 3-5 years of age (81 patients), and \u22656 years of age (81 patients). They were also grouped by pneumonia pattern: bronchopneumonia group (96 patients) and segmental/lobar pneumonia group (95 patients). Results: Eighty-six patients (45%) were seroconverters, and the others showed increased antibody titers during hospitalization. Among the three age groups, the oldest children showed the longest duration of fever, highest Creactive protein (CRP) values, and the most severe pneumonia pattern. The patients with segmental/lobar pneumonia were older and had longer fever duration and lower white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts, compared with those with bronchopneumonia. The patient group with the most severe pulmonary lesions had the most prolonged fever, highest CRP, highest rate of seroconverters, and lowest lymphocyte counts. Thrombocytosis was observed in 8% of patients at admission, but in 33% of patients at discharge. In MP, older children had more prolonged fever and more severe pulmonary lesions. The severity of pulmonary lesions was associated with the absence of diagnostic IgM antibodies at presentation and lymphocyte count. Short-term paired IgM serologic test may be mandatory for early and definitive diagnosis of MP. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is an important causative organism of respiratory infections in children and young adults. M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MP) has been reported in 10-40% of community-acquired pneumonia cases, and recent studies have indicated that younger children (<5 years of age), as well as school-aged children, are prone to M. pneumoniae infection [1-6]. In Korea, M. pneumoniae epidemics have occurred every 3-4 years since the 1980s; in the most recent epidemics, the peak age was younger than that seen previously [6] . However, few studies have attempted a clinical comparison of MP according to age [4, 5] .

In addition, TMV(24A+UPD) had a higher viral RNAs accumulation than TMV in N. benthamiana protoplasts, and induced lethal symptoms in the infected plants. TMV(62A+UPD) showed a drastically reduced accumulation, its coat protein was undetectable in protoplasts, and the inoculated plants remained symptomless. This study analyzed the structures of 3\u2032-UTR of TMV and found that the longer poly(A) tract introduced upstream of UPD reduced viral RNAs accumulation and induced milder symptoms in N. benthamiana. In conclusion, different lengths of the internal poly(A) tract introduced into the TMV 3\u2032UTR lead to structural variations that affect virus accumulation and symptom expression. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Tobamovirus. TMV has a wide host range and the symptoms vary with plant species and environmental conditions. In the field, tobacco plants infected by TMV show a typical mosaic pattern of light and dark green colour on the leaves, and distortion of newly emerged leaves. In the greenhouse, TMV infected N. benthamiana plants show severe leaf necrosis and stem collapse, leading to plant death within a few days. Similar to other tobamoviruses, the genome of the TMV-U1 strain 1,2 encodes four major proteins, two RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (p126/p183), a movement protein (p30) and a coat protein (p17.5), which are essential for virus replication, cell-to-cell and long distance movement in plants 3-5 , respectively. A poly(CAA) segment of nucleotides located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) serves as a binding site for the host heat shock protein, HSP101, which is essential for viral translation. The poly(CAA) sequence is functionally similar to a 5\u2032 -cap or a poly(A) tail that recruits host elongation factor eIF4F for viral translation 6-8 . In TMV 3\u2032 -UTR, five pseudoknots (PKs) are present. Three belong to an upstream pseudoknots domain (UPD), and two are located in the tRNA-like structure (TLS) 9,10 . TMV UPD plays an important role in both viral replication and translation. Mutational analysis shows that UPD could interact with eEF1A/GTP with high affinity, and the PK2 and PK3 of the UPD located immediately upstream of the TLS are involved 11,12 . Polyadenylation is known to function in regulating RNA stability and translation. The importance of the poly(A) tail to viral infectivity has been reported in some viruses and the poly(A) length could also affect virus replication 13-16 . A poly(A) tail of sufficient length in Bamboo mosaic virus interacts with secondary structural elements upstream to form a pseudoknot structure, and disruption of this interaction reduces virus accumulation 17,18 . Several plant viral RNAs do not have a poly(A) tail, but possess an internal polyadenylate sequence in the 3\u2032 terminal region of their genomes 19 . The length of the poly(A) tract varies in different viruses. So far, internal poly(A) tracts are found in bromoviruses, hordeiviruses, and tymoviruses 20 . Dulcamara mottle virus possesses an internal poly(A) tract in the 3\u2032 -UTR which lacks a 3\u2032 -terminal tRNA-like sequence (TLS). This is different from other tymoviruses 21 . In recent years, two tobamoviruses isolated from Hibiscus spp. were reported to contain an internal poly(A) tract upstream of 3\u2032 -TLS. They are Hibiscus latent Singapore virus (HLSV) 22 and Hibiscus latent Fort Pierce virus 23,24 . The length of HLSV internal poly(A) tract ranges from 78 to 96 nt 22 . HLSV is unable to replicate when the length of internal poly(A) tract is less than 24 nt 25 . Therefore, the 24 nt internal poly(A) tract is the minimal length required for HLSV replication in N. benthamiana. Moreover, HLSV is unable to replicate if the internal poly(A) tract is substituted by TMV UPD sequences, indicating that the internal poly(A) tract is not replaceable. This is different from previous studies that the UPD can functionally substitute for a poly(A) tail in plant and animal cells 26 . In general, the 3\u2032 -UTR is considered as a modular element that largely provides self-contained functions. The TLS mimics the tRNA structure, and it enhances virus translation and promotes minus-strand synthesis 27,28 . In vitro competition experiments reveal that the TMV-TLS has the highest binding affinity for RNA polymerase 29 . Deletion studies of UPD showed that the pseudoknot which is closest to the TLS is essential for TMV replication 11 . It is known that the pseudoknot structure, not sequences in UPD, plays an important role in virus replication. The poly(A) tract is a simple RNA element and its length affects virus replication efficiency of HLSV. In this study, a series of TMV mutants were constructed with different lengths of internal poly(A) tract. The internal poly(A) tract is positioned upstream of UPD in the TMV genome. Results showed that TMV(24A+ UPD) possessed the highest infectivity and induced most severe lethal symptoms. The accumulation of viral RNAs induced by TMV(24A+ UPD) was higher than that of TMV in N. benthamiana. TMV(42A+ UPD) induced necrosis in the inoculated leaves, and systemic movement to the upper leaves was slower than that of TMV(24A+ UPD). The accumulation of viral RNAs of TMV(62A+ UPD) declined rapidly in N. benthamiana protoplasts and infected plants were symptomless after inoculation. The RNA structures of the mutated TMV fragments were subjected to selective 2\u2032 -hydroxyl acylation analyzed by the primer extension (SHAPE) method. Structural change in the 3\u2032 -UTR was dependent on the length of the poly(A) tract that was introduced upstream of the UPD in TMV genomes, and the longer the tract, the lower the viral RNAs accumulation and its infectivity. \n Title: TMV mutants with poly(A) tracts of different lengths demonstrate structural variations in 3\u2032UTR affecting viral RNAs accumulation and symptom expression OPEN", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Due to limited genomic and transcriptomic data, the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin, the major bioactive compound in G. uralensis, is currently unclear. Identification of candidate genes involved in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway will significantly contribute to the understanding of the biosynthetic and medicinal chemistry of this compound. We used the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium regents to produce a substantial expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset from the vegetative organs of G. uralensis. A total of 59,219 ESTs with an average read length of 409 bp were generated. 454 ESTs were combined with the 50,666 G. uralensis ESTs in GenBank. The combined ESTs were assembled into 27,229 unique sequences (11,694 contigs and 15,535 singletons). A total of 20,437 unique gene elements representing approximately 10,000 independent transcripts were annotated using BLAST searches (e-value \u2264 1e-5) against the SwissProt, KEGG, TAIR, Nr and Nt databases. The assembled sequences were annotated with gene names and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. With respect to the genes related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, genes encoding 16 enzymes of the 18 total steps of the glycyrrhizin skeleton synthesis pathway were found. To identify novel genes that encode cytochrome P450 enzymes and glycosyltransferases, which are related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, a total of 125 and 172 unigenes were found to be homologous to cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, respectively. The cytochrome P450 candidate genes were classified into 32 CYP families, while the glycosyltransferase candidate genes were classified into 45 categories by GO analysis. Finally, 3 cytochrome P450 enzymes and 6 glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis through an organ-specific expression pattern analysis based on real-time PCR. Conclusions: Using the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium reagents, our study provides a high-quality EST database for G. uralensis. Based on the EST analysis, novel candidate genes related to the secondary metabolite pathway of glycyrrhizin, including novel genes encoding cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, were found. With the assistance of organ-specific expression pattern analysis, 3 unigenes encoding cytochrome P450s and 6 unigenes encoding glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. \n Title: EST analysis reveals putative genes involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

In recent years, the cellular distribution and biological functions of FPRs have expanded to include additional roles in homeostasis of organ functions and modulation of inflammation. In a prototype, FPRs recognize peptides containing N-formylated methionine such as those produced in bacteria and mitochondria, thereby serving as pattern recognition receptors. The repertoire of FPR ligands, however, has expanded rapidly to include not only N-formyl peptides from microbes but also non-formyl peptides of microbial and host origins, synthetic small molecules and an eicosanoid. How these chemically diverse ligands are recognized by the three human FPRs (FPR1, FPR2 and FPR3) and their murine equivalents is largely unclear. In the absence of crystal structures for the FPRs, site-directed mutagenesis, computer-aided ligand docking and structural simulation have led to the identification of amino acids within FPR1 and FPR2 that interact with several formyl peptides.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of BCoV infections and their genetic diversity in Uruguayan calves and to describe the evolutionary history of the virus in South America. The overall detection rate of BCoV in Uruguay was 7.8% (64/824): 7.7% (60/782) in dairy cattle and 9.5% (4/42) in beef cattle. The detection rate of BCoV in samples from deceased and live calves was 10.0% (6/60) and 7.6% (58/763), respectively. Interestingly, there was a lower frequency of BCoV detection in calves born to vaccinated dams (3.3%, 8/240) than in calves born to unvaccinated dams (12.2%, 32/263) (OR: 4.02, 95%CI: 1.81-8.90; p = 0.00026). The frequency of BCoV detection was higher in colder months (11.8%, 44/373) than in warmer months (1.5%, 3/206) (OR: 9.05, 95%CI: 2.77-29.53, p = 0.000013). Uruguayan strains grouped together in two different lineages: one with Argentinean strains and the other with Brazilian strains. Both BCoV lineages were estimated to have entered Uruguay in 2013: one of them from Brazil (95%HPD interval: 2011 and the other from Argentina (95%HPD interval: 2010-2014). The lineages differed by four amino acid changes, and both were divergent from the Mebus reference strain. Surveillance should be maintained to detect possible emerging strains that can clearly diverge at the antigenic level from vaccine strains. \n Title: Bovine coronavirus in Uruguay: genetic diversity, risk factors and transboundary introductions from neighboring countries", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Recent trials suggest procalcitonin-based guidelines can reduce antibiotic use for respiratory infections. However, the accuracy of procalcitonin to discriminate between viral and bacterial pneumonia requires further dissection. Methods. We evaluated the association between serum procalcitonin concentration at hospital admission with pathogens detected in a multicenter prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. Systematic pathogen testing included cultures, serology, urine antigen tests, and molecular detection. Accuracy of procalcitonin to discriminate between viral and bacterial pathogens was calculated. Results. Among 1735 patients, pathogens were identified in 645 (37%), including 169 (10%) with typical bacteria, 67 (4%) with atypical bacteria, and 409 (24%) with viruses only. Median procalcitonin concentration was lower with viral pathogens (0.09 ng/ mL; interquartile range [IQR], <0.05-0.54 ng/mL) than atypical bacteria (0.20 ng/mL; IQR, <0.05-0.87 ng/mL; P = .05), and typical bacteria (2.5 ng/mL; IQR, 0.29-12.2 ng/mL; P < .01). Procalcitonin discriminated bacterial pathogens, including typical and atypical bacteria, from viral pathogens with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], .69-.77). A procalcitonin threshold of 0.1 ng/mL resulted in 80.9% (95% CI, 75.3%-85.7%) sensitivity and 51.6% (95% CI, 46.6%-56.5%) specificity for identification of any bacterial pathogen. Procalcitonin discriminated between typical bacteria and the combined group of viruses and atypical bacteria with an area under the ROC curve of 0.79 (95% CI, .75-.82). Conclusions. No procalcitonin threshold perfectly discriminated between viral and bacterial pathogens, but higher procalcitonin strongly correlated with increased probability of bacterial pathogens, particularly typical bacteria. \n Title: Clinical Infectious Diseases Clinical Infectious Diseases \u00ae 2017;65(2):183-90 Procalcitonin as a Marker of Etiology in Adults Hospitalized With Community-Acquired Pneumonia", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Methods: CAP patients from 12 teaching hospitals were prospectively and consecutively recruited. Basic and clinical information, throat swabs and paired sera were collected. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by IgG and IgM antibody tests, fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) and culture. A comparative study of the diagnostic values of three methods, including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was conducted. A fourfold or greater increase of IgG antibody titers of paired sera was set as the diagnostic \"gold standard\". Results: One hundred and twenty-five CAP patients (52.8% males, median age 47 years, range 14-85) were enrolled. Twenty-seven (21.6%) patients were diagnosed with acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections by the \"gold standard\". Specificity values of all three methods were around 90%.

Conclusions: In the defined group of patients, there was a good agreement between positive rate of MP cultivation of throat swabs and acute M. pneumoniae infection (PLR of 10.9).

To better define the role of Waddlia in both miscarriage and pneumonia, a tool allowing large-scale serological investigations of Waddlia seropositivity is needed. Therefore, enriched outer membrane proteins of W. chondrophila were used as antigens to develop a specific ELISA. After thorough analytical optimization, the ELISA was validated by comparison with micro-immunofluorescence and it showed a sensitivity above 85% with 100% specificity. The ELISA was subsequently applied to human sera to specify the role of W. chondrophila in pneumonia. Overall, 3.6% of children showed antibody reactivity against W. chondrophila but no significant difference was observed between children with and without pneumonia. Proteomic analyses were then performed using mass spectrometry, highlighting members of the outer membrane protein family as the dominant proteins. The major Waddlia putative immunogenic proteins were identified by immunoblot using positive and negative human sera. The new ELISA represents an efficient tool with high throughput applications.

Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high-and low-risk groups in Qatar. A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP. Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%). Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT). The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT. Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT. All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63). Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT. In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21). The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays. \n Title: Comparative Serological Study for the Prevalence of Anti-MERS Coronavirus Antibodies in High-and Low-Risk Groups in Qatar", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Methods: This randomized crossover study evaluated 23 healthcare providers. Quantitative fit tests (QNFTs) were performed before and after training using three types of N95 or higher filter respirators (cup-type, fold-type, valve-type).

The genus Norovirus includes seven genogroups (designated GI-GVII), of which GI, GII and GIV infect humans. Human noroviruses are responsible for widespread outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis and represent one of the most common causes of foodborne illness. No vaccine or antiviral treatment options are available for norovirus infection. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of noroviruses is a key enzyme responsible for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Here, we review the progress made in understanding the structures and functions of norovirus RdRp and its use as a target for small molecule inhibitors. Crystal structures of the RdRp at different stages of substrate interaction have been determined, which shed light on its multi-step catalytic cycle. The in vitro assays and in vivo animal models that have been developed to identify and characterize inhibitors of norovirus RdRp are also summarized, followed by an update on the current antiviral research targeting different regions of norovirus RdRp. In the future, structure-based drug design and rational optimization of known nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors of norovirus RdRp may pave the way towards the next generation of direct-acting antivirals. \n Title: Structure(s), function(s), and inhibition of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of noroviruses", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The ocular anellovirus load in SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients did not differ and no SHAPU-specific anellovirus variant was detected.

Objectives: To separate the effects of RSV LRTI and an atopic diathesis on subsequent recurrent wheezing, we examined the protective effect of previous palivizumab administration against subsequent recurrent wheeze in infants with and without a family history of atopy. Methods: A prospective multicenter, matched, double cohort study was conducted in 27 centers in Europe and Canada. The rates of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing in premature infants <36 weeks gestation who had received palivizumab in the first year of life were compared to those of gestational age-matched controls. Results: The relative protective effect of palivizumab on physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing through the ages of 2 to 5 years was 68% in those with no family history of asthma (odds ratio, 0.32; (95% CI, 0.14-0.75; N 5 146 palivizumab-treated, 171 untreated) and 80% in those with no family history of atopy or food allergies (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.59; N 5 101 palivizumab-treated, 100 untreated). In contrast, there was no effect of palivizumab on subsequent recurrent wheezing in the 90 children with a family history of atopy or food allergies compared to 130 untreated infants with atopic families. Conclusion: Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in nonatopic children decreases by 80% the relative risk of recurrent wheezing but does not have any effect in infants with an atopic family history. This suggests that RSV predisposes to recurrent wheezing in an atopy-independent mechanism.

It has currently been identified in mosquito pools collected in the field in West and Central Africa. Emergence in wild birds in Europe and serological evidence in encephalitis patients in India raise questions on its genetic evolution and the diversity of isolates circulating in Africa. To better understand genetic diversity and evolution of Bagaza virus, we describe the full-genome characterization of 11 West African isolates, sampled from 1988 to 2014. Parameters such as genetic distances, N-glycosylation patterns, recombination events, selective pressures, and its codon adaptation to human genes are assessed. Our study is noteworthy for the observation of N-glycosylation and recombination in Bagaza virus and provides insight into its Indian origin from the 13th century. Interestingly, evidence of Bagaza virus codon adaptation to human house-keeping genes is also observed to be higher than those of other flaviviruses well known in human infections. Genetic variations on genome of West African Bagaza virus could play an important role in generating diversity and may promote Bagaza virus adaptation to other vertebrates and become an important threat in human health. 2 of 26 meningoencephalitis virus (ITV), a pathogen affecting poultry (turkeys) and close to West Nile virus (WNV) in several genomic regions [3, 11] . Although diverse studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of the transmission modes of BAGV [8, 12] and the pathogenesis of BAGV infection [13] , only one study has addressed BAGV genetic diversity, reporting a high homology >90% between Central African Republic, Indian and Spanish BAGV isolates [9] . In West Africa, there is a lack of data on BAGV genetic diversity. To fill this gap and gain better insights into BAGV molecular evolution, we characterized the full-genome of 11 BAGV isolates, sampled from 1988 to 2014 in Senegal and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Firstly, we assessed genetic distances, phylogenetically informative sites found in more than one sequence contributing to branch ordering, N-glycosylation patterns, recombination events, selective pressures on West African BAGV sequences and their evolutionary phylogenetic relationships with previously available BAGV genomes. Secondly, to assess evidence of future BAGV codon adaptation to human house-keeping genes, a bio-informatics approach was used for analysis of codon adaptation biases. \n Title: Full-Genome Characterization and Genetic Evolution of West African Isolates of Bagaza Virus", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Return \"True\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \"False\".", "input": "Paragraph: Apelin is an inotropic and cardioprotective peptide that exhibits beneficial effects through activation of the APJ receptor in the pathology of cardiovascular diseases. Apelin induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in failing hearts, thereby improving heart function in an angiotensin 1-7-dependent manner. Whether apelin antagonizes the over-activation of the renin-angiotensin system in the heart remains elusive. In this study we show that the detrimental effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) were exacerbated in the hearts of aged apelin-gene-deficient mice. Ang II-mediated cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy were augmented in apelin knockout mice. The loss of apelin increased the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to ACE2 expression in the Ang II-stressed hearts, and Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis was markedly enhanced in apelin knockout mice. mRNA expression of pro-fibrotic genes, such as transforming growth-factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling, were significantly upregulated in apelin knockout hearts. Consistently, treatment with the ACE-inhibitor Captopril decreased cardiac contractility in apelin knockout mice. In vitro, apelin ameliorated Ang II-induced TGF-\u03b2 expression in primary cardiomyocytes, accompanied with reduced hypertrophy. These results provide direct evidence that endogenous apelin plays a crucial role in suppressing Ang II-induced cardiac dysfunction and pathological remodeling. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 239 2 of 12 dysfunctions [8, 10, 11] . By contrast, APJ was identified as a dual receptor to mediate cardiac hypertrophy [12, 13] via \u03b2-arrestin signaling [14, 15] . Thus, the precise role of endogenous apelin signaling in heart function remains elusive. Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive response to maintain cardiac function in the event of an increased workload, although prolonged cardiac hypertrophy can lead to heart failure via the ischemia of cardiomyocytes [16, 17] . In addition, cardiac fibrosis adversely increases tissue stiffness and impairs ventricular function. Consistently, cardiac hypertrophy and the development of fibrosis correlate with the deterioration of myocardial function in heart failure [18] [19] [20] . Thus, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis are key features of heart failure, and apelin's inotropic and protective roles in the heart are attractive as a potential therapeutic candidate for treating heart failure. Apelin has also been identified as a substrate for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which cleaves apelin with similar efficiency as its primary substrate angiotensin II (Ang II) [21] [22] [23] . ACE2 is a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that inactivates Ang II by converting it to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) [21] [22] [23] , whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (or ACE1) activates RAS by converting Ang I to Ang II. ACE2 was also identified as a regulator of heart failure [24-26], diabetic nephropathy [27, 28] , acute lung failure [29, 30] , and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus receptor [31, 32] . Apelin-APJ signaling has been shown to counteract the effects of Ang II on AT1R in defined physiological and pathophysiological settings. For instance, in hypertensive rat models, the continuous infusion of Ang II downregulates apelin and APJ expression [33] . We have shown that Apelin upregulates ACE2 expression. Apelin-induced ACE2 downregulates Ang II signaling while enhancing Ang 1-7-Mas receptor signaling in aged or failing hearts [34] . On the other hand, it has been suggested that the counter-balancing effects of the apelin-APJ axis on Ang II-AT1R signaling are mediated by receptor dimerization. The APJ receptor physically interacts with AT1 receptors, and exogenous apelin negatively regulates Ang II-AT1R signaling in in vitro cell culture systems and in an in vivo atherosclerosis model [35] . However, whether endogenous apelin counteracts the over-activation of RAS in the heart remains unexplored. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of endogenous apelin on Ang II-induced pathology in the heart. We showed that Ang II-mediated cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, and fibrosis were augmented in apelin knockout (Apelin KO) mice. \n Title: Loss of Apelin Augments Angiotensin II-Induced Cardiac Dysfunction and Pathological Remodeling", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Objectives: To investigate the impact of outdoor weather in a temperate climate setting on the seasonal epidemiology of viruses causing respiratory tract infections, particularly influenza A (IFA). Study design: In total, 20,062 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples referred for detection of respiratory pathogens using a multiplex PCR panel, between October 2010 and July 2013, were included. Results of PCR detection were compared with local meteorological data for the same period. Results: Low temperature and vapor pressure (VP) were associated with weekly incidence of IFA, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus and adenovirus but no association with relative humidity was found. The incidence of human rhinovirus and enterovirus was independent of temperature. During seasonal IFA outbreaks, the weekly drop of average temperature (compared with the week before) was strongly associated with the IFA incidence recorded the following week. Conclusion: A sudden drop in outdoor temperature might activate the annual influenza epidemic in a temperate climate by facilitating aerosol spread in dry air.

At the same temperature and mass fraction of methanol (n-propanol, acetonitrile or 1,4-dioxane), the mole fraction solubility of ribavirin is greater in (methanol + water) than in the other three solvent mixtures. The preferential solvation parameters were derived from their thermodynamic solution properties by means of the inverse Kirkwood-Buff integrals. The preferential solvation parameters for methanol, n-propanol, acetonitrile or 1,4-dioxane (dx 1,3 ) were negative in the four solvent mixtures with a very wide compositions, which indicated that ribavirin was preferentially solvated by water. Temperature had little effect on the preferential solvation magnitudes.

In this study, we performed two metaanalyses of porcine transcriptomic data: i) scrutinized the global immune response to different challenges, and ii) determined the specific response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) infection. To gain an in-depth knowledge of the pig response to PRRSV infection, we used an original approach comparing and eliminating the common genes from both meta-analyses in order to identify genes and pathways specifically involved in the PRRSV immune response. The software Pointillist was used to cope with the highly disparate data, circumventing the biases generated by the specific responses linked to single studies. Next, we used the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software to survey the canonical pathways, biological functions and transcription factors found to be significantly involved in the pig immune response.

Since it is often impossible to observe the state of all nodes in a network, a common method is to detect harmful cascades from sparsely placed sensors. However, the harmful cascades are usually dynamic (e.g., the cascade initiators and diffusion trajectories can change over the time), which can severely destroy the robustness of selected sensors. Meanwhile the large scale of current networks greatly increases the time complexity of sensor selection. Motivated by the observation, in this paper we investigate the scalable sensor selection problem for early detection of dynamic harmful cascades in networks. Specifically, we first put forward a dynamic susceptible-infected model to describe harmful cascades, and formally define a detection time minimization (DTM) problem which focuses on effective sensors placement for early detection of dynamic cascades. We prove that it is #P-hard to calculate the objective function exactly and propose two Monte-Carlo methods to estimate it efficiently. We prove the NP-hardness of DTM problem and design a corresponding greedy algorithm. Based on that, we propose an efficient upper bound based greedy (UBG) algorithm with the theoretical performance guarantee reserved. To further meet different types of large-scale networks, we propose two accelerations of UBG: Quickest-Path-UBG for sparse networks and Local-Reduction-UBG for dense networks to improve the time complexity.

Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs, stool specimens and clinical data from patients presenting to GPs with an ARI were prospectively collected during two winter seasons (2014)(2015)(2016).

As previously shown, a lower pre-existing anti-MHV antibody level was found in susceptible H III mice as compared to resistant L III mice. Mortality rates of the F 1 (H \u00c2 L) hybrids and F 2 and backcross segregants reflected co-dominance of both characters and the survivors had higher preexisting anti-MHV antibody titers. The present data show that both lines had the potential to synthesize antibodies and that the resistance acquired by the susceptible H III mice paralleled the antibody synthesis. Nevertheless, higher antibody titers were necessary to confer resistance in H III mice than in L III ones. When compared to uvMHV3, a single immunization with a related infectious MHV strain induced a higher antibody synthesis and led the H III mice to resist the MHV3 challenge. A direct correlation between the antibody level and resistance to infection was always observed in H III mice. Although mounting a Th2 response as indicated by IgG1 responses, they were also able to readily synthesize large amounts of IgG2a antibodies after immunization or during infection, reflecting a Th1 response. The transfer of anti-MHV antibodies to susceptible H III mice was capable of conferring resistance to MHV3, providing the antibodies were present before virus infection and in large amounts. The resistance and the survival time of these animals increased with the level of antibody administered. If these direct and clear data suggest that H III mice can acquire resistance through antibodies, the basis of the resistance of the resistant L III mice may rely on mechanisms less dependent on antibodies. \n Title: Antibody responsiveness during immunization and challenge of genetically modified antibody responder mice with murine hepatitis virus 3", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Return \"True\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \"False\".", "input": "Paragraph: Phylogenetic analyses have provided strong evidence that amino acid changes in spike (S) protein of animal and human SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) during and between two zoonotic transfers (2002/03 and 2003/04) are the result of positive selection. While several studies support that some amino acid changes between animal and human viruses are the result of inter-species adaptation, the role of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in driving SARS-CoV evolution, particularly during intraspecies transmission, is unknown. A detailed examination of SARS-CoV infected animal and human convalescent sera could provide evidence of nAb pressure which, if found, may lead to strategies to effectively block virus evolution pathways by broadening the activity of nAbs. Here we show, by focusing on a dominant neutralization epitope, that contemporaneousand cross-strain nAb responses against SARS-CoV spike protein exist during natural infection. In vitro immune pressure on this epitope using 2002/03 strain-specific nAb 80R recapitulated a dominant escape mutation that was present in all 2003/ 04 animal and human viruses. Strategies to block this nAb escape/naturally occurring evolution pathway by generating broad nAbs (BnAbs) with activity against 80R escape mutants and both 2002/03 and 2003/04 strains were explored. Structure-based amino acid changes in an activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) ''hot spot'' in a light chain CDR (complementarity determining region) alone, introduced through shuffling of naturally occurring non-immune human VL chain repertoire or by targeted mutagenesis, were successful in generating these BnAbs. These results demonstrate that nAb-mediated immune pressure is likely a driving force for positive selection during intra-species transmission of SARS-CoV. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of a single VL CDR can markedly broaden the activity of a strain-specific nAb. The strategies investigated in this study, in particular the use of structural information in combination of chain-shuffling as well as hot-spot CDR mutagenesis, can be exploited to broaden neutralization activity, to improve anti-viral nAb therapies, and directly manipulate virus evolution.

This paper examines air flow path and airborne pollutant distribution by computational fluid dynamics modeling and field measurement. In hospitals, the risk of virus diffusion mainly depends on air flow behavior and changes in direction caused by supply air and exhaust air locations. An improved isolation room ventilation strategy has been suggested, and is found to be the most efficient in removing contaminants based on the observations and simulation results from three ventilation systems. The results show that ventilation systems utilizing the \"lowlevel extraction\" technique are very effective at removing pollutants in the human breathing zone. A new clean isolation room ventilation strategy has been developed that employs two exhaust air grilles on the wall behind the bed at low floor level, coupled with a fan filter unit, and is found to have the highest pollutant removal efficiency. \n Title: Investigation on the contaminant distribution with improved ventilation system in hospital isolation rooms: Effect of supply and exhaust air diffuser configurations", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

This study was carried out to evaluate the relationship between optical density ratio (ODR) measured on bulk tank milk with an indirect Ostertagia ostertagi ELISA and reproduction/mortality parameters. Data were collected between 2008 and 2010 from monitoring carried out on 1643 dairy herds (Normandy, Western France). ODR values of 3 samples from each farm taken from November 2008 to 2010 were averaged and then transformed into a categorical variable. Reproductive and mortality data were obtained from 1444 herds using cow records from government databases. Statistical analysis was carried out using ordinary logistic regression (OLR). The outcome variables were the case-control status of a herd for reproductive factors, age at first calving and inter-calving intervals, and mortality ratios of various age classes. The effect of the categorical ODR variable was studied and several potential confounder herd factors were used to improve the model fit. A significant relationship was found between high Ostertagia ODR levels and a late age at the first calving (>34.5 months) (odds ratio (OR) = 1.94, p < 0.001). No significant relationship was observed with OLR for inter-calving intervals although bivariate analysis showed that herds with high ODR levels had longer inter-calving intervals than herds with low ODR level (first intercalving interval in herds with low vs. high ODR levels = 412 days vs. 422 days, p < 0.001; other inter-calving intervals = 408 days vs. 413 days, p < 0.01). A high ODR level was also associated with high mortality of calves between 0 and 30 days of life (mortality ratio > 6%) (OR = 1.43, p < 0.05) and between 91 and 365 days (ratio > 3%) (OR = 1.72, p < 0.01). No significant relationship was observed with multivariate approach for mortalities in other classes by age, but bivariate analysis showed that herds with high ODR level had higher mortalities than herds with low ODR levels (mortality between 31 and 90 days in herds with low vs. high ODR levels = 1.89% vs. 2.91%, p < 0.001; mortality after 365 days = 1.67% vs. 2.93%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, our results confirm the usefulness of ELISA as an indicator for production losses in dairy herds. This inexpensive tool could be advantageous, used to aid farmers and veterinarians to carry out appropriate control measures. \n Title: The association between Ostertagia ostertagi antibodies in bulk tank milk samples and parameters linked to cattle reproduction and mortality", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Among these pathogens, Alternaria alternata (Alt), a universally present fungus, and human rhinovirus have been extensively studied. However, their interactions have not been investigated. In the present study, we tested the effect of Alt exposure on virus-induced airway epithelial immunity using live virus and a synthetic viral mimicker, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Alt treatment was found to significantly enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and IL-8) induced by virus infection or dsRNA treatment. In contrast to this synergistic effect, Alt significantly repressed type I and type III IFN production, and this impairment led to elevated viral replication. Mechanistic studies suggested the positive role of NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in the synergism and the attenuation of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway in the inhibition of IFN production. These opposite effects are caused by separate fungal components. Proteasedependent and -independent mechanisms appear to be involved.

Comparative metagenomic analysis of human and non-human primate (NHP) microbiomes offers a promising approach to study this symbiosis. Very few microbial species have been characterized in NHP microbiomes due to their poor representation in the available cataloged microbial diversity, thus limiting the potential of such comparative approaches. We reconstruct over 1000 previously uncharacterized microbial species from 6 available NHP metagenomic cohorts, resulting in an increase of the mappable fraction of metagenomic reads by 600%. These novel species highlight that almost 90% of the microbial diversity associated with NHPs has been overlooked. Comparative analysis of this new catalog of taxa with the collection of over 150,000 genomes from human metagenomes points at a limited species-level overlap, with only 20% of microbial candidate species in NHPs also found in the human microbiome. This overlap occurs mainly between NHPs and non-Westernized human populations and NHPs living in captivity, suggesting that host lifestyle plays a role comparable to host speciation in shaping the primate intestinal microbiome. Several NHP-specific species are phylogenetically related to human-associated microbes, such as Elusimicrobia and Treponema, and could be the consequence of host-dependent evolutionary trajectories. Conclusions: The newly reconstructed species greatly expand the microbial diversity associated with NHPs, thus enabling better interrogation of the primate microbiome and empowering in-depth human and non-human comparative and co-diversification studies. \n Title: Microbial genomes from non-human primate gut metagenomes expand the primate-associated bacterial tree of life with over 1000 novel species", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The highest mean titre obtained by ELISA was approximately 1.5-3.5 times greater than those obtained by the other techniques whilst CFT gave the lowest values.

Highly significant r values were determined for control sera when IHA was compared to ELISA (r> 0.79), and to both CFT and ELISA with immune animals (r> 0.96).

The role of S100A12 in parasite and viral infections is also difficult to study in traditional animal models due to the lack of S100A12 expression in rodents. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate fecal S100A12 concentrations in a cohort of puppies with intestinal parasites (Cystoisospora spp., Toxocara canis, Giardia sp.) and viral agents that are frequently encountered and known to cause gastrointestinal signs in dogs (coronavirus, parvovirus) as a comparative model. Methods: Spot fecal samples were collected from 307 puppies [median age (range): 7 (4\u221213) weeks; 29 different breeds] in French breeding kennels, and fecal scores (semiquantitative system; scores 1\u221213) were assigned. Fecal samples were tested for Cystoisospora spp. (C. canis and C. ohioensis), Toxocara canis, Giardia sp., as well as canine coronavirus (CCV) and parvovirus (CPV). S100A12 concentrations were measured in all fecal samples using an inhouse radioimmunoassay. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric 2-group or multiple-group comparisons, non-parametric correlation analysis, association testing between nominal variables, and construction of a multivariate mixed model. Results: Fecal S100A12 concentrations ranged from < 24\u221214,363 ng/g. Univariate analysis only showed increased fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs shedding Cystoisospora spp. (P = 0.0384) and in dogs infected with parvovirus (P = 0.0277), whereas dogs infected with coronavirus had decreased fecal S100A12 concentrations (P = 0.0345). However, shedding of any single enteropathogen did not affect fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis (all P > 0.05) in this study. Only fecal score and breed size had an effect on fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: An infection with any single enteropathogen tested in this study is unlikely to alter fecal S100A12 concentrations, and these preliminary data are important for further studies evaluating fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs or when using fecal S100A12 concentrations as a biomarker in patients with chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation. \n Title: Effect of selected gastrointestinal parasites and viral agents on fecal S100A12 concentrations in puppies as a potential comparative model", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}]
