Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.  It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.

I had a second cup, and the flavor grew on me even more, and I thought: \"it really is delicious for a decaf.\"  The aroma isn't truly satisfying (why does this always happen with decaf?) but I think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack.

Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.  And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.  That's great.  So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.  But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).  On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.  Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.

The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.

On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.

Personally, I am more concerned about overall sugar and calories in my soft drinks so this little 8 oz can has 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar.  If memory serves me that is in line with the calories of most softdrinks and more sugar then most soft drinks.

I made a pot without mixing it with anything and drank it black, as I always do. It's surprisingly drinkable, if a little on the light side. Still, the taste is fairly rich and appealingly winey, though I do like a little more smoky aftertaste than this provides. (There's really not much aftertaste at all, truth be told.) It's as good if not better than nearly all the straight decaf coffee I've ever had, and having it ground as opposed to beans really doesn't seem to be an issue here. Ground coffee does tend to go stale more quickly than bean, so I'd suggest using it fairly quickly, but that's easy to do with a 10-ounce bag.

He put me off coffee for a week.)  So, with that double-whammy in mind, I've lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods.  Hence my decision to go the low-acid coffee route.  And like the headline says, this coffee is a good news bad news situation.  First, the good news: Puroast Coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low-acid.  I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.  Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a-okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery.  Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start.  There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.  So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.

Upon first taste, both of us found this juice to be excessively concentrated sweetness.  Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.  Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.  Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).  By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say \"no *added* sugar\", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying \"no sugar\" or \"no sucrose\" (table sugar).  disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one.", "output": "Tastes like overly sweet apple juice, Trader Joe's version is better", "category": "Summarization 1216.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

Both times using filtered water and a quality coffee maker that uses the Melitta style (cone) filter. To my taste, it was stale and over-ground (like the flavor was watered out of it and then over-roasted and ground extra fine to try and put some flavor back into it), comparable in quality to low-end bulk coffee. The brands of decaf coffee I do like and brew at home (Dunkin' and Newman's Own, to name only two) are in the same price range, and also purchased pre-ground, but to me taste much smoother, and more full-flavored.

The experience with this brand has been disappointing. I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.  I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.  \"Stacey\"'s review sold me on it:  \"Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with \"meat by-product\" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be \"unfit for human consumption\". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered \"waste\" and packaging it up as \"healthy & nutritious\" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.  Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not \"sold-out\" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of \"aflatoxin poisoning\" from the \"healthy & nutritious\" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as \"Natural\", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their \"high priced waste\" and heavily marketing it as \"natural\".  My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. \"", "output": "Not what I thought", "category": "Summarization 1216.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.
