He alleged that his marriage broke down after his wife had an affair with his agent, and that she had also transferred the couple's joint assets. Ma has hit back at Wang, accusing him of abandoning their family. \n\nThe topic has sparked a debate about relationships and divorce. It seems Wang's situation has struck a chord with many - which could explain the number of views, which are high even by Chinese standards. \n\nThe divorce quickly became a top trending topic in China. According to micro blog Sina Weibo, posts with the hashtag \"Wang BaoQiang Divorce\" have been viewed over five billion times. Chinese netizens seem to have rallied around Wang, with topics like \"Wang Don't Cry\" \"Wang We Support You\", quickly trending after news of the divorce spread. Statistics by Weibo showed that 47% of netizens' posts condemned Ma for her affair, saying it had shattered her family. \n\nBut why are they so interested? what is it about this one that's got all of China ruffled up? \n\nSome people feel that this divorce seems to fit a certain trope - of a beautiful but ordinary girl marrying a rich but less good-looking man. It is not uncommon to hear the belief that a couple has to \"match\" at every level - be it in status, or physical appearance - for a relationship to work out. Wang and Ma's split has many people wondering if uneven matches are unlikely to succeed. \n\nA lot of social media discussion has also centred around divorce, and in particular how people can protect themselves. Wang has alleged that his wife transferred and hid some of the couple's assets. They're a wealthy couple - their assets, according to Chinese media, include nine flats, a BMW car and various luxury goods. As a result, people are debating the importance of protecting individual assets, even after marriage.', question: 'and his wife?", "output": "Wang Baoqiang", "category": "Wrong Candidate Generation 1536.json"}, {"instruction": "This task is about reading the given passage and the question, return an incorrect answer to the given question.", "input": "story: Wang Jiaming from Beijing Chenjinglun High School says he is a lucky boy. He's happy that he's sitting the senior high school entrance exam in 2014 instead of 2016. On Oct 22, Beijing Municipal Commission of Education announced that, from 2016, the English scores in the senior high school entrance exam will be reduced from 120 to 100. Of the 100 points, the listening ability scores will increase to 50. Meanwhile, the points for Chinese will increase from 120 to 150. \"The change won't affect me. I feel so lucky because English is my strongest subject,\" said Wang. Why such a change? It places the importance on Chinese in our study, and reduces students' stress, said Li Yi, spokesman of the commission. \"The change will also push us to pay attention to the practical usage of English,\" said Li. \"Students will be encouraged to learn to understand English menus and read English news on mobile phones.\" There isn't news that other cities will have the same change. But several places are making changes to English tests in the college entrance exams. For example, Shandong is considering taking out the listening part of the English exam in its college entrance exams. But, \"being tested for less points doesn't mean the subject _ ,\" Bai Ping wrote in China Daily. English has long been the world's most commonly used language. Former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji once said: \"In a globalizing economy , if you cannot communicate with foreigners, how can one be part of the world economy?\" Wang Jiaming said he understood the change. \"Chinese, not English, is our mother tongue ,\" he said. \"But still, I think English is both interesting and useful.\"', question: 'where is he educated?", "output": "Wang Jiaming", "category": "Wrong Candidate Generation 1536.json"}]
