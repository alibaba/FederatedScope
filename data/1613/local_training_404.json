Why is this?\n(A)Empirically there is a need to understand why virtually all war and major political violence since 1945 continues to take place in the developing world and why the majority originates from internal rather than external sources. Between 20 - 30 million have lost their lives in more than one hundred intra-state wars and there are 20 - 40 wars ongoing in any given year. (B)Conceptually there is a need to find appropriate theories and concepts that accommodate the unique character of the security situation in the developing world; intra-state war, communal violence, poverty, famine, weapons proliferation, crime, political instability, socio-economic breakdown and state collapse. (C)From a normative perspective there are clear humanitarian imperatives to resolve the lack of security; 90 per cent of victims of intra-state violence are civilians, half a million are killed by light weapons, 40,000 a year die from hunger and poverty whilst tens of millions die from disease, chronic poverty, and inadequate health, education, employment, and environmental causes. (D)All of these options. There is a profound disjuncture between security in developed nations and the kind of security in the world's \"zones of instability\". From a global perspective insecurity is more of a norm than security is. However, globalization essentially means that these forms of insecurity cannot be contained within increasingly porous national borders.", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 1361.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a question on security studies.

(B)The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women. (C)The role of women was given appropriate consideration; women have fulfilled many vital roles in the support of the dominant security system. (D)Women are generally unsupportive of warfare and prefer to engage in anti-war or opposition movements, rendering their contribution to the study of warfare as marginal.", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 1361.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a question on security studies.

(B)Realism is the broad term that can be applied to any traditional approach to Security Studies. (C)Realism is a set of approaches that encompasses any security threat that involves the military.

Within this analysis states with weak democratic and nationalist credentials may provide the conditions that contribute to the development of terrorism. (B)Terrorism amongst Islamic groups is developed on ethnocentric lines opposed to the secularism that accompanies modernity. It is perhaps ironic that whilst terrorism was organized around the threat to Islamic society in the Middle East, the response to threat has resulted in groups in Europe feeling threatened by Muslim intrusion on Western values. (C)Capitalist market activities and technological and communication revolutions have increasingly intruded on traditional cultures and societies. Development inequalities and increasing marginalization of some ethnic or economic groups in the populations, alongside an increasing awareness of their dispossession provides grounds for breeding terrorism. (D)Non-democratic state structures characterized by a strong centralized system and repressive methods open a space for popular discontent to transform into operational terrorist activities with the intent of ending the political system.

(B)Information has no special significance to economic decision making, which is guided more by external forces that coerce actors than their own rational choices. (C)Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.

A securitized issue is part of public policy requiring governmental action; decision-making, resource allocation and even communal governance. (B)A securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitised when it is outside of the political domain. An existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even when it is not included within public debate. Securitization refers to the recognition of the threat prior to its emergence in the political process. (C)Securitization refers to the move of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once placed above the political sphere it cannot be returned to the public sphere, having been translated into a state interest above normal proceedings. (D)An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 1361.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a question on security studies.

(C)Gun shows and arms fairs do not contribute in a significant way to the trade in illicit arms.

(B)Policy-academe developments have resulted in the modification of the role of think tanks away from policy towards politicization resistant theory. (C)Security studies has been marked by the gradual \"IR-ification\" of the discipline. Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated. (D)Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.

(B)Critical constructivism regards the strength of social constructivism to be its ability to bridge rationalist and reflectivity approaches. Conversely, social constructivists regard this as an unhelpful regression to positivist binary frameworks of analysis. (C)Conventional constructivism refers to the earlier works of social constructivist theorists that are characterised by a rejection of positivist methodology.
