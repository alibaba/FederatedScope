A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 \u00b0C (0.09 \u00b0F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 \u00b0C (0.2 \u00b0F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \"thread\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

You need to come up with a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph. The generated question should not be answerable without both the background and story. Write a question about the story that requires a relationship in the background paragraph to answer. Check whether your question requires both the background paragraph and the story to answer. If your question can be answered by only one of these, try to rewrite your question so that it requires both. Note that \"flipping\" a word in the question can give rise to a new question where the answer will be different from the original question. Often, \"flipping\" a word gives rise to flipping the direction of the relationship, for example, from \"increase\" to \"decrease.\"", "input": "Background Paragraph: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel \u201cquiet\u201d room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. \nStory: James is attending a concert. When he first walks in the concert hall there aren't that many people there and it is relatively quiet. As the room fills up it starts to get a bit louder. And when the concert starts its so loud that it is almost painful for him as he is sitting near the speakers.", "output": "Given that during the concert the decibel levels were high enough to be painful to James, will further increasing them make them safer or harmful?, Given the concert is now over and everyone is leaving, will the decibel levels increase or decrease?, Will the decibel levels have increased or decreased in the time since James arrived at the concert to when the show started?", "category": "Question Generation 59.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. \nStory: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.", "output": "In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B?, In which organism ATP molecules would not be produced, sample A or sample B?, In which organism cellular respiration would not occur, sample A or sample B?, In which organism cellular respiration would occur, sample A or sample B?, In which organism energy would be converted from glucose, sample A or sample B?, In which organism energy would not be converted from glucose, sample A or sample B?, Which organism would make their own glucose, sample C or sample D?, Which organism would not make their own glucose, sample C or sample D?, Would sample C make their own glucose or acquire it from other organisms?, Would sample D make their own glucose or acquire it from other organisms?", "category": "Question Generation 59.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph.

Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word \u201cOpen\u201d in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. \nStory: John wanted to make some lighted signs for his business. To that end, he chose noble gases, neon, krypton, and xenon. First, he kept the noble gases in containers. He called it step A. Then he passed electric current through them. He called it step B. In the process, he came up with three signs, sign A, sign B, and sign C. Sign A used neon.
