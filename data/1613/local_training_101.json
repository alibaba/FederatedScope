We call this set the neighbor of the word. We have observed that the neighbor of a polysemic word consists of words that resemble the primary sense of the polysemic word.  Even though a word may be a polysemic, it usually corresponds to a single vector in distributed representation. This vector is primarily determined by the major sense, which is most frequently used. The information about a word's minor sense is subtle, and the effect of a minor sense is difficult to distinguish from statistical fluctuation. To measure the effect of a minor sense, this paper proposes to use the concept of surrounding uniformity. The surrounding uniformity roughly corresponds to statistical fluctuation in the vectors that correspond to the words in the neighbor Surrounding Uniformity (SU) can be expressed as follows: $SU(\\vec{w}) = \\frac{|\\vec{s}(\\vec{w})|}{|\\vec{w}| + \\sum _{i}^{N}|\\vec{a_i}(\\vec{w})|}$\n\nwhere $\\vec{s}(\\vec{w}) = \\vec{w} + \\sum _{i}^{N} \\vec{a_i}(\\vec{w}).$ \n Question: How is the fluctuation in the sense of the word and its neighbors measured?", "output": "Abstractive", "category": "Question Understanding 1089.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and a question based on the context.

As more than one user may interact with a given post, we first add a maximum pooling layer after the user matrix embedding layer and user vector embedding layer to form a moderator matrix embedding INLINEFORM0 and a moderator vector embedding INLINEFORM1 for moderator INLINEFORM2 respectively, where INLINEFORM3 is used for the semantic transformation in the document composition process, as mentioned in the previous section. The term moderator here is to denote the pseudo user who provides the overall semantic/sentiment of all the engaged users for one document. The embedding INLINEFORM4 models the moderator stance preference, that is, the pattern of the revealed user stance: whether a user is willing to show his preference, whether a user likes to show impartiality with neutral statements and reasonable arguments, or just wants to show strong support for one stance. Ideally, the latent user stance is modeled by INLINEFORM5 for each user. Likewise, for topic information, a maximum pooling layer is added after the topic matrix embedding layer and topic vector embedding layer to form a joint topic matrix embedding INLINEFORM6 and a joint topic vector embedding INLINEFORM7 for topic INLINEFORM8 respectively, where INLINEFORM9 models the semantic transformation of topic INLINEFORM10 as in users and INLINEFORM11 models the topic stance tendency. The latent topic stance is also modeled by INLINEFORM12 for each topic.\n\nAs for comments, we view them as short documents with authors only but without likers nor their own comments. Therefore we apply document composition on comments although here users are commenters (users who comment). It is noticed that the word embeddings INLINEFORM0 for the same word in the posts and comments are the same, but after being transformed to INLINEFORM1 in the document composition process shown in Figure FIGREF4 , they might become different because of their different engaged users. The output comment representation together with the commenter vector embedding INLINEFORM2 and topic vector embedding INLINEFORM3 are concatenated and a maximum pooling layer is added to select the most important feature for comments. Instead of requiring that the comment stance agree with the post, UTCNN simply extracts the most important features of the comment contents; they could be helpful, whether they show obvious agreement or disagreement. Therefore when combining comment information here, the maximum pooling layer is more appropriate than other pooling or merging layers. Indeed, we believe this is one reason for UTCNN's performance gains.\n\nFinally, the pooled comment representation, together with user vector embedding INLINEFORM0 , topic vector embedding INLINEFORM1 , and document representation are fed to a fully connected network, and softmax is applied to yield the final stance label prediction for the post. \n Question: How many layers does the UTCNN model have?", "output": "Abstractive", "category": "Question Understanding 1089.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and a question based on the context.
