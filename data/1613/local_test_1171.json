[{"instruction": "You are given a time in 24-Hours format, and you need to convert it to time in the 12-Hours format. For a 24-Hours format time larger than 12:00, subtract 12 hours from the given time, then add 'PM'.  For example, if you have 14:30 hours, subtract 12 hours, and the result is 2:30 PM. If the 24-Hours format time is less than or equal to 12:00, add 'AM'. For example, say you have 10:15 hours, add the 'AM' to the end, here we get 10:15 AM.
