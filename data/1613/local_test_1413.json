Hunted by German and French police, he eventually committed suicide in a hotel in Strassen, Luxembourg on May 18. Context_2 : Andrew Philip Kehoe (February 1, 1872 \u2013 May 18, 1927) was an American farmer and treasurer of his township school board, notable as a mass murderer for killing his wife and 43 other people (including 38 children), and injuring 58 people by setting off bombs in the Bath School disaster on May 18, 1927. He committed suicide near the school by detonating dynamite in his truck, causing an explosion which killed several other people and wounded more. He had earlier set off incendiary devices in his house and farm, destroying all the buildings, as well as killing two horses and other animals. Context_3 : Mass murder (sometimes interchangeable with \"mass destruction\") is the act of murdering a number of people, typically simultaneously or over a relatively short period of time and in close geographic proximity. The FBI defines mass murder as murdering four or more persons during an event with no \"cooling-off period\" between the murders. A mass murder typically occurs in a single location where one or more people kill several others. Many acts of mass murder end with the perpetrator(s) dying by suicide or suicide by cop. Context_4 : Marc L\u00e9pine (] ; born Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi; October 26, 1964 \u2013 December 6, 1989) was a Canadian mass murderer from Montreal, Quebec, who in 1989 murdered 14 women, and wounded 10 women and four men at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, in the \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre, also known as the \"Montreal Massacre\". Context_5 : The term mass media refers to any means or technology used to communicate a message to large groups of people. Popular forms of mass media include television, the Internet, and newspapers. Mass media are specifically intended to reach larger audiences. The term is often divided into two broad categories: that of electronic mass media and that of print mass media. Electronic mass media require their audiences to interact with electronics in order to receive the message. They attempt to recreate or represent a message through moving pictures and/or sound. Four common examples of electronic media used in Canadian society are television, radio, films, and the Internet. Print mass media, on the other hand, refers to any media that is distributed to audiences in a printed form, on paper. Examples of this include newspapers, printed books, and magazines. The mass media model in Canada is different from the mass media model of the United States as well as the rest of the world. According to John A. Irving, mass media functions differently in Canadian society because of a lack of collective identity; this is in reference to Canada's languages (and related cultures) as well as its proximity to the United States. Irving states that such cultural dualism means that only some of the population responds to the mass media in English, while the other portion remain uninfluenced by English-based media. In terms of the proximity to the United States, he explains that \"most of the difficulties that threaten the mass media in Canada are the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism.\" Because of the United States' overwhelming influence on Canadian mass media, Canada has not been able to form its own identity in the media. These two factors have slowed down the process of the creation of a Canadian community. Mass media help in forming a community through communication. When a large group of people is in communication with one another through media, an identifiable culture is formed. Individuals in dialectic experience a sense of membership and collective identity.

He is the last of the Saint Gall Ekkehards, and flourished towards the end of the twelfth, and the beginning of the thirteenth, century. No particulars are known concerning his life, and tradition is silent as to his origin, the year of his birth and of his death. He was dean of the abbey in the reign of Innocent III. Context_3 : The Abbey Library of Saint Gall was founded by Saint Othmar, the founder of the Abbey of St. Gall. During a fire in 937, the Abbey was destroyed, but the library remained intact. In 1983 the library together with the Abbey of St. Gall were made a World Heritage Site, as 'a perfect example of a great Carolingian monastery'. Context_4 : The Abbey of Saint Gall (German: Abtei St. Gallen ) is a dissolved abbey (747\u20131805) in a Roman Catholic religious complex in the city of St. Gallen in Switzerland. The Carolingian-era monastery has existed since 719 and became an independent principality between 9th and 13th centuries, and was for many centuries one of the chief Benedictine abbeys in Europe. It was founded by Saint Othmar on the spot where Saint Gall had erected his hermitage. The library at the Abbey is one of the richest medieval libraries in the world. The city of St. Gallen originated as an adjoining settlement of the abbey. Following the secularization of the abbey around 1800 the former Abbey church became a Cathedral in 1848.

In essence it is a synthesis of the \"Discourse on Method\" and \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" It was written in Latin, published in 1644 and dedicated to Elisabeth of Bohemia, with whom Descartes had a long-standing friendship. A French version (\"Les Principes de la Philosophie\") followed in 1647. It set forth the principles of nature\u2014the Laws of Physics\u2014as Descartes viewed them. Most notably, it set forth the principle that in the absence of external forces, an object's motion will be uniform and in a straight line. Newton borrowed this principle from Descartes and included it in his own \"Principia\"; to this day, it is still generally referred to as Newton's First Law of Motion. The book was primarily intended to replace the Aristotelian curriculum then used in French and British Universities. The work provides a systematic statement of his metaphysics and natural philosophy, and represents the first truly comprehensive, mechanistic account of the universe. Context_2 : Maximilian de Gaynesford (born 1968) is an English philosopher and the author of \"The Rift in the Lute: Attuning Poetry and Philosophy\" (Oxford, 2017). He was educated at Ampleforth College and Balliol College, Oxford (1986\u20139; First in Modern History), after which he spent several years studying Theology, before turning to Philosophy in 1993. Before receiving his doctorate, he was elected Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy at Lincoln College, Oxford (1997). He was subsequently Humboldt Research Fellow at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin (2003) and a tenured professor at The College of William and Mary in Virginia (2002\u20132006) before becoming Professor of Philosophy (2008) and Head of Department (2016) at the University of Reading. He is the author of over forty articles and four books: \"The Rift in the Lute: Attuning Poetry and Philosophy\" (Oxford, 2017), \"I: The Meaning of the First Person Term\" (Oxford, 2006), \"Hilary Putnam\" (Routledge, 2006), and \"John McDowell\" (Polity, 2004). In 2011, he edited a collection of articles on the Philosophy of Action, \"Agents And Their Actions\" (Blackwell), which includes recent work by John McDowell and Joseph Raz. He often gives papers on attuning poetry and philosophy for general audiences, as here . He spoke at the Harvard Conference in celebration of Hilary Putnam, here . He has a daughter, Elisabeth (born 2009). Context_3 : Pragmaticism is a term used by Charles Sanders Peirce for his pragmatic philosophy starting in 1905, in order to distance himself and it from pragmatism, the original name, which had been used in a manner he did not approve of in the \"literary journals\". Peirce in 1905 announced his coinage \"pragmaticism\", saying that it was \"ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers\" (\"Collected Papers\" (CP) 5.414). Today, outside of philosophy, \"pragmatism\" is often taken to refer to a compromise of aims or principles, even a ruthless search for mercenary advantage. Peirce gave other or more specific reasons for the distinction in a surviving draft letter that year and in later writings. Peirce's pragmatism, that is, pragmaticism, differed in Peirce's view from other pragmatisms by its commitments to the spirit of strict logic, the immutability of truth, the reality of infinity, and the difference between (1) actively willing to control thought, to doubt, to weigh reasons, and (2) willing not to exert the will, willing to believe. In his view his pragmatism is, strictly speaking, not itself a whole philosophy, but instead a general method for the clarification of ideas. He first publicly formulated his pragmatism as an aspect of scientific logic along with principles of statistics and modes of inference in his \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series of articles in 1877-8. Context_4 : Elisabeth of the Palatinate (26 December 1618 \u2013 11 February 1680), also known as Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Elisabeth of the Palatinate, or Princess-Abbess of Herford Abbey, was the eldest daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine (who was briefly King of Bohemia), and Elizabeth Stuart. She was born in Heidelberg, Germany, spending the first nine years of her life there. When she was nine, she went to live in Leyden, with her brother and was raised in a nursery palace to complete her studies. After finishing her studies, she was deemed ready to live in The Hague with her mother. Context_5 : The Three Principles of the People, also translated as Three People's Principles, San-min Doctrine, or Tridemism is a political philosophy developed by Sun Yat-sen as part of a philosophy to make China a free, prosperous, and powerful nation. The three principles are often translated into and summarized as nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people. He believed that the economic livelihood of the people depended on adopting the teachings of the American economist Henry George, writing that \"The teachings of your single-taxer, Henry George, will be the basis of our program of reform.\" Context_6 : In computer programming, the term SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by Robert C. Martin, . Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or Adaptive Software Development. The SOLID acronym was introduced by Michael Feathers. Context_7 : Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (German: \"Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten\" ; 1785; also known as the \"Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals\", \"Grounding of the Metaphysics of Morals\" and the \"Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals\") is the first of Immanuel Kant's mature works on moral philosophy and remains one of the most influential in the field. Kant conceives his investigation as a work of foundational ethics\u2014one that clears the ground for future research by explaining the core concepts and principles of moral theory and showing that they are normative for rational agents. Kant aspires to nothing less than this: to lay bare the fundamental principle of morality and show that it applies to us. In the text, Kant provides a groundbreaking argument that the rightness of an action is determined by the character of the principle that a person chooses to act upon. Kant thus stands in stark contrast to the moral sense theories and teleological moral theories that dominated moral philosophy at the time he was writing. Central to the work is the role of what Kant refers to as the categorical imperative, the concept that one must act only according to that precept which he or she would will to become a universal law. Context_8 : In Canadian and New Zealand law, fundamental justice is the fairness underlying the administration of justice and its operation. The principles of fundamental justice are specific legal principles that command \"significant societal consensus\" as \"fundamental to the way in which the legal system ought fairly to operate\", per \"R v Malmo-Levine\". These principles may stipulate basic procedural rights afforded to anyone facing an adjudicative process or procedure that affects fundamental rights and freedoms, and certain substantive standards related to the rule of law that regulate the actions of the state (e.g., the rule against unclear or vague laws). The degree of protection dictated by these standards and procedural rights vary in accordance with the precise context, involving a contextual analysis of the affected person's interests. In other words, the more a person's rights or interests are adversely affected, the more procedural or substantive protections must be afforded to that person in order to respect the principles of fundamental justice. A legislative or administrative framework that respects the principles of fundamental justice, as such, must be fundamentally fair to the person affected, but does not necessarily have to strike the \"right balance\" between individual and societal interests in general. Context_9 : A first principle is a basic, foundational, self-evident proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. In philosophy, first principles are taught by Aristotelians and a nuanced version of first principles are referred to as postulates by Kantians. In mathematics, first principles are referred to as axioms and postulates. In physics and other sciences, theoretical work is said to be from first principles, or \"ab initio\", if it starts directly at the level of established science and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and parameter fitting. Context_10 : Principia philosophiae cartesianae (PPC; \"The Principles of Cartesian Philosophy\") or Renati Descartes principia philosophiae, more geometrico demonstrata (\"The Principles of Ren\u00e9 Descartes' Philosophy, Demonstrated in Geometrical Order\") is a philosophical work of Baruch Spinoza published in Amsterdam in 1663. In the preface to this work, Ludovic Meyer explains that it is a reconstruction of Ren\u00e9 Descartes' \"Principles of Philosophy \"in the Euclidean or \"geometric\" fashion\". \"In the appendix, a series of non-geometric prose passages entitled \"Metaphysical Thoughts\" [\"Cogitata Metaphisica\"], Spinoza explicates Descartes' views on traditional metaphysical topics (including essence, existence, idea, potential, necessity, contingency, duration, and time) while furtively interpolating some of his own. fact_1 :  In essence it is a synthesis of the \"Discourse on Method\" and \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" It was written in Latin, published in 1644 and dedicated to Elisabeth of Bohemia, with whom Descartes had a long-standing friendship. fact_2 : Elisabeth of the Palatinate (26 December 1618 \u2013 11 February 1680), also known as Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Elisabeth of the Palatinate, or Princess-Abbess of Herford Abbey, was the eldest daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine (who was briefly King of Bohemia), and Elizabeth Stuart.

However, these early individuals could not openly worship as they were persecuted by the Spanish Inquisition for practicing Judaism. Independent Mexico eventually adopted freedom of religion and began receiving Jewish immigrants, many of them refugees. The book \"Estudio hist\u00f3rico de la migraci\u00f3n jud\u00eda a M\u00e9xico 1900-1950\" has records of almost 18,300 who emigrated to Mexico between 1900 and 1950.

Dred Scott, an enslaved man of \"the negro African race\" who had been taken by his owners to free states and territories, attempted to sue for his freedom.

Context_3 : Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an academic support model developed by Dr. Deanna Martin at the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City (UMKC) in 1973 that uses peer-assisted study sessions to improve student retention and success within targeted historically difficult courses. The SI program provides peer support by having students who succeeded in traditionally difficult academic courses (e.g., Organic Chemistry, Biology 101, Logic) help other students complete these courses. SI is a non-remedial approach that provides regular review sessions outside of class in which students work collaboratively by discussing readings, comparing notes, working together to predict test items, and sharing ideas for improving class material. Courses selected for SI tend to be \u201cgatekeeper\u201d courses for first and second year students\u2014generally those classes that have a 30% or higher proportion of students who receive a \u201cD\u201d, fail, or withdraw (the \"DFW\" rate) from the course. Out-of-class review sessions are led by \u201cSI leaders,\u201d students who took the class already and did well. SI leaders attend all class lectures, take notes, and act as models to those currently taking the course. The SI model is used for selected courses at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional school levels, and has been adopted by colleges and universities in the United States and internationally.

Context_5 : Work colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition. Context_6 : Speak It!

There are primarily two classes of people with Igbo ancestry in the United States, those whose ancestors were taken from Igboland as a result of the transatlantic slave trade before the 20th century and those who immigrated from the 20th century onwards partly as a result of the Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s and economic instability in Nigeria.

To others, especially for those living in New England or the Midwest, a Canadian-American is one whose ancestors came from Canada. fact_1 :  These students work to build pride and self-esteem through educational and cultural programs, discovering their heritage and learning ways to effect change. fact_2 : Black Nova Scotians are Black Canadians whose ancestors fled the Colonial United States as slaves or freemen, and later settled in Nova Scotia, Canada during the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968), was a United States Supreme Court case that invalidated an Arkansas statute that prohibited the teaching of human evolution in the public schools. The Court held that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a state from requiring, in the words of the majority opinion, \"that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma.\" The Supreme Court declared the Arkansas statute unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. After this decision, some jurisdictions passed laws that required the teaching of creation science alongside evolution when evolution was taught. These were also ruled unconstitutional by the Court in the 1987 case \"Edwards v. Aguillard\".

Context_5 : The United States Senate has had ten African-American elected or appointed office holders. The United States Senate is the upper house of the bicameral United States Congress, which is the legislative branch of the federal government of the United States. The US Census Bureau defines African Americans as citizens or residents of the United States who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa. The term is generally used for Americans with at least partial ancestry in any of the original peoples of sub-Saharan Africa. During the founding of the federal government, African Americans were consigned to a status of second-class citizenship or enslaved. No African American served in federal elective office before the ratification in 1870 of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits the federal and state governments from denying any citizen the right to vote because of that citizen's race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Of the ten senators, six were popularly elected (including one that previously had been appointed by his state's governor), two were elected by the state legislature prior to the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913 (which provides for the direct election of U.S. Senators by the people of each state), and two were appointed by a state Governor. The 113th United States Congress (2013\u201315) marked the first time that two African Americans served concurrently in the Senate.

Hatch's amendment would allow anyone who has been a US citizen for twenty years to seek these offices. In the wake of the California recall election, 2003, this proposal was widely seen as an attempt to make California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (born in Austria and naturalized in 1983) eligible for the presidency and is sometimes nicknamed \"Arnold bill\" or \"Amend for Arnold\". However, there are other politicians who were not born as American citizens and therefore would benefit from such an amendment. Notables include Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm (born in Canada, naturalized in 1980), former Florida Senator Mel Martinez (born in Cuba), former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (born in Czechoslovakia), former Vermont governor Madeleine Kunin (born in Switzerland), and current Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao (born in Taiwan).

Context_8 : Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), is a landmark United States Supreme Court case which deals with civil rights, specifically, segregation in the District of Columbia's public schools.

Board of Education\", 347 U.S. 483 (1954), \"Bolling\" was reargued on December 8 and 9, 1953, and was unanimously decided on May 17, 1954, the same day as \"Brown.\" The \"Bolling\" decision was supplemented in 1955 with the second \"Brown\" opinion, which ordered desegregation \"with all deliberate speed.\" \"Bolling\" did not address school desegregation in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which applies only to the states, but held that school segregation was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In \"Bolling,\" the Court observed that the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution lacked an Equal Protection Clause, as in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court held, however, that the concepts of Equal Protection and Due Process are not mutually exclusive. Context_9 : The Saxbe fix , or salary rollback, is a mechanism by which the President of the United States, in appointing a current or former member of the United States Congress whose elected term has not yet expired, can avoid the restriction of the United States Constitution's Ineligibility Clause. That clause prohibits the President from appointing a current or former member of Congress to a civil office position that was created, or to a civil office position for which the pay or benefits (collectively, \"emoluments\") were increased, during the term for which that member was elected until the term has expired. The rollback, first implemented by an Act of Congress in 1909, reverts the emoluments of the office to the amount they were when that member began his or her elected term.

Context_3 : British Airways Flight 268 was a regularly scheduled flight from Los Angeles LAX airport to London Heathrow LHR. The flight took off at about 9:24\u00a0p.m. on 20 February 2005. When the plane, a four engine Boeing 747\u2013436, was around 300 feet into the air, flames burst out of its number 2 engine, a result of engine surge. The pilots shut the engine down. Air traffic control expected the plane to return to the airport and deleted the flight plan. However, after consulting with the airline dispatcher, the pilots decided to set off on their flight plan \"and get as far as we can\" rather than dump 70 tonnes of fuel and land. The 747 is certified to fly on three engines. Having reached the East Coast, the assessment was that the plane could continue safely. The cross-Atlantic journey encountered less favourable conditions than predicted. Upon reaching the UK, believing there to be insufficient usable fuel to reach their destination, the captain declared an emergency and landed at Manchester Airport. Context_4 : The Aeronca Model 50 Chief was an American light plane of the late 1930s. Consumer demand for more comfort, longer range and better instrumentation resulted in its development in 1938, powered by a 50-horsepower (37-kilowatt) Continental, Franklin or Lycoming engine. A 65-horsepower (48-kilowatt) Continental engine powered the Model 65 Super Chief, which was also built in a flight trainer version, the Model TC-65 Defender, with its rear seat positioned nine inches (23 centimeters) higher than the front for better visibility. Context_5 : The LeRoy W. Homer Jr. Foundation is a national 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in memory of First Officer LeRoy W. Homer Jr.. LeRoy Homer was the co-pilot of United Airlines Flight #93, which crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. The flight recordings revealed that Dahl and Homer survived the initial attack and were still alive after the hijackers took over the plane. It is believed that Dahl and Homer took actions to interfere with the hijackers, including disengaging the autopilot just before the hijackers took over in order to prevent them from setting the plane's target coordinates for Washington, D.C., and switching the output of the pilots' microphones from the cabin address speakers to the radio transmitter so that Jarrah's attempts to communicate with the passengers would instead be heard by air traffic controllers. After learning of the earlier crashes at the thumb|right|World Trade CenterMelodie and the Pentagon, the crew and passengers attempted to foil the hijacking and reclaim the aircraft. Meanwhile, the hijackers were not able to disengage the autopilot. Dahl continued to struggle in the cockpit, refusing to allow a hijacker to deactivate the autopilot so he could fly the plane manually. The hijackers were heard to say \"Inform them, and tell him to talk to the pilot; bring back the pilot\", possibly referring toLaurel Homer (CVR transcripts). However, the uprising of crew and passengers took place and during the attempt the plane crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania2002. The crash killed everyone on board. Before the plane went down, she says, he had regained consciousness and was part of the final attack that forced the plane to abort its intended target, which was somewhere in Washington, D.C., and crash.ref>]] Context_6 : At first the model had a new petrol engine with 1395 cc and 29\u00a0kW (39\u00a0hp) at 3800 rpm to 1400 Fiat, and had a manual 4-speed transmission. A 1.5 ton truck was newly developed, which was offered from 1951 in a flatbed and chassis for special bodies. It was powered by the engine of the prior year featured Fiat 1400s. The engine was already in the car Fiat 1400 was just sufficient, and with the 3.1 tons it had real trouble. Once in motion, the Fiat 615 was indeed 80\u00a0km/hr fast, but with forced driving it had poor fuel efficiency. There was a reason that the 1100 Fiat ELR far built until 1954. The somewhat weaker beast of burden was, with its 1.1 liter and 28/30 PS (at 4400 rpm) a little lame, but it had fully loaded a ton to move less weight, so was more economical. It therefore retained its loyal following who forgave its manageable liveliness out of habit, especially as it came with start-up to a peak of over 90\u00a0km/hr and thus was significantly faster than the Fiat 615 with its maximum of 78\u00a0km/hr. With high pressure, therefore a suitable diesel engine was developed by Fiat: a swirl chamber engine (Ricardo System) based on the 1.9 liter engine for the \"big\" Fiat in 1900 and the new SUV Fiat Campagnola. (This engine was a hubvergr\u00f6\u00dferte variant of the 1400 engine.) The new diesel engine (type 305) was later also available in either sedan 1400 from 1952 in addition to the Fiat 615 N (N = Nafta = Diesel) and one year in Fiat Campagnola and Fiat. Although the experiment of the Fiat 615 built 1.9 L gasoline engine proved to be stronger and with faster drive spurt, confined themselves to the diesel, the Type 615 N. Only Steyr in Austria until 1958 offered the Fiat 615 as gasoline, as Steyr 260 with its own 50\u00a0hp 2 L gasoline engine from the car Steyr 2000. The Fiat 615 N was a very modern vehicle that in Italy, initially had no competition. The export ran well at the beginning, missing, or half-hearted development left the Fiat 615 N (and especially its successor) over the years become increasingly rare even in Italy. In Zastava in Yugoslavia, the Fiat 615 was built with a petrol engine under license. However, not as the beginning of the Fiat, with the 1.4 L 4-cylinder engine, but with the much stronger torque 1.9 liter engine (type 105) with 47\u00a0hp at 3500 RPM, as well as in the, also at Zastava built under license, Campagnola was used. It is unclear whether the successor (from about 1963, as Fiat 615 N1) only with the 1.9 liter petrol engine (such as 615 B) was built, with a diesel engine. Context_7 : A tiltrotor is an aircraft which generates lift and propulsion by way of one or more powered rotors (sometimes called \"proprotors\") mounted on rotating engine pods or nacelles usually at the ends of a fixed wing or an engine mounted in the fuselage with drive shafts transferring power to rotor assemblies mounted on the wingtips. It combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. For vertical flight, the rotors are angled so the plane of rotation is horizontal, lifting the way a helicopter rotor does. As the aircraft gains speed, the rotors are progressively tilted forward, with the plane of rotation eventually becoming vertical. In this mode the wing provides the lift, and the rotor provides thrust as a propeller. Since the rotors can be configured to be more efficient for propulsion (e.g. with root-tip twist) and it avoids a helicopter's issues of retreating blade stall, the tiltrotor can achieve higher speeds than helicopters. Context_8 : The 90mm GUN TANK T42 was a medium tank powered by the AOS-895-3, a 6-cylinder, Air cooled, Opposed cylinder, Supercharged engine displacing 895.9 cubic inches. It was intended to fulfill OTCM 32529's, dated December 2, 1948, call for a tank weighing 36 tons and equivalently armed as the M46 while having superior armour. With an engine producing only 500\u00a0hp, concern about the T42's performance was expressed. Testing, with a T40 loaded to the weight of T42 and powered by the AOS-895 through a CD-500 transmission, revealed it to be only equivalent in performance to the late model M4A3, which was below the design estimates. Context_9 : The Aviatik D.III was a German prototype single-seater fighter plane from the First World War, designed by Aviatik. It became the basis for the Aviatik D.IV and Aviatik D.V. In November 1917, the plane was first flown, using a 195\u00a0hp Benz Bz IIIbo gearless engine. It was of similar design to the Aviatik D.II, and was armed with two LMG 08/15 machine guns. After several tests at Adlershof from February 9\u201312, 1918, the plane underwent modifications, as requested by the Idflieg. In April, a second prototype, powered by a Benz Bz IIIbm, although several D.III powered by the original IIIbo engine were already under production; however, none of them were ever completed.

Context_4 : The Townsend House is a historic late First Period house in Needham, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story wood frame house was built in 1720 by Gregory Sugars, a sea captain, for his son-in-law, Rev. Jonathan Townsend. The building has retained little external appearance as an early 18th century house, showing the adaptive reuse and restyling of older houses. It was given a Federal appearance in the 1780s by its second owner, Rev. Samuel West, and was, under his ownership, used as a muster site for the local militia prior to the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord. The building has been much modified over the years (including the addition of a mansard-like roof), but many of its older interior rooms have retained features from the 18th century.

Context_6 : The Prussian education system refers to the system of education established in Prussia as a result of educational reforms in the late 18th and early 19th century, which has had widespread influence since. It is predominantly used as an American political slogan in educational reform debates, since it was adopted by all American K\u201312 public schools and major universities as early as the late 18th century, and is often used as a derogatory term for education in the service of nation-building, teaching children and young adults blind obedience to authority, and reinforcing class and race prejudice. The actual Prussian education system was introduced as a basic concept in the late 18th century and was significantly enhanced after Prussia's defeat in the early stages of the Napoleonic Wars. The Prussian educational reforms inspired other countries and remains important as a biopower in the Foucaultian sense for nation-building. Compulsory education on the Prussian example was soon mirrored in Scandinavia, and United States started to adopt the Prussian example. Early American adopters include Daniel Coit Gilman, who set up The General Education Board, later renamed The Rockefeller Foundation, and first president of Johns Hopkins, John Dewey at the University of Chicago, James McKeen Cattell at The University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University, Henry Philip Tappan at The University of Michigan, James Earl Russell at the New York College for the Training of Teachers, and many more.

This was the third worst season for the Rams during their time in St. Louis. The team looked to improve on its 8-8 record from 2006. However, the Rams slumped early, losing their first 8 games of the season heading into their bye week. Following their bye, they would beat both New Orleans and San Francisco on the road before losing 5 of their last 6 games to conclude the season. The Rams 0-8 start to the season is the worst in franchise history and matched their 3rd ever longest losing streak. The Rams also went 1-7 at home in 2007, the worst in franchise history until it was broken by the 2009 team 2 years later. The Rams defense was dismal, and was the biggest scar on the team the entire season, as they allowed the 2nd most points in the league during the season with 438. Context_2 : The St. Louis Rams season was the franchise's 77th season in the National Football League, the 20th overall in St. Louis and the third under head coach Jeff Fisher.

The Rams failed to improve on their 7\u20139 record from 2013, finishing 6\u201310 in 2014. The Rams' 2014 season was notable for their numerous starting quarterbacks including Austin Davis, Shaun Hill, and Sam Bradford, the last of whom was injured before the season began.

Context_4 : The 1950 National Football League playoffs took place after the 1950 regular season ended with a tie for first place in both the American and National conferences. The ties forced one-game playoffs to determine who would play in the NFL championship game. It was the only time in the NFL's championship-game era that two such tiebreaker playoff games were needed in the same year. The Cleveland Browns and New York Giants tied for first place in the American Conference, while the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams tied for first place in the National Conference. The Browns proceeded to beat the Giants 8\u20133, and the Rams beat the Bears 24\u201314 in their playoff game. Cleveland then beat the Rams in the championship game the following week.

In 2015 2.1 million dollars of renovations were made to the facility, including adding an AstroTurf playing field, all new blue chair back seats, and padding the outfield wall. In addition the ASU Sports Complex consists of two NCAA regulation fields used for practice, along with indoor practice facilities. The Rams only coach has been Kevin Brooks. The only coach in ASU baseball history, he has a 219-134 Lone Star Conference record and an 14-11 record in five trips to the NCAA postseason. The Rams are the only Lone Star Conference team to ever make the College World Series and Brooks has taken them there three in only 12 seasons.

After the conclusion of the strike, the Rams finally got a win at home over the Kansas City Chiefs. However, during the game, quarterback Bert Jones was lost for the season after suffering a neck injury that ultimately ended his career. The Rams would lose their next four games before upsetting the 49ers in San Francisco in the season finale. The Rams would ultimately finish the season 2-7, last place in their division and dead last in the NFC. It was the team's worst season since 1962, when they won only 1 game. As a result, head coach Ray Malavasi was fired after the season and replaced by John Robinson the next season. Context_8 : The 2009 Detroit Lions season was the franchise\u2019s eightieth season overall in the National Football League.

The Lions spent the whole season at the bottom of their division and finished at 2\u201314, the second-worst record during the 2009 season. \"Pro Football Reference\" has argued that, owing to a weaker programme featuring the NFC West and AFC North vis-\u00e0-vis their 2008 schedule against surprisingly strong NFC South and AFC South divisions, the 2009 Lions were actually a weaker team than the 0\u201316 2008 Lions. Context_9 : The 1976 Los Angeles Rams season was the team's 39th year with the National Football League and the 31st season in Los Angeles.

After a record setting 1975 season in which their defense was nearly untouchable, the Rams were picked by many to win the Super Bowl. Despite not improving on its 12-2 record from 1975, the team continued to be one of the best in the NFL. This Rams team is quite notable for setting many records during the season. One good notable record was breaking the franchise record for points scored in a game with 59 in a 59-0 devouring of the Atlanta Falcons. The Rams would ultimately have another year of success, finishing 10-3-1. In the playoffs, they would beat Dallas 14-12 in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. However, the Rams would lose the NFC Championship game to the Minnesota Vikings 24-13. Context_10 : The 2009 St. Louis Rams season was the team\u2019s 72nd season in the National Football League, and its 15th in St. Louis.
