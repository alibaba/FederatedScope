It's also important to note that nobody has ever called me an asshole over this, it's just something that I myself am worried about.\n\nAnyway, I'm in love with my best (female) friend. I myself am male. During this story, which is still going on right now, we're around ages 16-20.\n\nI became friends with her because I had a crush on her. As soon as I felt it was socially appropriate, which was about 4-5 months into our friendship, I told her that. She said OK, but has basically dodged saying anything about reciprocation. Now, I'm not a dumbass, I know that \"not saying yes\" means \"no\". So I don't make any illusions of her being in love with me. She's basically trying to not hurt my feelings.\n\nHowever, despite this, I'm still in love with her. I don't have any issue with her avoiding the question, and I know that she, currently, isn't interested in a relationship (With anyone). Knowing this, I try to avoid bringing it up to much and try to just stay mostly friends. But I can't get rid of my love for her. I've told her this as well, or at least, I think it was clear from what I've said.\n\nThe big problem is that my wishes for the friendship and hers obviously don't align perfectly. I'd like to have way more contact with her than the other way around. Now, we've devised a situation that mostly works. We meet up at least once a year, possibly more if she wants. I email her every month. And she's 'required' to send me 2 emails per year. Now, when I say emails, these are big emails, usually being 1-3 pages, but I've sent one that was 8,25 pages long. A bit excessive, I know. Plus sometimes, there's some extra contact, like wishing each other a happy birthday, happy new year, all that jazz. \n\nAll in all, I'd say, on average, we meet up around 2 times a year and she emails me a couple of times a year, while I email her every month. This along with little titbits of contact along the way. She has assured me that this isn't something specific to me, and that this is just how she works. This has fluctuated along the years, but so far, the friendship has survived, even despite some (possibly major) issues. I'd obviously like more contact, but I try to respect her wishes.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not always the best at respecting her wishes and boundaries. Often times I get too excited or too depressed and start messaging her a bit too often. For example, while I can keep myself to 1 email per month the majority of the times, I'd say that in 1/3rd of all months, there would be another email. Sometimes, these weren't too big, like responding back to her when she responded, however, I don't think these emails were a real problem. The real problem emails were the ones I sent out of depression, loneliness, or whatever.\n\nI try to restrain myself from sending those emails, and in later times (As in, the last few months), I've been able to do so (Because I currently don't have anything that would lead to me sending those emails). However, previously, I haven't been so lucky. I went almost a whole year sending her 2 emails instead of 1, where I basically split up the month in 2 segments. Now, after she told me that she didn't like it, because it became too much for her, I stopped immediately. But I still did it for the previous few months, and that's something that I can't take back.\n\nThe even bigger problem however, weren't those emails. They weren't the emails I sent out of depression or other things. The emails I did send out of depression were pretty fucking bad. I'd try to always assure her that it wasn't her fault and that I'm merely venting to her about shit, but it basically became a negative feedback loop for myself. As I've said, currently, I've stopped doing so, and don't plan on doing it again, although I don't know if I'll be able to restrain myself from doing so when the going gets tough again.\n\nAnd currently, we've worked out most of these issues and our friendship still stands. We're prepared to face any new issues that might come our way, and the future looks bright. But my question is, was I an asshole for doing that to her in the past, or was it just a series of unfortunate events?", "output": "RIGHT", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

Sharing experiences and thought process helps me feel less of a weirdo and that there are people like me.\n\nSecondly, I enjoy helping other people through their problems. I get quite a bit of satisfaction out of seeing somebody's life take a turn for the better and knowing I helped with that improvement.

We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should.

Which means prom is also coming up. \n\nNow, I don't know about all of you but I think prom is one of the most elaborate scams ever devised by the education system and entertainment (case in point: every high school sweetheart film ever made). Which is why I never went to my senior prom.\n\nIts overpriced, you REQUIRE a nice outfit, and to top it off neither of us go to the school anymore. I've given her all these points and yet she still wants to go. We did, however, go to the homecoming last year. Let me tell you, I've never been more disappointed with my school and you have gym teachers getting arrested for sexual conduct with students here. \n\nShe was upset about the homecoming being bad too and I just know that prom going to be exactly the same way because there is no way our school makes enough money for a proper dance. So what do all think? Am I wrong for not wanting to go to a dance with my her? I'd rather spend the night at somewhere that would actually be fun.

I want to get back together with her and\n\nMy ex and I dated for about 4 years prior to us breaking up about 9 months ago.  I initiated the break up due to emotional issues stemming from my father's death in August 2017 (I was having a lot of difficulty processing and expressing emotions healthily and she is already a very emotional person and I kept asking myself \"How am I supposed to take care of your emotional needs when i can't even take care of my own?\"  I've since learned that letting people in is not weakness, as well as made progress towards getting past being constantly affected by the loss of the greatest man I've ever known).  At the time, she had said she would like to remain friends and we actually made earnest and sincere efforts to be friends; hanging out at neutral and public locations, paying for ourselves if food/drink/entertainment became involved, etc.  A few weeks ago, it came to a point where we realized the feelings were still there, mutually, but that we would need to talk more about how it was going to work between us (it used to be very one-sided in my direction and I want to put the balance more towards the middle) if we were to get back together.  So we began talking about getting back together and we still are.\n\nDuring all this time, she started hanging out another guy.  I was fine with this because we were broken up at the time and he seemed like a good friend to her.  Until a lot of things happened to make me feel the opposite.  Without going too deep into it and making this a stupidly long post, he has an abusive streak that he's using to control her.  In recent months, he's had her cosign for a brand new motorcycle and rejected getting a used car, isolated her from most of her friends, and move in with him into an apartment that she can barely afford half the rent on (and he can't pass a tenant screening so she's on the hook for that, too).  If she were to take on the amount of time necessary for her to afford more plus bills, she would have to quit school.  Everytime I come to her place, I'm told by her to just not engage (I do not like this \"man\" and refuse to do him the courtesy of hiding it from my face).  When I leave, he gets in her face and tries to intimidate her accusing her of bringing me over to have sex (the woman was on the floor shaking in obvious medical distress and he said, \"You're a needy little cunt, aren't you?\" and left.  I was there to help take care of her.).\n\nI have told her that she needs to get out of there, I have pointed out all the red flags, and she has been told how all of those were also things done to her by her mother (very abusive childhood).  I have also said that I can't control what she does with her life or who she hangs out with when we date again, but I have told her that if we moved in together, he will not be welcome in my home and I refuse to make him feel welcome in my home (still debating whether I'm even going to *let* him feel welcome in my home.  I am aware that it would be her home, too.).  She is still intent on being friends with him.  I haven't dropped the \"It's either him or me,\" line and I'm afraid of it coming to that because I'm not sure I would win but more importantly, it would put a huge strain on our relationship and I'm not sure we would outlast it before she realized that getting away from him was a good thing.

I want to make sure you obtain all the information:\n\nI met this person (call him TOM)on my 22nd birthday, I was drunk and with the help of liquid courage I managed to go up to TOM and ask for his number. The next day I he messaged me to save his number for the next time I go out. I was shocked that it worked lol \\[TOM also messaged me saying he would do \u2018dirty things\u2019 to me, I figured TOM liked me (probably a red flag here if he was willing to do things like that on such a short period of time\u2026)\\] Regardless.\n\nStarting out as friends, we would meet up when we both had off which was the weekends only. Things were cool for several months. Time passes, I remember I did the whole \u201cwhat are we?\u201d and he kind of froze. I remember getting upset and that was a red flag there, but this was my first time with someone (I thought I was going to fast with it) so I ignored it. Carried on our relationship, we went out here and there, I guess you could say we were dating (I thought we were, and I assumed that). His birthday came, I gave a few cool gifts and what not. Then the holidays, Thanksgiving and then Christmas I did the same. At this point, he introduced me to his friends that were nice to me. So, in return, I tried to be as nice as possible and befriend them because my thinking is if you wanted to date someone you need to be cool with their friends &amp; fam. Everything was cool until\n\nChristmas Break//New Year\u2019s\n\n\\*Remember this whole time I\u2019m going to college and this was my first time ever to be on my own (away from home). During my Christmas break I decided to stay at my place so I was alone and my work is seasonal so I was literally doing nothing. \n\n\\-----&gt;  New Years. New Year seem to be a problem. Last year, I was with my parents (they\u2019re in late 70s)  they went to bed at 7pm! So I didn\u2019t want to go home to celebrate my new year like that. Comes the evening I get a random message from TOM\u2019s friend asking me to go out with them for the New Year. I got excited cause I wasn\u2019t doing anything. Excited to go, I got dressed and geared up to let loose &amp; experience the new year the right way! Then I get a message from TOM saying are you going out with my friends?! ( I should have messaged him about it before saying yes to TOM\u2019s friend, turns out he had to work on New Years) I said yes to going because I got excited. He was really upset and said fine go. \n\nThe next day we talked, he thought it was wrong of me to go with his friends while he wasn\u2019t there \\[ I can understand that \\]. I told him I wouldn\u2019t do it again, things were weird after that, it wasn\u2019t the same. We barely saw each other and talked, it was on and off. I get a message from the same friend that invited me out for NY to go for some food &amp; a show. I decided to go to surprise TOM since he worked later in the day. I went and it was just her, I kind of panicked and didn\u2019t want to be rude and just leave because of what TOM and I agreed on so I went with it. TOM\u2019s friend and I talked about life it was pretty chill, his friend was cool af. He found out, I tried to explain that I was trying to surprise TOM by just showing up unexpectedly. This backfired, things were never the same. We didn\u2019t talk for a while until my birthday. I tried to invite him out to celebrate it but he didn\u2019t show. 3 days later he showed up gave me a gift wished me a happy birthday and left. It was strange, like he felt like he had to do it (return a favor). Time flies and things kinda settle down. **TOM wanted to be friends rather than anything else (via tinder msg)**. I haven\u2019t seen TOM for a while until he asked me to go out with him and his friends. I went, he was drunk and admittedly said things went too fast that\u2019s what scared him. I wasn\u2019t buying it because we \u201ctalked\u201d for a whole year and he didn\u2019t know what I was majoring in? What my hobbies were? and I\u2019m sure a lot more. But I know all this information about TOM, it\u2019s just salt in the wounds at this point. I TOLD HIM THAT I HATED HIM FOR NOT CARING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT NIGHT. TOM said that he would \u201calways be nice to me\u201d. Lol, anyway So I\u2019m not interested in TOM anymore, I was done trying to pursue him. \n\nOne night this summer one of his friends \\*AT THE TIME\\* invited me out to a hot tub party, I went and after that  I got message from his friend saying that he was deleted from all social medias from TOM and was sent a message saying \u201cwhy would you try to get with my ex\u201d. I was confused. I laughed about it and his friend did too, I moved on. Over time TOM tried to talk to me on social media, I was dry and ignored it.\n\nThen comes this decemeber: my friend wanted me to go out to the club were I met TOM, of course he was there and so was his friends. I\u2019m not interested in TOM but his friends greeted me we took pictures I kissed his friend on the cheek as a good bye. That night I got a message saying why did I kissed his friend. I sent \u201cLMAO\u201d and that was it. Then a week later I was sent a message to go out with a few friends that were gonna be with TOM. This is New Year weekend, so I had nothing like last year and I went to have a few drinks. Cops were out so I stood around till the bar closed. Tom and his friends were done with clubbing and were waiting on a ride. I offered to get an UBER to be nice and to make sure everyone arrives safely to their destinations. Uber X carries on 4 I totally spaced on that and there was 5 of us. So in the end we tried to pack in the car and the uber driver was like this can\u2019t happen so I jump out and said  I\u2019ll just go home ( I didn\u2019t live to far from the club and wasn\u2019t too drunk) I got out and the car started to drive off and then out of no where one of TOM\u2019s friend jumped out and thought it was messed up for me to get an uber for everyone and not even take it. Tom and the people made it back to their destination. Out of no-where me and the friend that rode with me back to the same destination gets deleted from TOM\u2019s social media. I don\u2019t care, I ended up blocking him in return. His friend was like what did I do? I apologized for bring him in this mess even though I was just trying to be nice and be cautious about going home. Apparently, TOM was mad, stormed off as soon as they are arrived.\n\nAt this time his friends told me the truth (since he was gone) and everything that was wrong with me and him. I found out that TOM\u2019s friends are not trustworthy, they tend to \u201cmess around\u201d with a lot people. I think I can say that TOM has insecurities because he thought I slept with his friends in the past. Tom\u2019s friends said I was too nice and tried to please TOM no matter what. Also, Tom\u2019s friends told him to take me seriously. Tom\u2019s friends said I was too honest which made things worse at times. \n\nThere was a reason why I wanted to wait till I was older to try to date and to experience things with someone I cared about. To show what type of person I am I had my first kiss when I was 18 and didn\u2019t get laid till well this relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s just sad that I tried so hard to make this perfect.\n\nI know this was a lot, but I wanted to provide my thinking to each action I did. It was my first person I thought I loved. Hard lesson learned. As well I learned that age is just a number because TOM was immature for a 28yo. Lol, I tried to make this relationship happen and it damaged me pretty bad tbh\u2026 through school, work, and my own life probs.\n\nI figured I was in the wrong because I got unfriended and what not\u2026\n\nso AITA to ruin this relationship, take friends, idk?\n\nwhat do you think??", "output": "RIGHT", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

I\u2019m on mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird. \n\nI\u2019ll start with some backstory. Five months ago, I was dealing with constant jaw pain and numbness in parts of my face. After seeing doctors and dentists, I finally landed at an oral surgeon\u2019s office who took an X-ray and found my wisdom teeth were technically impacted but actively growing at the wrong angle. The reason I was experiencing numbness is because the my teeth are pressing down on a nerve, and surgery will be necessary to prevent possible permanent damage. I scheduled my surgery to land specifically on spring break for my school. Pretty much all of my professors this semester take off points for missing class, so missing an entire week was entirely out of the question for something I\u2019m paying $21K for. This was in December.\n\nI asked my boyfriend immediately afterwards if he would be able to watch me for my surgery. He\u2019s ending trade school so we planned ahead to make sure he would be free during the time I went for my surgery. Everything fit perfectly and we confirmed this was the plan. \n\nThis all changed about three weeks ago, when he got a call from a possible employer who was demanding that he start training on the same day of my surgery. My boyfriend asked if he could delay until the day after and explained the situation, but the employer basically brushed him off and said \u201cshe knows it\u2019s a job right?\u201d \n\nThat annoyed me immensely, seeing as this surgery is necessary and I\u2019m not allowed to be by myself, but whatever. We had a heated discussion about it and I told him that if he can\u2019t do it to let me know NOW so I can arrange a \u201cbaby sitter\u201d as soon as possible. He kinda went back and forth on it and then decided that he doesn\u2019t want to work with this specific company and that he\u2019ll bring me for my surgery. Okay, cool, I can relax. \n\nToday(less than a week before my surgery), he tells me he can\u2019t take me to my surgery. We get into a huge argument and he says he wants to go to the interview so that it can be on his resume for future employers to look at it. I\u2019m pissed because I can\u2019t find anybody to take me, everyone I know is busy. The paperwork specifically says I\u2019m not allowed to leave the center by myself because I\u2019ll be under the influence; someone has to check me out, so I can\u2019t even get an Uber. He says I should consider his employment, but I don\u2019t think any future employer is going to care that he got a job interview and trained for one day then quit. In fact, I think this shows a lack of commitment. \n\nI feel super guilty because I don\u2019t want to say he can\u2019t go to his interview but now I have to ask a friend to take the day off last minute.

When I met her she was financially stable, though I make mid-six figures and she makes mid-five figures. I appreciated that she was frugal (as am I) and didn't waste money on things like trips or expensive meals out or material items no one needs. After a while she admitted to me that the reason she is so frugal is because she grew up very poor and does not have a safety net. Last spring she had an accident that resulted in her being in the hospital for some time and saddled her with a great deal of medical bills. From day one she was adamant that because we had only been dating for a few months, I was not responsible for any of her bills, nor did she even want me to know the financial specifics of them. I was fine with that and we continued as usual. I did notice that she has become more frugal than before and has acted as if she is under more stress, but I honestly thought it had more to do with the accident than anything else.\n\nLast weekend we met up with two of our other friends for brunch. My GF said she wasn't hungry and didn't order anything during the meal and just had a cappuccino and some of my home fries, but we all split the meal four ways anyway because that's how it is with these friends. It wasn't a huge bill but she was obviously annoyed about having to put her card down for it, even though we've all paid our share of meals where we had the smallest item before. Anyway, when we were on our way home we passed a woman selling tamales on the corner for $2 apiece. GF says to me \"Babe, do you have $2?\" I did have cash, but she had literally just sat through a meal saying she wasn't hungry, and I was embarrassed by the way she had rolled her eyes while settling the bill, so I told her there was a bank across the street. She went \"I don't want to have to take out a $20 just for a two dollar tamale,\" and I told her \"Fine, don't get a tamale then.\" She got really quiet and went \"I'm just really hungry,\" and I kind of snapped at her and told her that she should have ordered something at brunch instead of just eating my leftovers. Then she told me that she has been \"food insecure\" over the past few weeks because of her medical/credit card debt and that she didn't have the $20 in her bank account to take out because she had to pay at brunch. She said she hadn't told me about any of this because she \"knew\" I would judge her for not handling her money more wisely, started crying, called me an asshole, and walked off. I haven't spoken to her since it happened on Sunday.\n\nI don't think this is fair for a number of reasons, the biggest being that I'm not a mind reader and wouldn't know anything about her finances because she expressly told me her medical bills were none of my business. I highly doubt the \"food insecure\" claim, but either way, she has been way too eager to let me pick up the bill when we go out to eat over the past couple months (even though at the beginning of the relationship we always split it evenly, or she'd pay if she ordered the more expensive thing). She makes a salary and I have no reason to believe she can't afford food to eat, so I'm pretty sure this is a guilt trip situation.

I'm gonna preface this by saying I'm by no means calling myself a perfect catch, or a highly sought after womanizer, but this girl is a little high on the weight scale and a little low on the overall attractiveness scale to be someone I'd pursue while sober. Long story short, even though she's not my cup of tea while sober, blackout me was more than willing to go home with her and be college kids for the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy awkward and hungover ass couldn't figure out a tactful way to dip out the next morning so we continued to wake up at noon, start drinking again, and make me question my standards again. After sobering up and getting home on Sunday, the two of us came to an agreement that young adults like to fuck around wile drunk, and that's the end of it. Trouble is she kept contacting me, assertively at first, but eventually easing off well after I told her we're done and I had started a serious relationship with a girl I actually liked. \n\nFast forward about a year and a half and I had tried to maintain a platonic communication with her despite her best efforts. I know the easiest thing would be to just block her #/Snapchat, but mixed in with untasteful nudes and drunken pleas to come over see and her were seriously concerning messages about depression and mental instability. Call it my fault or call it bad luck, but either way I seem to have a history of getting overly involved romantically with depressed, anxiety ridden, and/or bipolar women. I want to break any ties with her, but at the same time don't wanna be the trigger that sets off someone who's already claimed to be suicidal. \n\nIn case it wasn't already obvious, I'm not exactly a pillar of emotional stability either, and I've made the mistake of digging myself a deeper hole. Due to a mixture of post break-up loneliness, depression, and alcoholism, I've let my sad dick take control of my brain and slept with her. I'm not even attracted to her, and the fact that I'm too ashamed to confide in my friends about this situation is telling, but I just find myself caving in out of shear boredom almost. I think she's even catching on to the fact that I prefer not to have her around my place while others are over, and only see her when I'm feeling down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: Girl I had a one night stand with but carry little interest in still contacts me. Despite my lack of physical interest, and lack of compatibility with her, I occasionally sleep with her out of pity/ boredom/ loneliness/ or some combination.

I'm not comfortable explaining exactly what was up, but it's like if you're having issues with weird leg and foot pain that feels like pins and needles and you know your friend has diabetic neuropathy, even if you're not diabetic, you may ask them about neuropathy because neuropathy is nerve damage often in the hands and feet so it's vaguely related.

The next day I was playing a sportsgame at 8 in the morning so I left and didn\u2019t check my phone. We got home and we left to go to an amusement park and were away the entire day. I had left my phone at home. We ate on our way home and got home at 9. Me being younger meant that I fell asleep immediately, again not checking my phone. The next day I had a lot of texts from the school group chat for homework so my girlfriend\u2019s text was at the bottom. I didn\u2019t read it and found out about it in the evening.

I ran into some difficult times in a housing situation, and C and his girlfriend K offered to rent me a room. C had been dating K for about a year, and I was good friends with K as well. I was weary about cohabitating with friends, but they practically begged me to do it. We set some ground rules, rent cost etc, and one rule being that they were 100% ok with me having  girls over or whatever, (tenant/landlord law in the state forbids landlords from preventing a tenant from having guests anyway.) \n\nFast forward a few months, I had to have knee surgery which put me off of work for 14 weeks. In this time I needed an incredible amount of help getting around ( I couldn't drive either) and the girl I was seeing was amazing at helping me. She would stay over on days when I had early morning doctor of PT appointments and help me whenever she could.\n The problem was, K did not like this girl. K is the kind of friend who thinks she knows what's best for you, so even though she had no discernable reason to hate her, she just did. One week this girl had to stay over about 4 nights in a row, to help me getting to appointments and we were also working on a large charity project for a children's hospital ( this was around the holidays)\nI should note that this girl didn't shower here, we didn't cook or eat their food, drink their drinks or hang out in common areas. I/We literally stayed in the room I rented the entire time. \nAbout a week later I get this text from K:\n\n\"Hey, I don't have a lot of friends, but the ones I do have, I value a lot in my life. Part of the reason I probably don t have a lot of friends is because I don't like to bullshit or be fake. If there's something bothering me, I like to talk about it and resolve it. I know you've told me you've had bad experiences with roommates and I have too, trust me, but I really did mean it when I said that we will never have an issue, because we are all good friends. \nI'm going to be upfront because I don't expect anything less from you. Get your dick wet...i love sex and I don't feel like you should be deprived. But can (girl) just come less? She's there every single day, and we didn't really sign up for 2 roommates. My sisters will be here from dec 23rd till January 11th, and unfortunately we only have two bathrooms, so could she also please not come when they are here? \"\n\nI responded \"ok\" but I was actually hurt a lot by this. \nLike.. being accused of trying to move this girl in, when she had no property here and didn't cost them anything was insulting. Also they know I can't walk or drive around due to my surgery, yet assume she's just staying over for sex. Not to mention I felt like if I rent a room somewhere, I should be able to sleep with whoever I want in that room. \nI couldn't argue the point because they're the ones helping me out with housing, and I didn't want to put my friend C in the middle of this, but I felt like this was only said because K hated this girl. I started looking for a new place to stay immediately but it took 6 weeks. In this 6 weeks neither K nor C, or her visiting sisters would even acknowledge my existence. No one would talk to me or even make eye contact with me. Not to mention my birthday was during the time her sisters were over which made it incredibly lonely sitting in my room like a ghost in the attic. \nI moved out and haven't spoken to K at all since. C contacted me later asking me to apologize to K for \"getting weird and ignoring her\" after she sent that text. The thing is, I couldn't do it. I didn't want to be her friend anymore. Unfortunately it also cost me my friendship with C. \nTLDR: I rented a room with my friend and his girlfriend. They agreed before hand they're cool with me having girls over. Had a girl over too often due to needing help with injury/Charity work. Friend's girlfriend hated this girl asked me to not have her come over so often/ anymore. I felt like if I rent a room, I should be able to sleep with whoever I want in that room. Both friendships with friend and his girlfriend are destroyed. AITA?

But it's okay- they're broke too and they're family. I'll do a lot for family without mentioning it. \n\nHalfway though all of this I'm *told* (not asked) that the adult brother is staying at our house for the next 2 weeks (laughable- it'll be a month or more, I'm sure) because he's yet to apply for a job transfer, search for new work in the new town, or even put in his two weeks notice here. He's the only one in that household who works so they can't afford him not working for a few weeks. The parents didn't tell him to transfer or job search either.

It all falls on my boyfriend and I but I can't say no because they're family and he has \"nowhere else to go\".

We said our goodbyes and agreed to meet up in the morning and explore the city. \n\nThis morning, I didn't hear from them.

Chegg Study is useful for accessing textbook solutions, posting problems to be answered by \"experts\", and searching solutions previously worked by \"experts.\" For college students, it costs $15.00/month. Split among three people, that is $5.00 each per month. We will call my roommates Sally and Betsy.\n\nBetsy is the one who suggested we share a Chegg account. We were all studying one night, and Betsy had a chemistry test the next day. She kept saying how useful Chegg would be for chemistry. I thought it could be useful to me also, since I'm a science student. Betsy suggested the three of us share a Chegg account and pay $5.00 each per month. I knew that by owning the account, I was accepting the risk that my roommates might not hold up their agreement. Nevertheless, I created the account, shared the login information with Betsy and Sally, paid the $15.00 for that month, and sent Venmo requests to Betsy and Sally for $5.00 each. They each paid and we continued to study happily.\n\nThe second month rolled around, and I billed them both for $5.00 after Chegg charged me the $15.00. Sally texted me saying she didn't find it useful but knew it would be useful to me and Betsy. This annoyed me, but I had seen it coming. I decided I would retain the service if Betsy still wanted to share. I didn't bother asking Sally for my $5.00 back because I suspected she would refuse to pay it and throw a fit. Betsy agreed that she and I would retain the Chegg service and pay $7.50 each.\n\nThis month, like every other, I billed Betsy for my $7.50 after Chegg charged my account. She didn't ever pay it. I texted her and asked about it today. She said she wouldn't be using it anymore. I said that was fine, but I still needed the $7.50 because I had already been charged for the month. She was flabbergasted that I had the nerve to ask for my $7.50 that she had effectively spent by not notifying me that she wished to cancel the service. She says she will not pay for something that she isn't using. I explained that this would be like me refusing to pay rent because I decided to move out without giving her notice to find someone else to take over the lease, although the money is not that much. She became irate and insisted repeatedly that she said she \"only needed it for chemistry\" and that she had told me \"MONTHS ago\" that she would not need it after that. In my memory, this is false; she said she would use it for chemistry, not that she wanted to cancel it after the semester ended. And even if she did say that, I think she should have had the courtesy to remind me that she would no longer need the service. We both agreed that we should have had a conversation about whether we intended to continue using it after the semester ended. I told her I wasn't going to fight her over $7.50, but I was frustrated that she had asked me to create the account, then not held up her agreement. She raised the point that I didn't charge Sally for $5.00 when she decided to no longer pay, and I said that it was beside the point because she owed me $7.50 regardless of the $5.00 Sally owes me. I said that at some point, it's my money they're spending by refusing to pay.

That's why I'm on that sub in the first place, I don't care much for Spongebob, but it's funny.

To start off, I was 17m, my girlfriend was 18f. We'll call her dirt. So, I had just started up another year of school. And already from the last year, I've had my own circle of friends. Consisting of 3 males, including myself. And 3 females. A balanced group, a few of them; dirt in particular, I've never really paid much attention to, and didn't really care about them as much as the others as they always had their own flaws that annoyed me. Now me, being decently young back then, didn't really ever have a girlfriend before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to my shock, only about 2 months after knowing dirt. The messenger of our group, we'll call her mike, so mike, had just received a little gossip on dirt's recent crush, which just so happened to be me. At the end of the day, mike told me about it. I was mind blown, confused, dumbfounded. Basically a surge of emotions rolling around screaming what the hell is going on?? But I made up my mind. I wanted to try having a girlfriend, and so I did. The first few months went smoothly, she was so kind, and i was kind straight back. And the time we spent was fun. I couldn't have really asked for more. Then, at the end of the school year; my parents decided they'd like to finish my education by homeschooling me. Naturally, being myself. I agreed on a whim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until later when I looked into it more, that I realized I wouldn't be able to see dirt anymore. So our relationship would become long distance from now on.  So we went our separate ways, still together. But not in real life. In the first 3 months, I was hit with a heavy depression by this fact. I wouldn't leave my room for hours and i stopped caring about things. And to make things worse, when I finally recovered. She changed, she was like a different person almost. It was subtle but I could tell. At the time i had no clue and blissfully passed it off, but looking back now the signs were clear and I had the chance to run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is when it started, no longer theoretically being in moderation by me, she was free to do as she wished. And as such, she could change her priorities. So she started caring less, as dumb as I was, even I saw this coming. But the thing is, there was so much more to it. even now I don't know the half of what she did behind my back. She started being friends with my sister, and she started ERPing as well, (which stands for Erotic Role Playing) Of course at the time I had no clue she did this as I trusted her enough to not have to look on her social medias, otherwise I would have immediately ditched her for cheating.  And after this, started the deception and lies, she would lie to me. I would want to confront her about things she's been doing that don't really sit well in a relationship. But every time, she would pass it off. Then talk to my sister,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm not just being jealous here, she genuinely cared about my sister more than I. And I wasn't to happy as you could imagine, as that's not how this works. Multiple times i confronted her, to not avail. But, in the end started to grow knowledgeable. I realized that my issues can't be solved by no means that i've tried. And that I need to end it. She's showed all the unspoken and implied signs of a manipulative psychopath. So how would i go about this? At the time, I was still my too nice for my own good gullible self, I couldn't simply end it by talking to her about it, even on a whim. \n\nSo out of ideas, and approaching the 2 year mark for our realtionship, I decided, if I'm too weak to end it. I'll just get her to end it for me. So, I did the thing that annoyed her the most. Surpassing her, every time she tried to speak something factual, I would correct it, and the thing is, it was super easy, she's not the brightest so almost everything she said would have a bottom line or different answer. Eventually, she had enough and we finally broke up. There's more to this experience, but this is all that's relevant to the title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in all in all, I simply want to know Am i the asshole for doing what I did? And did i need to do it that way? Or were there better choices here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: 17m, 18f girlfriend started off nice and happy, moved on to be a pyscho, discovered things about her.\n\nDecided to try and end it, not good enough to end it, so i let her do it for me by getting her to a point where she was sick of me.", "output": "WRONG", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

We both went on to be diagnosed with depression after the incident and some other earth shattering events. But to the story at hand.\n\n\nWe were in one of those big relationship defining fights. Those fights that last for awhile and emotions come out so raw that our immature minds couldn\u2019t properly comprehend all of it. The crux of it was simple. She was contemplating opening up our relationship so she could \u201csow her wild oats\u201d in college. I\u2019m as new age as they come but I had a problem with it and wanted to stay a monogamous couple. \n\n\nThe fight progressed and in the end she wanted to take it all back. I couldn\u2019t accept that, I needed to cool off, it felt like my entire world was spinning so I went into the other room to breathe. (It\u2019s a one room apartment so I couldn\u2019t go anywhere). While in the living room I heard the door to the bathroom slam. I heard her yelling about how she doesn\u2019t want to live. I ran to the bathroom door scared.\n\n\nI heard her frantically searching and slamming through the drawers. I heard a loud crack and a cry. Then it repeated, and repeated.\n\n\nThroughout this time I was saying her name asking her to open the door and to stop. The bang and whimpers continued until I backed up and ran into the bathroom door. The door frame was weak and buckled allowing me in (we had a really cheap apartment, think projects level). When the door swing open I saw her hit her head on the wall again.\n\n\nI immediately grabbed her, wrapped her in a weird bear hug type deal and brought her to the bed in the other room. There she laid next to me and cried for awhile. My head was still spinning but I knew I had to do something. I remembered that 9/11 in our area allowed texting. While she was laying down sobbing I quickly texted 9/11 our location, the situation and to please hurry.\n\n\nMy rational at the time was that she just seriously attempted to hurt herself. As selfish as it sounds I was nowhere near capable of handling the situation alone.\n\n\nThe police came, they talked to us apart. Took us in squad cars to a local hospital where she was admitted to a psych ward after a review. \n\n\nAfter talking to my friends on the matter I was told that I may have handled this wrong. I was informed of the terrible realities of inpatient care. As well as the stress it puts on a person going through a bad times. I feel like shit for hurting her.\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR:\nGirlfriend and I had a big fight over the state of our relationship. She locked herself in the bathroom and hurt herself.

However, These messages were just to show her side of the story and telling me she does not want to include our mother in our arguments. Then there were some casual messages afterwards to try and end this entire situation. This almost broke my patience, since I felt the only reason I included our mother was to protect her from myself. Additionally, she still ignored the apology message I had sent the night before. I sent one message saying that I did not like it that she ignored my apology, because I had to use a lot of self-control to type it. I think it might have been her way of putting this entire situation behind her and moving on. I feel that I need her to at least say that she appreciates that I apologized.\n\nNow I feel like I might sent some hurtful messages if I contact her again, since my patience is almost spent, but I still want the opinion of others.

I saw him text her that they \u201chad a big problem\u201d and that I know everything. \n\nNow when I confronted my mom she kept on denying it. She said that I saw it in a wrong way (what other way is there to see \u201cdaddy\u201d?) and that she was planning a summer visit to India with him and planning on how to pay for it to surprise my dad. They both kept on denying it. She kept on saying why would I cheat now in my 50s (mind you my dad is outside the country). \n\nNow I\u2019m really stuck in crossroads. Is she actually cheating?

The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \"RIGHT\" or \"WRONG\".", "input": "So first, some backstory.\n\nDuring my sophomore year in high school I met this girl (who we'll call Sarah) and we hit it off quite well. We developed feelings for each other and we kept on talking until the last day of summer break when she told me she didn't like me anymore. I was heartbroken for months, but then I met this other girl (who we'll call Anna) who helped me out of that dark place, and I then realized I started to have feelings for her and as it turns out they were mutual but she was not allowed to date so we just kept it on the down low for about a year, but I found she was a bit emotionally unavailable, so I explained that I craved more affection and emotion and broke up with her basically. So at this point we are in Senior year and not long after that one of me and Anna's mutual friends (who we'll call Sally) said that she liked me, and I saw that as a means of getting the things I craved so I decided I was down but she changed her mind at the last minute and we never became a thing. So Anna found out about that and was even more hurt than she already was (she had been having breakdowns in the middle of class and stuff like that according to yet another friend who is not important to the rest of the story, to which I replied \"where was that emotion when I needed it?\", but I digress) because it was as if I had never cared about her in the first place which really wasn't the case. I felt so bad and I really wanted to repair our relationship, but then Sarah comes back and explains that the reason she had told me she no longer liked me was just because past relationship trauma from her middle school years made her go into panic mode and she did not want to leave herself vulnerable again, but her feelings for me never truly went away, and what made her come back was that she actually tried being with a different guy but the guy ended up getting back with his ex without even telling Sarah about it so Sarah, now knowing how I felt originally, went back to me to apologize and wanted to try us again but for real this time. We wanted to wait until the whole thing with Anna and Sally blew over before we became official, but they ended up finding out because Sally was actually Sarah's best friend and I was texting Sarah but Sally had her phone at the time taking pictures for snapchat. So Anna is even more upset at me now and so is Sally because now it's like I never cared about either of them. I feel absolutely horrible that I caused all of this, I really never intended for any of this to turn out the way it did. I used to look at guys who were players in disgust but now I am just disgusted at myself that I became one of them. Sarah and I just decided to become official since there's really nothing to lose now but I am still trying to forgive myself. I was being so stupid. This series of events (which I'll call The Crisis to refer to it later) was my first real experience with relationship drama and I'm trying to take as many lessons from it as possible, better I learn now than later right? But anyways, now for the actual story. \n\nSo I was texting Sarah and she told me that one of our mutual friends (who we'll call Chris) had been mean to her after Anna and Sally interrupted a conversation she was having with a mutual friend of me, Sarah, Anna, and Sally (who we'll call Aaron). Sarah had a theory that Sally was trying to steal away their mutual friends from before The Crisis, which would explain the interruption but the facts are unclear. It is no secret that Chris liked Anna so it would make sense if Chris was simply putting on a show for Anna so I decided to confront Chris even though Sarah said it was okay. I texted him saying \"Were you mean to Sarah to put a show on for Anna?\" and he explained that he didn't mean to make Sarah feel bad, he thought that was just their banter because they were being jokingly mean to each other just that morning. I was satisfied, I just wanted to know what happened after all, and that was supposed to be the end of it but turns out Chris had screenshotted the conversation and I assume showed it to Anna, making fun of me for thinking his act was a show for her. Anna probably told Sally about it because Sally somehow found out and texted me saying that she did not even talk to Aaron to begin with and that I should keep her name out of my mouth. She was acting like I was spreading rumors or something but I literally only spoke to Chris who was involved anyway. But what confused me is that she claimed she didn't talk to Aaron so I asked Chris about it since he saw the whole thing and he confirmed that Sarah was talking to Aaron when Anna and Sally came and interrupted the conversation. I asked him for permission to use that as proof and when he said yes I screenshotted what he said and showed it to Sally to which she replied that all she did was call Aaron's name and then Aaron started talking to Anna. I was pretty sure that still counts as interrupting the conversation but I thought this whole situation was extremely petty so I just let her have the last word and let that be the end of it. I then told Sarah what had happened and she got so upset with me. She kept saying that I should've dropped it when she said it was okay and that it was none of my business. She didn't talk to me for like a day after that and in the meantime I was talking to Chris about the whole situation and we both agreed that neither of us had the intention of escalating the situation to this height. When Sarah finally did explain why she got so upset, she explained that she did not want Sally to hate her any more than she already did, she did not want to poke the bear so to speak. As I previously explained they were best friends before The Crisis, and I guess she still wanted to find a way to remain that way but that confuses me because she knew that trying to be with me in the first place would mean losing her, so I assumed she was prepared for that and thought I was worth it. I explained to her that I don't think she can have the both of us at the same time and that I don't want her to go on a wild goose chase for Sally. I just think this whole situation was extremely petty and honestly should not have even happened. \n\nThis is a long one so thanks if you read the whole thing, but without further ado: AITA?", "output": "RIGHT", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

When I decided to switch universities last year and move back in with my parents I was giving up a very well paying, stable job as an au pair/tutor. I hadn\u2019t lived at home for about 4 years and in that time my mother and father made the decision to start fostering a 13 year old I will call Alice. I love Alice, I never had a girly kinda sister around since I had a very manly lesbian sister and my twin brother. She\u2019s hard working, sweet and caring, and none of this is directed towards her. \nTo make up for me not having a stable income anymore my parents decided to hire me as an au pair to Alice. \nMy hours are essentially 07:00-07:30 Monday till Friday, 14:00-16:00 Monday till Thursday and 14:00-20:00 on a Friday (She has choir in a town 40 minutes away and we get home late every Friday). This in between studying full time, and working another side job. \nThey pay me R3400 a month (about $244) which is supposed to include my fuel. I drive about 22km (about 14 miles) every day dropping and fetching her from school. Au Pairs in my country generally charge R50-75 an hour ($3.50-7.50) and R3/km ($0.20). \n\nNow that all of that is over let me start from about 15 minutes ago when I told my parents that I wanted to stay at my boyfriends house this weekend, starting on Thursday as I currently have off from school and he is house sitting this entire weekend, so he has no way of visiting me. My mother freaked saying that who would look after Alice on Friday, as she is also on break and therefor doesn\u2019t have school on Friday either. I stood there flabbergasted as my mom berated me about how if I was her client back in the old town I would not treat her like this and that I should look after Alice this Friday. I walked out of the room absolutely furious that she would speak to me like that. If she wanted me to look after Alice she could have asked nicely and I would have said yes and gone through to my boyfriend Friday afternoon instead. \n\nShe brought in business a o I decided to handle this as cleanly and business-like as possible. After some serious calculations I figured out that my parents were not only underpaying me (R35 an hour/$2.50) but also grossly misusing me. So I\u2019ve decided to propose I charge them what they should be paying me, including overtime for looking after my sister this entire week. Since I only work from 14:00, that would include an extra 6 hours of work everyday that they need to pay me for, and I would discuss a new monthly rate that I should be rightfully paid. I am separating business from family and if they want to look for a cheaper option they can try but they will not find it, as I would be charging them the bottom rate for an au pair here. \n\nSo my question is, AITA for doing this to my parents? \n\n\n\n\n\n", "output": "RIGHT", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

Normally we have a pretty good relationship and talk for a bit before switching. Usually its to vent on other coworkers who have causes us stress the last time we saw each other (usually the same people.) But today was different.\n\nToday they come into work and notice that another coworker who normally works in the back, is working out front where everyone can see. (Big lobby area, the guy has a stand out for a group today) and my coworker just starts railing on this dude. \"Oh god, fatso's out of the kitchen. I can't stand him.\" Now normally I understand - the dude is hard to get along with at work because he's head chef and is demanding of everyone he talks to. However when its not busy or when he is just hanging out (rarely) the guy has always been pleasant with me so in my mind: Pleasant dude/demanding when working. I can live with that.\n\nHowever I don't think my coworker has ever just chatted with the guy, except in work mode. And they are loudly complain about the chef working in the lobby today. Now the lobby's big, he probably can't hear them talk but they are making no effort to conceal it. In fact they're going on and on so much I only get a chance to say one sentence- \"I think you're overstepping.\"\n\nThey shut up. Like on the spot. Now normally they are chatty no matter what but this was an instant shift. They didn't talk to me besides \"Yes, No,\" or \"okay\" until I packed up and left. Reeeaaally different from any other interaction with them. Personally I'm thankful in case chef was going to overhear at some point later in the day when I wasn't there.\n\nTLDR: Coworker was complaining loudly about fellow coworker who was working in the same room (probably couldn't hear at the time) and I told them they were overstepping without explaining myself. Coworker got visibly upset with me and refused to talk to me till I left.\n\nSo specifically- AITA for the way I spoke?

He went to a fancy art school where he worked his ass off for his degree (went to community college first, worked the entire time he was at school, went to food closets, was homeless on and off living out of his car, ect). After we both graduated, we moved in together and I went to get my masters and he went to work in food service. He's been stuck on the idea that he HAS to do animation and hes just waiting for his big break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblem is. He sucks at it.\n\nHe hasn't even made an animation!\n\nYeah his school sucked so much, they didn't even have students make a demo reel. His story ideas are terrible, his artwork is terrible, and it feels like he's done nothing since graduating. I feel terrible for thinking this way and feel like a total asshole for trying to persuade him to seek another career path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Side:** He won't tell me why he wants to do animation specifically (not even the generic, \"I want to make an impact on the world\" kind of thing) and complains that the world is out to get him (often saying he suffers from \"bad luck\" or \"god hates me\" when I feel like it's his life choices hes making). He complains that the animation industry is cutthroat and works you to the bone and how awful it is. He also complains that art is so hard for him and his hand physically hurts when he even thinks about doing something creative. This all prompts me to say, \"If its so terrible and you complain about it so much.... well then why do you want to do it?\" and he goes on and on about how he wants to create a cartoon series and that he wants to put his degree to use. Or he comes up with a different disingenuous answer every time I ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, he started working part time so that he could work on his art more... but he hasn't really done much. He thought he could open commissions up to make some money on the side... but no one has even messaged him about it and its been months. He has no online following and complains about that too. I'm having to pay for a lot of things because he only makes enough to pay his bills and rent (I buy food, pay for any kind of date, pay for getting his car fixed, pay him for gas to get to work, ect). I honestly don't mind if he was happy but he hates this job too, and it sounds like it's not the right fit. He will not seek another job or pick up more hours because he thinks he is not qualified for anything outside food service and retail (not true), he doesn't want to do any more schooling or training for another career path, and he wants his next job to be an animation job and that's that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is also dead set on moving in with his former roommate that lives in LA (I really dislike him and think hes super sexist and a general man-child) so they can make their own TV show and pitch it to studios. Problem is, I think this friend is just as depressed and hasn't done shit either so I don't know how moving in with him would help. But he claims they have brilliant ideas (that I think are bad) and he needs to be in the same room to \"bounce ideas off each other.\" (Skype is out of the question apparently??)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is stressful for me because he won't say when he is going to move, wont make any plans for it, has no savings for it, and doesn't even know how long he will live out there (six months?? a year??? indefinitely????). I'm trying to find my own way in the world as well and it just feels like his ideas are just outlandish based on his skill. It's making it hard to move forward in life and make plans for the future together. We are close to our thirties now and while we are both the definition of late bloomers, I'm kind of tired of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am by no means a saint. I have had to change my career path and tried many different jobs out. I'm not doing a job that matches my degree. I've volunteered at a lot of different places and come at my career goals in non conventional ways. I've learned a lot from all of these experiences about what I want to do with my life. When he looks at jobs, if they aren't animation he wont even both applying. He's worked food service, retail, and that's it and only because he needed a paycheck. Never had an internship, never volunteered anywhere, nothing. I asked him if he would like to volunteer someplace now he's working part time and he said, \"no that will just take time away that I could be spending drawing.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gets very angry and stubborn with me if I mention pursuing a different career path, no matter how gently I say it, and it has been the basis for almost all of our fights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**His side:** He often feels like I dislike his art and am not supportive of him. He says that these things take time and he is working on artwork and has made lots of progress. He also says he is applying for lots of jobs and he goes to (expensive!) animation conventions to network with people and recruiters for jobs. He spent $500 on an online skype tutoring course with a well known animator and really hit it off with the guy. He thinks that I just really don't get along with his old roommate and wishes that I did because then we could all move in together. LA is the place to be if you want to do animation and no other city would provide him as many opportunities. Me not supporting him is making things worse in his eyes and he wants me to be a supportive partner.  He blames the world around him and says his lack of money makes it hard to do anything. His computer is 4+years old now and makes it hard to even run photoshop on and that's why he doesn't like to animate or do art as much. He also says it takes him a long time to get his creativity flowing and it takes him too long to draw anything. If he just had more talent, he would have a job already (exact wording from him). He gets distracted while drawing and loses track of time (especially in the morning) making it hard to find time in the day to do anything productive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe does suffer from depression and has since childhood. I had to push\\* him to go to therapy. He had a lot of negative experiences in the past and was on a crap load of medications that really messed with his affect. Since in therapy he's moved forward a bit, but his therapist is mostly about dealing with his stress and teaching meditation techniques. I also recently pushed him to get medical insurance and see a psychiatrist (and a doctor for the first time since dating). He got diagnosed with ADHD and is somewhat interested in pursuing medication, but is still hesitant because he \"doesn't want to become dependent on a pill.\" and, \"I've made it this far without medication, I don't want to lose the coping mechanisms I've learned to deal with it.\"\n\n\\*By push I mean looking up therapists/medical plans and basically laying it out for him or giving him a script of what to say on the phone when he chooses who to call. As with most things regarding his self care, it's a struggle to get him to do it but once he does he appreciates it and is thankful. I know you can't make anyone get help if they really don't want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently looking into doing couples therapy with him.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nHe has many redeeming qualities (like being a wonderful supportive partner to me) and is such a smart brilliant person with so many skills. He's great at math, science, and all kinds of other subjects! But his determination and constant failure to get into the animation field have been a strain on our relationship. I feel like a huge asshole because instead of being supportive, I want to discourage him! When he draws me things or asks me to look at his latest work, I just feel upset because it's terrible and he won't get a job with his skills the way they are now.  I understand he is going through some heavy depression, but he's just so stubborn.

I found a local girl (late 20's early 30's) who posted a pet sitter ad on a community website. We met, I checked references, agreed on a price, and everything seemed fine. I left payment on my counter before I left with detailed instructions. One thing I stressed was not to have anyone else in the house. I have rescue cats who don't like strangers, especially males, and she said it wouldn't be a problem. The day before I was to return home she sent me a message asking where the broom and mop was because \"I want you to return home to a clean house\".

She was set to leave at 7:30 that morning for work and I got home around 9am.\n\nWell, when I got in the house reeked of feces. She left a big #2 in the main bathroom, the cats had peed multiple times in both the showers, there were food scraps in the bathroom garbage, and she didn't even bother to make the bed. She left wet towels in the dryer, and the kitchen was a disaster. It looked like she cooked a Thanksgiving feast. Food remnants in the sink, on the counters, drips down to the floors. My big crock pot and rice maker were left out and the dishwasher was full including casserole dishes, mixing bowls, measuring cups, herb scissors, turkey baster, etc. I could tell my dining room table was used because every chair was put back askew and the drop leaf was used. She used all my flour, left grease in multiple baking pans, left her own food/leftovers in the fridge, and multiple Tupperware containers were missing.

I was pissed, so I never contacted her again.\n\nShe messaged me yesterday asking if I would be needing someone to watch the cats in the next few months because she is trying to fill her calendar with house, pet, and baby sitting jobs.

So for context I\u2019m in high school. The girl and myself are both 17. \n\nTL:DR at the bottom \n\n\nFor starters, we\u2019ve know each other since we got to High School. It was always a chill thing, never super close. \nTwo years ago, she had a on/off thing with my best friend in a grade up. They were always never certain on anything. That changed when he moved across country. I was closer to her then, but still just acquainted. \n\nLast year however, her and I started to talk a lot more. She was always super spotty with texting back, but she said she was really busy and I went along. Summer break hit and as I tried to make plans, she\u2019d leave me on read/opened constantly. I began to think of it personally. \n\nWe stopped contact until the start of 1st semester this year. We had a class together, right after lunch. I like to get to my classes a bit early on the first day, scope out who\u2019s sitting where and make sure I can sit near someone I know. Where I ended up sitting, there was an open space right beside me. She walks in right before class started, sits down beside me and just starts talking to me like nothing at all. \n\nOver the course of the semester, we were close again. She again was still super spotty with responding to me. When my best friend came back for a week, she changed completely however. She was immediately responding to me, asking to hangout, etc. I took it with good graces, thinking she was trying harder. It was like that for a couple weeks, then she dropped off again.\nRight before winter break, we went on a trial-date of sorts and it went really well. I mentioned how I have a discount at a high-end restaurant because of some connections, so we went there. \nWinter Break hit, and she said she was travelling. I didn\u2019t bother trying to talk to her as she said she\u2019d have very little Wifi and such.\n\nShe comes back and we hangout a few times. She was always glued to her phone, never really paying any attention. I felt really bad about myself, thinking I did something wrong. \nWith 1st semester exams coming up, we didn\u2019t talk as much due to studying. I was ok with that, still thinking I had done something wrong. Exams came and passed. We have no semester 2 classes together and she stopped responding to me completely. \n\nFinally a couple days ago she texted me asking if we go back to the restaurant for another date. I responded, with no reply for hours. Finally I texted my best friend to message her and see if she was just ignoring me. She replied to him immediately. I had had enough at that point and snapped at her, saying she only talked to me if she needed something. She swore me off, saying that I should know she rarely checks her phone and told me to never even look at her again. \n\nAITA or did I over-react?\n\nTL:DR, girl I know from school was very spotty with me.

We had never really met the dude but he seemed chill. However apparently they had a pretty big falling out. We never really got the details but she did mention she felt like he had used her for sex, so after this we obviously took her side and agreed not to really talk to this guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, since then sometimes I'll be eating at our school's dining hall (we're all college freshmen living in dorms) with some friends, some from the group, and some other people, but not including Sarah, and her ex will just come by and sit with us.

When we go out to eat or something he'll usually wear like a plainer grey v neck or the like though which is nice.\n\nBut I just feel like it's not super sexy to be wearing graphic tees that often as an adult. He says that he'd rather me be direct about me liking/disliking something about him instead of telling white lies.

I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max.

I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session.

We've been saving to fix it, but it needs a lot of work.  Mine has become our main transportation for both of us and he's contributed 25% of the payment since we're using it only. I have no problem driving him around because he contributes to the payment, but his family is becoming an issue to me. For the record, I like his family, but they do not help him out in any way. His mother mainly loves to mooch for everything she can and never returns the favor. He's always bending over backwards to help her out and it's not been an issue, but it is now since we're using my car. \n\n   We always have to pick several members of his family up for any family events because hardly anyone has cars, which adds an extra 30 minute drive to the location. Last week his mother got dropped off at our work asking us to take her home after I had already told BF, \"No, I'm tired and want to go home already.\" So we had to drive an extra 20 minutes just to take her home after working an 11 hour shift. He says we have to because he pays part of my payment, but I feel like that doesn't cover his family's expenses and they're taking advantage of us. They never cover gas money or do anything for him/us. \n\n   I feel that if I still pay 75% of my payment on a car that's in my name then I should get the most say in where we go. I never had an issue when his car was working, but now I'm running the miles up on my car that I've put much more money into over the years than he has over the past few months. Also he's not on my insurance, so I have to do all the driving because he's not covered.

We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected.

It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up.

I know, it already sucks enough.\n\nI also have grown up with a huge respect for money, because I've not been allowed to have a job, so I spend the money that I get very wisely. That's why, I usually look to any opportunities to minimize family spending, meaning that I usually only ask for one expensive thing a year during that one period. That being said, if something is too expensive, if one of my parents tell me that buying that thing is impossible for financial reasons, then I've never argued with them about it.\n\nFor reasons that will become clear in a bit, I'm a decently athletic person, with a decently healthy lifestyle, and I go the the gym very regularly, though I don't enjoy exercising.\n\nNow to get into the story:\n\nI ask my dad for a set of those trendy new true wireless earbuds. The ones I request cost around $140. Pretty expensive, I know, but not out of this world costly. My dad says no, because he's ordered me an exercise bike/desk combo (yeah, seriously) that costs around $170.\n\nAs I said before, I'm a pretty healthy guy, so believe me when I say I do not need this bike. This is not a passive-aggressive push towards a better lifestyle because I'm not unhealthy to start with. Naturally, I politely tell my dad that I'd rather not get that, because for my yearly gift, I would rather have something that I actually want. I ask him to cancel the order. \n\nI'm fairly adamant about this, and my mom is on my side, and so one day my dad tells me that he ordered the earbuds. However, the ones he ordered are of much lower quality ($50) than the ones that I asked for. He orders them prior to telling me though, so I can't protest. However, he says that if the earbuds are not of good quality, he will return them.\n\nI'm somewhat peeved, but decide to give them a try. They arrive, I test them, and they're what I expected: okay but not great. I'm probably somewhat biased, but after reading reviews, it's clear that there is a significant drop in audio quality.\n\nSo, I text my dad if he can return them. Here's where the problems begin. He accuses me of taking him for granted and caring about simply the price of things instead of the feelings behind them. He claims that neither I, nor my brother (he's eight years old!) have any gratitude for him. \n\nI then explain excessively politely that I'm simply annoyed at how he always buys things first and then tells me after the fact (this has happened several times where he buys something different from what I ask, and I am too timid to speak out). \n\nThis receives no reply.\n\nI then say \"Also, about (brother). He is far too young for you to have the expectation of him showing gratitude. You can have it for me, but not for him. Please dont extend any of this onto him because he definitely doesnt deserve it.\"\n\nHe blows up and accuses me of teaching him how to parent, and refuses to speak to me afterwards, not replying to any explanations that I have.\n\nAITA for thinking that instead of buying a $170 chair and $50 earbuds, he could've simply bought the $140 earbuds and called it a day? \nAITA for expecting him to speak to me before buying stuff for me?\nAITA for trying to protect my brother from my dad's toxicity? \n\nFor the cherry on top:\n\nThe chair and the earbuds have not been returned. The earbuds are being charged and the bike has been assembled. I'm fairly sure that he's using both of them, or at least planning to. So I'm left with no present whatsoever. I'm suspicious that he bought the bike knowing he would be the one using it anyway. I'm not sure because we haven't spoken in three days.\n\nFor years now, my dad has emotionally blackmailed me in ways like this, and it always results in days of not speaking to eachother before my mom (an angel btw) convinces me to go and apologize several times to maintain the relationship. I'm beginning to think that silence is better than continuously sacrificing my dignity.\n\nHere's to the new year. \n\nP.S.

My father was a police officer and has always told me that, for my own safety, I should never engage with anyone on the street. You never know what might happen. Last year, I was in a situation with my male friend and my boyfriend that involved a homeless person approaching us and targeting me. He started cursing at me and the situation could have gotten physical had my boyfriend not driven away. After we were safe, I told them that this is why we should not engage with homeless people. I get that not all of them are dangerous, but I do not want to be involved as I am scared of what might happen. My boyfriend agreed with me and respects my wishes. My friend, however, laughed and said that he\u2019s going to do whatever he wants if I\u2019m there or not.\n\nFlash forward a few months. Said friend and I go on a class trip to a city in Europe. While we are there, he insists on engaging with every single homeless person he meets. He even goes to ATMs to withdraw money, exchanges information with them, and does whatever they ask. I told him that this made me uncomfortable, and he told me that I should just keep walking by myself if I didn\u2019t want to do that with him.\n\nI told him that I\u2019m concerned for his safety as well as my own; we\u2019re in a foreign country and we have no means of defending ourselves. It\u2019s one thing if we\u2019re home, but this doesn\u2019t seem safe. He claims that he can defend himself and that it\u2019s his duty as a Christian to give to every homeless person. He claims that he has never had a bad experience, so nothing could happen with these people. He also implied that I am not a good Christian because of this. It got so bad that one of the people he gave money to saw him on a street again, called him out by his first name, and asked for even more.\n\nI am not against helping the homeless, but you can\u2019t know what might happen.

My sister (16) and I (19) have recently started going swimming every weekend to try and improve our health. We both have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, so we can\u2019t go super fast and we have to take a lot of breaks, but we can swim at a perfectly decent speed which usually isn\u2019t a problem.\n\nThe pool we swim at has three lanes: one lane has a parent and toddler class on a Saturday morning so it\u2019s out of bounds. The second is an adults and children lane, and the third is adults only. My sister and I were swimming in the adults lane when a man came in who was swimming much faster than us. And he wouldn\u2019t stop at all between laps. It quickly became impossible for my sister and I to swim in the lane, because every single time we started, he\u2019d catch up to us and we\u2019d hold him back. He made it very clear we were getting in the way, saying excuse me and knocking into me a few times (I think on purpose but I\u2019m not sure). He also seemed to get annoyed by us taking breaks and standing at the end of the pool, even though we tried to keep out of the way. He also wouldn\u2019t keep in line, he was kind of zigzagging across the lane trying to overtake everybody. It was a nightmare.\n\nEventually he got our attention and said to us: \u201cExcuse me girls, this is the ADULT lane, and it can be quite fast. Maybe you\u2019d be better suited to that lane\u201d (points to the children\u2019s lane). This pissed me off for two reasons. Firstly the other lane was completely full and nobody was following the rules about swimming clockwise, so it would be completely impossible for us to swim there. Secondly, I look a little young for my age but I\u2019m clearly not a child, and the way he talked to me was very condescending. I didn\u2019t want to make a scene so I just gave him a kind of grimace smile and continued swimming in the adult lane. We ended up getting out a few minutes later though, because it was so annoying. \n\nAITA for not moving? I\u2019m genuinely not sure because as much as my sister and I are entitled to swim there, he is too and we were slowing him down quite a bit. But I don\u2019t want to feel like I can\u2019t swim in a shared pool just because of one person. I\u2019ve been wanting to bring my blind friend swimming with me but now I\u2019m worried that people will get annoyed with her too, and she can be quite easily upset if she thinks she\u2019s inconveniencing people.", "output": "RIGHT", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

On mobile, and not a native English speaker.\n\n\nSome backstory : \n\n\nI\u2019ve known D for about 3 years in a uni association. We at first didn\u2019t engage much, but then had to work together, and automatically became friends. \nSince then, we\u2019ve been seeing and texting each other regularly, and it felt good to have found someone who is like the friendship equivalent of a soulmate. To say, after watching the San Junipero episode of Black Mirror, we said that if we ever end up alone in our 40s, we will date each other. \n\nThings between us have always been easy. We were at first a trio, but the other girl, L (30F), has been a true pain. She knew D for a couple of years longer, and has seen me like the intruder in a way. She acted like she was my friend, but then would tell D how I was toxic for her, when really she was the one who was toxic, and trying to be D\u2019s only friend and making her her property in a way. \n\nThis didn\u2019t put a strain in my relationship with D, and more so, reinforced it. We had each other\u2019s back. \n\nTwo years ago, I went through a really tough break up, and at the time D had gotten into a relationship with a very manipulative guy. He would dictate her every move, and was all around a bad guy. I warned her, and told her to break it off. She didn\u2019t really listen, as I was very much in the slump and couldn\u2019t possibly rationalise it all with her. \n\nShe ended up breaking up in February 2017, which was a relief for me, but then she spent the entire year crying about how much of a monster he was, although I had warned her multiple times that he was sucking the life out of her. \n\nThings didn\u2019t get better, when she found out she had a strain of HPV that gave her condylomas, and the timing matched with when she was with that guy. I did my best to be there for her, and reassure her that it wasn\u2019t the end of the world. Offered to be with her when she went to the gynaecologist, and also when she went to get them lasered off. I listened to her on the phone hours at the time, when she cried because of him, thought she would never be able to be with someone ever again, and beating herself about it all. She had zero self esteem at that point. \n\nI did what any best friend would do, and explained to her that all of this wasn\u2019t true, that she wasn\u2019t worthless, and will find someone who will be beyond her expectations. \n\n\nAll through it all, she barely inquired how I was doing. I was going through a shit year, and except some times when I would break down in front of her, she was basically inexistant. Never asked how I was holding up, never offered to cheer me up. I get it. She was going through her own stuff, and I couldn\u2019t hold her accountable for it. \n\nSo I sucked it up. \n\n\nAt the end of 2017, she started seeing this guy, who was initially trying to get together with me, but I rejected him over and over, because I was still hoping my ex would come back, and truly, he wasn\u2019t my type personality wise. I need someone who is very active, quick witted, who can make me laugh, and who isn\u2019t in some sort of half asleep state all the time. \n\nBut anyway, the guy didn\u2019t want a relationship, and was just profiting off her state to get sex, basically living at her place and not spending a dime when helping with groceries or anything. She even did his laundry. FFS. What king of man child is that. \n\nHere again, I told her he wasn\u2019t a good fit for her, that he used her as a surrogate mother who would also have sex with him. She didn\u2019t listen. She needed the attention and told me it felt great that he would be here at night to stroke her hair. Fine. \n\n\nThen he started dropping the ball continuously. \nThey established they would have a sort of open relationship. Except he knew first hand that she wasn\u2019t going to act on anything because she was unable to trust men anymore. He is very socially awkward and although not ugly at all he still scared people off because he\u2019s just weird at first. He used her weakness to profit from the situation. They said that the rule was no telling. She didn\u2019t want to hear about who he thought was attractive, or who he fucks. \n\nBut he mentioned one girl, even had her name in one of his passwords, called her by her name, you know the drill. \n\nShe kept coming to me crying saying that he fucked up again. At the time, I met my now boyfriend and was doing so much better, so I was ready to be her clutch again although she wasn\u2019t mine for so long. So I listened, warned her, again and again, even had my boyfriend explain that as a guy he thinks his behaviour is unacceptable and so on and so forth. \n\nShe didn\u2019t want to quit it. I told her that she didn\u2019t need to come telling me about those things because it would just make me mad. She still did. And I still listened. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, she went on a trip, and she met this guy. They didn\u2019t have sex, like no PiV but did everything around. I asked her why she didn\u2019t go all the way when she recounted her nights with him, absolutely over the moon. And she said that she wasn\u2019t allowed to \u201ctake off her clothes\u201d when with someone else. Like. What ? She could do bj\u2019s, get fingered, whatever else, but no PiV. I was mad. I didn\u2019t know about this. How can you call this an open relationship ? Yeah you don\u2019t. He\u2019s profiting. Because she would excuse him for fucking someone all the way, but he would probably have thought it\u2019s a deal breaker. Screw that. \n\nSince October, I\u2019ve been very depressed. I can barely get out of bed. I can barely have sex with my boyfriend. I almost don\u2019t eat anymore. Life is all together shitty. But yet again now, although I\u2019ve told her, she doesn\u2019t give a shit, or at least doesn\u2019t try to be a friend to me. \nSo when she told me that her guy got upset because she \u201cslept\u201d with someone, I had enough. She was in tears saying that she fucked things up, and I told her I didn\u2019t want to hear it. \n\nI went to leave, and she called me selfish. She doesn\u2019t seem to realise that I have been suicidal, but I should somehow give a shit about her shitty relationship when I\u2019m this down. \n\nI snapped at her and said that I don\u2019t give a crap if she feels bad, because once again I warned her multiple times that this guy is a piece of work, and that she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to anything with him if she wasn\u2019t able to put up with it. \n\nNow I think our relationship is broken and there might be no going back unless she accepts that I\u2019m also hurting in my own way, and have other things on my mind. She won\u2019t apologise because she thinks I\u2019ve overreacted, but I don\u2019t see it. \n\nSo AITA for telling her to fuck off ? \n", "output": "RIGHT", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

My family suffers from a range of mental challenges/conditions/illnesses: ADHD, Aspergers, depression, substance abuse, gender identity, anxiety. Although miraculously none of the uglier symptoms present themselves around friends or guests, they all come out in the wash during family holidays. This year, the parents rented a cottage in the middle of nowhere, so we will all be stuck together with no place to go.\n\nThis Thanksgiving has been a foretaste of what I fear will happen come Christmas. In just the last two days, I've been through enough mental illness crap to make me not want to come for Christmas. One sister had a two-hour violent meltdown over playing MineCraft (she's 11) that resulted in my father having to restrain her about six times. The other has ignored the houseguest from Japan she brought home from college (who, unfortunately, has had to witness all this going on), and freaked out during a board game: there was some confusion over a move that did not involve her: my family tends to get loud and talk over each other and that triggered her anxiety which resulted in her throwing a fit and her game pieces and storming out of the house. Just today I was yelled at for 'always looking for an argument': my mother announced her intention to shut off the internet for several hours to install a new router and I observed that I (and the Japanese exchange student) were working on online classwork. I'm typing this expecting the internet to shut off at any moment - I retreated to a closed room to avoid further conflict over the issue.\n\nI have tried to adopt the perspective that my role is to be a peacemaker as much as possible (e.g, acquiescing to simple demands, being a kind host to this poor Japanese girl and just talking to her). However, this Thanksgiving has made me feel that I am horrible in that role. I will admit that their behavior does not always bring out the best in me - I do not take well to my sister hitting and kicking my parents or the dog, for example. I am fully aware that some of this behavior is beyond my family's control; however, it is frustrating to see it under control around friends/guests, but receive the full brunt of it over political discussions, or even stupid things like games. Part of the reason I'm considering cancelling my Christmas ticket is so I won't end up becoming one of several assholes over Christmas.\n\nI fully anticipate that between the various diagnoses and differences on politics and religion that there will be several shitshows come Christmas. However, this holiday is the one time of year my entire family gets together. We will also have a bit of extended family joining us, too. If I don't show, it will be noticed and talked about, and break my parents' and grandparents' hearts. I've also had to pay nearly $1000 for Christmas travel, which I will only get about $600 back in the form of travel vouchers if I cancel. I have no idea what the alternative would be, as I don't have another family to 'adopt' me for the holidays (e.g., SO).\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA for skipping family Christmas to avoid conflict aggravated by mental illness, knowing that it will hurt my family deeply if I don't come?", "output": "WRONG", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

We (my sister and I) don't know the family well, so we thought it was odd. \n\nAs the days went on, we started to learn more about him. He's a sweet kid, but he definitely has his flaws. For one, he's a 17 year old high school dropout. Not great, but it happens (this is how I rationalized it to myself). He also smokes a ton of pot. While it isn't that big of a deal, we haven't been happy with the stench. His room is putrid. It smells like a mix between rotten food and pot. My mother seems to have no issue with any of this for whatever reason. \n\nAll of that doesn't seem \\*that\\* bad, right? I didn't think so either until my younger sister recently filled me in on some of the underpinnings of his life. She has the room adjacent to his. The wall that separates the room is extremely thin, so she hears everything. Here's what she told me: \"I can hear EVERYTHING, Dreadcarrier. The drop of a pin, a whisper. So guess what I get to hear when he has his boyfriend over 3-4 nights a week? A lot of fighting, crying, and sex.\" She's a college student (as am I) so this really disrupts her sleep/work schedule. Once again, my mother brushes this off. She thinks she's doing something nice for the kid and that takes precedence.\n\nBut wait, there's more! My little sister follows him on Instagram. He has been posting pictures of himself \"tripping\" on my back porch! Not to mention the fact that he took a picture of himself using my sister's expensive Yeti cup as a gravity bong. All of this has her truly irked, and my mom thought she was overreacting (to the cup thing, not sure if she knows about the psychedelics). \n\nAnyway, I've been skeptical of this arrangement from the get-go. I never thought it was a good idea to remove a problem child from his (accepting of his sexuality but strict about his lack of achievement) family. Once I saw it was giving him the freedom to do drugs and continue to let himself fall into a hole, my suspicions were confirmed. I haven't voiced my concerns because it isn't my house or my business, but now it is affecting my sister's life. \n\nI plan on confronting my mother. I want to explain that what she is doing may seem like a good deed, but it isn't helping the kid in the long-term. He has no life structure, no authority making sure he is doing right. He also has no intention of going back to school and smokes pot all the time. Giving him carte blanche isn't what's best for him. I also plan on explaining that his presence is disrupting her successful child's life. It isn't fair to give her the short end of the stick because she works hard. She deserves to live in a quiet house where she feels comfortable. \n\nWIBTA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "output": "RIGHT", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.
