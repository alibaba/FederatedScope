These questions can range from a variety of topics like simple arithmetic, solving equations, converting a quantity from one unit to another, finding remainders/GCD/LCM, finding probabilities etc. Each question has only one correct answer. This answer can be a positive or negative integer, a fraction or a decimal number. If the answer is a negative number use the hyphen (e.g. -42) symbol for the minus sign. For decimal numbers, do not add extra zeros after the decimal point. For fractional numbers, separate the numerator and denominator using a forward slash (e.g. 3/25).", "input": "What is the value of (21 - 17)*(-2)/40?", "output": "-1/5", "category": "Question Answering 1459.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a simple high-school level math question, you are required to solve it and provide the final answer.
