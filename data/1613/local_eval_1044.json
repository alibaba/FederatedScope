An online search reveals prices ranging from about $6 for 100 capsules containing 600 mg to around $12 for 50 high-dose capsules containing 700 mg. The intent of the pilot study was to determine the effect of N-acetylcysteine on PTSD symptoms, cravings and substance use. All three endpoints are described in the news release albeit in relative terms. We are told that the 8-week trial randomized 35 veterans with PTSD and substance use disorder. Some received N-acetylcysteine and others a placebo, but all of the participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The release reported that \u201cVeterans in the NAC-treated group showed a 46% reduction in PTSD symptoms, compared with a 25% reduction in the placebo group on the Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), which assesses trauma history and symptom severity. The threshold CAPS score for diagnosis of PTSD is 50.\u201d The release quotes the lead author: \u201cAs a group, the NAC-treated veterans were below diagnostic level for PTSD at the end of treatment.\u201d This establishes that the benefit was clinically meaningful. But we prefer to see absolute rather than relative numbers as used here. For example, the actual before and after scores on the PTSD scale would have better illustrated how large the benefit was. The release explains that the drug used \u201cdoes not cause side effects at the doses used in the study, but it degrades quickly when stored, is contraindicated in patients with asthma, and can cause nausea at higher doses and so should always be obtained and administered under a physician\u2019s supervision.\u201d However, the published study notes a higher incidence of adverse events in the N-acetylcysteine treated group that in those treated with placebo (66.7% vs. 47.1%). N-acetylcysteine can cause \u201cnausea, vomiting, and diarrhea or constipation. Rarely, it can cause rashes, fever, headache, drowsiness, low blood pressure, and liver problems,\u201d according to WebMD. This news release does not exaggerate the benefits found in the study, and added helpful caveats about the limitations of the study, its applicability to the general population and its small size. We\u2019d have preferred to see some specific language cautioning about the short duration of the study (just 8 weeks) and the fact that the results might not hold up over time. There is no obvious disease-mongering here. However, when the release notes that 7-8 percent of Americans have experienced PTSD at some point in their lives it could have been noted that the PTSD experienced by military veterans \u2014 leaving them \u2018difficult-to-treat\u2019 \u2014 is in a different category than what civilians might experience. The release clearly states the funding sources and it would be very unlikely that these researchers would have a financial interest in the product under study since it is off-patent and generically available without a prescription. The news release mentions other treatments for PTSD (such as SSRI antidepressants) even though we don\u2019t learn how effective those treatments are compared to N-acetylcysteine. The lead researcher very helpfully mentions that the drug should not be used without cognitive behavioral therapy or other forms of psychological counseling. The news release places the results of the study in a positive light noting, \u201cCurrently, there are no well-explored pharmacological treatments for patients with co-occurring PTSD/SUD. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for treatment of PTSD, pharmacological treatments for co-occurring PTSD/SUD have yielded suboptimal results.\u201d While SSRI\u2019s have been the most studied to date, other drugs that have been studied in preliminary trials could have been mentioned, including prozosin, prazosin, guanfacine, atomoxetine, topiramate, memantine, acamprosate, and ketamine. A 2014 article in Addictive Behaviors journal describes some of these: \u201cPharmacological treatment of comorbid PTSD and substance use disorder: recent progress.\u201d (Addictive behaviors\u00a039.2 (2014): 428-433.) We learn it is sold over-the-counter and available everywhere. The release claims novelty with these statements: \u201cThis trial is the first to use NAC as a pharmacotherapy for PTSD and a broad range of SUDs\u201d and \u201cNAC treatment with CBT would be a novel approach to treat co-occurring PTSD and SUD.\u201d This does appear to be the first such clinical trial of the supplement to address this combination of disorders. There is no use of unjustifiable language. In fact, we were pleased to see the consistent use of \u201csubstance use disorder\u201d or SUD to describe the inappropriate use of illegal and legal drugs. Our recent post on ways to put people first when talking about addiction shows how careful terminology improves accuracy and reduces stigma. Claim: A potential pharmaceutical intervention for co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorder", "output": "This news release describes the outcomes of a small randomized placebo controlled study on the use of N-acetylcysteine, an inexpensive over-the-counter supplement, along with cognitive behavioral therapy in male veterans with PTSD and substance use disorder (SUD). Overall, the release provides a balanced report on the results and the limitations of the study. We think that with the addition of cost and a more in-depth discussion of harms it could have been even better. Post-traumatic stress is a huge problem among veterans who have seen combat, and the effects of PTSD can be lifelong and debilitating. Since PTSD is also found in police officers, firefighters and other emergency personnel, a safe and effective treatment for it might have wide ranging applications. This trial on a small number of veterans who suffered both from PTSD and substance use disorders could very much add to available therapies in which there are few effective treatments but many sufferers. This could also be significant to the 7 to 8 percent of Americans who develop PTSD at some point in their life.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

The profession\u2019s ugly underbelly was exposed last week when police accused British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline of bribing officials and doctors for six years to boost sales and the price of its medicines. GSK has called the developments \u201cshameful\u201d and on Monday said some of its Chinese executives appeared to have broken the law. China is an appealing market for pharmaceutical firms and medical-equipment makers, with spending in the industry expected to nearly triple to $1 trillion by 2020 from $357 billion in 2011, according to consulting firm McKinsey. The corruption stems largely from doctors\u2019 low base salaries, which are set in line with a pay scale for government workers. Hospitals can pay bonuses but, given public hospitals are strapped for cash, compensation is usually low, say doctors and industry experts. A doctor fresh out of medical school in Beijing earns about 3,000 yuan ($490) a month including bonuses \u2014 roughly the same as a taxi driver. A doctor with 10 years experience makes around 10,000 yuan a month, according to Peter Chen, chief executive of privately run Oasis International Hospital in Beijing. \u201cWithout the grey income, doctors would not have the incentive to practice,\u201d said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Over the past 30 years the Chinese government has made its healthcare sector more market-oriented. That means the country\u2019s 13,500 public hospitals have to balance their own books. Medical services accounted for just over 50 percent of public hospital revenue in 2011, according to Health Ministry data. About 40 percent came from prescribing drugs while the rest was from other income as well as government subsidies, which have fallen steadily since the 1980s. Hospital administrators can set fees for in-patient care, nursing and laboratory tests. But the state fixes the cost of operations to make surgery affordable to ordinary Chinese. And it effectively caps the cost of many prescribed medicines by setting a suggested price. That leaves hospitals little room to top up wages. One Chinese doctor who used to hold a senior position at a prominent hospital in Beijing said 80 percent of his income came from bribes. Without it, he would have earned less than $600 a month, said the doctor, who left China five years ago to live in Britain where he continues practicing medicine. \u201cThese sums (bribes) are essential. You cannot survive on your salary,\u201d said the 50-year-old physician, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. An industry executive who has worked in China\u2019s medical sector for more than 15 years said bribery and corruption permeated every level of a public hospital. \u201cThey are seen as necessities in the current healthcare system,\u201d said the executive, who also declined to be identified. The Health Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Officials at the National Development and Reform Commission, which sets the prices of prescribed medicines, also declined to comment. Low base salaries are a legacy of China\u2019s planned economy, said Jia Xijin, associate professor at the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsinghua University in Beijing, explaining the dilemma faced by the government. China has also committed to making health care affordable for its 1.37 billion people. The government has spent 2.2 trillion yuan ($358 billion) on the system since 2009, of which more than 680 billion yuan was to provide universal health insurance coverage, state media quoted the Finance Ministry as saying earlier this year. Public hospitals say recruiting new doctors is getting harder as many physicians are turned off by the wages at a time when patient numbers are growing. Health Ministry data showed the overall number of doctors rose 13 percent from 2008 to 2011, while patient visits jumped 28 percent. \u201cThere will be no doctors left to treat the current doctors when they retire,\u201d said the accounting director at a Shanghai hospital who declined to be identified because she was not authorized to speak to the media. Low salaries have also spawned a system of under-the-table payments from patients. The payments are known as \u201chongbao\u201d \u2014 a reference to the cash-filled red envelopes given as presents during Lunar New Year festivities \u2014 and cover various services from jumping the queue for appointments to extra surgical fees. Bob Wang, a 35-year-old businessman in Beijing, said he gave the main surgeon who operated on his aunt\u2019s femur bone transplant last year 5,000 yuan in \u201chongbao\u201d on top of the 100,000 yuan he paid to the hospital because he was worried the doctor would not take the operation seriously otherwise. There was unstated \u201chongbao\u201d guidance for each type of surgery, he said. \u201cIf my family or myself get sick ... we won\u2019t just go to the hospital. Everything will take forever \u2014 from registration to waiting for a bed, to getting seen by a doctor to queuing for surgery,\u201d he said. According to the doctor now living in Britain, patients and their families could sometimes spend two to three times more than the actual fee in \u201chongbao\u201d. Critics doubt that an anti-corruption campaign by President Xi Jinping will have much impact. Indeed, a former doctor at a major heart hospital in Beijing said eradicating corruption would be nearly impossible. \u201cIt would be easy to find out who was taking money if the government wanted to,\u201d said the cardiologist, who has been working in the United States since 2009. \u201cBut everyone would be found guilty.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance. One of the issues they discussed was the high cost of health insurance. Paul, an eye surgeon, is strongly opposed to President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance. Paul told Oliver that according to the most recent statistics, \u00a0\"\"85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn't. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don't they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn't have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year. Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people.\"\" In this fact-check, we\u2019ll check whether the cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans. In a separate report, we\u2019ll look at his claim that half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year. Survey data consistently shows that cost is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans obtaining coverage. When the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s June 2013 health tracking poll asked uninsured respondents for the main reason they didn\u2019t have health insurance, a plurality of 40 percent cited cost. The second-biggest factor, at 26 percent, was related to employment, such as being unemployed or having a job that doesn\u2019t offer health insurance. These two reasons aren\u2019t mutually exclusive -- someone could have told the pollster that their lack of a job was the biggest reason but also find cost to be a barrier to obtaining insurance. The only answer in the poll that suggests the respondent doesn\u2019t face a cost obstacle is \"\"doesn\u2019t need insurance,\"\" which was the answer of only 11 percent. In another survey, the 2011 National Health Interview Survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers asked, \"\"Which of these are reasons you stopped being covered or don\u2019t have health insurance?\u2019\u2019 Respondents were allowed to choose more than one reason. In this survey, too, a plurality -- 42 percent -- cited cost. Three other reasons cited are compatible with cost being an obstacle -- a lost job or a change in employment (26 percent), an employer that didn\u2019t offer insurance (11 percent) and ineligible due to age or leaving school (9 percent). Just 6 percent cited \"\"other,\"\" which included \"\"didn\u2019t want or need coverage,\"\" among other answers. \"\"The cost of insurance is a major reason why people are uninsured -- Sen. Paul is right about that,\"\" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. \"\"People without access to employer-sponsored coverage have a hard time affording it on their own, and that accounts for most of the uninsured.\"\" Our ruling Paul asked, \"\"Why didn't (uninsured Americans) buy insurance?

He added: \u201cWe will resolutely and with all means defend ourselves in this (glyphosate) litigation.\u201d  Baumann was speaking on Monday to German media invited to visit Bayer\u2019s new operations in the former research and development facilities of Monsanto in St. Louis, Missouri. The remarks, made on Monday, were embargoed to the end of the week to allow media to return home. Shares in Bayer have lost 25 percent in value since Aug. 10, when a San Francisco jury awarded $289 million to Dewayne Johnson on grounds Monsanto failed to warn the school groundskeeper and other consumers of the cancer risks posed by glyphosate-based RoundUp and Ranger Pro. Johnson has terminal non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma that he alleges was caused by the herbicides. A judge later reduced the award to $78 million. Bayer denies that glyphosate causes cancer and says decades of scientific studies and real-world use have shown the chemical to be safe for human use. The company is appealing the findings. The number of glyphosate cases that Bayer faces across the United States has jumped to more than 8,700, prompting concerns among investors about the impact of litigation costs on Bayer\u2019s bottom line. Baumann expressed confidence that Bayer could handle the litigation, and cited its \u201cinexpensive\u201d $12 million settlement of 4,000 lawsuits over its contraceptive Mirena device. Bayer also won five of six trials over its best-selling bloodthinner Xarelto, over which it faces 24,000 U.S. lawsuits. The sixth jury found in favor of a plaintiff, but a judge later overturned the decision. \u201cDue to our exposure as a pharmaceutical company, we have the experience to defend those (glyphosate) cases,\u201d he said. Baumann said the company\u2019s legal strategy had been revised following the integration of Bayer and Monsanto in mid-August. He declined to provide details, but recent court filings reveal some of the steps the company has taken. Last week, Bayer added the attorneys from law firm Arnold & Portner who won the Xarelto cases for the company to its glyphosate defense team. It is also trying to change the juror selection process for upcoming trials. In filings last week in San Francisco federal court, where a new glyphosate trial is scheduled to begin on Feb. 25, 2019, Bayer said the \u201cjury pool likely has grown more hostile\u201d due to negative media coverage following the Johnson verdict. Michael Miller, one of the attorneys for the plaintiff, said the company\u2019s claims were \u201chypocritical beyond belief\u201d given its own efforts to control the message on glyphosate, most recently in a full-page advertisement in the Washington Post. Bayer has asked U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, who is overseeing the San Francisco case and some 580 others, to significantly expand the jury pool and question prospective jurors about their knowledge of the media coverage of the cases.

The article does not mention comparative costs for other ways of managing the medical conditions these drugs treat. The news article does not quantify the potential benefits of treatment with heartburn or antacid drugs. They are very effective in preventing acid-related disease. An additional sentence or two might help readers weigh their pros and cons. The article provides balanced information about the frequency and seriousness of one potential harm of taking antacids\u2014hip fractures. Most other research has turned up relatively minor side effects (e.g. gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea), though a 2005 study suggested that these drugs might make people more susceptible to virulent clostridium difficile infections that produce dangerous watery diarrhea. Though the article ably employs a quote by Dr. Alan Buchman to explain the chief limitation of the study\u2019s design\u2014that it cannot prove cause and effect, and that the patients simply may \u201chave some other problem that increases the risk of fractures\u201d\u2014the story could have stated more clearly the drawbacks inherent in a retrospective study of a large patient database. There are no obvious elements of disease mongering. Hip fracture is common and often devastating. As the article suggests, it is the final insult on the slope toward death for one in five people. It dispatches another one in five to nursing homes for the rest of their lives. However, the article provides information only on relative risk of hip fractures, not their absolute risk. The very large relative risks cited may overstate the absolute risk of these medicines, even if there is a true risk of fracture. The news article reports the funding source for the study, cites three sources\u2014the study\u2019s author, an academic gastroenterologist, and a spokeswoman for the manufacturer of Prevacid\u2014and provides adequate information to judge their potential conflicts of interest. The article explains that heartburn drugs may cause hip fractures by blocking calcium absorption. It suggests two potential solutions \u2013 either \u201csimply to consume more calcium,\u201d or to take the drugs in lower doses. Unfortunately, it fails to note that there is conflicting research to support the calcium-blocking hypothesis or that there is little research to show that calcium consumption can offset the increased risk of fracture among people taking antacids. More importantly, the article could have offered three additional recommendations: (1) all patients may not need to take these medicines on a regular basis; (2) lifestyle and dietary changes\u2014cutting back on caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, and acidic foods\u2014can also help; and (3) some patients taking one class of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors (e.g. Nexium, Prevacid, Prisolec) could safely switch over to another class known as histamine blockers (e.g. Zantac) that were associated with fewer hip fractures in this study. Histamine blockers have a very safe long-term record (20+ years). Most readers are likely to know about heartburn drugs or antacids that suppress the production of gastric acid. They are, as the LA Times says, \u201camong the most widely used in the United States.\u201d Some of these medicines are also available over-the-counter without a prescription, potentially useful information omitted from the news article. The report states that the treatment is widely used and accurately implies that it is not new. No obvious use of text from a press release. Claim: Less acid, brittler hips? Some heartburn drugs may be behind an increase in fractures", "output": "This is a compact (only 566 words), nicely reported story that places a potentially important development in its appropriate context. The researchers went to great lengths in their published study to weed out variables other than heartburn drugs that might explain the increase in hip fractures that they observed. Nevertheless, they acknowledge that their retrospective review of a large patient database is inherently incapable of proving cause and effect. The quote from Dr. Alan Buchman in the news story summarizes this chief drawback well: The patients, he notes, may \u201chave some other problem that increases the risk of fractures.\u201d The study provides reasonable evidence to support the news article\u2019s recommendations that patients should only use the drugs if they need them, and even then take them only at their lowest beneficial dose. Whether \u201cthe solution is to simply consume more calcium\u201d remains unknown, unfortunately. Additional advice on the benefits of lifestyle and dietary changes would have been welcome, and perhaps a note on the relatively lower fracture risk associated with the class known as histamine blockers.

The risk of death from heart attack was higher in the vegetable-oil group, even though certain markers of cholesterol in their blood did become lower. The story does a good job of explaining the study\u2019s design, and some of the complex issues surrounding dietary habits and heart disease.

But as of late Thursday, power was restored to more than half of those who had lost it, PG&E officials said in a release. About 312,000 electric customers remained without power as of 10 p.m. officials said. Some of the state\u2019s most devastating wildfires were sparked in recent years by damage to electrical transmission lines from high winds, with flames then spreading through tinder-dry vegetation to populated areas. Newsom, a Democrat, told a news conference on Thursday he did not fault the utility for shutting off electricity as a safety measure, but he described the outage as too broad and said it resulted from years of mismanagement by the utility. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a scale and scope of something that no state in the 21st century should experience,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is unacceptable and it\u2019s happened because of neglect.\u201d  The remarks were the most pointed comments Newsom has directed at PG&E since the outages began early on Wednesday. Among the questions he raised was whether the utility was too large, with a service area covering more than 40 counties. He also faulted PG&E for putting what he called \u201cgreed\u201d ahead of investments in its infrastructure to protect the electrical grid from dangerous winds. PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment. PG&E Chief Executive Bill Johnson acknowledged that his company had left \u201cmillions of people\u201d without a \u201cfundamental service\u201d they expect and deserve. \u201cThis is not how we want to serve you,\u201d he told a media briefing in San Francisco, adding that PG&E \u201cwas not adequately prepared\u201d for such a large power outage. As high winds moved south, a similar cut-off was under way by neighboring utility Southern California Edison, which warned that more than 173,000 customers could lose power in parts of eight counties, including Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura. Residents, business owners and even public officials expressed frustration about the blackouts, which the utility began on a much smaller scale last year during times of high fire risk. \u201cNorthern California is not a Third World country,\u201d the San Jose Mercury Statesman said in an editorial. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that the region is being forced to endure this level of disruption as the long-term strategy for dealing with the threat of wildfires.\u201d  PG&E, California\u2019s biggest investor-owned utility, said power would be restored to areas once up to 77 mph (124 kph) winds die down and 2,500 miles (4,025 km) of transmission lines could be inspected. \u201cWe faced a choice between hardship or safety, and we chose safety,\u201d Michael Lewis, PG&E\u2019s senior vice president of electric operations, said in a statement. The National Weather Service said the hot gusty winds that usually hit northern California in October, sometimes called the \u201cDiablo Winds\u201d, would continue into Friday morning. Much of northern California, from San Francisco to the Oregon border, remains under a state \u201cred flag\u201d fire alert, although no major blazes have been reported. \u201cAs soon as the weather passes, PG&E will begin safety inspections with 6,300 field personnel and 45 helicopters standing at the ready once we get the all clear,\u201d the utility said in a tweet on Thursday. Oakland supermarkets brought in refrigeration trucks to save food. Michael Wara of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment estimated the economic cost of the shutdown could reach $2.5 billion, with small businesses hit hardest as they typically lacked back-up generators. In Santa Rosa, a California wine country town where entire subdivisions were destroyed by a deadly 2017 wildfire, restaurateurs Mark and Terri Stark said they had to close one of their six restaurants after it lost power. \u201cThis is preventative medicine and medicine sometimes is not good to take,\u201d said Mark Stark, 60, who lost one restaurant in the 2017 blaze. The fires in that region killed 46 people. \u201cThose fires and what they caused are still very real for people in our \u2018hood,\u201d he said.

It says, \u201cIt is, however, expensive: a month\u2019s supply of Latisse can cost up to $150, and that is in amounts appropriate for use merely on the eyelashes. Rogaine, which is also available over the counter now, costs about $25 a month, and a month\u2019s supply of Propecia runs about $75.\u201d The story did not quantify any of the benefits of Latisse or the other hair loss products. The story mentioned harms in passing but did not quantify them. We wish it would have. The problem here is that we are talking about off label use, but, at a minimum, some of the harms related to the other, more established products could have been quantified. Instead, the story gives the harms question short shrift, saying, \u201cOne advantage of Latisse is that it needs to be applied only once a day (Rogaine needs to be applied twice; Propecia is taken once daily), and does not seem to cause reactions in people who are allergic to minoxidil.\u201d We wish that the story had provided some information about the effectiveness of hair loss products. We only get the one true believer\u2019s comment \u201cthat (Latisse) has worked for about 70 percent of his patients.\u201d We also would have liked to have seen a comment about the need for continuing use of the products. The story does a great job avoiding what may be better termed fear-mongering in a case like this. Often stories about cosmetic medicine make people feel like their aging selves are inadequate. This story actually has a little fun with the idea of men being paranoid about their hair loss without minimizing the very real anxiety that hair loss causes. We did think one comment from Dr. Bernstein seemed to medicalize baldness. He said, that \u201cit\u2019s important to remember that baldness is unlike other conditions where you can progress past the point of being helped. \u2026Once we have a cure for hair loss, everyone will be able to benefit.\u201d We think this one is a wobbler. The story did quote two hair loss specialists. We wish it had gone a little broader in scope and talked with someone who is not currently prescribing Latisse and could speak to the safety and efficacy of an uNPRoven product like this. The story discusses a number of alternatives, and even provides price information for some. It says, for example, \u201cFor those too impatient to wait, there is also the bold and fashionable solution of shaving one\u2019s head.\u201d We do wish, though, that some comparative effectiveness information had been given. The story makes it clear that Latisse is a prescription product sold for eyelashes but being used off label by some doctors for hair loss. The product definitely appears to be novel, and the story does a good job placing it in the right context. The story went well beyond any news release. In fact, unlike other stories we have seen about emerging cosmetic therapies, this story may not be a big hit with the product\u2019s manufacturer. The man in the\u00a0lead anecdote, for example, says that he\u00a0has stopped\u00a0using the product because it is\u00a0too expensive.

There are two main products on the market now, but both of them come with significant side effects and questions about long term efficacy. Any new entrant in the hair loss field tends to generate excitement, and we think that reporters have a duty to see past effusive marketing and cut to the facts.

The commentary is largely based on a Daily Mail article that ran in 2008, when John McCain was running for president. The article included rare public comments from McCain\u2019s ex-wife, Carol Shepp McCain, about the couple\u2019s divorce and about John\u2019s mindset after he returned from Vietnam after spending five and a half years as a prisoner of war. We couldn\u2019t track down the original \u201cGetting to Know the Real John McCain\u201d commentary, or verify that a woman named Burma Davis Posey was its actual author. But we can look at some of the biographical details included in the commentary. The commentary\u2019s central theme is that Carol McCain was a loyal wife and mother \u2014 and that John selfishly divorced her because of life-altering injuries that she sustained in a car accident on Christmas Eve of 1969. Both John and Carol McCain have agreed that their divorce fell apart because of John\u2019s immaturity, but Carol disputes the idea that her accident was the central cause. For his part, John McCain wrote in his 2002 memoir \u201cWorth Fighting For\u201d that:\u00a0\u201cMy marriage\u2019s\u00a0collapse was\u00a0attributable to my\u00a0own selfishness and\u00a0immaturity. The\u00a0blame was entirely\u00a0mine.\u201d For her part, Carol McCain told the Daily Mail in a 2008:\u00a0\u201cMy accident is well recorded. I had 23 operations, I am five\u00a0inches shorter than I used to\u00a0be and I was in hospital for\u00a0six months. It was just awful,\u00a0but it wasn\u2019t the reason for\u00a0my divorce. My marriage ended because\u00a0John McCain didn\u2019t want to\u00a0be 40, he wanted to be 25. You know that happens\u2026it\u00a0just does.\u201d And the commentary\u2019s claims about John McCain meeting Cindy and beginning a relationship with her before his first marriage ended appears to be true. John claimed in \u201cWorth Fighting For\u201d that his relationship with Cindy didn\u2019t begin until after he separated from Carol, but others dispute that. A 2008 Los Angeles Times story that quotes a friend of John McCain who was at the reception in Hawaii where John met Cindy said that some people in his social circle believed that the McCains had already separated by the time John and Cindy met based on John\u2019s behavior: By contrast, some\u00a0of McCain\u2019s\u00a0friends, including\u00a0the Senate aide\u00a0who was at the\u00a0reception where\u00a0McCain first met \u00a0(Cindy) Hensley, believed\u00a0he was separated at\u00a0that time. Albert \u201cPete\u201d\u00a0Lakeland, the aide\u00a0who was with\u00a0McCain at the\u00a0reception in Hawaii\u00a0in April 1979, said\u00a0of the introduction\u00a0to Hensley: \u201cIt was\u00a0like he was struck\u00a0by Cupid\u2019s arrow. He was just\u00a0enormously\u00a0smitten.\u201d As the pair began\u00a0dating, Lakeland\u00a0allowed them to\u00a0spend a weekend\u00a0together at his\u00a0summer home in\u00a0Maryland, he said. The senator has\u00a0acknowledged that\u00a0he behaved badly,\u00a0and that his swift\u00a0divorce and\u00a0remarriage brought\u00a0a cold shoulder\u00a0from the Reagans\u00a0that lasted years. In the end, the \u201cGetting to Know John McCain\u201d commentary draws from a number of credible reports that were published during the 2008 presidential campaign. Many of the biographical details about John McCain and his first marriage are true, but they\u2019re also colored by the author\u2019s unfavorable view of McCain. A number of rumors about John McCain went viral in July and August 2017 as the senator\u2019s battle with brain cancer, and his deciding \u201cno\u201d vote on the Obamacare repeal bill drew attention to him. We investigated claims that Richard Nixon pardoned John McCain\u00a0and that John McCain started the USS Forrestal fire.

Nationwide, makers of alcoholic drinks face disrupted business and lost revenue. If another shutdown starts in about two weeks, as President Donald Trump has threatened if Congress doesn\u2019t provide money for a border wall, the backlog could persist. U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, both Oregon Democrats, warned of \u201cdisastrous\u201d consequences in a letter to John Manfreda, administrator of the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. They urged Manfreda to dedicate all resources to clearing the backlog of applications. \u201cThis regulatory paralysis disproportionately disadvantages small, craft brewers, vintners, cider makers, and distillers, who depend on new product releases for their businesses\u2019 survival,\u201d Wyden and Blumenauer said Tuesday. Michael Kaiser, vice president of WineAmerica, a national association of U.S. wineries, said the backlog will also stretch the turnaround time on new applications to around 36 days. The federal alcohol agency strives for it to be two to four days. It must issue permits for beverages that will be sold across state lines and approve the labels. \u201cThis will impact wineries of all size,\u201d Kaiser said in an email. California winery Copper Cane canceled contracts last fall to buy 2,000 tons (1,814 metric tons) of grapes, saying lab testing showed smoke taint after wildfires last year cloaked much of Oregon in smoke and ash. Jim Blumling, Copper Cane\u2019s vice president of operations, has said both lab and sensory tests showed a high level of smoke taint and that the most effective time to test is as close as possible to harvest. But independent laboratory analysis showed much of the crop was not adversely affected, the local wineries said. Willamette Valley Vineyards head winemaker Joe Ibrahim had sampled a few of the grapes, searching for an ashy taste in the skins that would reveal some taint. He found none. \u201cThe wines are actually really beautiful wines,\u201d Ibrahim said, standing next to a huge vat in his winery\u2019s cellar containing rose of pinot noir, the first of the three Oregon Solidarity wines that will be bottled. The vineyard outside the small town of Turner and King Estate Winery in Eugene bought 150 tons (136 metric tons) of the grapes, enough to produce 88,800 bottles of wine. Eyrie Vineyards and Silvan Ridge Winery helped make the wines. Willamette Valley and King Estate would have bought even more grapes, but they were already getting overripe on the vine, Willamette winery director Christine Collier Clair said. One grower also had crop insurance for 1,500 tons (1,360 metric tons), she said. The label application for the rose was sent and approved before the government shutdown, Clair said. The federal agency still must approve labels for Oregon Solidarity chardonnay and pinot noir. Retailers are counting on having the wines and to do promotions, she said. The wines will be sold nationwide and will be available to buy online. Rogue Valley Vintners, a southern Oregon nonprofit made up of wine producers, growers and community partners, will get the proceeds. Clair said she hopes the chardonnay label gets approved on time for its scheduled May release. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau spokesman Thomas Hogue said there are many applications to wade through. \u201cWe are still assessing the workload,\u201d Hogue said in an email Monday, when federal employees returned to work after five weeks. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that our backlog has roughly doubled as a result of the shutdown.\u201d ___ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky Claim: Shutdown casts pall on effort to help Oregon winegrowers.", "output": "Winegrowers in southern Oregon faced financial ruin after a California winemaker claimed wildfire smoke tainted their grapes and refused to buy them.

Local television pictures showed the Chicago River and Lake Michigan filled with chunks of ice. The brutal blast known as the polar vortex is a stream of cold air that spins around the stratosphere over the North Pole, but whose current has been disrupted and is now pushing south into the United States. Officials warned Chicago residents, accustomed to chilling winters, to expect an unusually deep and dangerous freeze. Even the city\u2019s supply of its signature deep-dish pizza was affected: The Lou Malnati\u2019s chain announced it would stop taking delivery orders at 8 p.m. on Tuesday. \u201cThis could possibly be history-making,\u201d said Ricky Castro, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Romeoville, Illinois. As much as two feet (60 cm) of snow was forecast in Wisconsin, and six inches (15 cm) in Illinois. Snow was expected through Wednesday from the Great Lakes region into New England. Some Chicago residents found warmth inside the Harold Washington Library Center, which planned to stay open on Wednesday. Gilbert Rothschild, 79, walked through a corridor wearing three sweaters and an undershirt underneath his parka. \u201cThe more layers, the more you\u2019re insulated,\u201d he said. Rothschild, the president of a liquor retailer, said he planned on keeping his stores open on Wednesday, figuring customers who were not working might want to pick up something to keep them feeling warm at home. Many Midwest cities opened warming shelters. Regional governments closed hundreds of schools and airlines canceled more than 2,000 flights, according to the Flightaware flight tracking website. Many had been destined for Atlanta, where the National Football League\u2019s Super Bowl will take place on Sunday. Amy Patterson, a vice president at the Atlanta Super Bowl Host Committee, said there would still be time for fans to fly to Atlanta for the game, with the National Weather Service forecasting a high of a balmy 58F (14C) on Sunday. A low of minus 10F (minus 23C) was forecast in Chicago and elsewhere in northern Illinois on Wednesday. But with the wind chill factored in, temperatures will feel as low as minus 50F (minus 46C) through Thursday, the National Weather Service reported. Temperatures could reach lows of minus 30F to minus 40F (minus 34C to minus 40C) in parts of the Northern Plains and Great Lakes on Wednesday, the NWS said. The freezing weather may have killed a man in Rochester, Minnesota, who was found dead outside his home on Sunday, according to a report by WCCO, a local CBS affiliate. Rochester police officials did not respond to a request for comment. Jim Hayes, a National Weather Service meteorologist, warned that frostbite was possible within 10 minutes in the intense cold. For many across the region, life ground to a halt. In Chicago, home to the nation\u2019s third-largest school system, officials plan to cancel classes for all 360,000 students on Wednesday due to the weather. Detroit also said all public schools would close, and Michigan State University said it would suspend classes, only the seventh time it has done so because of weather since 1855. The Chicago Zoological Society said it would shut Brookfield Zoo for only the fourth time in its 85-year history on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the National Weather Service, the coldest recorded temperature in Chicago was minus 27 degrees (minus 33C) on Jan. 20, 1985.

Voters currently can request absentee ballots only if they provide an excuse for why they can\u2019t vote in person. Illness is one option, but the law isn\u2019t explicit on whether the illness excuse covers healthy voters concerned about catching or spreading COVID-19. Under the bill sent to Republican Gov. Mike Parson, people considered at-risk of the coronavirus \u2014 those age 65 and older, living in a long-term care facility or with certain existing health problems \u2014 could vote absentee without needing to have their ballot notarized. Anyone else could cast a mail-in ballot but would need to get it notarized. The bill passed with bipartisan support but received mixed reviews from both parties. Republicans said it doesn\u2019t include enough restrictions to ensure election security, and Democrats said it has too many rules. \u201cWhen you are not wanting to go to the polls because you are either ill or fearful of becoming ill, but then you have to go get a notary to be able to not go to the polls, it doesn\u2019t really fix the problem,\u201d House Democratic Minority Leader Crystal Quade said. Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft on Friday said he no longer supported the measure after lawmakers stripped a contested photo ID requirement out of it. Lawmakers returned to the Capitol to work on the state budget and other policies days before Parson lifted his statewide stay-at-home order in early May. Members of the public were allowed in the Capitol to watch debate but were encouraged to stay home, prompting concern from some lawmakers about lack of public involvement in crafting major policy changes. Both lawmakers and visitors were quizzed on their health and had their temperatures checked before they could enter the building. \u201cThe work that we did here today I think was important enough that legislators made the decision that they were going to go ahead and come to the building to do work,\u201d Republican House Speaker Elijah Haahr said. \u201cWe understand the risks involved.\u201d Few lawmakers wore masks in the final days of session, and legislators frequently sat close to one another to vote. Lawmakers also faced pressure to act on crime legislation following a bloody 2019 and a violent start to 2020. The deaths of two men on Tuesday night were Kansas City\u2019s 63rd and 64th homicides this year. St. Louis police reported 53 homicides as of Friday. A bill headed to Parson\u2019s desk would create the crime of vehicle hijacking, expand the number of crimes that are considered dangerous felonies, ban probation for some crimes, and broaden what\u2019s considered a criminal street gang, along with increased penalties for taking part in gang activities. \u201cThis is going to help get the most violent habitual offenders off of the streets,\u201d Republican Rep. Nick Schroer said. The bill sparked outrage from House lawmakers who said it could reverse a drop in the state\u2019s prison population following a bipartisan push for criminal justice reform in recent years. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make us safer,\u201d Republican Rep.

Republican skeptics in the Senate expressed no interest in compromising on the House-backed bill Friday after a feud between the two GOP-led chambers. At issue was a House provision that could thwart efforts to build a wind-energy power line that was slipped onto another Senate bill without senators noticing.

The event is being hosted by The Sanders Institute, a think-tank formed last year separate from the senator\u2019s political operations that grew out of the ideas generated during his 2016 presidential campaign. The institute and the meeting have attracted a number of high-profile supporters. Hollywood actors Danny Glover, Susan Sarandon, John Cusack and Cynthia Nixon joined intellectuals Cornel West and Simon Sinek. Elected officials such as Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio are also expected at the meeting, which wraps up Saturday. The health care study released Friday morning that looked at Sanders\u2019 2017 Medicare for All Act. It estimated such a system would save an estimated 9.6 percent over current U.S. health care consumption expenditures, said University of Massachusetts economist Robert Pollin, one of the authors of the study. It estimates people would use an estimated 12 percent under a Medicare for All system. The savings would come from reducing administrative and pharmaceutical costs and establishing uniform Medicare rates for hospitals. Businesses would save about 8 percent of what they currently pay for employee health insurance. The system would need to raise just over $1 trillion in new government income to pay for it. Additional government revenue would come from a 3.75 percent sales tax on non-essential items and other taxes on the wealthiest people in the United States. \u201cThe biggest winners are going to be middle-class households,\u201d Pollin said. People at the meeting did not address the prospects of the plan passing in Congress. The meeting comes as the 77-year-old Sanders is considering his political future. Sanders, who lost the 2016 Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton, is expected to decide soon whether to launch a second bid for the White House. During a speech Thursday night, Sanders told supporters they had to work harder to convince people of all races, regions and income levels that liberal policies will help them.

The story clearly states the reduction in fetal death rates the review authors calculated by combining the results of the studies ithey looked at. It reports the absolute risk calculation of fetal or newborn deaths (1.7 percent among women who did not receive ultrasound monitoring vs. 1.2 percent among those who did). This reporting of absolute (as opposed to relative) risk reduction is a strong point of the story since it conveys to readers that while the intervention did improve outcomes, the underlying risk is small.

The story notes that there has been concern that the use of Doppler ultrasound might increase unnecessary interventions, including cesarean section deliveries in cases where it is not actually needed. It says the studies indicated that Doppler ultrasound appeared to lead to better decisions about cesarean sections and inductions of labor. The story explains that this report is a review of other studies. It also points out some shortcomings in the underlying studies. The story also includes a comment from one of the study authors that since the technique is established in current practice it is unlikely that there will be future studies of the use of the technology in high-risk pregnancies. The story clearly states that the evidence on the use of Doppler ultrasound applies only to high-risk pregnancies and that there is no evidence the examinations should be done in low-risk pregnancies. There is no information in the story that appears to come from an independent source. Comments from experts in the field would have helped put the authors\u2019 comments into perspective. The story says other types of testing, including electronic fetal-heart monitoring, may also be done during high-risk pregnancies.

Notably, the story reports the absolute risk calculation of fetal or newborn deaths (1.7 percent among women who did not receive ultrasound monitoring vs. 1.2 percent among those who did), rather than trumpeting a large reduction in relative risk. By including the absolute risk numbers, the story helps readers understand both that the test appears to reduce the death rate and, importantly, that the overall risk of fetal or newborn death in developed nations is very small, thus putting the results in perspective. This story also pointed out that there is some uncertainty about the findings because of concerns about the quality of the underlying studies including in the review. What\u2019s more, it highlights the point that the studies included only women who had high-risk pregnancies and that there is no evidence to suggest the use of Doppler ultrasound to monitor low-risk pregnancies. The story would have been ranked as satisfactory on all criteria if it had reported the typical cost of Doppler ultrasound monitoring and included an independent source in addition to the lead author of the review.

Castro said this action left Patrick out of step with Texas Democrats and Republicans who, he suggested, are more supportive of immigrants regardless of origin. Patrick, the Houston state senator in a May 27 runoff with incumbent David Dewhurst for the GOP lieutenant governor nomination, replied: \"\"No, mayor. That\u2019s a lie.\"\" Asked to elaborate, Patrick said: \"\"First of all, that bill, which didn\u2019t pass, would have only \u2026 come into play had police had suspicions that someone had committed a crime and then\"\" they would \"\"turn it over to\"\" the federal Immigration Customs Enforcement agency, he said, \"\"to try to keep us in line with Secure Communities,\"\" the program enabling fingerprints of arrested individuals to be checked against federal crime and immigration databases. Patrick further said he\u2019d decided, \"\"based on things the federal government has done, that that bill will not pass and will not be effective.\"\" We wondered if indeed Patrick filed an Arizona-type \"\"show-me-your-papers\"\" proposal. Looks like it. Castro's basis By email, Castro spokesman Jaime Castillo quoted Patrick\u2019s measure, which died without a hearing in the 2011 legislative session, and said it was similar to a vital part of Arizona\u2019s law. As recapped by Castillo, Patrick\u2019s legislation specified: \"\"A peace officer shall inquire into the lawful presence of any person who is lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested on other grounds if the officer has a reasonable suspicion to believe the person has violated a criminal provision of the federal immigration laws (sic).\"\" Castillo said Arizona's law \"\"included language authorizing police officers to check immigration status if they have reasonable suspicion to believe that someone is here illegally and, before\"\" court rulings \u00a0\"\"to arrest without a warrant, anyone \u2018the officer has probable cause to believe \u2026 has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States.\u2019\"\" Let\u2019s look at both. Arizona law Arizona\u2019s 21-page measure, signed into law in April 2010, included provisions intended to \"\"work together to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present\"\" in the country. A key element of the law--which included state-level restrictions on human smuggling and workers congregating in search of day jobs--directed law officers at all levels to check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Another section said the immigration status of arrested individuals must be checked before their release. The law also provided for officers to transport individuals lacking proof of legal residency to federal authorities. Generally, as noted in a 2010 fact check, the law required legal immigrants to carry papers that confirmed their legal status, though the U.S. Supreme Court later threw out parts of the law that would have made state crimes out of federal immigration violations, as reported by The Associated Press in June 2012. According to the AP\u2019s account, the court rejected the law\u2019s mandate that immigrants obtain or carry immigration registration papers. It also tossed language making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job, the AP said, and voided a provision permitting police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants. The court let stand the law\u2019s requirement that police officers check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Even then, the AP reported, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges. Also, they removed some teeth by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges. Patrick\u2019s proposal According to a Texas legislative website, Patrick filed his measure, SB 126, on Nov. 8, 2010 in anticipation of the 2011 legislative session. The proposal called for revising the state\u2019s Code of Criminal Procedure by specifying that a \"\"peace officer shall inquire into the lawful presence of any person who is lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested on other grounds if the officer has a reasonable suspicion to believe the person has violated a criminal provision of the federal immigration laws.\"\" If the officer has \"\"probable cause\"\" to believe as much, the officer could arrest the person and \"\"shall identify and report the person to\"\" ICE, the proposal said. Also, Patrick\u2019s measure voided any local ordinance, regulation or policy interfering with an officer carrying out the described duty, furthermore giving legal immunity to an officer, agency or other governmental entity for any cause of action connected to carrying out such duties aside from intentional misconduct, recklessness or gross negligence connected with the intended law. At the time, news stories said Patrick had filed a proposal like the show-your-papers part of the Arizona law, though Patrick stressed in interviews that police officers would be required to ask a person if they were in the state legally only if they reasonably suspected otherwise. A Nov. 13, 2010, news story in the San Antonio Express-News quoted him as saying law agencies wanted the question to be required, instead of being optional, to avoid complaints of profiling. In January 2011, Patrick separately told the Associated Press and an MSNBC host that he\u2019d been to Arizona to see its law in action. Patrick said on MSNBC: \"\"It's workable for our police. And then once a police officer says to someone, are you legally present, because they don't have any identification, we then give the discretion to the officer to take the next step. Is that an arrest, is it detaining that person on suspicion of another possible crime?\"\" Logan Spence, Patrick\u2019s lieutenant governor campaign manager, replied to our query about Patrick\u2019s proposal with an email suggesting Patrick\u2019s proposal was more narrow than the entire Arizona statute. By phone, Castillo said Castro didn\u2019t say in the debate that Patrick filed the entire Arizona law. Our ruling Castro said Patrick \"\"proposed Arizona-style show-me-your-papers legislation.\"\" Patrick\u2019s unsuccessful proposal was similar to, and modeled on, Arizona\u2019s show-your-papers provision.s . \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\" Claim: \"Juli\u00e1n Castro Says Dan Patrick \"\"proposed Arizona-style show-me-your-papers legislation.\"", "output": "\"Castro said Patrick \"\"proposed Arizona-style show-me-your-papers legislation.\"\" Patrick\u2019s unsuccessful proposal was similar to, and modeled on, Arizona\u2019s show-your-papers provision.\"", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

The emergency measure \u2014 which includes free testing for COVID-19, paid emergency leave and other emergency appropriations \u2014 easily passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 18, 2020. But it passed without much help from Wisconsin. The Kenosha Democrats seized on that fact in a March 19, 2020, Facebook post. The post explained the bill, commented on gerrymandering and noted the GOP no votes from purple Wisconsin went beyond the breakdown from even the deepest red of the red states. It was accompanied by a graphic with pictures of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Reps. Mike Gallagher, Glenn Grothman, Jim Sensenbrenner and Bryan Steil that said this: \"\"WI is the ONLY state where all Republicans voted against protecting its citizens.\"\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let\u2019s check it out. The bill passed 363-40 in the U.S. House and 90-8 in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, all five Republicans in the Wisconsin delegation cast a no vote, according to roll calls published by ProPublica. All four state Democrats voted for the bill. And, yes, that clean sweep of Republican votes was unique around the country. In Oklahoma both Republican senators voted against the bill, but two of three Republican representatives supported it. Iowa\u2019s lone Republican representative voted no, but both Republican senators there supported the bill. That leaves us to look at the characterization that Wisconsin Republicans \"\"voted against protecting (the state\u2019s) citizens\"\"? Like anything in politics, it\u2019s more complicated than that. In various statements issued after the votes, the state\u2019s Republican lawmakers didn\u2019t object to the concept of providing help amid the pandemic, but they took issue with numerous specifics in the bill and how the process was handled. Sensenbrenner objected to spending money on a bill that he said stretched 100 pages and was presented with less than 30 minutes to review. \"\"We do not know the full cost of this legislation,\"\" he said in a statement. \"\"I am not a fan of passing bills to find out what is in them.\"\" Steil told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he voted against the bill because it \"\"places a heavy government mandate on Wisconsin small businesses that are already suffering negative consequences from coronavirus.\"\" Gallagher echoed those comments in a statement, saying he feared the bill would hurt small businesses. \"\"This bill, while well-intentioned, contains a number of unclear provisions that could force small businesses in Northeast Wisconsin to lay off workers or cause them to close their doors altogether,\"\" Gallagher said. \"\"Let me be clear: H.R. 6201 contained a number of good provisions like free testing that we\u2019ve already successfully fought for. But I have serious questions as to whether the best way to support those needing paid and sick leave is through tax credits to small businesses instead of direct payments to those affected.\"\" Lori Hawkins, chair of the Kenosha County Democratic Party, defended the description in the Facebook post. She said the bill guided both testing and treatment to help control the spread of the disease. \"\"A 'no' vote by our elected officials was a vote against protecting their constituents from this highly contagious disease which has already been deadly to residents in Wisconsin,\"\" she said in an email. A viral Facebook post said Wisconsin \"\"is the only state where all Republicans voted against protecting its citizens.\"\" It is indeed the only state where all Republicans opposed the bill, which has now become law.

As the\u00a0recent HealthNewsReview.org post by Lieberman might suggest, this is part of a growing trend to conceal the true cost of expensive drugs to the consumer, forcing those with more substantial insurance plans to foot the bill. \u201cDo we want the health system to work for a few or for everyone?\u201d Lieberman wrote. \u201cThat should guide our reporting when the next news release touting the newest specialty drug shows up.\u201d After 12 to 16 weeks of treatment, Merck claims its drug can cure two types of hepatitis C in 94% of people. This includes people who had cirrhosis, HIV or kidney impairment. However, it should have been explained that the response or \u201ccure\u201d refers only to the reduction of viral load, which does not address long-term effects or adverse effects of the drug. The benefits are given in absolute terms, but viral loads are not reported and the response or viral loads in the placebo group are not reported at all in the release. This would be a critical element to be adequately reported in describing the results of\u00a0studies on the efficacy of a particular\u00a0drug. Finally, since some of the patients\u00a0already had cirrhosis, there is no way the drug can prevent this outcome, and the needed study outcome should be\u00a0reduction in the rate of liver or other GI cancers. The discussion on harms includes a long list of drugs to avoid mixing with Zepatier as well as common side effects and adverse reactions including headaches, fatigue, nausea, and anemia in about 5% of people who took the drug. Although we wouldn\u2019t expect harms from placebo to be severe, we expected to see at least a mention of them since the drug was compared against placebo. And, since the minor harms were listed so extensively, we would have liked to see a mention of the risks for more rare but serious side effects due to the drug. In its news release on the approval, the FDA writes, \u201cZepatier carries a warning alerting patients and health care providers that elevations of liver enzymes to greater than five times the upper limit of normal occurred in approximately 1 percent of clinical trial participants, generally at or after treatment week eight.\u201d Drugs must pass high bars to achieve FDA approval, and here we\u2019re given the detailed results in five randomized, double-blind clinical trials for one form of hepatitis C (GT1 HCV) and one\u00a0trial for another \u2014 GT4 HCV. Each of the trials used a few\u00a0different populations with different\u00a0pre-existing\u00a0conditions. Despite the exhaustive accounting of study results, we\u2019ll ding the release here for not acknowledging that the studies were all designed to find the \u201cdisease oriented\u201d and not \u201cpatient oriented\u201d outcomes. This means that the trial looked at the reduction in viral load, not the prevention of specific conditions like cirrhosis, an outcome that is supposed to be prevented by the use of these drugs. Patients care most about conditions that affect them and not how many virus particles are in their blood, so this was an important omission. There are no harrowing, overly dramatic details here. Merck is clearly labeled as the sponsor of the release. In the clinical trials section, some alternative treatments are named, including \u201cIFN or PegIFN \u00b1 RBV\u201d and \u201cboceprevir, simeprevir, or telaprevir in combination with PegIFN + RBV.\u201d \u00a0We\u2019ll award a Satisfactory on that basis, although the trials mentioned are all compared against placebo and not these drugs. It would have helped to know what those treatments are, and their effectiveness. We will note, however, that\u00a0highly successful curative hepatitis C treatments are very\u00a0new \u2014 basically, within the past few years. The alternatives prior to that were liver transplants, which can cost $300,000, and viral interferon treatments, which were less than 50% effective. Merck\u2019s release states the drug will start shipping to wholesalers within 7 days of Jan. 28, 2016. This is the second one-pill, once-a-day option for hepatitis C. We don\u2019t think the release demonstrates novelty. \u201cMultiple therapeutic tools\u201d to treat hepatitis C are mentioned in a quote by the executive director of the Hepatitis Education Project, but we\u2019re not clued in to what those are or where Zepatier fits in. Alternative drugs have similar, albeit slightly lower, cure rates in the high-80% to low-90% range. We see the word \u201ccure\u201d four times in the release. The release defines its use of the term cure early on in the release as \u201cSustained virologic response is defined as HCV RNA levels measuring less than the lower limit of quantification at 12 weeks after the cessation of treatment (SVR12), indicating that a patient\u2019s HCV infection has been cured.\u201d\u00a0 We disagree because there\u2019s no indication that these\u00a0\u201csustained\u201d responses are prolonged\u00a0for a long period after the drug is discontinued. Claim: Merck Receives FDA Approval of ZEPATIER\u2122 (elbasvir and grazoprevir) for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 or 4 Infection in Adults Following Priority Review", "output": "Merck\u2019s PR release fills us in on its freshly FDA-approved drug \u2014 Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir) \u2014 to treat two different forms of hepatitis C and claims to \u201ccure\u201d upwards of 94% of infections based on 12- and 16-week trials. The combination pill is taken once a day throughout treatment. The release seems targeted primarily to healthcare professionals, rather than consumers, so it\u2019s chock-full of jargon and statistics. While the release indicates the risks, benefits and costs, we saw some weaknesses in the presentation of the evidence. For example, the news release did not provide the outcomes for the placebo group, even though the studies compared the drugs with placebo. Nor did it explain that the outcome assessed \u2014 sustained virologic response \u2014 is a short-term proxy for the longer-term results that patients really care about, such as rates of liver failure and cancer. Speaking of costs, what this release doesn\u2019t cover (although who\u00a0would expect a for-profit drug\u00a0company to do so?) is the insane cost of specialty drugs, the rising demand for them, and their increasing burden on the U.S. healthcare system. HealthNewsReview.org contributor Trudy Lieberman expands on\u00a0this issue in\u00a0a recent blog\u00a0post, which happens to focus\u00a0on\u00a0another (very expensive) hepatitis C drug. Hepatitis C is caused by a virus that attacks the liver \u2014 an organ you can\u2019t live without because it breaks down toxins, fights infections, helps regulate metabolism, and aids digestion. Infections can be passed down in a variety of ways, including from mother to child (during pregnancy), use of unsanitary needles (e.g. drugs or tattoos), or having sex with someone who\u2019s infected. Severe infections can lead to liver transplants, and cure rates with drugs in the past decade were less than 50%. Treatment has evolved rapidly as new drugs hit the market each year. Now drug sponsors are claiming that 80% to more than 90% of chronic infections can be essentially eliminated with drugs, but they do not come cheap. Harvoni, made by Gilead, costs $94,500 per 12-week course of treatment \u2014 $1,125 per pill. Gilead\u2019s other hepatitis C drug Sovaldi costs $84,000 per course. And now Zepatier, made by Merck and now FDA-approved, costs $54,600 \u2014 what the Financial Times called the latest volley in a hepatitis C drug price war. Unfortunately, the need for such expensive drugs is on the rise, and with it is an increasing\u00a0burden on the healthcare system. About 3.5 million people in the US live with chronic hepatitis C. And according to the CDC\u2019s latest estimates, the number of new US cases is growing: There were about 16,500 new cases in 2011, 24,700 new cases in 2012, and 29,700 new cases in 2013 \u2014 and more than three quarters of these cases lead to a chronic infection. The effect of these drugs on outcomes of reducing effects of Hep\u00a0C virus on the liver, longevity or cancer rates has never been proven or quantified. Before we can talk about the effect\u00a0of\u00a0the price\u00a0of the drug, we need to quantify the effect (NNTB) of\u00a0the\u00a0drug for patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic Hep C.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

Andrew M. Cuomo says women in New York state don\u2019t have to worry about new Trump administration rules ending a federal requirement that employers must include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans. The new rules exempt employers from the Obama-era mandate if they have religious or moral reservations to the coverage. But Cuomo said contraception will still be covered in New York state. \"\"This year, we ensured that whatever happens at the federal level, women in our state will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care,\"\" Cuomo said in a statement. States can set certain insurance standards beyond what the federal government requires. New York state told insurance companies in January they are required to cover birth control and abortion services. That condition still stands, but is Cuomo right that women in New York state are not affected by Trump\u2019s decision? Limits to state regulation State regulations, like the one from January, do not apply to all plans. The state Department of Financial Services regulates everything sold on the state health exchange, called New York State of Health. That includes plans sold to individuals and companies with 100 or fewer employees. The agency says the state\u2019s birth control mandate covers 1.35 million residents in those plans. Health care offered through companies with more than 100 employees is more complicated. Companies that go the traditional route of buying health coverage through an insurance carrier must adhere to the rules. About 2.5 million people in that category are covered by the state\u2019s birth control mandate. But companies that are self-insured, where the employer assumes a large part of the costs,\u00a0are not regulated by the state, meaning they need not adhere to the state's birth control mandate. About 60 percent of private sector workers in the U.S. who get their health coverage through an employer were enrolled in a self-insured plan in 2015. That\u2019s up from 46 percent in 1996, according to research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. In New York state, about 54 percent of private sector employees who get health insurance through their employer had a self-insured plan last year, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The option is most popular for companies with at least 1,000 employees. Eighty percent of private sector employees at companies that size in New York state are enrolled in a self-insured plan. What about public health insurance? The federal government sets the baseline for what services are covered under Medicaid. Government workers are covered under state regulation, but Medicaid and Medicare enrollees are not.States can add to that list. The list of services covered by Medicaid in New York state goes well beyond the federal standard. New York is one of multiple states where Medicaid covers birth control and abortion services. About a third of the state\u2019s population alone is on Medicaid. Our ruling Cuomo said women in New York state \"\"will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care\"\" because of an action the state took earlier this year. But not every woman is in an insurance plan\u00a0regulated by the state. It\u2019s possible a self-insured large employer in New York state could apply for an exemption from the federal birth control mandate. If granted the exemption, the company would not have to provide health coverage for birth control to its employees. Those exemptions are not expected to be widespread, but they are possible.

Those steps come as Indiana\u2019s death toll from confirmed or probable COVID-19 illnesses has grown past 1,600 people. STATEWIDE STUDY The testing of about 4,600 people at random around the state found 1.7% were infected at the time of the test and 1.1% tested positive for antibodies showing they were previously exposed. The tests were done by IU\u2019s Fairbanks School of Public Health over a week ending May 1. The findings project that Indiana has seen a 0.58% fatality rate among those infected. That rate is almost six times greater than the death rate for seasonal flu, said Nir Menachemi, a professor who led the study. Nearly 45% of those infected reported experiencing no symptoms of the COVID-19 respiratory disease. Menachemi said that highlighted the need for people to practice social distancing and wear masks in public to avoid unknowingly spreading the coronavirus. \u201cThe needs to minimize the risk of infection spread will probably not go away until we have a vaccine or a really good treatment that can deal with everyone infected,\u201d Menachemi said. A statewide order from Gov. Eric Holcomb started lifting many business and travel restrictions starting May 4. Menachemi said the IU researchers plan a new round of random testing in early June that will look for any increased coronavirus spread connected with the state\u2019s reopening steps. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the first glimpse of how the relaxing of some of the issues have impacted the population,\u201d he said. The projected infection rate would mean about 186,000 Indiana residents had the coronavirus by the end of April, when the state health department reported fewer than 19,000 confirmed infections. The agency reported nearly 25,500 infections as of Wednesday. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. INDIANAPOLIS RESTRICTIONS Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett announced Wednesday that Indiana\u2019s largest city will begin easing its pandemic restrictions starting Friday after health tracking data showed the city was ready to enter \u201ca path toward reopening, incrementally, our local economy.\u201d Public gatherings \u2014 including religious services \u2014 will be permitted to increase from the county\u2019s current 10-person limit to 25, and nonessential retail stores, including liquor stores, can begin opening to the public at 50% capacity. The mayor said that starting May 22, the city will allow in-person dining to resume at restaurants but only for outdoor seating \u201cand with strict social-distancing guidelines\u201d and required masks for restaurant workers. However, indoor restaurant dining will continue to not be permitted. Tougher local restrictions have remained in Indianapolis, northwestern Indiana\u2019s Lake County and rural northern Indiana\u2019s Cass County, where a large coronavirus outbreak infected hundreds of Tyson meatpacking plant workers. Hogsett said that if the trajectory of coronavirus cases \u201ccontinues to stabilize and hopefully decline\u201d more city restrictions could be lifted by June 1. STATE\u2019S TOLL Indiana\u2019s coronavirus death toll has grown past 1,600 people as state health officials on Wednesday added 41 fatalities involving confirmed or probable infections to the tally. The Indiana State Department of Health recorded 38 newly confirmed COVID-19 deaths, most of which occurred Monday or Tuesday, along with three additional deaths considered coronavirus-related by doctors but without confirmation of the illness from test results. One of the newly confirmed deaths dated back to April 22, which gives that date 48 deaths and makes it the state\u2019s deadliest single day during the pandemic.

The story does a good job of describing groups for comparison: coffee-abstainers, light drinkers (1-6 cups per week), and heavier drinkers (>2 cups per day). However death rates were presented as relative risk. How many of the 18,000-plus subject died during the average 16 years they were followed? What does \u201c18% less likely to have died\u201d look like in absolute numbers? Coffee does have adverse effects, such as insomnia, increasing anxiety, and triggering reflux in certain people. However, the story made no mention of coffee\u2019s downsides. The story makes clear how large the study was, what the methodology was, and that other big risk factors for early death such as smoking were taken into account. Also, the story makes clear that no one is recommending coffee-drinking as a mode to prevent chronic diseases that lead to early death. And it includes a clear caution regarding the limitations of observational studies: \u201cThough the two studies involved hundreds of thousands of people, they weren\u2019t designed to show that drinking more coffee caused people to live longer; that would require a randomized trial.\u201d And yet, it\u2019s important for journalists to avoid language that undercuts this important message. The headline, suggesting that coffee is \u201cgood for you\u201d makes a clear cause-and-effect leap. And the use of a hedge like \u201cmight\u201d in the following sentence isn\u2019t enough to offset the clear cause-and-effect implication \u2014 i.e. that coffee is responsible for \u201cextending\u201d your life. \u201cThe best thing about your coffee habit might be that it extends your life by reducing your risk of death from heart disease, diabetes or even cancer.\u201d We\u2019ll rate this a very marginal Satisfactory with room for improvement. Coverage at the BBC, for example, was more successful at capturing the nuances of observational evidence, starting with the headline:\u00a0\u201cCoffee drinkers live longer \u2013 perhaps.\u201d No fear-mongering here. The story includes perspective from an editorial that accompanied the studies in the journal, the Annals of Internal Medicine. And that\u2019s enough for a satisfactory grade. Reaching out to more sources, and actually talking to experts in this field, might have turned up additional insights worth sharing with readers. The story makes clear that the claims of benefit \u2014 reduced mortality \u2014 are not a reason to drink coffee. Instead the findings suggest there are no long-term effects that should scare coffee-drinkers away from their habit. In any case, the situation does not call for a comparison with alternative methods of living longer. We\u2019ll rate this Not Applicable. Coffee is so widely available that there\u2019s no need to make the point. The story makes clear how the National Cancer Institute study extends previous research on coffee\u2019s health effects from studies of mostly white European-descent subjects to a multi-ethnic population. The story does not appear to rely on a news release. Claim: Two big studies bolster the claim that coffee \u2013 even decaf \u2013 is good for you", "output": "This Los Angeles Times story was one of many news outlets to report on a pair of large epidemiological studies on coffee-drinking and mortality. And like many of those other stories, this piece seems to assume that coffee really is healthy, although that is not proven by these or any other observational (association) studies. We think the helpful notes of caution included in the story may get drowned out by the optimistic framing of the headline and lead paragraph. Describing coffee as \u201cgood for you\u201d suggests to readers that coffee causes health benefits \u2014 not something that these studies were designed to evaluate. We also explored the problems with news coverage about this study in a blog post. As the article states, \u201c2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed\u201d each day around the world. Coffee is widely consumed and many people drink multiple cups per day. The potential health benefits and risks of coffee, like its consumption cousins wine and chocolate, seem to always be of interest to health news readers. And yet, like so many previous studies, these describe an association, not a causal effect.

For the priests, like doctors, nurses and other frontline workers, it means putting their lives at risk to care for the sick in hospitals. \u201cI know the consequences,\u201d said Dorantes, 36. \u201cWe are called to do this.\u201d  Throughout history, priests and other clergy have risked their lives ministering to the dying through population-decimating plagues and on the battlefields of wars. But in the face of COVID-19, which has killed more than 150,000 people worldwide and about 33,000 in the United States, the Vatican last month waived the requirement for in-person worship and sacraments, including a special dispensation for believers who cannot receive the last rites. Many faiths and denominations in America have taken similar unprecedented actions, as the coronavirus has upended one of the most sacred duties of clergy of most major faiths - ministering to the dying and comforting the bereaved. The disease has forced clergy to rely on technology. Cell phones or iPads are held at the bedsides of very ill patients by nurses and orderlies. During funerals, they preach to empty pews during services  shared using sites such as Zoom and FaceTime. Graveside prayers can be attended by the barest few, sometimes just three mourners. For clergy, this is the new normal, said United Methodist Bishop Thomas Bickerton, a member of the denomination\u2019s ruling council of bishops, which has halted in-person worship services. Rabbi David-Seth Kirshner, head rabbi at Temple Emanu-El in Closter, New Jersey, said many hospitals won\u2019t allow bedside visits by anyone, including clergy. \u201cWe don\u2019t even bother to ask,\u201d said Kirshner, 46, who leads a conservative congregation of about 800 families. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d  But the rabbi asks nurses or orderlies to hold an iPad so patients can see it. They then pray together. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very important that we at least offer that.\u201d  Some burials that under Jewish tradition should be held within a day have to wait a week or more, the rabbi said, in places where cemeteries and funeral homes are beyond capacity. One Muslim imam said many funeral homes in the United States are no longer allowing the Islamic ritual of washing the body before burial, for fear of spreading the disease. \u201cFor the family it\u2019s tough because they cannot mourn the same,\u201d Daoud Nassimi, an imam in Washington D.C., told the online publication Middle East Eye. About 3 million Americans identify as members of the Episcopalian Church, which is largely relying on video chats and phone calls by priests to make that last connection with those on the brink of death, according to Reverend Lorenzo Librija of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. A few weeks ago, he came up with a plan to organize the effort. It is called \u201cDial-a-Priest\u201d and is aimed at helping people who do not have a relationship with a local church, but still want to receive the last rites. \u201cWe picked that name because it\u2019s easy to remember and easy to Google,\u201d said Librija. His group has about 100 retired ministers who have volunteered to man telephones around the clock, ready to give the ritual ministration of death from the Book of Common Prayer. The Archdiocese of Chicago, with its 24-member last rites team, is one of the few places in the nation where in-person visits to patients near death have continued in hospitals. Dorantes, pastor of Chicago\u2019s Saint Mary of the Lake parish, said he has conducted several bedside rituals since he volunteered in late March. He and the other priests don protective jump suits and N95 respirator masks. Wearing gloves, they take a dab of blessed oil and make the sign of the cross on the patient\u2019s forehead and hands using a Q-tip. \u201cLaying on of hands and anointing, this is the sacrament of the church, a visible sign of invisible grace,\u201d he said. \u201cI could see it in their eyes, incredible moments of grace.\u201d Claim: Protective gear, cellphone, video chats: How America's clergy minister to COVID-19 patients.", "output": "Reverend Manuel Dorantes closed his eyes, took a breath to calm his fear and prayed when word came that Cardinal Blase Joseph Cupich had put out a call for volunteers.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

Timothy Ray Brown, was a young HIV-positive American living and working in Berlin who had developed leukaemia and suffered a relapse after initial treatment. REUTERS/Courtesy KPIX TV/Handout Dramatic scientific advances since HIV was first discovered 30 years ago this week mean the virus is no longer a death sentence. Thanks to tests that detect HIV early, new antiretroviral AIDS drugs that can control the virus for decades, and a range of ways to stop it being spread, 33.3 million people around the world are learning to live with HIV. People like Vuyiseka Dubula, an HIV-positive AIDS activist and mother in Cape Town, South Africa, can expect relatively normal, full lives. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about death at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m taking my treatment and I\u2019m living my life.\u201d   Nonetheless, on the 30th birthday of HIV, the global scientific community is setting out with renewed vigor to try to kill it. The drive is partly about science, and partly about money. Treating HIV patients with lifelong courses of sophisticated drugs is becoming unaffordable. Caring for HIV patients in developing countries alone already costs around $13 billion a year and that could treble over the next 20 years. In tough economic times, the need to find a cure has become even more urgent, says Francoise Barre Sinoussi, who won a Nobel prize for her work in identifying Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). \u201cWe have to think about the long term, including a strategy to find a cure,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to keep on searching until we find one.\u201d   The Berlin patient is proof they could. His case has injected new energy into a field where people for years believed talk of a cure was irresponsible. Timothy Ray Brown was living in Berlin when besides being HIV-positive, he had a relapse of leukemia. He was dying. In 2007, his doctor, Gero Huetter, made a radical suggestion: a bone marrow transplant using cells from a donor with a rare genetic mutation, known as CCR5 delta 32. Scientists had known for a few years that people with this gene mutation had proved resistant to HIV. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t know when we started this project what would happen,\u201d Huetter, an oncologist and haematologist who now works at the University of Heidelberg in southern Germany, told Reuters. The treatment could well have finished Brown off. Instead he remains the only human ever to be cured of AIDS. \u201cHe has no replicating virus and he isn\u2019t taking any medication. And he will now probably never have any problems with HIV,\u201d says Huetter. Brown has since moved to San Francisco. Most experts say it is inconceivable Brown\u2019s treatment could be a way of curing all patients. The procedure was expensive, complex and risky. To do this in others, exact match donors would have to be found in the tiny proportion of people \u2014 most of them of northern European descent \u2014 who have the mutation that makes them resistant to the virus. Dr Robert Gallo, of the Institute of Virology at the University of Maryland, puts it bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s not practical and it can kill people,\u201d he said last year. Sinoussi is more expansive. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly unrealistic to think that this medically heavy, extremely costly, barely reproducible approach could be replicated and scaled-up ... but from a scientist\u2019s point of view, it has shown at least that a cure is possible,\u201d she says. The International AIDS Society will this month formally add the aim of finding a cure to its HIV strategy of prevention, treatment and care. A group of scientist-activists is also launching a global working group to draw up a scientific plan of attack and persuade governments and research institutions to commit more funds. Money is starting to flow. The U.S. National Institutes of Health is asking for proposals for an $8.5 million collaborative research grant to search for a cure, and the Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR, has just announced its first round of four grants to research groups \u201cto develop strategies for eradicating HIV infection.\u201d   Until recently, people in HIV and AIDS circles feared that to direct funds toward the search for a cure risked detracting from the fight to get HIV-positive people treated. Even today, only just over five million of the 12 million or so people who need the drugs actually get them. HIV first surfaced in 1981, when scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discovered it was the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). An article in the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report of that June referred to \u201cfive young men, all active homosexuals\u201d from Los Angeles as the first documented cases. \u201cThat was the summer of \u201881. For the world it was the beginning of the era of HIV/AIDS, even though we didn\u2019t know it was HIV then,\u201d says Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has made AIDS research his life\u2019s work. In the subsequent three decades, the disease ignorantly branded \u201cthe gay plague\u201d has become one of the most vicious pandemics in human history. Transmitted in semen, blood and breast milk, HIV has devastated poorer regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, where the vast majority of HIV-positive people live. As more tests and treatment have become available, the number of new infections has been falling. But for every two with HIV who get a chance to start on AIDS drugs, five more join the \u201cnewly infected\u201d list. United Nations data show that despite an array of potential prevention measures \u2014 from male circumcision to sophisticated vaginal or anal microbicide gels \u2014 more than 7,100 new people catch the virus every day. Treatment costs per patient can range from around $150 a year in poor countries, where drugs are available as cheap generics, to more than $20,000 a year in the United States. The overall sums are huge. A recent study as part of a non-governmental campaign called AIDS2031 suggests that low and middle-income countries will need $35 billion a year to properly address the pandemic by 2031. That\u2019s almost three times the current level of around $13 billion a year. Add in the costs of treatment in rich countries and experts estimate the costs of HIV 20 years from now will reach $50 to $60 billion a year. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we have to look at another possible way of managing of the epidemic beyond just treating everyone forever,\u201d says Sharon Lewin, a leading HIV doctor and researcher from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. In some ways, we have been here before. Early AIDS drugs such as AZT came to market in the late 1980s, but within a decade they were overtaken by powerful cocktail treatments known as HAART, or highly active antiretroviral treatment. HAART had a dramatic effect \u2014 rapidly driving the virus out of patients\u2019 blood and prompting some to say a cure was just around the corner. But then scientists discovered HIV could lie low in pools or reservoirs of latent infection that even powerful drugs could not reach. Talk of a cure all but died out. \u201cScientifically we had no means to say we were on the way to finding a cure,\u201d says Bertrand Audoin, executive director of the Geneva-based International AIDS Society. \u201cScientists ... don\u2019t want to make any more false promises. They didn\u2019t want to talk about a cure again because it really wasn\u2019t anywhere on the horizon.\u201d   The ultimate goal would allow patients to stop taking AIDS drugs, knocking a hole in a $12 billion-a-year market dominated by Californian drugmaker Gilead and the likes of Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck. It\u2019s unlikely to happen anytime soon, but Brown\u2019s case has opened the door to new ideas. \u201cWhat it proved was that if you make someone\u2019s cells resistant to HIV...then all the last bits of HIV, that hang around for a long time in patients on treatment, did in fact decay and disappear,\u201d says Lewin. Now scientists working on mimicking the effect of the Berlin patient\u2019s transplant have had some success. One experimental technique uses gene therapy to take out certain cells, make them resistant to HIV and then put them back into patients in the hope they will survive and spread. At an HIV conference in Boston earlier this year, American researchers presented data on six patients who had large numbers of white blood cells known as CD4 cells removed, manipulated to knock out the existing CCR5 gene, and then replaced. \u201cIt works like scissors and cuts a piece of genetic information out of the DNA, and then closes the gap,\u201d says Huetter. \u201cThen every cell arising from this mother cell has this same mutation.\u201d   Early results showed the mutated cells managed to survive inside the bodies of the patients at low levels, remaining present for more than three months in five. \u201cThis was a proof of concept,\u201d says Lewin. Another potential avenue is a small group of patients known as \u201celite controllers\u201d, who despite being infected with HIV are able to keep it under control simply with their own immune systems. Researchers hope these patients could one day be the clue to developing a successful HIV/AIDS vaccine or functional cure. Scientists are also exploring ways to \u201cwake up\u201d HIV cells and kill them. As discovered in the late 1990s, HIV has a way of getting deep into the immune system itself \u2014 into what are known as resting memory T-cells \u2014 and going to sleep there. Hidden away, it effectively avoids drugs and the body\u2019s own immune response. \u201cOnce it goes to sleep in a cell it can stay there forever, which is really the main reason why we can\u2019t cure HIV with current drugs,\u201d says Lewin. Her team in Melbourne and another group in the United States are about to start the first human trials using a drug called SAHA or vorinostat, made by Merck and currently used in cancer treatment, which has shown promise in being able to wake up dormant HIV. As scientists begin to talk up a cure, the old question of whether that\u2019s the right goal has re-emerged. Seth Berkley, a medical epidemiologist and head of the U.S.-based International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) is concerned.

That is absolutely critical.\u201d   Vuyiseka Dubula agrees. The South African activist finds talk of a cure for HIV distracting, almost disconcerting. \u201cThis research might not yield results soon, and even when it does, access to that cure is still going to be a big issue,\u201d she says. \u201cSo in the meantime, while we don\u2019t have the answer on whether HIV can be cured or not, we need to save lives.\u201d Claim: Special Report: An end to AIDS?.", "output": "For his doctors, Timothy Ray Brown was a shot in the dark.

To do so would require passing the secondary school baccalaureate, or \u201cbac.\u201d But the exams are held only once a year in Congo, and the 21-year-old Mabowa was being held in medical isolation, unable to sit in the same room with other test-takers. So the medical staff members caring for him at an Ebola treatment center run by the Alliance for International Medical Action, or ALIMA, came up with a solution. They found a school official willing to proctor the exam as Mabowa took it safely behind a window. The papers were passed to Mabowa without touching him. After finishing, he held his pages up one by one to the window so they could be photographed with a smartphone and then emailed to officials for scoring. Then his work and his pencil were incinerated. For the oral part of the exam, the questions were asked of him through the glass. On Saturday, Mabowa completed the last of his exams. He is awaiting the results while still in isolation, where he will stay until the virus is gone from his body. He hopes to study political science at the University of Kisangani. \u201cMy mother had told me: \u2018My son, you must study. If you have your diploma, you will succeed in life.

Health workers are racing to contain the outbreak, trying to trace, vaccinate and isolate all people who have come into contact with those carrying the highly contagious virus. The only people allowed in Mabowa\u2019s presence are survivors, who are immune to the virus, and health workers wearing protective gear from head to toe. Mabowa already had lost his older sister when he developed a splitting headache and fever and lost his appetite. But since he had recently been vaccinated against Ebola, he brushed off his symptoms as side effects of the shot. He finally went to the Ebola center in Beni when his illness made him unable to continue studying. After testing positive for Ebola, he began asking the nurses and doctors about how he could still take his exams. Studying was difficult because Mabowa no longer had access to his notebooks and other materials. The ALIMA staff members who were moved by his desire to take his exams even brought Mabowa a school uniform he could wear while taking the bac \u2014 a white dress shirt and navy trousers. \u201cThe fact we brought the exams to him is an important step for his healing and recovery,\u201d said Goretti Muhumira, a psychologist with ALIMA.

NORAD\u2019s engaging well over a thousand people to provide a yearly Santa-tracking program seems to many like a rather whimsical venture for a staid defense-based agency to be engaging in. And, in fact, NORAD didn\u2019t set out to be in the business of providing real-time Santa updates every Christmas Eve: that service came about strictly by accident, the result of a misdialed number published in a local department store newspaper advertisement. Back in 1955, NORAD\u2019s predecessor, the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) was based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. At Christmastime of that year, a Sears department store advertisement placed in a Colorado Springs newspaper featured a picture of Santa urging children to \u201cCall me on my private phone and I will talk to you personally any time day or night.\u201d  Unfortunately, the phone number included in the ad was either misprinted or misdialed, and a child who called ended up not on the phone with St. Nick but rather with one Colonel Harry Shoup, the officer on duty that day at CONAD. Rather than informing his juvenile caller they had reached a wrong number and  brusquely instructing them to get off the line, Col. Shoup opted to play along and asked his staff to accommodate the inquisitive youngster by providing them with updates on Santa\u2019s Christmas Eve progress. The story of the accidental origins of NORAD\u2019s Santa-tracking program has been told and re-told many times over the decades. Here\u2019s how Col. Shoup\u2019s daughter related it back in 2009:   One morning that December, U.S. Air Force Col. Harry Shoup, the director of operations at CONAD, the Continental Air Defense Command \u2014 NORAD\u2019s predecessor \u2014 got a phone call at his Colorado Springs, Colo., office. This was no laughing matter. The call had come in on one of the top secret lines inside CONAD that only rang in the case of a crisis. Grabbing the phone, Shoup must have expected the worst. Instead, a tiny voice asked, \u201cIs this Santa Claus?\u201d \u201cDad\u2019s pretty annoyed,\u201d said Terri Van Keuren, Shoup\u2019s daughter, recalling the legend of that day in 1955. \u201cHe barks into the phone,\u201d demanding to know who\u2019s calling. \u201cThe little voice is now crying,\u201d Van Keuren continued. \u201c\u2018Is this one of Santa\u2019s elves, then? '\u201d The Santa questions were only beginning. That day, the local newspaper had run a Sears Roebuck ad with a big picture of St. Nick and text that urged, \u201cHey,  Kiddies! Call me direct \u2026 Call me on my private phone and I will talk to you personally any time day or night.\u201d But the phone number in the ad was off by a digit. Instead of connecting with Santa, callers were dialing in on the line that would ring if the Russians were attacking. Before long, the phone was ringing off the hook, and, softening up, Shoup grabbed a nearby airman and told him to answer the calls and, Van Keuren said, \u201c\u2018just pretend you\u2019re Santa. '\u201d Indeed, rather than having the newspaper pull the Sears ad, Shoup decided to offer the countless kids calling in something useful: information about Santa\u2019s progress from the North Pole. To quote the official NORAD Santa site, \u201ca tradition was born.\u201d From that point on, first CONAD and then, in 1958, when NORAD was formed, Shoup\u2019s organization offered annual Santa tracking as a service to the global community. A phone number was publicized and anyone was invited to call up, especially on December 24, and find out where Santa was. Manning those phones over the years have been countless numbers of Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps personnel and their families, and for many people, turning to NORAD to find out where Santa is became something to look forward to each year.
