I worked on my resume and case for weeks on end to ensure i had the best chance of getting the position. i got into a few spats with coworkers about who should be promoted as well. this caused a lot of tension among us and made actual work tough for nearly a month. we had a first wave of interviews that knocked out half of the applicants. this made things even worse as some longer tenured employees were not pushed through to the second round of interviews. i was lucky enough to be pushed through myself. after the second round, we had two days where we did not know who had won the position. this was also stressful for us and put more tension on the office and all of us personally, as it was a life changing event for anyone who won the spot due to the salary and our life trajectories. after a few days, my manager called me into his office and informed me that i had won the position. this was a surprise to me as i thought other members were favored over me and would get the position. i was ecstatic to win the spot, as my salary more than doubled and i got great benefits. despite the stresses i was very happy with the situation.", "category": "Story Composition 1477.json"}, {"instruction": "Read the given summary of events, and write a longer story which covers everything described in the summary.

All of the little kids were there and we even saw a deer.", "output": "I went to visit family for vacation at my sister's house. It was the first time in years that we had all gathered together and some of the younger children had never met before. It was a great time watching them all play together and get along. I helped with a lot of the cooking as I like that and am good at it. It was fun to go out in the woods with the kids and show them the river and we saw a deer. I played baseball with a few of the nephews. We went out to eat at a great restaraunt and had a great time. It was nice to catch up with my siblings and hang out like we used to. We had not all been together for a long time and we reminisced. It was a bit cold but did not snow and we built a fire outside one night and maybe drank a bit much. My parents enjoyed seeing all of the kids running around. It was a great time with my family and one we will repeat this year. We discussed renting a nice lake house or something a bit closer to everybody next time. It is hard to meet up often because we are all scattered out over the country. It was a good reminder of how lucky I am to have such a good family. I am looking forward to next time.", "category": "Story Composition 1477.json"}]
