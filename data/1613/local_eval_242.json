This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.  Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.  When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.  Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better.

I am fructose intolerant so I dare not to even try eating these because of that.  I have read a lot of scientific literature about fructose and I have my opinions and the corn council has theirs. They have 180 calories per 40 gram serving which is too much for a snack for my purposes.  Yes, eating half would be only 90 calories, but half is barely a bite.

My wife said that it would probably be something like Orangina, but since I'm not particularly fond of Orangina that didn't help me much. I then remembered that I had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all. I sampled this product cold, as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor.  I was very surprised to discover that I enjoyed this quite a bit. I expected there to be some acidity to it, given the orange and tangerine combination, and found none. I did find it surprisingly sweet considering that there's no added sugar. It was not, in fact, entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish. There was a slight and very brief metallic aftertaste which I first assumed was from drinking it right from the can, but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained. Still, it's not enough to put me off from drinking it.  The one thing that did put me off was the price. I'll admit that I'm something of a \"cheap drinker\" - I have a hard time, for example, going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for $2.50 when I can buy a $2 bottle of lemon juice and a $2.50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over. I *always* do the math and price out what I'm drinking. (Do you have ANY idea how much money Coke makes off those 20 oz bottles?!?) So for this product, $23 for a 24-pack comes out to 96\u00a2 per 8.3 ounce can, or about 12\u00a2 per ounce. A half gallon of Tropicana orange-tangerine juice at the local supermarket is $3.80, or about 6\u00a2 per ounce. I happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece, and it would take 2-3 chargers to do the entire half-gallon, so all said and done it would cost me about 8\u00a2 per ounce to make my own carbonated orange-tangerine drink, so it's about 2/3 the cost to make it myself. (No, I didn't factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice.)  So I guess the bottom line here is, if you're really big on the whole carbonated orange-tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed, or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65% of the cost (assuming you have a carbonator). Or, you can buy a two liter bottle of house-brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about $22 in the process.", "output": "3", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1215.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

It's not pure orange juice- but made up of a mixture of several different juices including apple, orange, grape and tangerine.  That juice blend gives it a slightly tangy taste that is actually at first slightly surprising and mostly refreshing.  The carbonation also seems lighter to me than soda but it is definitely there.  The things I like about this product are the smaller can size (8.3oz)which makes it a more appropriate serving that a regular soda.  I also like the bright packaging and the pleasant taste.  After reading the ingredients of SWITCH carefully- I see that it is all juice just as it claims- so its probably a better choice than a regular soda.  This product has no added sugars just as advertised on the can- but buyer beware- its still kind of high in sugar because fruit juices are naturally high in sugar. As always be sure to read the label if you are concerned about sugar levels.

Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%.
