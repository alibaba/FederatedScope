Here, using genetic and chemical tools to probe functions of the S1P 1 receptor, we elucidate cellular and signaling mechanisms that are important in initiating cytokine storm. Whereas S1P 1 receptor is expressed on endothelial cells and lymphocytes within lung tissue, S1P 1 agonism suppresses cytokines and innate immune cell recruitment in wild-type and lymphocyte-deficient mice, identifying endothelial cells as central regulators of cytokine storm. Furthermore, our data reveal immune cell infiltration and cytokine production as distinct events that are both orchestrated by endothelial cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that suppression of early innate immune responses through S1P 1 signaling results in reduced mortality during infection with a human pathogenic strain of influenza virus. Modulation of endothelium with a specific agonist suggests that diseases in which amplification of cytokine storm is a significant pathological component could be chemically tractable.", "output": "Endothelial Cells Are Central Orchestrators of Cytokine Amplification during Influenza Virus Infection", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

To date, no information is available on F1 protein of Indian isolates, and hence detection of antibodies for F1 protein in Indian patients assumes great relevance. Specific primers have been designed to amplify sequence coding for 120aa of truncated F1 (tF1). The amplified tF1 has been cloned in bacterial expression vector, pET21b for expression in Escherichia coli. Partially purified expressed protein has been subjected to western blot analysis using patients' sera. Three HCV positive sera employed in western analysis showed positive signals to tF1, while sera from uninfected individuals failed to give any signals. Further, results of western blots, carried out with patients sera titrated with purified core protein, confirmed the presence of antibodies specific to F1. The positive signal observed for F1 in western analysis with HCV infected sera suggests that F1 protein is synthesized in the natural course of HCV infection in Indian patients as well.

The subjects' cardiorespiratory physiological measurements were assessed in different states of physical activity under different interventions (mask without and with MF). A total of 106 subjects were recruited between July-August 2016. The use of the mask without MF increased the End-Tidal CO 2 (etco 2 ) and fractional concentration of inspired co 2 (fico 2 ) at rest and on mild exertion, as expected. The use of the mask with MF brought FICO 2 levels comparably closer to baseline levels without the mask for both activities. The mask, with or without the MF, was found to be well fitting, comfortable and safe for use in children at rest and on mild exertion. The N95 mask tested offers a promising start for more studies in the paediatric population. Air pollution, such as haze or smog, is an evolving and increasingly significant problem around the world. A wide range of hazards of chronic air pollution in children include nocturnal cough, asthma, poor performance in neurobehavioral function, negative impact in cognitive development and harmful effects on brain development 1-5 . In particular, children represent a vulnerable segment of any population. They carry more risks of long term exposure to pollution over the course of their lives and are susceptible to acquiring chronic diseases in their developing lungs 6-11 . Use of masks and respirators can offer protection against air pollutants. However, the commercially available disposable particulate respirators, typically certified for surgical (which may only offer some barrier against larger particles) and occupational use, are mainly designed for and studied in adults.

VP35 is functionally equivalent to the phosphoprotein (P) of other mononegaviruses 22 such as rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. Phosphorylation of the P protein is universally 23 regarded as functionally important however, a regulatory role(s) of phosphorylation on VP35 24 function remains unexplored. Here, we identified a highly conserved Ser129 residue near the 25 homo-oligomerization coiled coil motif, which is essential for VP35 functions. Affinity-purification 26 MS followed by post-translational modification (PTM) analysis predicted phosphorylation of 27 Ser129. Co-immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and biochemical characterization studies 28 revealed a moderately decreased capacity of VP35-S129A to oligomerize. Functional analysis 29 showed that Ser-to-Ala substitution of Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 did not affect IFN inhibitory 30 activity but nearly abolished EBOV minigenome activity. Further coimmunoprecipitation studies 31 demonstrated a lost interaction between VP35-S129A and the amino terminus of the viral 32 polymerase but not between viral nucleoprotein (NP) or VP35-WT.

Although nucleos(t)ide analogs inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase are clinically available as anti-HBV agents, emergence of drug-resistant viruses highlights the need for new anti-HBV agents interfering with other targets. Here we report that cyclosporin A (CsA) can inhibit HBV entry into cultured hepatocytes. The anti-HBV effect of CsA was independent of binding to cyclophilin and calcineurin. Rather, blockade of HBV infection correlated with the ability to inhibit the transporter activity of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). We also found that HBV infection-susceptible cells, differentiated HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes expressed NTCP, while nonsusceptible cell lines did not. A series of compounds targeting NTCP could inhibit HBV infection. CsA inhibited the binding between NTCP and large envelope protein in vitro. Evaluation of CsA analogs identified a compound with higher anti-HBV potency, having a median inhibitory concentration <0.2 lM.

Lactating, crossbred beef cows (n = 127 at ENREC; n = 56 at PREC) with summer-born calves were used from November to April. Treatments were (1) drylot feeding or (2) cornstalk grazing with supplementation. Dry-lot pairs were limit fed a crop residue and distillersbased diet to meet energy requirements of a lactating cow. A dried distillers grain-based pellet was supplemented to pairs on cornstalks at a rate of 2.4 kg of DM/pair daily. Dry-lot cow-calf pairs were limit fed 12.1 kg of DM/d throughout the trial. Results and Discussion: At ENREC, cows wintered on cornstalks lost BW and had a 0.46-unit decrease in BCS (P < 0.01), whereas cows in the dry-lot gained BW and had a 0.24-unit increase in BCS.

Principal Findings: Trust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (b = 0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (b = 0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (b = 0.19 and b = 0.23, respectively).

The molecular mechanisms regulating the fate of the initial immune response to infection, either as a protective response or as detrimental immunopathology, are not well understood. The purinergic receptor P2X7 is an ionotropic nucleotide-gated ion channel receptor expressed on immune cells that has been implicated in induction and maintenance of excessive inflammation. Here, we analyze the role of this receptor in a mouse model of influenza virus infection using a receptor knockout (KO) mouse strain. Our results demonstrate that the absence of the P2X7 receptor results in a better outcome to influenza virus infection characterized by reduced weight loss and increased survival upon experimental influenza challenge compared to wild-type mice. This effect was not virus strain specific. Overall lung pathology and apoptosis were reduced in virusinfected KO mice. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425), and CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) was also reduced in the lungs of the infected KO mice. Infiltration of neutrophils and depletion of CD11b \u03e9 macrophages, characteristic of severe influenza virus infection in mice, were lower in the KO animals. Together, these results demonstrate that activation of the P2X7 receptor is involved in the exacerbated immune response observed during influenza virus infection. IMPORTANCE A hallmark of influenza virus infection is the development of lung pathology induced by an exacerbated immune response. The mechanisms shared by the antiviral host defense required for viral clearance and those required for development of immunopathology are not clearly understood. Purinergic receptors, and in particular the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7r), are involved in activation of the immune response. We used mice lacking the P2X7r (P2X7r KO mice) to better understand the mechanisms that lead to development of lung pathology during influenza virus infection. In our studies, we observed that P2X7r KO mice developed less lung immunopathology and had better survival than the wild-type mice. These results implicate P2X7r in the induction of an exacerbated local immune response to influenza virus and help us to better understand the mechanisms leading to the lung immunopathology observed during severe viral infections.

The software determined more than 100 candidate probe pairs per dataset, from more than 300 16S rRNA sequences, in less than 5 min. Results demonstrated how ORMA improved the performance of the LDR assay on cyanobacteria, correctly identifying 12 out of 14 samples, and allowed the perfect discrimination among the 13 milk pathogenic-related species.

This host shutoff phenotype is orchestrated by the viral SOX protein, yet its functional significance to the viral lifecycle has not been elucidated, in part due to the multifunctional nature of SOX. Using an unbiased mutagenesis screen of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) SOX homolog, we isolated a single amino acid point mutant that is selectively defective in host shutoff activity. Incorporation of this mutation into MHV68 yielded a virus with significantly reduced capacity for mRNA turnover. Unexpectedly, the MHV68 mutant showed little defect during the acute replication phase in the mouse lung. Instead, the virus exhibited attenuation at later stages of in vivo infections suggestive of defects in both trafficking and latency establishment. Specifically, mice intranasally infected with the host shutoff mutant accumulated to lower levels at 10 days post infection in the lymph nodes, failed to develop splenomegaly, and exhibited reduced viral DNA levels and a lower frequency of latently infected splenocytes. Decreased latency establishment was also observed upon infection via the intraperitoneal route.

Here, we report our findings of a head-to-head comparison of two viral vectors modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and a novel replication-competent modified vaccinia Tian Tan (MVTT) for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) via intramuscular and mucosal vaccinations in mice. MVTT is an attenuated variant of the wild-type VTT, which was historically used as a smallpox vaccine for millions of Chinese people. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV was used as the test antigen after the S gene was constructed in the identical genomic location of two vectors to generate vaccine candidates MVTT-S and MVA-S. Using identical doses, MVTT-S induced lower levels (,2-3-fold) of anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) than MVA-S through intramuscular inoculation. MVTT-S, however, was capable of inducing consistently 20-to-100-fold higher levels of Nabs than MVA-S when inoculated via either intranasal or intraoral routes. These levels of MVTT-S-induced Nab responses were substantially (,10-fold) higher than that induced via the intramuscular route in the same experiments. Moreover, pre-exposure to the wild-type VTT via intranasal or intraoral route impaired the Nab response via the same routes of MVTT-S vaccination probably due to the pre-existing anti-VTT Nab response. The efficacy of intranasal or intraoral vaccination, however, was still 20-to-50-fold better than intramuscular inoculation despite the subcutaneous pre-exposure to wild-type VTT. Our data have implications for people who maintain low levels of anti-VTT Nabs after historical smallpox vaccination.

Although vaccines provide the most effective means for preventing infectious diseases, there are two main reasons why it is often difficult to reach a socially optimal level of vaccine coverage: (i) the emergence of operational issues (such as yield uncertainty) on the supply side, and (ii) the existence of negative network effects on the consumption side. In particular, uncertainties about production yield and vaccine imperfections often make manufacturing some vaccines a risky process and may lead the manufacturer to produce below the socially optimal level. At the same time, negative network effects provide incentives to potential consumers to free ride off the immunity of the vaccinated population. In this research, we consider how a central policy-maker can induce a socially optimal vaccine coverage through the use of incentives to both consumers and the vaccine manufacturer.

Cells with basal N-myc, on the other hand, were less susceptible to virus-induced oncolysis and established a robust IFN-mediated antiviral state. The same effects were also observed in NB cell lines with and without N-myc amplification. Microarray analysis showed that N-myc overexpression in TET-21N cells downregulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with known antiviral functions. Furthermore, virus infection caused significant changes in global gene expression in TET-21N cells overexpressing N-myc. Such changes involved ISGs with various functions. Therefore, the present study showed that augmented susceptibility to VSV\u0394M51 by N-myc at least involves downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions and alleviation of the IFNstimulated antiviral state.

Furthermore, although it is known that MSCs pre-treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines show enhanced anti-inflammatory properties via the secretion of soluble factors, the underlying mechanisms of IBD remain unclear.

Abstract | Viruses are fully reliant on the translation machinery of their host cells to produce the polypeptides that are essential for viral replication. Consequently, viruses recruit host ribosomes to translate viral mRNAs, typically using virally encoded functions to seize control of cellular translation factors and the host signalling pathways that regulate their activity. This not only ensures that viral proteins will be produced, but also stifles innate host defences that are aimed at inhibiting the capacity of infected cells for protein synthesis. Remarkably, nearly every step of the translation process can be targeted by virally encoded functions.

The method is used to examine the similarity of different sequences by calculating the distances between them, which the main difference from previous method is the way to map the original time series to symbolic sequences. Here we make use of the state space reconstruction to construct the symbolic sequences and quantify the similarity of different stock markets and exchange rate markets considering the chaotic behavior between the complex time series. And we compare the results of similarity of artificial and real data using the modified method, information categorization method and system clustering method. We conclude that the reconstructed phase space information clustering method is effective to research the close relationship in time series and for short time series especially. Besides, we report the results of similarity of different exchange rate time series in different periods and find the effect of the exchange rate regime in 2008 on the time series.

Automatic thesaurus construction based on patterns was first suggested by Hearst [1], but it is still not clear how to automatically construct such patterns for different semantic relations and domains. In particular it is not certain which patterns are useful for capturing synonymy. The assumption of extant resources such as parsers is also a limiting factor for many languages, so it is desirable to find patterns that do not use syntactical analysis. Finally to give a more consistent and applicable result it is desirable to use these patterns to form synonym sets in a sound way. We present a method that automatically generates regular expression patterns by expanding seed patterns in a heuristic search and then develops a feature vector based on the occurrence of term pairs in each developed pattern. This allows for a binary classifications of term pairs as synonymous or non-synonymous. We then model this result as a probability graph to find synonym sets, which is equivalent to the well-studied problem of finding an optimal set cover. We achieved 73.2% precision and 29.7% recall by our method, out-performing hand-made resources such as MeSH and Wikipedia. We conclude that automatic methods can play a practical role in developing new thesauri or expanding on existing ones, and this can be done with only a small amount of training data and no need for resources such as parsers.

The clinical data of 34 cases with severe pneumonia were collected. According to the clinical outcome, the patients were divided into a survival group (n=26) and a fatality group (n=8). Various factors, including the blood lactic acid level, oxygenation index, CRP level and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, were retrospectively analyzed in order to investigate whether these values had clinical significance for the prognosis of the patients. No statistically significant differences with regard to age, gender, initial concentrations of blood lactic acid and CRP, and APACHE II scores were observed between the two groups at admission to the Intensive Care Unit. However, the blood lactic acid levels were found to decrease to a normal level within 12-24 h after treatment in the survival group, while the levels were maintained at a higher concentration in the fatality group, even at 72 h after treatment (P<0.05). Furthermore, the oxygenation index in the survival group was significantly higher when compared with that in the fatality group. The oxygenation index was maintained at a normal level in the survival group, while the oxygenation index levels were below normal and continued to decline in the fatality group. A positive correlation was observed between the blood lactic acid level and the APACHE II scores (r=0.656, P<0.05).

The viruses cause acute gastroenteritis and may lead to death. Presently, no effective vaccine or selective drugs accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are available for the treatment of norovirus. Advances in the development of norovirus replicon cell lines, GII.4-Sydney HuNoV strain human B cells, and murine and gnotobiotic pig norovirus models have facilitated the discovery of effective small molecule inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Areas covered-This review gives a brief discussion of the biology and replication of norovirus before highlighting the discovery of anti-norovirus molecules. The article coverage includes: an overview of the current state of norovirus drug discovery, the targeting of the norovirus life cycle, the inhibition of structural and nonstructural proteins of norovirus such as proteases and polymerase, and the blockage of virus entry into host cells. Finally, anti-norovirus drugs in the clinical development stage are described. Expert opinion-The current approach for the counteraction of norovirus focuses on the inhibition of viral RNA polymerase, norovirus 3C-like protease and the structural proteins VP1 as well as the blockade of norovirus entry. Broad-spectrum anti-norovirus molecules, based on the inhibition of 3C-like protease, have been developed. Other host factors and ways to overcome the development of resistance through mutation are also being examined. A dual approach in targeting viral and host factors may lead to an effective counteraction of norovirus infection. Current successes in developing norovirus replicon harboring cells and norovirus infected human cells, as well as murine norovirus models and other animal models such as piglets have facilitated the discovery of effective drugs and helped our understanding of its mechanism of action.", "output": "Current Tools for Norovirus Drug Discovery HHS Public Access", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Following extensive consultation, they were published in January 2001. 1 These guidelines describe the precautions healthcare workers should take in three areas: standard principles for preventing HCAI, which include hospital environmental hygiene, hand hygiene, the use of personal protective equipment, and the safe use and disposal of sharps; preventing infections associated with the use of short-term indwelling urethral catheters; and preventing infections associated with central venous catheters. The evidence for these guidelines was identified by multiple systematic reviews of experimental and nonexperimental research and expert opinion as reflected in systematically identified professional, national and international guidelines, which were formally assessed by a validated appraisal process. In 2003, we developed complementary national guidelines for preventing HCAI in primary and community care on behalf of the National Collaborating Centre for Nursing and Supportive Care (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence). 2 A cardinal feature of evidence-based guidelines is that they are subject to timely review in order that new research evidence and technological advances can be identified, appraised and, if shown to be effective in preventing HCAI, incorporated into amended guidelines. Periodically updating the evidence base and guideline recommendations is essential in order to maintain their validity and authority. Consequently, the DH commissioned a review of new evidence published following the last systematic reviews.

Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5 o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure. In this single centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased blood T cell counts. Older age, male, fever over 38.5 o C, symptoms of dyspnoea, and underlying comorbidity, were the risk factors most associated with severity of disease. Patients.

Recently, it was discovered that bovine neutrophils and macrophages produce extracellular traps in response to Mannheimia haemolytica, another member of the bovine respiratory disease complex. In this study, we demonstrate that H. somni also causes extracellular trap production by bovine neutrophils in a dose-and time-dependent manner, which did not coincide with the release of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker for necrosis. Neutrophil extracellular traps were produced in response to outer membrane vesicles, but not lipooligosacchride alone. Using scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy, we observed H. somni cells trapped within a web-like structure. Further analyses demonstrated that bovine neutrophils trapped and killed H. somni in a DNA-dependent manner. Treatment of DNA extracellular traps with DNase I freed H. somni cells and diminished bacterial death.

Stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) belong to a novel family of cellular structures collectively known as mRNA silencing foci that harbour repressed mRNAs and their associated proteins. SGs and PBs are highly dynamic and they form upon stress and dissolve thus releasing the repressed mRNAs according to changes in cell physiology. In addition, aggregates containing abnormal proteins are frequent in neurodegenerative disorders. In spite of the growing relevance of these supramolecular aggregates to diverse cellular functions a reliable automated tool for their systematic analysis is lacking. Here we report a MATLAB Script termed BUHO for the high-throughput image analysis of cellular foci. We used BUHO to assess the number, size and distribution of distinct objects with minimal deviation from manually obtained parameters. BUHO successfully addressed the induction of both SGs and PBs in mammalian and insect cells exposed to different stress stimuli. We also used BUHO to assess the dynamics of specific mRNA-silencing foci termed Smaug 1 foci (S-foci) in primary neurons upon synaptic stimulation. Finally, we used BUHO to analyze the role of candidate genes on SG formation in an RNAi-based experiment. We found that FAK56D, GCN2 and PP1 govern SG formation. The role of PP1 is conserved in mammalian cells as judged by the effect of the PP1 inhibitor salubrinal, and involves dephosphorylation of the translation factor eIF2a. All these experiments were analyzed manually and by BUHO and the results differed in less than 5% of the average value. The automated analysis by this user-friendly method will allow high-throughput image processing in short times by providing a robust, flexible and reliable alternative to the laborious and sometimes unfeasible visual scrutiny.

However, few studies have compared different reassortant combinations in pseudoparticle systems, or compared entry kinetics of native viruses and their pseudotyped analogs. Here, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirions displaying distinct influenza virus envelope proteins were tested for fusion activity. We produced VSV pseudotypes containing the prototypical X-31 (H3) HA, either alone or with strain-matched or mismatched N2 NAs. We performed single-particle fusion assays using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to compare hemifusion kinetics among these pairings. Results illustrate that matching pseudoparticles behaved very similarly to native virus. Pseudoparticles harboring mismatched HA-NA pairings fuse at significantly slower rates than native virus, and NA-lacking pseudoparticles exhibiting the slowest fusion rates. Relative viral membrane HA density of matching pseudoparticles was higher than in mismatching or NA-lacking pseudoparticles. An equivalent trend of HA expression level on cell membranes of HA/NA co-transfected cells was observed and intracellular trafficking of HA was affected by NA co-expression. Overall, we show that specific influenza HA-NA combinations can profoundly affect the critical role played by HA during entry, which may factor into viral fitness and the emergence of new pandemic influenza viruses.", "output": "Viral fusion efficacy of specific H3N2 influenza virus reassortant combinations at single-particle level", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

However, the development of novel but still conventional systemic antimicrobial agents, having only a single mode or site of action, will not alleviate the situation because it is probably only a matter of time until any such agents will also become ineffective. To continue to produce new agents based on this notion is unacceptable, and there is an increasing need for alternative approaches to the problem. By contrast, light-activated molecules called photoantimicrobials act locally via the in-situ production of highly reactive oxygen species, which simultaneously attack various biomolecular sites in the pathogenic target and therefore offer both multiple and variable sites of action. This non-specificity at the target circumvents conventional mechanisms of resistance and inhibits the development of resistance to the agents themselves. Photoantimicrobial therapy is safe and easy to implement and, unlike conventional agents, the activity spectrum of photoantimicrobials covers bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. However, clinical trials of these new, truly broad-spectrum, and minimally toxic agents have been few, and the funding for research and development is almost non-existent. Photoantimicrobials constitute one of the few ways forward through the morass of drug-resistant infectious disease and should be fully explored. In this Personal View, we raise awareness of the novel photoantimicrobial technologies that offer a viable alternative to conventional drugs in many relevant application fields, and could thus slow the pace of resistance development. The original report 11 concerning a photoantimicrobial effect was published in 1900, when Raab showed the inactivation of Paramecium caudatum when exposed to the dyes acridine or eosin and then illuminated with sunlight. Raab's supervisors, von Tappeiner and Jesionek, applied this approach to tumour cells and reported their results in 1905. 12 Thus, both the antimicrobial and anticancer approaches of photodynamic therapy have been known for more than a century. Anticancer photodynamic therapy is now a clinical reality in hospitals and dermatology clinics worldwide, including for the treatment of actinic keratosis and basal Wainwright et al.

Most existing inference methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate them. In contrast, the so-called plugand-play methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification. Our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological and ecological systems.", "output": "Plug-and-play inference for disease dynamics: measles in large and small populations as a case study", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Effective respiratory hygiene in the ED is imperative to limit the spread of dangerous respiratory pathogens, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and bioterrorism agents, particularly given that these agents may not be immediately identifiable. Sustaining effective respiratory control measures is especially challenging in the ED because of patient crowding, inadequate staffing and resources, and ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients. Threat of contagion exists not only for ED patients but also for visitors, health care workers, and inpatient populations. Potential physical sites for respiratory disease transmission extend from out-of-hospital care, to triage, waiting room, ED treatment area, and the hospital at large. This article presents a summary of the most current information available in the literature about respiratory hygiene in the ED, including administrative, patient, and legal issues. Wherever possible, specific recommendations and references to practical information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are provided. The ''Administrative Issues'' section describes coordination with public health departments, procedures for effective facility planning, and measures for health care worker protection (education, staffing optimization, and vaccination). The patient care section addresses the potentially infected ED patient, including emergency medical services concerns, triage planning, and patient transport. ''Legal Issues'' discusses the interplay between public safety and patient privacy. Emergency physicians play a critical role in early identification, treatment, and containment of potentially lethal respiratory pathogens. This brief synopsis should help clinicians and administrators understand, develop, and implement appropriate policies and procedures to address respiratory hygiene in the ED.", "output": "Respiratory Hygiene in the Emergency Department C L I N I C A L", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

To asses the risk factor related to clinical material, climatic condition and type of RT-PCR applied, cloacal swabs (CS), faeces, sera, bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus (TH) and spleen (SP) and ileumcaeca region were collected from 30-day-old poults suffering of enteritis episode characterized as poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS). The PEMS clinical features were characterized by watery to foamy faeces, light brown-yellow in colour and low mortality rate. Meteorological data (rainfall and relative humidity) observed during along the study presented monthly average temperature ranging from 39.3 and 31.2\u00baC, precipitation in rainy season from 40 to 270.3 mm/month, and no rain during dry season. Simplex RT-PCR gave odds ratio (OR) values suggesting that ileum-caeca region is at higher chance (OR=1.9; p=0.9741) to have both viral RNA than faeces (OR=1.5; p=0.7319). However, multiplex RT-PCR showed 3.98 (p=0.89982) more chance to give positive results in faeces than CS at dry season. The major risk factors seem to be low rate of humidity and high temperatures at winter, probably responsible for spread, easily, the TCoV and TAstv-2 among the flocks. The positive results of both virus suggested that they can play an important role in enteric disorders, associated to low humidity and high temperatures frequently found in tropical countries.", "output": "EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF ASTROVIRUS AND CORONAVIRUS IN POULTS IN THE SOUTH EASTERN REGION OF BRAZIL", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

In this review, we focus on S-palmitoylation of proteins, which are crucial for the interactions of pathogenic bacteria and viruses with the host. We discuss the role of palmitoylated proteins in the invasion of host cells by bacteria and viruses, and those involved in the host responses to the infection. We highlight recent data on protein S-palmitoylation in pathogens and their hosts obtained owing to the development of methods based on click chemistry and acyl-biotin exchange allowing proteomic analysis of protein lipidation.

The limitations of this approach were recognized in 1 acute health care organization that led to the development of an Infection Control Continuous Quality Improvement tool. Methods: The Pronovost cycle, Barriers and Mitigation tool, and Hexagon framework were used to review the existing monitoring system and develop a quality improvement data collection tool that considered the context of care delivery. Results: Barriers and opportunities for improvement including ambiguity, consistency and feasibility of expectations, the environment, knowledge, and education were combined in a monitoring tool that was piloted and modified in response to feedback. Local adaptations enabled staff to prioritize and monitor issues important in their own workplace. The tool replaced the previous system and was positively evaluated by auditors. Challenges included ensuring staff had time to train in use of the tool, time to collect the audit, and the reporting of low scores that conflicted with a target-based performance system. Conclusions: Hand hygiene compliance monitoring alone misses other important aspects of infection control compliance. A continuous quality improvement tool was developed reflecting specific organizational needs that could be transferred or adapted to other organizations.", "output": "Moving beyond hand hygiene monitoring as a marker of infection prevention performance: Development of a tailored infection control continuous quality improvement tool", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}]
