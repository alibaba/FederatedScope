[{"instruction": "Read the given story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.", "input": "I had decided to go spend my wife's birthday at an all inclusive resort. It was a great time to go because it was the dry season in Central America. We went with her family. I enjoyed going there because it was the first time that I went to one. What I enjoyed the most was that I could go to the buffet line and get all the food that I wanted. I didn't have to worry about tipping or ordering something off the menu. I also enjoyed the open bars. I had alot of different cocktails that I didn't know about before. I got to fill my satisfaction in that area. I also enjoyed the pool area where the entertainment possibilities were endless. Later at night we went to the night entertainment. There were several dance routines and comedy routines. There was a cocktail bar there as well so that I could enjoy my drinks in different areas. I didn't get to go to the night party but my wife did. The rest of the time there was spent doing the same things for the next couple of days.", "output": "recalled", "category": "Text Categorization 1478.json"}, {"instruction": "Read the given story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'.

She is so beautiful and she means the world to me. We like to play in front of our house often. One day I was out in the yard watching her play. She was jumping rope and having a good time. She didn't have a care in the world. It was just a normal day. The next thing I knew I heard a loud bang down the street. A little girl had just been hit by a vehicle. I was terrified. I ran down the street as fast as I could. I ran over to her to check on her. She was bleeding. I called emergency services on my phone. I told them what was happening and they needed to hurry about as fast as they could. They got their and took the girl off to the hospital.", "output": "imagined", "category": "Text Categorization 1478.json"}]
