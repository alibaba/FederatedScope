The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.", "input": "Sentence: Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't convince him.\n Reason: The 'he' refers to sid because Because Sid was explaining to Mark but Sid couldn't convince Mark. \n Question: Is the above reasoning correct or wrong?
