My parents just got divorced, and are currently living at separate addresses. I wrote two pages to my dad about how much he\u2019s taught me, how I\u2019m who I am to him, everything you would expect. I had some friends and even my favorite teachers to read over it to make sure it was perfect, and I ended up making My english and anatomy teacher well up, along with a few classmates cry. I poured my absolute heart into this letter. I turned it in with confidence that I said what I wanted my dad to know. After all, I love him to death.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: I didn\u2019t write anything for my mom. I didn\u2019t want to. I couldn\u2019t stretch to write a paragraph, much less a page. I wouldn\u2019t budge to fake it, or write some generic garbage as a nice gesture. I don\u2019t know if it was bitterness, spite, or just negative parts of our relationship taking focus of anything I was thankful for.\n\n My dad received his letter Thanksgiving day, and he loved it. He asked if he could show his friends how great his son was and whatnot. My mom didn\u2019t get anything that day. To be fair, she doesn\u2019t even know about the letter and she doesn\u2019t know that I couldn\u2019t write half a page of nice things about her. However, she loves me and I don\u2019t think It\u2019s fair that I silently resent her. I feel like I\u2019m the only one in the family that she really has right now, and she probably needs someone to love her right now.\n\nAITA?\n\n", "output": "not answerable", "category": "Ethics Classification 1130.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, judge whether or not a specific person is wrong here.

She was first turned onto this by the \u201cMommy Group\u201d at her church.\n\nHer church/religious background: my friend was raised in a cult and unfortunately bears the scars of someone introduced to ultra-extreme conservativism at a young age. Even though she fled the cult, she gravitated to a man who made her join his religion to be with him (publicly, I might add as they\u2019d been sleeping together for a while). She gave up dreams to be a doctor for this guy and dropped out of college and used her college savings on a wedding.\n\nAlthough I was sad about this, and even a down right bitch at times, I\u2019ve learned that friendship is about staying supportive through the hurdles. We\u2019ve had gaps in our friendship before from fights that devastated us and it would be too difficult to do this again.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nThe church has \u201cElders\u201d who manage the church. Enter 7 nondescript aging white guys. The \u201cElders\u201d (not kidding, that\u2019s their name), have women and male groups split up and it\u2019s clear that while the men talk business and the future of the church, the women have been overcome by anti-vaccine propaganda. It\u2019s very clear that the \u201cElders\u201d are not involved nor concerned about the stuff in the women\u2019s group, and I really don\u2019t think they know the levels of insanity this group is at right now. \n\nI\u2019m so so tempted to write to the pastor, as my friend (who is very young and impressionable) really doesn\u2019t do anything her pastor won\u2019t tell her to do. She would be personally offended if I said anything to her about her kids. As much as I\u2019m disappointed in my friend, I\u2019m mostly pissed off at the mommy group for brainwashing the young moms. My friend went through post pardum depression and I feel like they knew how to exactly sink their claws into her when she was so vulnerable. \n\nHer kids are truly wonderful and I get upset every time I see a kid with measles because it\u2019s so preventable. A ton of moms now don\u2019t vaccinate and they work together on getting paperwork finalized for religious exemption or they pull their kids from school to home school them. \n\nI worry for her and her beautiful family, but I really want to give a fucking wake up call to the pastor who does not have any idea this is being taught in his church.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m obsessing or being controlling, and I can handle the honest truth as this has been on my mind for some time. I unfortunately grew up ultra religious and I know the pain that comes from that may make me more upset than the average person. \n\nTL;DR: friend\u2019s church has a mommy group that is teaching anti-vaccine propaganda to young, new moms without the churches knowledge. I would like to write an anonymous letter to their pastor to tell him about the uprising of anti-vaxx propaganda from their women\u2019s group.\n\nHoping for clarity ", "output": "answerable", "category": "Ethics Classification 1130.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, judge whether or not a specific person is wrong here.

She tried to arrange having me come to her sister's wedding afterparty, but due to logistics and everything it wasn't completely guaranteed that it would happen.

In addition, I knew absolutely no one at this wedding, so you can imagine how that would give me some anxiety. \n\nWhen I arrive, it's past 9:30, the dancing seems to have peaked, with the first guests starting to leave. Everyone is quite drunk, I tend to shy away from tons of alcohol. The girl I'm dating seems drunk asks me to bring her a drink, which I do. She then asks me to bring her a drink two more times, after I say things like \"you sure?\". I'm feeling a little strange since I've never seen her drunk before and she's behaving quite differently. In addition, I've had some really shitty past experiences with an ex who was borderline verbally abusive to me when drunk, and I just wasn't feeling it that night. \n\n I spend about an hour dancing with the family, bride, and whoever else hasn't left yet, and then I tell her I'm thinking of heading home for the night soon. She straight up tells me I can't leave, and that she will get really upset if I do. She then asks me to do some random tasks which I do, like moving wedding supplies into the car and trying to stop the dance floor from dying out. I try to leave a few more times, but she makes it clear that it's going to be really bad if I leave. I end up leaving at around 1:30am. \n\nThe next day I told her that it was weird of her to force me to stay when I wasn't having a good time, and that she should be fine without me there since all her friends and family are gathered at the wedding, whereas I knew no one and it was a weird atmosphere to meet the family.

We've been married about 8 years. More importantly, I don't know what perspective is the healthiest to take on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample: tonight, my wife (47), mother-in-law, son (5) and I (45) are getting ready to have dinner. Like the previous poster, I do enjoy cooking; I like to experiment and hate using recipes. Sometimes, I lose- big time, but usually, I can do a pretty good job of making something delicious and healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, about a year ago, my son (5yr) was diagnosed Celiac, and about 6 months after, I figured out that my 30 year gut problem is an IBS caused by onion, garlic, and all kinds of other foods containing fructans. Those foods containing gluten (a protein) also have these fructans (a sugar), so wheat, barley, rye- my son and I both get hit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think my problem goes beyond serious, explosive, burning, toilet discomfort for a couple days, but my son truly will have problems if he ingests more than a sugar packet's worth of gluten in a year (put your knife in peanut butter, wipe it on your 'regular' bread, go back to the peanut butter jar with the knife, guess what's now in the peanut butter- whatever kind of bread you spread it on next).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, as soon as I found out about my son's celiac, I cleaned the house of gluten. Anything remotely suspect, I put in boxes intending to give away. Wife came home; within an hour most everything was back on the shelves. Perhaps I over-reacted, I'm not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward about 8 months. We now often just prepare three meals for dinner. My son, being five, well he'd likely get his own meal in any case, not just because the gluten thing, but also, he's five.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife though, she insists on buying both regular and gluten-free, well just about everything.  So, we have gluten, and gluten-free peanut butter, gluten and gluten-free butter, gluten and gluten-free breads. Still gotta use the same toaster and all though. She made pizzas the other day using her bread-maker. One gluten-free pizza for the boy and I, a 'regular' one for her and our guests. Using the same bread-maker she'd been using for years. A sugar packet's worth of the gluten molecule, remember. But maybe I'm over-reacting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway- things are settling to where I cook meals and my wife does dishes/cleanup (I hate dishes- hate it- and I do it 'wrong' anyway too often). She'll still make meals occasionally too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my wife has a thing with beef- I can't pin down her reason though, because it often changes. For years, the reason was that cows produce methane, take up too many resources, bad for environment, etc. But then I pointed out her milk drinking habit, and the fact that there were more buffalo in North America before the slaughter than there are cows now, and that they share a similar physiology, etc. So now her reason seems to have switched to that it 'makes her feel bad'. Though I still hear the environmental piece from time to time. She has no problem with other meats- birds, pigs, fish, not much a fan of lamb or goat though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she'll eat the beef pot pies her mother makes. And she'll eat beef other times at her parents' house, or at other's houses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo tonight, I go to make dinner for myself, my wife and my mother-in-law.  I decided to season some ground bison (having this onion/garlic thing, I've got to create all my own seasonings from scratch- EVERY seasoning mix has onion or garlic powder). Then I put it over rice and made a tomato-cucumber-corn salsa to put over top of that (because, again- I defy you to go find a salsa without onions or garlic).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it's good- it's really, really good. But my wife won't have any of it. Because I used the bison ground beef. She said last time she tried it, she had too much and it made her feel bad.  So instead, we just get in each other's way in our cramped kitchen while she prepares an entirely different meal using nothing I had prepared tonight except the rice. The meal she decided to have was my leftover veal-tomato-sweet potato crock pot disaster that I don't intend to have another bite of myself, I'm so disappointed with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any case, when the meal was over, my mother-in-law said, 'Thanks, that was good.'. And I said, 'Thanks, I'm glad somebody enjoyed it.\" My wife said, \"You didn't like it?\" I said, \"No, it was great!\".  She again said something about how last time she tried the bison she, 'Didn't feel good'. Then she proceeds to take another bite of the vegetables she'd picked out of the crock pot veal leftovers. Knowing full well that veal is cow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis kind of behavior, is regular. When she makes me salads with the bitter, yucky plant leaves I just don't like, I eat them. I might complain a little, but I don't just make my own meal instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo folks, AITA for sitting here feeling bad because I live in a family that has to have three separate meals on a regular basis? Is this any different than the previous poster's situation with his fiance? Should I do more to cater to her choices of food items, when my son and I have diagnosed medical problems associated with foods that she refuses to adapt her own eating and grocery habits to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease ask for clarifications if you need them- I'm not looking for validation here- I really don't know if I'm an asshole or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR- Wife prefers not to eat beef. I make family meals and will use bison or beef (usually bison if I can find it) maybe once a week or every other week, but my wife won't eat it and just makes her own meal instead. My son and I have diagnosed/medical food issues, but she brings the offending foods home anyway.

Anyway curiosity got the best of me and I found the Facebook.  The most recent activity was while we were dating and it was one of her older pics on IG uploaded with some caption I knew my gf wouldn't write. Well I brought it up to my gf and she said her mom has the account and looks on there. She's known of this and let it happen.  I told her it wasn't okay and made me uncomfortable.  I asked to have it deleted but she said she didn't want to fight with her mom over it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understood and let it go.

Despite that, I was always fed and always got gifts on Christmas.  I only recently learned that my mom was putting herself into debt to always make sure my little brother and I had plenty of presents.  I'm thankful for her generosity, but it needs to stop.  At this rate, she's going to die in debt.\n\nShe's always bought for all my cousins, too.  And since my first cousins are having more and more kids, the number of people she wants to buy for keeps increasing.  I've pleaded with her for the past few years to just not buy gifts, trying to convince her that holiday shopping is not obligatory, that the kids all have plenty of toys and games already, that my brother and I don't need anything, and that that money would be of so much more use going towards future expenses.  She never listens though...saying that she needs to because my first cousins have always bought gifts for my brother and I, and that it will make her happy to buy the gifts/sad to not buy the gifts.\n\nI should add that I'm 2.5 years out of college, and I have a decent job (65k+ in an area with relatively low cost of living).  Ever since getting this job, I've helped my mother financially as much as possible. She works at a school and doesn't get paid when the kids are on break, and I fully support her during those times.  I bought her a car and pay for all maintenance and sometimes gas.  I help her at random times when she won't be able to make ends meet in a given month. I've bought Christmas and birthday gifts, and I buy my brother things he wants and needs in her stead. I intend to pay off her credit cards over the coming few years.\n\nI could buy all the gifts, but I just don't think it's necessary,  especially when I'd rather put it toward helping my mom and doing things with the people I would be buying for.  I take my brother to concerts and I'm taking the oldest cousin-once-removed skydiving next year.  I'd rather do more things like that and buy gifts that matter at some point in the future than add to their piles of stuff. In my family, the Aunts and Uncles all buy the kids cheaper things, and their ideas for gifts come from the parents telling them \"so-and-so needs an xmas idea\" and passing whatever they said along.

Whenever I smell smoke wafting up into my suite I simply close my patio door or bedroom window and it prevents stinking up my suite.\n\nThe incident \nI was assembling IKEA furniture at 5PM. I hear a ton of banging on the floor. I adjust to work more quietly and finish entirely within 20 minutes. \n\nThe fallout \nThe next day I come home to a mild smell of cigarette smoke in the entrance to my apartment. I see an envelope on the floor under my doors mail slot, and when I pick it up it reeks of cigarette smoke. I open it and read a strongly word letter from the tenant downstairs, complaining of loud banging at 5PM the day before, threatening to contact the tenancy board and pursue further action of this nature. I put the letter in a zip lock to contain the smell. My apartment smells nice and my air freshener doesn\u2019t need competition. \n\nMy take \nThis dude is over sensitive to noise, irritable in general and gross. I wait on it a few days and think on how to respond.\n\nI decided:\n- I really don\u2019t want to interact with this person. It will be very very unpleasant between the predictable stink and the likelihood of a unpleasant exchange. \n- instead, after a week, I wrote a note to the landlord saying I normally ignore the eccentric irritability of the person downstairs but now that they are leaving stinky letters in my entrance I have to address it. \n- I included the stinky letter in the ziplock bag for the landlord to read and presumably smell.\n- I told the landlord I will be ignoring this tenant going forward as best I can. I also mentioned that my neighbour to my right has never complained of noise and even told me he likes living next to me because I\u2019m not loud or obnoxious and as a bonus I\u2019m not a smoker.\n- my call to action with the landlord was that he simply ask the tenant downstairs to be more tolerant of noise during daytime hours and to cease putting anything in my mail slot.\n\nJudge me \n\nAm I the asshole for:\n- avoiding the tenant downstairs entirely and just tattling to the landlord\n- avoiding conflict not because I\u2019m afraid but because I just genuinely think the tenant downstairs is stinky and passive aggressive and his letter gave me all the insight I needed on both.

She and I were sitting in some chairs perusing a book or two - it was quite busy as it was a rainy weekend. I got done looking at my book and wandered off to find something else to look at. About ten minutes later I notice another seat in the 4 chair circle is open so I grab something and head back.\n\nWhen I got to the seat there were four books in the chair (all three other seats were taken). I leaned over to pick up the books and my wife says \u201chey I think the guy sitting there was saving the seat\u201d, but I was like meh whatevs, no one pays to sit here so I picked up the books and set them on the table and sat down.\n\nWithin 30 seconds the guy (we\u2019ll call him book guy or bg) shows up and the following conversation ensues:\n\nBG: hey man I was sitting there. Me: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m pretty sure these seats are public use. When I got up earlier someone else sat where I was and I waited for another seat to open.

Answer 'not answerable' if more information is required and 'answerable' if all the information is sufficient to answer who is wrong in this situation.", "input": "I'm gay and around March last year began getting close with a bisexual friend of mine. By 'close' I mean platonically so. I did have feelings for him but he didn't feel the same way. We spent a lot of time together, spoke a lot, and seemed to think very highly of each other. \n\nI got a big red flag when he tried to make out with me at a party we were both at. This wasn't uncommon behaviour for him, but I took issue with it being directed at me. I forgave him -- he was drunk, after all -- but asked him not to do it again because it was messing with my feelings a little bit. He tried it twice more on two separate occasions before I finally decided I needed some space to deal with my feelings properly. The decision to distance myself was a complicated one; I knew our mutual friends were fed up with him and were on the brink of ditching him, but at the same time I felt suffocated in the relationship and wanted that to end. The problem was that he would be completely alone (he didn't have much of a family at the time) and I didn't want that for him. Nonetheless, I chose to distance myself anyway and made it clear why. I thought that the least helpful thing would be to freeze him out without explanation and that knowing would perhaps make things easier to process. \n\nThis lasted for a week. It turned out we were, once again, both present at the same house party. I avoided talking to him and generally stuck to chatting with random people and seeing how it went. Little did I know he was going to try to hang himself in the home-owners garage, or at least that is what it looked like. After seeing him stumble in there, I figured I ought to check on him because I knew there were loads of dangerous tools in rather precarious places and he might knock something over and hurt himself or something. Well, I caught him as I did and we ended up having a long -- rather touchy, on his side of things -- conversation about what was going on. He blamed me for all of it and told me that it was because I'd made him feel guilty. He explained that he loved me, that things could be different if he wasn't afraid of his sexuality, and how he wanted me to promise I wouldn't leave him. Foolishly, I made that promise, if only because I wanted it to make him feel better.\n\nThe next day I spoke to him about it because I couldn't really sleep after seeing him all strung up like that. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help. He said no, but that he would consider the account of everything I'd told him and get back to me. In spite of saying very little about anything else, he told me to discount what he said about loving me. At this point, I just rolled my eyes and waited patiently for a reply that I didn't get. Instead, I heard three different versions of that same story from our mutual friends all over the course of the next month, all which painted me in a bad light. I began to wonder if there was something terrible I'd done but deluded myself into thinking I hadn't. This time I was a little more direct and asked him about it straight up. He then admitted that he was self-harming and blamed it on me, again. From that point onwards I have had recurrent dreams about it and have not been able to absolve my guilt for something which, I can reason now, was not my responsibility. Our mutual friends speculated that he was self-harming, based on something they'd noticed, and I confirmed it for them hoping they'd treat him a little better.\n\nA week later all of our mutual friends had ditched him, and to this day I don't really know why. I can make some educated guesses, but I've never heard any proper explanations. Either way, I thought it was unfair for them to ditch him despite knowing what they did. This meant that I was the only person he really had any more, which wasn't great for me but I accepted that and tried to help. I stayed up night after night to keep him company and, combining that with the guilt of what he'd accused me of, I became very depressed. I gradually isolated myself from everybody but him and neglected the advice of all the friends who told me to stop helping him. I wasn't going to, though, because they were unwilling to give him a second chance and he'd still be all alone. \n\nSuddenly he froze me out and started trying very hard to get back in with these mutual friends again. My poor judgement in isolating myself meant that it was now I who had nobody I was particularly close to anymore and, having become rather unpersonable and irritable in person, nobody was particularly interested in my company. Most of all, I felt betrayed. I'd tried to help him the best I could and after all they'd done to him he was in the process of ditching me in favour of them. I spoke to him about it and he called me selfish for talking about my feelings. I warned him about them -- they'd not only hurt him but countless people in the past, and I think they're pretty callous -- to which he accused me of attempting to manipulate him because, apparently, I wanted control over him. It was at this point I learned that he'd turned to drugs to cope. I told an official trained in pastoral support because I was no longer in a position to help at all and I didn't want to see him running himself into the ground like that. I know it has helped him in the long-run, and it has also meant that his family are looking out for him a lot more now and making sure they're present in his life.\n\nWe argued at this point more than we talked normally. I often got angry and was generally scathing to him in these instances, and he'd accuse me of doing all sorts of heinous things that I wouldn't even dream of doing. Depression worsened and my feelings for him hadn't gone, neither had the guilt or the dreams, and any attempt to talk to him about any of this he took severe issue with. On one occasion I lashed out verbally and, I'm told, really hurt him. I remember that I was not pleasant whatsoever and I take responsibility for that. After this, he nearly hit me at another house party and I decided I'd had enough. He ended up in with our mutual 'friends' -- who, at this point, had ditched me -- and I wondered if I'd been so unreasonably terrible that this was what I deserved. I decided to go see a counsellor from this point onwards.\n\nI hadn't spoken to him in four months and have only recently been in contact with him again. The dreams haven't gone and neither has the guilt, and I've asked him if I can talk to him about it. I understand it might be hard for him to talk about all of that stuff, but I feel that if I can reconcile what happened and understand my place in it all I might be able to sleep properly again. Having asked him, he refused on the basis that I'd try to manipulate him again (not that I see where I did this in the first place) and try to turn him against his friends. I pushed for it and he's finally agreed. I'm asking here if I'm the arsehole in this situation because my current friends all become very shifty when I ask them for advice. I don't want to push him, but I'm at a point in my life where I can't afford to be losing sleep over something I think can be ended like this. \n\nThanks in advance.", "output": "answerable", "category": "Ethics Classification 1130.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, judge whether or not a specific person is wrong here.

During this time I managed to win her back, move back in with her and my son, to then make a mistake and be thrown out again. So I own the place where we both work. It's soley in my name as it was my business. She has helped out, worked with me and my intention was always to make it our business by getting her name on the place too. Well, after all of this happening, she has walked out once on the business before and left me in the shit so to speak, had to employ someone else to take over her role within the company. I moved out, into my friends unoccupied house, then into my own flat. After realising that I can't do everything, I couldn't pay for myself, for my employee, for all her rent, food, bills and all my sons needs, I asked her to come back and work with me. During this time she was working a job that she earnt little to no money and couldn't cover basic needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe comes back to work with me, we manage to make the business stable. I let her take over the finances to which I don't think she did a good enough job of. Unfortunately, I can't get back with her, her decision was made a long time ago, and I had been living with a hope, that some day, maybe it could work. After not really knowing how to approach anything with her, still kinda thinking we could at least do things as a family, which I was wrong to presume. I had a really bad day where I couldn't even function properly, asked her if I could stay at hers and talk and go through some things, which we kind of did. She bascially turnt around at the end and said I can't do this anymore, that she doesnt feel like she can do this and that she doesn't want to be near me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I don't put her name on the business, she will likely leave her position, go back to not working enough and thengod knows what will happen. I care for this woman, she is the love of my life, she is the mother of my our son. She has no one here, no family, no friends. I was the only one and I am the only one who knows her truely. AITA for thinking that I shouldn't put her name on it, take my car back(which i've let her been using for 4 months), take my laptop back(which we had been sharing but it was more 80%/20% in her favour), have a relationship with my son and forget about her and let her get on with things? Maybe she will do it well, maybe she won't.

We used to be quite good friends but I developed a one-sided crush on them, needless to say things became awkward between us and eventually I decided it would be best for us to stop talking, we didn't talk for around 1 year and I figured that was it for us. \n\nRecently he got back in touch with me and we started talking again. Things were awkward at first but I was determined to try and work past it. One night I decided to ask him where he thought our friendship would go in the future and he told me it was better if we didn't bring up the conversation again, that decision upset me though I didn't voice it and instead simply agreed to not mention it again.\n\nAfter that I decided I wanted to see him in person again and we arranged to meet up at his house, the day went smoothly and we played games and then went out for a walk while talking to one another. When it got late I was getting ready to go home and we hugged, though after that he told me I was bad at picking up on social cues, when I asked him what he meant later he told me he didn't remember. This again upset me but I decided not to voice it yet again.\n\nThe next day I questioned him on something. I had previously asked him if he wanted to stay round mine and he agreed to it, the day after we were round his he told me he didn't want to stay round anymore as things were still awkward. I told him I wanted there to be full honesty between us, I was again upset by his actions, this time it was because he had lied to me. That evening he told me that we don't see each other the same in this friendship and that we should stop talking, I've tried to contact him since but I've just been ignored and this whole ordeal has made me miserable.\n\nI keep wondering if I had simply moved too fast, that I should have given him more space and that it was me who was making things awkward.

I would tell him and he would say everything is fine, i would talk to him in the halls but he would ignore me and i would shoot him a text and he would just see it and not replay for hours later but i would see he had been online at or a few momments before. It hurt me because he knew a part of the reason we broke up was because of communication and than he would say everything is fine.\n  Anyway i would get ignored so i decided to give him a tast of his own medition by ignoring him at school and not texting him, i do this for a while and my friend told me that my ex was confused why i was ignoring him.

With her, as a woman in her twenties, constantly needing to ask for permission to do basically anything.\n\n\n\nIt has improved a lot, with her becoming much more assertive and independent but one things still really bothering me. At the point when we had been living together around for around 7 months her parents  (who were in a longstanding legal battle with the US government over their citizenship rights) heard that the next hearing was going ahead and assumed they would win the case within that month,  despite me, my girlfriend, the lawyer,  and their oldest son trying to explain that this was only one step in a long process.\n\n\n\nWith this they decided they would spend their time before moving back to the USA  seeing the sights in Europe.  The problem was that they drained my girlfriends bank account to do it. (It was an account she made as a minor so her mom had access)\n\nWhen it came out that they won the case but another date was scheduled they exploded and blamed the lawyer and said it was his fault my girlfriends life savings were now non existent. \n\n\nAs I've said, over time she has gotten a lot more assertive and in return her parents have started treating her more like an adult. \n\n\nNow we're left being solely reliant on my income and savings and it honestly makes me furious.\nAny time I bring it up with her she says \"it doesn't matter\" and any time I voice my concern over feeling like I'm the only one putting resources into this relationship she blames her parents.

(Interesting side note: they pulled him out of school to start help working and now he's too old to finish high school and has no qualifications)\n\n\nSo, knowing that her parents are genuinely not in a good place financially, but they don't manage their money well, am I the asshole for wanting my girlfriend to demand the money from her parents because we shouldn't pay for their mistakes?\n\n\nWhenever we talk about it it always ends with me feeling terrible and just assuming I'm the asshole, but am I the asshole? \n\n\nAnd am I the asshole for expecting her to carry some of the financial burdens?", "output": "not answerable", "category": "Ethics Classification 1130.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, judge whether or not a specific person is wrong here.

We looked out for each other and we always had Naloxone on us in case we needed it because the local needle exchange would give it out to known users in the city. \n\nI ended up overdosing after my relapse because I over estimated how much I could actually handle at that point and luckily Jack came back at the right moment and saved my life. \n\nAfter this, I have been fully clean for a little bit over a year now.

Receptionist I think. Teachers there are not required to put grades in as soon as an assignment is done, so completed assignments may go ungraded for 4-5 days. Near the end of each semester my aunt would get very pushy, and it was a little annoying, but still tolerable and understandable because from her end, she saw all these ungraded assignments. The really annoying part is that she would tell my mom, my mom would get mad, and then argue with me about how I'm lying to her. After a few more days, the grades would show up, and everyone would be happy again. 2 semesters in, I talked to my aunt about not believing the initial grade, and giving it another few days. Nothing changed for the next 3 semesters. This last one, she caused the biggest fight between my mother and I. That night I just took my daily and raced around some back roads for a few hours, came home, and stayed up til 1 am in my shop.

I have a friend, who currently studies VR and UX design in uni, let's call him M. He has a girlfriend, who is a first-year gamedev student, let's call her L. L and M are also artists, kind of. We are all about the same age, around 20. I also want to emphasise that 'friend's GF' is not necessarily equal to 'my friend' in this case.\n\nL has a task for this semester - to make a game trailer. She decided that she doesn't want to throw away (???) the idea and the art after she completes the task, and wants to make a game. Us three have agreed to team up and work together. Now, this is important: during the initial meetup, L said things like \"this is **my** project\" and \"**I** have the rights for this idea\". I explicitly said that since this is her project, she will be responsible for the workflow and design, and I will only code and build. This will be a good practice for her, and the game is very simple, so this shouldn't be a big problem. We all agreed on that.\n\nI'm not going to go into the details, I'll just say that it's a simple mobile game. I also want to clarify that the basic workflow of making a game is as follows: take the idea you want to work on, make a game design document, make a prototype, refine, test, deploy (repeat 4 and 5 if necessary). It is generally considered a bad practice to freestyle things and work on later stages before the earlier stages. E.g. you make the music and high-quality models for the game, and then end up not using anything because the game gets reworked six times in prototyping.\n\nSo the next thing I talk about on this meeting is the GDD and the importance of making design choices in the beginning. I also mention multiple times that I, as a person who builds everything, need to know what needs to be done and how it should look/feel/work before I start working on the prototype. I ask her if she can compile everything into a single document as she did before, and advice her to use google and ask her teachers if she struggles with something.\n\nThis spring, L was making a project for her university entrance exam. The task was to basically design a game. This is important since she was capable of making a design document and other necessary things to show off and describe a game idea, therefore she knows what to do and how to do it. She periodically asked for help, and I helped where I could, without getting too involved, since this was her exam, not mine. Before that, I helped other people with their projects and ideas, all for free (there is a certain tendency here).\n\nThis time, I expected to be able to finally work as a part of the team. Not to do everything myself, not babysit everyone, just do my part and make a game. Oh boy. Was I ever as fucking wrong as this time. I mean, what can be easier than writing a few pages explaining the basic ideas? Core and meta, how to monetize, how should the menu look, what SFX and VFX we might need. The answer is, many things, but making a design document is not the most difficult part of making a game. Mind that is is also not final, you can and have to make changes to the GDD, but it's oh so difficult to work without it.\n\nWe \"started\" two months ago. L tried to make me write this thing a few times, and I kept sending her to google things and/or ask her teachers. She also kept feeding me with small, random, unstructured blobs of information, maybe hoping that I will compile them myself. I was close to doing this myself a few times but kept reminding myself that this time, I'm not the designer, she is the designer. Therefore, I was patiently waiting for her to write a three-page document. For two months. Last week I received two paragraphs with no useful info and replied that this isn't enough.\n\nI might have skipped a few details, I hope that it's nothing important, if you need clarification - please comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now the real story finally begins.**\n\nThis part will be biased since I'm still rather angry. I'm honestly trying to be objective, but it's hard.\n\nAfter our last dialogue, I was afk for a few days. I had stuff to do, personal stuff, and I honestly think I have a right to do my stuff whenever I want to. So, I return, power on the station, and get quite a shitpost from L *in our work chat,* that is supposed to be used for concept art, file sharing, and discussion. Anyways.\n\nI come back, and send her one of my own old design documents *as an example*. Why should I even do this, literally google this, please, it takes 3 minutes, and you have a whole faculty full of gamedevs! L responds, saying that it's my fault that she couldn't use google for two months, because \"if only I sent her the file a week ago she would've done everything earlier\". And she just keeps on fucking going on about how \"nobody is doing anything\" and \"you only do the code while I do everything else\" and \"it's such a shame that my amazing idea is getting lost because of you all\", and the best one is \"you are not helping me do my job\". I get it, you're a student, but I'm not supposed to teach you how to make games. I agreed to work for free. I think this is kind of enough of an investment.\n\nRegarding the code and stuff, it's a valid point, kind of. But we agreed on this initially, didn't we? Like, not taking into the account that code+build is 50% of the job, so it's a bit impolite to say this anyway.\n\nAnd here comes the fun part. She says, \"this is OUR game, it will only be MY game when I finish studying\". I'm honestly kind of taken aback by this. So, like, it's your game while it's easy, and then suddenly it's our game? What is this, some sort of conditional communism? Flip the switch and you're the boss, flip again and it's our job? So I'm confused and I ask her to calm down and tell her that if this load is too difficult for her, it might be a bad idea to continue studying/working in this field since it's only downhill from here (speaking from personal experience).\n\nNow, my opinion is that this is bullcrap. You can't call yourself the boss and then just shrug it off as soon as you have to do something. You also can't really say that you don't want to be the boss but keep talking shit. So I breathe in, breathe out, and logically explain to her that this is just workflow. You can't expect to get things done if you don't do them properly, and I have told her on multiple occasions what is the correct approach to this task. That I understand that this is difficult, that she also has to study, and maybe it wasn't the best idea to make a game at this point in time. If writing a small document is so difficult, maybe it's just not your thing, right? Fucken, wrong.\n\nAnd the shitstorm begins. If previously, the shit was just dripping from the ceiling fan, now the pipes of shit have burst full and wide, and the pressure is beyond imaginable. It's like Nurgle himself has arrived in our chat. \"You are lazy. You are a cunt. You don't do your job. You are not helping me. Oh, I'm just a beginner, and *this* is your motivational speech for me. Oh, I was hoping that you would do everything for me. You are acting so smug and grown up, why don't you guide me.\" You get the point.\n\nShould I spend my own time teaching and guiding a (basically) random person, because I know how to? Should I do L's job for her? Should I maybe do everything for her? Should I wipe her ass every time she takes a shit? Greatest minds of millennia still don't have answers to these questions. Keep in mind, M isn't really saying anything in this situation, and I understand that he is kind of between a rock and a hard place, and I don't blame him. I also want to point out that I haven't dropped the project yet, and I'm still waiting for the bloody design document.\n\nI personally feel like I should rush and help, as I always do, \"Take the wheel, Kuro!\" But I am so fucking tired.

My MIL didnt attend the wedding so she wanted photos of my husband and I in our wedding clothes. Fair enough, we agreed. The only day before the photographer left for the holidays was the day our plane landed, and I was fairly grumpy. Long flight, no sleep, and I was 9 weeks pregnant at the time so I was just sick and cramping. The photographer and his assistant knew all of this. I was bloated, and my wedding dress didnt fit me properly, so it was unzipped in the back and I had a wrap on to hide that fact so I was feeling pretty shitty about myself. After couples photos, the photographer wanted individual shots of my husband and I. I get into a pretty generic photo pose, and smiled. They ask me to move my arm a certain way, tilt my head, whatever. I guess I wasnt doing it right, because the assistant came around and started grabbing my arms, tilting my head, kind of shifting me around for the position. I'm really irritated at this point, and I huff while shes positioning me around. Then she says \"Come on, dont you want to look thin and pretty?.\" Which set me off. I dont like being touched by strangers, I dont like taking photos, and I've always been self concious about my weight and pregnancy wasnt helping that, on top of a long flight and no sleep, so I snapped. I told her \"I don't need to look thin and fucking pretty. I'm not a fucking barbie doll, so keep your hands off me. I'm fucking done with this bullshit.\" and I stormed upstairs to the guest room (we were at my MIL's house) I was crying, my husband talked to his mom for a second then came upstairs to comfort me. I changed into comfy clothes that actually fit and after a little while I went back downstairs and apologised. We finished taking photos with everyone in comfortable clothing instead of their Sunday best, and no individual shots of me. The assistant was a bit colder towards me than she had been earlier, but she was still polite. I still feel like a huge dick about the fit I threw. So, I come to you and await your judgement.

I am the partner of a live-in nanny. We both moved across the country with the family she Nannys for. They asked her to move with them without me and she refused because that would have been the end of our relationship  and would have screwed me over on the lease we had just signed.\n\n The initial agreement was that we would live with then for two months then move out. But we have lived with them for 4 months now. They never discussed increasing my partners wage due to higher cost of living and refuse to. They also have hired me on at a higher hourly rate to help with maintenance around the house and filling in to watch the kids. \n\nEven though they pay me more than my partner, I only ever work ~4 hours a week (they make sure.) Well today is payday and I asked to be paid about 12 hours earlier than usual because I have a bill due before my normal pay time and wanted to make sure the money would be in my account. They are refusing to pay me until tomorrow night when I help them host a party (not something I ever agreed to do or even discussed with them) which will mean my bill is paid late and will probably incur penalties. \n\nMy partner isn't in a position to help because she gets paid half of what I do and uses most of that money to feed us. \n\nSo even though I live in my employers house for free, am I the asshole for wanting to get paid early on my own terms?", "output": "answerable", "category": "Ethics Classification 1130.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, judge whether or not a specific person is wrong here.

I was like absolutely and as this is something we do often.  She hasn't met him in person.  She knows my door is always open but she still hasn't came to see him.  We live 20 hours apart.   So we are on FaceTime and she is talking with my son/ watching him laugh and play.  Overall it was a great reaction.\n\nThe problem I have is that in the background on her side is my step Dad who basically raised me.  The entire time he doesn't once come over to say hi or happy birthday or even acknowledge my son.  It was impossible for him not to hear or see what was going on, but not once did he look up or come to the screen.  The kid is 2 and is giggling playing pikaboo saying thier dogs name etc and no emotions.\n\n\nAfter we hung up it just really stuck with me and brought up a lot of animosity. So I sent my mom a text stating how I felt and that my son never did anything to him and to have him.sitting in the background being cold as fuck really brought up a lot of animosity for me and that I didn't need the bs or drama in my life.

My mom(53) has worked for the last 10yr+ as a school bus driver. She gets weekends off and has early days as well as major holiday vacations. She makes less than $35,000 annually, but hasn't made efforts to find something to help her sustain her residency in LA County. She lives with my aunt atm and pays $600 for a 1br, parking, utilities, internet, and laundry included. Last week my sister and her bf, who have a toddler together, got into it. Their relationship was already hanging on a thread because they just couldn't make things work. Her bf is very irrational and vindictive and my sister is very stubborn and proud. Well, he ended up kicking both her and their son out of their apt.\n\nMy mother invited my sister to stay at my aunts house given the situation and because all happened so fast neither of them reached out to my aunt to ask if it were alright. When my aunt found out she exploded. Gave my sister a month, max. She then blatantly told my mother that she needed to find a new place. My mother constantly had issues with my grandmother, who is also living in my aunts house and being supported by her as well. This always put my aunt in a stressful position as mediator. \n\nWhen I heard the news I was devastated. My husband and I offered to help my family as much as we could. My sister was lucky enough to find a room for rent with a family friend for $500, but my mother has little to no option and is even considering sleeping in her car. My husband and I both asked her to consider moving into a 2br and that she would have to pay $800 and watch our 10 month old when necessary so I could possibly work or go back to school, but she said she couldn't afford it. She then exclaimed that we should give her a discount for watching the baby. \nWhen we couldn't come to an agreement she asked us to compromise and get a 1br so she could sleep in the living room at less than what shes paying at my aunts. Neither of us wants to give up our privacy. \n\nMy husband and I are both in the culinary industry, so living in the city is necessary for us. We make just enough to get by here and in the future if the opportunity presents it self we will relocate to somewhere more inexpensive, but this is our life at the moment and we arent being pushovers. \n\nAITA? \n", "output": "not answerable", "category": "Ethics Classification 1130.json"}]
