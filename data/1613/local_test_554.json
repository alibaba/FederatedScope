", "input": "Because most muscles that extend the wrist and fingers are innervated by the C7 nerve root, C7 radiculopathy may rarely present solely with a wrist drop and finger drop, with relative sparing of non-radial C7-innervated muscles. This palsy is classically of the radial nerve and causes wrist drop, although other motor nerves can be affected. Fine, rapid tremors are seen in many toxic states, including alcohol, lead, mercury, and various drug compounds (caffeine, bromides, barbiturates, cocaine, amphetamine, ephedrine). Medical research papers related to Wrist drop include: 1  Radial nerve. 2  Motor Neurone Disease (MND) 3  Beriberi (Overview) 4  Multifocal Motor Neuropathy With Conduction Blocks (Overview) 5  Radial Mononeuropathy (Treatment) 6  Lead Nephropathy (Overview) 7  Radial Mononeuropathy (Diagnosis) 8  Leprosy (Overview) The patient has a wrist drop from compression of the right radial nerve as it winds around the humerus. This mononeuropathy occurs commonly among drug addicts and alcoholics who, while stuporous, are apt to lean against their arm for many hours. Symptoms of wrist drop Being unable to move the wrist upwards with the hand is facing palm down, numbness in the wrist area and back of the hand and inability to straighten the fingers are common symptoms. The muscles the radial nerve controls and the skin sensitivity that exists as a result of it, both do not function when Saturday night palsy occurs. This is known as wrist drop. When muscles in the forearm contract the wrist can be extended. However, when the tendons, muscles, and nerves reaching these muscles are not working properly, a condition called Drop wrist deformity may occur. This condition is also called Radial Nerve Palsy as damage to the radial nerve due to a broken humerus bone can result in this immobility of the wrist. Causes of drop wrist deformity Stab wounds to the chest, a broken arm and lead poisoning are some of the causes for this disorder. Some of the comorbid or associated medical symptoms for Wrist drop may include these symptoms: 1  Arm symptoms. 2  Head symptoms. 3  Limb symptoms. 4  Movement symptoms. 5  Muscle symptoms. 6  Nerve symptoms. 7  Weakness. 8  more associated symptoms...\u00bb. Of the 7 causes of Wrist drop that we have listed, we have the following prevalence/incidence information: 1  0 causes are very common diseases. 2  0 causes are common diseases. 3  1 causes are uncommon diseases. 4  0 causes are rare diseases. 5  2 causes are very rare diseases. 6  5 causes have no prevalence information. Wrist drop and finger drop are characteristic of injuries to the radial nerve within the spiral groove. The brachioradialis muscle may be weak and its tendon reflex lost. Sensory disturbances are restricted to the back of the hand near the base of the thumb. Causes of drop wrist deformity. Stab wounds to the chest, a broken arm and lead poisoning are some of the causes for this disorder. External pressure applied to the radial nerve or repeated usage of this nerve due to the use of crutches or leaning on the elbows can also cause this condition.", "output": "drop wrist what nerve", "category": "Question Generation 1497.json"}, {"instruction": "Write a phrase, the answer to which is present in the passage.

PURPOSE: To establish a mechanism to ensure that adverse drug reactions are systematically reported and reviewed. POLICY: All staff has the responsibility of reporting, documenting, and monitoring adverse drug reactions that occur within the facility's population. DEFINITIONS: communication of known and new adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and allergies is required in order to reduce potential for patient harm from the use of medicines. 1.3. SA Health recognises that patients may experience unpredictable adverse responses to prescribed medicines. 1.4. This policy is aimed at minimising patient harm by improvement in Preventing Adverse Drug Events . Policy developed by: Public Health and Clinical Systems . Approved at Portfolio Executive on: 25 June 2013 . Next review due: 01 June 2018 .

An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an unwanted, unde - sirable effect of a medication that occurs during usual clinical use. Adverse drug reactions occur almost daily in health care institutions and can adversely affect a patient\u2019s quality of life, often causing considerable morbidity and mortality.
