Fun read! . Bloodline by Fiona Mountain is the second book in the Natasha Blake genealogist mystery series.  After an elderly man hires Natasha to investigate the family background of his granddaughter's fiance, he is mysteriously murdered.  The man's son hires Natasha to find out why.  Mountain does a much better job this time of connecting with the reader.  Natasha's connections to her friends and family deepen and develop as well.  There are loads of subplots, including Natasha's insomnia which occasionally makes her take actions that had me shaking my head in disbelief.  The story takes an unexpected dark turn as Natasha finds out that sometimes finding the answers to questions only creates more questions with answers no one wants to hear.  This was a fun read that made me think a bit too.  I look forward to the next in the series.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

I read this novel because it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.  Anne Tyler has a gift for portraying ordinary indivdiuals who live ordinary lives.  Yet her novel is anything but ordinary because her characters are simple, yet real and their dialogue rings true.  Moreover, Ms. Tyler, like Hardy and Miller before her, clearly believes and successfully posits that her mundane characters are heroic because they survive, perservere and present (albeit unknowingly) moral and spiritual lessons that are universal to us all. But my hesitation in giving this novel 5 stars is that, while it is great fiction, it is not the greatest fiction of its time. And this raises another issue.  Why have so many Pulitzer Prize novels, such as \"Gilead,\" \"The Known World,\" \"Empire Falls,\" \"The Hours,\" \"Kavalier & Clay,\" and \"Middlesex,\" disappointed me recently? While these are compelling and at times superb works, they are not, in my opinion, deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.  Of recent winners, only \"The Shipping News\" merits that distinction.  Perhaps I will focus on National Book Award winners, since they seem more uniformly satisfying.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

With the multitude of books written regarding the sport of baseball, Steven Travers writes with a unique insight into not only the sport, but the day to day lives of Bonds and his peers.  As a former professional baseball player, Travers touches on the subject matter with a unique insight and perspective.  Additionally, Travers attended and graduated from USC during the time Bonds played at Arizona State (Pac-10).  As such, Travers is not only a writer, but a fan.  Travers not only documents Bond's achievement of becoming baseball's all-time single season homerun champion, but he touches on Bond's trials and tribulations with his peers and the media.  Ultimately, the reader soon realizes that Travers was able to do what many has tried and failed at; that is, he was able to garner the respect and support of Bonds in the ability to tell his amazing story to the whole world.  As a former Pac-10 pitcher at USC who battled Bonds on many occasions, I found Traver's insight very refreshing and commendable.  I found the book a very easy read that kept me entertained throughout.

First, Steven Thatcher is a wimp, his whining and hanging on to his baggage made him the most unattractive man I've come across in a romance. That he was the hero truly made this book lose a few stars. Special Agent, Neil, deserved the girl, not Thatcher, and Jenna should have stuck to her conclusion that Thatcher would always be suspicious of any man who so much as spoke to her. I just couldn't see how Jenna could have her HEA with a man like that. Each time Steven went into his childish knee-jerk reaction, I was willing Jenna to forget the guy and look at Neil instead.    I was also disappointed over how dumb the police were not to guess who the real killer was. All I can say is that I'm so glad I didn't read this book first when I decided to try Karen Rose.

The only criticism I have about the book is that Ms. Choquette  mentions several times that her family was Catholic and religiously so. I do not doubt her family's religious sensbilities, but the Church teaches against almost everything that Sonia practices and believes -- reincarnation, clairvoyance, ascended masters, divination with tarot cards, spirit guides, etc. I don't think it is possible to be a Catholic in the sense of someone who believes in the dogmas of the Church and be a New Ager as Sonia is. She also says that she prayed the rosary before her readings and one of her teachers said that she would attract only good spirits that way, but she also needed to pray the Our Father. The rosary requires the recitation of the Our Father at least 6 times, so I was confused when Sonia said she then began to pray the Our Father as well.

And the Band Played On is an act of phenomenal research and writing, and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling, political bumbling, and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many, the scientific in-fighting which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives, and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives, but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they didn't want to do the work, didn't want to spend the money, or didn't want to anger certain political groups.  Gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many.      It's the sign of a good book when it brings out strong emotions.  This book provoked in me anger, rage, confusion, compassion, sadness, and tears.  I wish I could thank all those, like Don Francis, Dr. Michael Gottlieb, Dr. Selma Dritz, Marc Conant, Dr. Dale Lawrence, Paul Volberding, and Dr. Arye Rubenstein, who tried so hard, against such overwhelming odds, to save lives quickly.  I would also chastise President Ronald Reagan and Merve Silverman and give Margaret Heckler and Bob Gallo a piece of my mind -- the skunks!      I am thankful that there are politicians like Orrin Hatch and people behind the scenes like Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones.  Though he was woefully slow in responding I'm grateful for the response of C. Everett Koop and that once having made his stand he never wavered and took it to the media wherever he could.      Randy Shilts did an excellent job of showing the culture in the United States and France and the politics in the medical and scientific communities and the political posture and arena during the 1980s.  He also humanized the crisis by following many of the patients from onset of medical problems to death (Enno Poersch, Gary Walsh, Frances Borchelt, Bill Kraus, and Gaetan Dugas) and by following the doctors and scientists in their fight to discover the properties of this terrible disease and conquer it.  It was enlightening and helpful to have the book structured as a time line.      The amount and variety of research done for this book is astounding, requiring Shilts to conduct hundreds of interviews and read millions of pages of articles and medical material.  In reading this book, my education has been enhanced and my life is more full and forever changed.      It is a great tragedy that AIDS killed Randy Shilts as it had killed so many other innocents, and that as I write this there is still no cure for AIDS.  As far as I can tell, it is again being largely ignored by governments and the medical community.

Be Good to Your Gander; Branding Processes Are Strikingly Similar; What's a Brand Essence?; Legendary Branding; Extracting a Brand Essence; The Kama Sutra of Marketing - Five Basic Positions; Framing to the Right Target Audience; Structured Creativity - Framing Tools; Creativity on Demand - Why Ad Agencies Can't Brainstorm; Feed Their Passions; Plan to Have Many Conversations; Everything Communicates; Storytelling - Letting the Genie Out of the Bottle; Branding and Thinking Two Products Ahead; Myth, Magic, and Making Money the Old-Fashioned Way; AKS; Jeff Lloyd's Secret to Commercial Residential Real Estate Sales; How to Turn Every First Sale into a Residual Stream of Income; Direct Response Branding; Acknowledgements; Index    Mack states that successful branding comes when you start thinking two products ahead of the current sale.  In other words, you need to be thinking about the overall story and impression that your company and product leaves with a customer.  This collection of legends and perceptions defines your brand, not the cute logo or corporate colors you stick on your products.  What that means is that you *have* a brand whether you think you do or not.  You need to bring your customer into the \"marketing funnel\", which is a four stage process: intrigue, consider, interested, and buy.  When you get them to buy, then the \"two products ahead\" mindset turns them from one-off buyers to loyal customers.  It's all a matter of managing your brand...  the story that your customers tell about your company and product.    This book started off as an e-book that the author marketed himself (for a much higher price).  His style of writing and communication is frank and blunt, with no room for dancing around an issue.  As such, it's a lot of fun to read.  Since I don't have a marketing background, I found it a little difficult to keep the finer points of marketing vs. branding vs. selling straight at times.  But overall, I got the message that your brand is a priceless asset, and it's important to do everything you can to make sure that brand says the right thing to your customer.    A valuable read for any business, but especially for the small business owner who doesn't think he has a brand...  he does.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

This is one book on ancient Israel that actually delivers what its title promises. In &quot;The Early History of God&quot; Mark Smith systematically sifts through archaelogical and literary data from Bronze and Iron Age Palestine, the Mediterranean, and Mesopotamia to find the earliest evidence for YHWH, his cult, and his context. Chapters include discussions of YHWH and El, YHWH and Baal, Asherah and asherahs, cultic practices, such as communication with the dead and child sacrifice, at the sites where YHWH was worshiped, as well as a brief discussion of the beginnings of monotheism during the late monarchy. Refreshingly for me, Smith frames his argument on available evidence, not on wishful thinking, and the result is provocative and stimulating. The long introduction to this new edition covers the debate that has gone on since the book was originally published over ten years ago, and the extensive footnotes are a wealth of information on every side of the discussion.

In the 1950s, television filled the void left by the Senate inquiries and the imposition of the comics code. A new resurgence in the 60s, comic books were exciting again, carrying into the 70s spurred by superhero AND horror/mystery comics. Bottoming out again in the eighties, this time the culprit- video games.   Today the enemies, television and gaming, are still with us vieing for our time. Comics are not truly accessable to the buying public. They've become the property of an exclusive club that seems to revel mostly in some artist's wet dreams. How nice to know they can excercise his or her artistic rights and freedom. But no one is buying it! It's dead for all intents and purposes. Comic shops have to fill their shelves with collectible toys to make it.  The comics I buy are at liest more than 30 years old. The new ones just are not interesting and even with all of this self-examination and navel probing, the quality just isn't there. It's my opinion that it doesn't have to read like Shakespear and look like Rembrant to be a good comic. But it must entertain.  The effort has been underway for years to leave the lowly comic book in the dust, replaced by the Graphic Novel. All in the name of impoving (the perception anyway) of the comic book market! Even HBOs Tales From the Crypt\" opening credits state 'Adapted from the comic MAGAZINE...'   The internet will not save comic books. It isn't a 'book' in the first place. Illegal downloading will kill it. Scanning comic books is already a problem.  The salvation of the medium is in the hands of something that is not real? If you cannot hold it and carress it in your hands like a lover then it will not satisfy (oops, better watch my own dreaming!). I do have a love affair with comic books.  The only salvation I believe are two things:   1) Comic books must be put back into the public eye through stores or what have you. Recruitment to comic books through casual 'walk by' customers who are not necessarily seeking out comics, they just happen upon them out in public stores. Yes, the great unwashed and 'unenlightend' masses parting with their three bucks is the only thing that will help save the comicbooks!  2) The superhero must die! And artists and writers must excercise self control or face the imposition of a new comics code", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

This book masyerfully unmasks the sorrows of the nation. The author is able to compose a memoir of the haunting lives of children in New York's ghettos. The fierce images of rat-infested homes, and schools filled with poisonous lead walls leave readers unable to fathom how people truly exist in such harsh conditions. Kozol addresses every area of the spectrum from the children's point of view to the political views of the country. Also presenting an array of diverse issues such as AIDs, drugs, underage prostitution, death, motives based in moral, religious beliefs, and inhuman treatment towards others to the reader. Feelings of pathos arise after hearing the accounts of the children in the area; readers feel sorrow for the children because they are stripped of their childhood. Numerous quotes and examples are given in the book, but one that particularly struck me was when Kozol asks one of the children if he knows anyone happy at all the boy candidly responds, \"Not many...Well, to tell the truth, not any who are happy for more than one day...No! Not for one day. For 15 minutes...Not any. That's no lie\"(212). To honestly not know at least some form of happiness is incompressible for me and I'm sure for many others as well. By using statements made by children the author easily wins the readers pity and sympathy. Our pity soon turns to anger when he describes the lack of government support. Examples such as unsanitary hospitals, toxic incinerators, closet sized school rooms, and shabby, less then adequate housing evoke sentiments of detest towards the government's lack of aid towards these poor devastated people. But once again Kozol quickly changes our feelings to those of denial. He provides shocking statistics and first hand accounts as to how the nation sympathizes with these people for five minutes and then continue on with their lives.  It seems shocking that people would do things so cruel such as disposing of their waste in the ghetto streets. While reading, it became a necessity for me to remind myself that the events taking place were all true; this is not a cleverly composed work of fiction, though it would certainly be far more assuaging if it were.       Taking into account the brilliant components of the book, I must say that I was vexed by one minor detail; Kozol's overall presentation of his opinions. The beginning of the book revolves around the accounts of parents and children within the area and the author provides few opinions on the subject. But towards the end he fills several pages with statistics followed by passages of his opinions. I feel that this takes away from the book because rather than focusing on the children and people living in the area we turn our attention to the author and how he is impacted by the events and things he witnesses.         Other than this minor dislike I think that the piece as a whole is very informative and certainly does a good job at presenting what appears to be the ideas and realities for several minorities in New York. It may not be a thriller, or adventure novel, but it most certainly is a mystery. A mystery as to how people are able to survive in such hostile conditions and retain hope. Kozol's mastery of rhetoric reveals that the issues taking place have been around and that until something changes they will remain so.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

I am married to a Marine officer who is currently deployed to Iraq for the second time.  As you can imagine, most of our friends are also Marine families.  Additionally, my mother-in-law was a Marine wife for 35 years.  This book is not representative of myself, my mother-in-law, or of ANY military spouse either of us know.

From that initial list, he pared down the items until he came up with what he felt are the most important eleven items that matter.  These mindsets, if understood, directly affect how you view current events and interpret your surroundings.  For instance, it's easy to look at each new technology and think that it will change everything.  But in reality, the same underlying forces continue to drive people's lives.  Business is in a constant state of flux, but it still ends up being all about buying and selling.  In sports, the one-handed jump shot in basketball completely changed the look of the game in 1936, but the game itself was still the same...  score a basket.  Once you strip away the fluff and hype, it's easier to understand where the general flow of life is going.  Or my favorite...  don't add something unless you subtract something.  Setting a cap on a situation (be it a sports roster or a number of menu items in a restaurant) forces you to weigh the merits of each item, keeping only the things that return value and dropping items that no longer measure up to the others.  Something to remember before you make yet another commitment...    Part 2 of the book applies a number of these mindsets to different current events and situations.  Personally, I found this part of the book a bit more unfocused than the first.  While I understand that the visual is becoming more important in today's society, I had a hard time staying focused on where the chapter was going.  He does tie the mindsets into the conclusions he draws, but I found the mindsets themselves to be more personally useful for my own life.    Definitely worth reading, even if you don't necessarily agree with him on how the mindsets play out.  I'll be revisiting the mindsets a number of times to get them firmly embedded in my brain.

This book is neither about Aristotle nor General Motors.  Do not be fooled into believing it is in any way an application of Aristotelian ethics in modern business; it is not.  Morris consistently contradicts Aristotle throughout the book.      An example is Morris' proselytizing conclusion that leadership requires humility.

No.  Could Aristotelian writing lead us to these conclusions?  No again.  Is Taoism consistent with Aristotelian reason and logic?  No, no, no.  Is Hasidic verse? Definitely not.

When reading books about Chemistry or Physics, the level of depth is usually to the electron, proton, neutron, and there is usually some mention of quarks and antimatter and dark matter, but with no explanation of where these ideas are coming from. This book gives a good, nonmathematical description of the Standard Theory (Model) of particle physics, which gives a good account of what particles are known, how forces are treated using particles called Bosons. The books will answer any questions about what is known, but without proofs. I plan to study physics as an undergrad, and probably grad too, and have always been attracted to learning about the fundamental particles. This book was very satisfying for me, and will be for other interested students.

After working in a church in Boston and another in Washington, D.C., minister Ed Wilcox and his family have transferred to the Consolidated Community Church in Emerald Springs, Ohio. His wife, Aggie, initially has her doubts about settling down in a small town, but eventually she, Ed, and their two young children find themselves making friends, except for elderly parishioner Gelsey Falowell who despises Ed and wants to get rid of him. Gelsey's wish may come true when the naked body of a murder victim is left on the Wilcox's front porch and Ed, who had been counseling the dead woman, is the chief suspect. Aggie knows that Ed is innocent but wonders why Ed is keeping secrets from her especially when her daughter Teddy tells her she saw her father fighting with the dead woman. When a second murder is committed and detective Kirkor Roussos seems to suspect Ed committed both crimes, Aggie, with the help of her friend, real estate agent Lucy Jacobs, begins investigating the murders. The more Aggie looks into the crimes the more she realizes that people, especially Gelsey, have secrets that have been buried for years and some people will kill to have them remain secret.    \"Blessed is the Busybody\" is a good beginning to what looks to be a good mystery series. The characters are well written and well defined. The mystery is written from the view point of Aggie, revealing various bits of her unconventional childhood, plus her struggles to raise her children especially oldest daughter Deena, who at eleven is just starting to rebel a little bit. Both Teddy and Deena are well written and come across as real children. Aggie's friend Lucy is so well written that I could picture here while reading the book. Ed comes across as a bit bland, but I suspect that will change in future books. Author Emilie Richards does a good job describing small town life and the secrets hidden there and the town itself was like a character in the book. The mystery is well written with plenty of surprising secrets slowly revealed as the book goes on. The mystery is complex yet satisfying, if a bit sad. But there's a nice gentle humor throughout the book that takes the edge off the sadder elements.    \"Blessed is the Busybody\" is well worth reading.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

I have no doubt the author is well intentioned and may in fact have had some good results with the exercises outlined.

Many of the people with BPD I have worked with have astonishingly traumatic abuse histories and to explore self-history without the tools necessary to contain the potentially explosive and RE-traumatizing emotions is foolish and even hurtful.    Furthermore, the author's assertion that the client be able to say that they want to use HIS text in therapy and the recommendation that if the therapist objects that the client move on to another therapist is TOTALLY misguided and naive.  I very much agree that it is important for clients to be able to guide their own work, but I am also highly aware of the ways people with BPD can split different providers.  There are just too many GENUINELY therapeutic reasons to approach the author's recommendations with caution to allow what he says to interrupt what may very well be extraordinary work between a therapist and client.

Although well written, this book is just left wing socialist blather. Most egregiously in error is the author's characterization of Catholic social teaching. He wuld have us believe that the Catholic Church is all behind the US social welfare system. Just one quote summarizes where the Catholic Church really is on this issue:     \"In recent years the range of such intervention has vastly expanded, to the point of creating a new type of state, the so-called \"Welfare State.\" This has happened in some countries in order to respond better to many needs and demands, by remedying forms of poverty and deprivation unworthy of the human person. However, excesses and abuses, especially in recent years, have provoked very harsh criticisms of the Welfare State, dubbed the \"Social Assistance State.\" Malfunctions and defects in the Social Assistance State are the result of an inadequate understanding of the tasks proper to the State. Here again the principle of subsidiarity must be respected: a community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life of a community of a lower order, depriving the latter of its functions, but rather should support it in case of need and help to coordinate its activity with the activities of the rest of society, always with a view to the common good. By intervening directly and depriving society of its responsibility, the Social Assistance State leads to a loss of human energies and an inordinate increase of public agencies, which are dominated more by bureaucratic ways of thinking than by concern for serving their clients, and which are accompanied by an enormous increase in spending. In fact, it would appear that needs are best understood and satisfied by people who are closest to them and who act as neighbors to those in need. It should be added that certain kinds of demands often call for a response which is not simply material but which is capable of perceiving the deeper human need. One thinks of the condition of refugees, immigrants, the elderly, the sick, and all those in circumstances which call for assistance, such as drug abusers: all these people can be helped effectively only by those who offer them genuine fraternal support, in addition to the necessary care.\" (Pope John Paul II, Centessimus Annus, 1991)       I could give you a quote for every other case where the author misrepresents Church teaching.

'The Glorious Cause' is the second in Shaara's two volume piece historical fiction concerning the Revolutionary War. 'Rise to Rebellion' was the first, and I believe the superior of the two, but 'The Glorious Cause' is an excellent novel as well.    'Rise to Rebellion' was the superior of the two novels due to the changes of heart that the readers sees in John Adams and Benjamin Franklin concerning the issue of independence from England. 'The Glorious Cause' has little of that type deep soul-searching. However, it is a fantastic portrayal of the difficulties encountered by the Continental Army and George Washington, in particular.    If I were to have my druthers, I would have preferred that Shaara had broken this 600+ page novel into two novels and expanded them both by delving more into the politics of the day and the difficulties of fighting a war with the governmental structures and restrictions that the Contintenal Congress was hampered with.     In addition, more battles and fronts could have been explored, such as the ill-fated American invasion of Canada and Benedict Arnold's naval adventures on Lake Champlain.

This is the 3rd & culminating text of Jung's CW trilogy on alchemy (see CW11 Psychology & Alchemy & CW12 Alchemical Studies before reading this one).  Jung obviously devoted considerable time & effort into the study of alchemy--because he perceived an amazing parallel with his theories/model of the psyche & the process of individuation.  I think it amazed him that the alchemists intuitively evoked such general principles of transcendental alchemy prior to the development of western science--indeed, they were simultaneously immersed in this development such that modern chemistry evolved from it.  Oddly, some are now advocating the use of chemicals (drugs) in lieu of psychology--e.g. for schizophrenia.  Maybe the tail is wagging the horse?  Of course, this is a difficult text.  The alchemical series may be the most difficult of Jung's already difficult texts.  But, as Jung demonstrated himself, sometimes the way to learn is to just jump in feet first--absorb as you can.

In the gospel phrase, theocentric saints are the salt which preserves the world from decay.'

Please make a different choice.' By telling these students to make a different choice the speaker used language that communicated respect.  His message informed them 'I see you as responsible for your own actions.  You control your behavior.  You choose your responses to life.'    Every page has this same sickening tone to it.

I started reading this wonderful book 6 months before I left Brazil towards Israel. After finishing the first Part (Paradise) I just could not keep on reading, and I abandoned the book for a while. After I landed in Israel I re-took the book and was delighted again with the realness of it. A thought occurred to me that the reading was so descriptive of the immigration sentiment that I just could not understand it before immigrating myself.    The book helped me to understand and to organize the infinite sensations that come with the leaving/arriving to another country. How the language affects the way we think and act, how sadness and happiness are mingled into one strange feeling, how we cope and forget without noticing, and how we urge to succeed and prove that we can be part of the new country.    In addition, the book also brought to me new feelings and curiosities about my grandparents, whom also escaped from Poland and Russia in the late 40's. Hoffman describes so well how the old traditions and languages influenced the new live of those who left their country because of prejudice and persecution!    One passage that I am specially fond of: \"No, I'm no patriot, nor was I ever allowed to be. And yet, the country of my childhood lives within me with a primacy that is a form of love. (...) All it has given me is the world, but that is enough. It has fed me language, perceptions, sounds, the human kind. It has given me the colors and the furrows of reality, my first loves. The absoluteness of those loves can never be recaptured: no geometry of the landscape, no haze in the air, will live in us as intensely as the landscapes that we saw as the first, and to which we gave ourselves wholly, without reservations.\" It reminds me of Wordsworth when he writes about Tintern Abbey.

Fran Lebowitz is sometimes referred to as the successor to Dorothy Parker. A few similarities are apparent. Both are sharp-witted, female New Yorkers famous for their often stinging one-liners. Yet, if Parker could be considered a painter of the urban American landscape in the 1920s through 1950s, Lebowitz should be considered a sketch artist from the 1970s. I don't think she has Parker's depth or sense of structure. Her essays are playful but often amount to mere list making or an assemblage of loosely connected observations that could just as well belong on a greeting card or cocktail napkin. And she often relies way too heavily on puns. Several pieces in this collection fall flat for me. Yet others - such as her advice to heiresses, \"At Home with Pope Ron,\" and \"The Last Laugh\" - were quite clever.

Firekeeper is soon busy investigating the strange relationship between the Loglimi and their animals; at the same time (and the reader may have to stretch a bit to accept this development) she learns more of her own background.

I know DR. Young and Shelley personally. They went to school with my dad and are great people. I have been to their home and retreat center Rancho Del Sol, and it is a great place. I also have been on the Ph Miracle diet for about 6 months now, and it works! I have lost over 20 pounds since then and I have cleared up some nasty protein pools in my blood that Rob found six months ago when I started the program.  At first I was a bit skeptical and hesitant to go on the program, but after time I felt that it was working and it was great. The food - which is cooked by a good friend of my family's and is also on the Ph program - is excellent, and the program is great.  And, those jerks that attack Rob and Shelley personally are nothing but low-life jerks. Rob and Shelley are wonderful people and great friends of mine. On their retreat to Rancho Del Sol, they went so far out of their way to help me and all of the others on the retreat.  And, when you watch Rob do a live blood test, it is fascinating. He presents his findings in conferences that are followed by a great Alkaline lunch. And the findings are very interesting. He bases most of his work on the work of A. Bechamp, an 18th century scientist that was an understudy of Louis Pasture. The facts are there, and quiet fascinating. He (Rob) is brilliant, but a bit excentric. But that is understandable considering his passion for his work.  Over all, this program works. I love the alternative path way to health, but do admit that Western methods are needed at times. I just feel that you don't need to \"Dope up\" on Px drugs at the first sigh of trouble.  So I give this 5 stars not just for the program, but for Rob and Shelley as my good friends.   But...  Do this in moderation to other healthy lifestyles. Don't just go 100 percent Alkaline all of the sudden. Slowly work your way to that wanted PH and be moderate with other health practices.  So 5 stars for me.  The book presents it all. A great read on the Ph program for weight loss! But do not assume something until you have read the book.

I got this for Christmas and finished it late last night.     As the tale begins, the author initiates two primary storylines, The first is set in WWII spanning both the European and Pacific theatres. The second is modern day and is centered on a California start-up (with requisite ambitious young guys) with primary business interests in the far east. One knows the stories are connected because of similar last names in both. The other connection is encryption - how crytography was central to the war and how it is central to current day business and, in the author's view, central to the future of civilization.    One of the great pluses of the book is how the author made use of these commonalities between WW2 and modern-day to create interest and anticipation. The middle of the book actually made use of these quite well and I was eager to keep reading. There is some terrific writing in middle sections and descriptions of people and places both in Europe and the Far East are very vivid.    The author does write with terrific humour at times and I was reminded in several places about a series of books written about WWI called \"The Bandy Papers - the Journals of Bartholomew Bandy\" by Donald Jack. Very similar in style as the author captures the points of view - dry wit - of Grandpa (WW2) and grandson (techno geek) Waterhouse.    The presentation of Gen. Douglas McArthur was (from my Canadian perpective) endearingly flag-waving-pipe-chomping-bullet- shedding-American-Super-hero and, of course, totally unbelievable.    Then I hit the final pages where I had hoped to receive a big-payoff to the build-up over the previous thousand pages. Alas, it was not to be and all the tedious verbiage that scarred the entire book turned out to be a sad bell-weather.    One of the \"1 star\" reviews amongst these reviews suggested that Tolkien was nothing compared to Neal Stephenson as far as filling up pages with words. There are numerous examples of page after page of \"who cares\" blathering which may tell us that some of the characters are in fact terribly boring individuals but do not deepen the characterizations. One of the good points is that when you hit such a section - and the reader will recognize them - you can simply skip about 5 pages or more and pick up the story without missing anything. The book could have been shortened by about 400 pages, maybe more. I'm guessing there is an encrypted message in the pages somewhere but I couldn't care less.    Some story lines, characters and inferences are left totally unresolved in the end (e.g. what happened to the dentist?). A case of author boredom and a loss of interest as the ending approached? And why the heck did Andrew Loeb make a final appearance! Talk about out-of-place and just bizarre.    I dunno what the author is thinking sometimes but several times he comes across as just a tad too clever. At least 3 times during the book (inluding the opening pages) I didn't have a clue what he was talking about. For example, one such bit of cleverness is his incorporation of the Hindenberg disaster in New Jersey - the narrative is written at that point from the perspective of a main character who stumbles literally out of the woods after seeing a brightness in the sky. It is not central or even obliquely of interest to the story line. The author never mentions Hindenberg by name and it is left to the reader (if you can pass the author's ever-so-clever test of cleverness) to figure it out. It seemed somewhat a condescending (to the reader) writing style.    There is the usual technology-dropping (like dropping names but gadgets instead of people) to presumably up the coolness factor and from my knowledge it is mostly, but not always, believable.    Ultimately, why there is some terrific writing, the overall result is a draft that needs 1 or 2 more rewrites and a worthy ending to really tell a terrific story.      Summary - go directly to Tom Clancy's books which are executed much better and have endings that offer a consistent pay-off (but with less humour). Clancy can also go on and on... but not like this guy!

Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1985, this thoughtful character novel focuses on Macon Leary, a travel writer who hates to travel, a man who has gone through life observing what is happening, but who has never been truly engaged.  Compulsively tidy, Macon has always believed that it is possible to order one's life so effectively that the untidiness, or chaos, that throws life into confusion can be avoided.  And then his beloved 12-year-old son is cold-bloodedly murdered in the senseless robbery of a burger joint while he is away at camp for the first time.    It gives away nothing of the plot to say that this event totally undoes Macon and his wife, and their polite and predictable marriage goes into a tailspin.  When the novel opens, Macon and Sarah have decided to separate, with Sarah getting her own apartment (where she can be as messy as she wants) and Macon remaining in the house with his son Ethan's undisciplined dog Edward.  In fact, Macon has moved back with his sister and brothers in the family house, to recuperate from his physical wounds--an accident in which he breaks his leg-- and from his emotional wounds.    Then into his life comes Muriel, a divorcee with an over-protected, allergic, and hypersensitive son.  She is a dog trainer, a flake, the only person willing to undertake the task of civilizing the aggressive, sometimes vicious \"pet\" that lives with Macon.  As Macon tries to deal with his life, his loss of Sarah (who is dating), his son's dog (which attacks anything that moves), and his commitment to producing yet another travel book, his life becomes more complicated, and the depth of his relationship with Sarah, relative to the shared loss they have faced, becomes an issue which must be revisited if he is ever to engage with life and explore the possibilities of a new life which Muriel offers.    Filled with wonderful descriptions of life, both within Macon's family and in Europe, where he travels for research, the novel provides the reader with a full, realistic picture of marriage between people whose relationship has been, in part, the result of their commitment to their son.  Poignant and emotional, but avoiding melodrama, the novel explores the meaning of life and love, the extent to which a marriage may limit or stimulate the growth of the people involved, and the ways in which a marriage must adapt to the new needs of the participants if it is to endure through time. n Mary Whipple", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

If you're familiar with the writings of Wong Kiew Kit he often states that you can't learn genuine martial arts like Taijiquan and Shaolin Kung Fu from a book.  You need to learn from a master because there are too many subtleties that will be missed without a proper instructor.  So when Wong Kiew Kit states that:     \"I have no Taijiquan lineage. I did not learn from any well-known living Taijiquan masters. I mainly learned from Taijiquan classics, and was able to interpret and practice what past masters had written because of my thorough Shaolin training.\"  Which is similar to saying:    \"I have no Shaolin lineage. I did not learn from any well-known living Shaolin masters. I mainly learned from Shaolin classics, and was able to interpret and practice what past masters had written because of my thorough Taijiquan training.\"    There's no way Wong Kiew Kit would tolerate someone claiming to be a master of Shaolin Kung Fu without having learned from a teacher belonging to a lineage.  On his website he states that:    \"Not a single person of those who have learnt Taijiquan from me complains about my lack of a Taijiquan lineage. In fact, no one seems to care about this lineage issue. On the other hand, they are satisfied that what they have leant(sic) from me is very close to the kind of Taijiquan practiced by masters in the past.\"  How are these people qualified to gauge how closely Wong Kiew Kit's Taiji compares to Taijiquan masters of the past?   Did they time travel and study under these past masters?  Or do they have a gut feeling like I have a gut feeling that I can learn Shaolin Kung Fu from a Taiji instructor?  It's quite likely that WKK is teaching a modified version of Shaolin Kung Fu that uses Taiji principles gleaned from his interpretation of the classics.      I won't deny that Wong Kiew Kit is probably Shaolin master, but there's no evidence to suggest that he is teaching an authentic form of Taiji.  He has admitted that his entire knowledge of Taijiquan has mainly come from books and scriptures, not from a living breathing human being trained in a proper lineage.  Call it whatever you want to WKK, but don't mislead people into thinking its Taijiquan.  Telling people to learn from masters and not from books and then doing it yourself is completley hypocritical.      In the end, of what value is a \"Tai Chi Chuan\" book that was written by someone who has no real \"Tai Chi Chuan\" training?    In response to a new review, let me mention a few things:    One reviewer presupposes that Taiji branched off from Shaolin, but there's so much debate about the origins of Taiji its to hard to make any concrete statements about it.    The Wikipedia page on Zhang Sanfeng states that:     \"Much of the written material about him is mythical, contradictory, or otherwise suspect. For instance, he is reported by different people to have been born either in 960, 1247, or in 1279.\"    There's almost no proof to suggest that he actually existed, or that he created Taiji out of Shaolin.  But what tends to be agreed upon is that all forms of Taiji branched off from Chen Style when Yang Lu-Chan learned the art and spread his version of Taiji (Yang Style) across China.       This reviewer and his master may have proper training in a Taiji, and I won't contest that, but as WKK explicitly states, he has none.  He seems to mistake WKK's lack of proper instruction from a Taiji master as modesty.  If  \"modesty\" is what you are looking for in a teacher, may I too be \"modest\" about my lack of proper instruction in Shaolin, and offer you my instruction; perhaps even a book about something that I have no proper instruction in.          WKK does state that you should not learn Taiji without a proper instructor, but he himself did just that.  Maybe he could provide us with the origins of his undistinguished lineage to settle the argument?      When the reviewer says that the Shaolin Temple is the \"supreme martial arts college throughout all of Buddhist China's history,\" it really is just a matter of opinion.  Not everyone views the Shaolin Temple in such a holy light.  Everything WKK writes in his books about the history of martial arts, the Shaolin temple and Buddhism ends up supporting his qualifications as a teacher; which is a major conflict of interest.  All the legends about Bodhidharma and Zhang Sanfeng are stated as fact without being prefaced with a warning about the highly mythical nature of their history.  He uses the iffy Taiji developing from Shaolin story to justify his lack of Taiji lineage.  If you were a prospective customer you would be highly discouraged by the whole no-lineage thing.  But when he feeds you the Taiji developing from Shaolin stuff the reader thinks, \"If Taiji developed from Shaolin, WKK must be a Master of both.\"  WKK sounds pretty great if he is the one writing the history books", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

Many others have delved into the finer points of Menzies' poor methodology and often deliberate exaggeration or falsities, so I won't bother. I'll only list four points that I think stand out even without deep fact checking:    1)Niccolo di Conti, the venetian explorer and crucial link in the book who supposedly sailed with the Chinese treasure fleet in 1421, failed to mention in his memoirs anything about Chinese junks or going to the four corners of the world. This seems strange.    2)The Fleet sailed to virtually every coastline in the world but missed Europe entirely, the one place sure to mark their passing for posterity. This is neither evidence nor disproof, merely a sketchy coincidence.    3)Native Americans are given startlingly short shrift, both in the book and in many of the reviews. Virtually every time something sophisticated is presented in the ancient new world it is attributed to the Chinese, reminding me of the Easter Island \"mystery\" of who carved those giant heads. For the record, Native populations weren't childish savages; prior to European contact they had very sophisticated civilizations, fully capable of jewelery work, cloth garments, and carving statues.    4)Lastly, Given the vast numbers of Chinese sailors involved(roughly 25-30,000), the presence of domesticated animals such as horses and pigs, and the inevitable presence of huge numbers of stow-away rats, doesn't it strike anyone as odd that there were apparently no diseases passed on to the various native populations in the Americas? It only took a very small amount of European contact to spark the largest, and deadliest pandemic in history that raged for nearly two centuries killing unknown millions of Native Americans. Chinese contact of the scale claimed would certainly have had a similar, if not worse, effect.

Adams is clearly a thoughtful Christian man who cares about husbands and wives. My problem: his definition of those roles are too old-fashioned and rigid for my taste. Just so you know, I am not a liberal woman who either ignores the Bible or is ignorant of its teaching; I know the Biblical teachings on marriage and it is their instructions I disagree with Adams about. He consistently calls the wife the \"helper\", which diminishes the aspect of partnership that I believe marriage should be. A leader and a helper is not a partnership, it is basically one central figure and a secondary figure who helps them. Adams stresses the specialness of a helper to uplift the concept, but is apparently unaware that the role still pushes a sense of lesserness on the woman's side because, if a wife is a helper, who is she helping? The husband! The man is still the central figure and the wife is not seen as his mate, but his \"helper\", a moon revolving around a sun. His beliefs basically come from the age-old concept of, in regards to a wife's role, taking the Biblical word \"Submit\" and turning it into \"obey\". Honey, they're not the same. Submission, unlike obedience, can be mutual and does not always have to do with authority. The concept of marital submission, I believe, is basically to surrender to another's needs and put the other before oneself; this does not at all necessarily mean obeying! Therefore, Adam's words that the husband is never to submit to the wife were incorrect. Certainly the husband is never supposed to obey his wife, but he is clearly expected to submit to her needs. The Bible stresses the importance of the husband laying down his life for his wife if necessary; that is HUGE submission on the husband's part. Submitting to a spouse should not be a matter of one ruling over the other, but rather a matter of both spouses making sacrifices out of love and respect for each other.     Adams' words of wifely obedience were very grating to me, especially when he tried giving examples of when a wife should refuse a sinful \"command\" from her husband. If a husband freely commands his wife, we've got bigger problems than whether the command itself is sinful or not. Adam's advice for the wife to \"respectfully\" refuse a sinful command also rather threw me, since his example of a sinful command was if a husband wanted his wife to play spouse-swap with another couple. His idea of what to say to such a husband? \"I must respectfully say no. You must not ask me to sin and I cannot do that.\" Firstly, if a husband actually had the nerve to ask his wife to do something like that (or command it, in Adams' words), he'd be lucky if a disrespectful answer was all he got. Secondly, I defy anyone to find a self-respecting wife who actually talks that way. The monotone of that robotic answer gave me the impression that Adams' taken this obedience thing a little too far. This impression was strengthened with his example of how a counselor should advise a woman who \"has not been a good helper\". His advice: \"They (wives) must be trained to put on helpful deeds, a step many counselors overlook.\" Maybe counselors overlook this because the concept of training women to be obedient helpers is, rightly, obsolete for most people.     Books like these, which so rigidly define the roles of spouses, have a tendency to simultaneously overcomplicate and oversimplify marriage (not an easy thing to do, but they manage). They oversimplify marriage because they seem to believe that if women just obey and respect their husbands and if husbands just love and nurture their wives, the marriage will go swimmingly. It is NOT that simple! Marriage is not a recipe with instructions, it's a union between two people who will occassionaly have conflicting ideas, and conflicts will NOT magically vanish if one spouse always gives in to the other. This method also overcomplicates things because it stresses the idea of training women to be followers rather than just letting them be led by love and respect for their husbands and letting the rest fall into place on its own.     Every marriage is different; it should be Godly, of course, but you cannot make the roles of spouses cookie-cutter. Christian books tend to do this mainly as a result of the author taking the Bible too literally. Adams does this by saying that, because the Bible tells the husband and not the wife to love, loving is primarily the husband's job. He went on to say that, if a husband complains that there is little love in the marriage, his counselor should tell him that it's mainly his fault! Honestly, this alarmed me more than his earlier words about counselors training women to be helpers (what kind of counselors are these, anyway?). To automatically blame either spouse for a marital problem based on your personal interpretation of the Bible instead of what's actually happening in the marriage is a little scary (if a professional counselor does this, it's downright terrifying). The interpretation itself is rather skewed; the Bible stresses on women giving respect and men giving love because respect is something that most men already give naturally and love is already something that women give naturally. It does NOT mean that the husband is the only one who has to love and the wife only has to respect, so to blame a lack of love automatically on the husband is simply unfair and silly. There are plenty of women who have a hard time loving and men who have a hard time respecting; you cannot simply assume which spouse is at fault because of Biblical instructions.     This is not a bad book, but unless you view marriage in the same rigid terms as Adams, it probably won't do much for you. If it focused more on mutual love and respect rather than defining one sort of behavior for one particular spouse, it would've worked a lot better for me.", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

Stockdale, CVN-77 . We all know Repbulicans don't care much for the environment, and now we're chopping down trees to give more praise to a man whose son's ambition is paid for with American lives. Why was this book written? Are trhe Bush-Kochs suddenly strapped for cash?      The book, if you can focus on a father and daughter that aren't dripping with wealth and power, is good enough. I like GHWB, voted for him, but the lovefest is going way overboard.     And as for the $500 billion dollar aircraft carrier (the tenth and final Nimitz-class supercarrier) just commisioned and named after George, Sr---it was absolutely wrong to do so. The man CVN-77 should have been named after is Admiral James B. Stockdale. Admiral Stockdale, a distinguished naval aviator and test pilot flight instructor, flew over 240 carrier-based missions, earned 28 combat decorations, and after being shot down over North Vietnam in 1965, spent 8 years as a P.O.W., 4 years in leg irons, 2 years in complete darkness, tortured and beaten daily. It is amazing that he didn't go blind after 2 years in darkness, malnourished and sleeping on concrete. Despite all of his pain, his primary concern was always the welfare of his fellow prisoners and that they received enough food and proper medical care. Stockdale even organized a hunger strike when one prisoner was denied medical treatment. At one point, he knew that one of his fellow P.O.W.s was guilty of an infraction that would possibly lead to that prisoner's execution. His captors knew Stockdale knew who the guilty prisoner was, and tortured Stockdale without mercy. Knowing there would be more torture and fearful he would crack and give out the prisoner's name, Stockdale attempted suicide. Rather than bear the thought of one of his fellow prisoners being executed or subjected to the pain that was inflicted on him, he tried to take his own life. Stockdale's suicide attempt was unsuccessful, yet in the attempt, was the ultimate statement about Admiral James B. Stockdale, that he would rather have died than see a fellow American soldier suffer pain or death at the hands of their captors.

This is a great book, and well worth purchasing if you want to learn about finances for investment properties.  It is not all that it could be, but don't let that stop you from using it to get started.  All that having been said, here are the things that I had to be careful about:  1) Ten performance measurements and ratios are presented in chapter 6, and they represent the heart of the book.  There is little overview of which ones are most importance or how to use or weigh conflicting or offsetting results.  2) The book is heavily centered on spreadsheets, which the author offers to sell to you.  Others have criticized the spreadsheets for being locked.  I used the book to recreate my own version of the spreadsheets, and the extensive explanations in the book helped, mostly, to make sure that I got the underlying formulas correct.  What I noticed, however, is that the book sorely needed a financially sophisticated editor.  For example, the spreadsheet on page 193 has an entry for \"Expense/Foot.\"  In fact, this entry is none other than the OER - Operating Expense Ratio - that was developed in Chapter 6.  Why go to all the trouble to create and define ratios, if you aren't then going to use them.  Other parts of the spreadsheets were equally problematic.  For example, the Net CF's - presumably \"cash flow\" - for a 3 year exit only had the receipts for years 1 and 2, and not for year 3.  Lastly, the book has nothing to say about (a) maintaining and growing a real estate portfolio of multiple properties as opposed to a single property, or (b) evaluating the relatively new 1031 multiple tenants in common investments that some long time owners are trading into in order to stop being a full time property manager as well as an investor.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

A group of anarchists (well-funded ones) have discovered a way to force a polar shift of the magnetic north and south pole.

It was, rather, a very evenly paced novel in which many of the developments involved terrorism and the government's response to the terrorists' acts.

The legislation involved giving the police easier rules and access to search people and their homes.
