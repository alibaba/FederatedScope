It inhabits low shrublands and, rarely, dry forests, at elevations from sea level to 2500 ft . Associated native plant species include aki\u02bb aki (\"Sporobolus virginicus\"), ilima (\"Sida fallax\"), naupaka kahakai (\"Scaevola taccada\"), and pili (\"Heteropogon contortus\"). Off-road vehicles, wildfires, grazing, and alien species competition have destroyed their habitat on the main islands, but they are still quite common on Nihoa and Necker. At least 2000 specimens grow on Nihoa, while there are far less on Necker. Context_2 : The O\u02bb ahu nukupu\u02bb u (\"Hemignathus lucidus\") was a species of nukupu\u02bb u which was similar to its cousins from the Islands of Kaua\u02bb i and Maui. Context_3 : Touchardia latifolia, commonly known as olon\u0101 in Hawaiian, is a species of flowering shrub in the nettle family, Urticaceae. \"T. latifolia\" is endemic to Hawaii and inhabits mesic valleys and wet forests at elevations of 70 - . Typical to many Hawaiian plants, the olon\u0101 does not have the stinging hairs of its mainland cousins. It is found on all the main Hawaiian islands except Kaho\u02bb olawe and Ni\u02bb ihau. Olon\u0101 has alternate leaves whose shape greatly varies depending upon the environment from thin lancolate to broad elliptic. The large range in leaf variation once divided \"T. latifolia\" into more than 10 species, which are currently considered to be one. Olon\u0101 typically flowers between the months of May through December The female flowers are borne on branching cymes which become fleshy orange berry-like achenes, and the male flowers are white. Olon\u0101 is easily cultivated (83% germination rate), and sprouts readily from cuttings, but does not transplant well due to its fragile roots. Context_4 : Molokai ( ; Hawaiian: ] ), nicknamed \u201cThe Friendly Isle\u201d is the fifth largest island of eight major islands that make up the Hawaiian Island Chain in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

Context_5 : The Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands was the prelate having ordinary jurisdiction of the \"Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands\". The Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands was created by the Holy See in 1847 as the Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands. In 1848, the phrase \"Sandwich Islands\" was dropped and replaced by \"Hawaiian Islands.\" The first Vicar Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands (and the Hawaiian Islands) was Msgr. Louis Desir\u00e9 Maigret, SS.CC. The Vicariate derives from the Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, established in 1825 and which was to become in 1833, a part of the larger territory under the ordinary jurisdiction of the Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania entrusted to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Context_6 : The Maui nukupu\u02bb u (\"Hemignathus affinis\") is a species of nukupu\u2018u Hawaiian honeycreeper that is endemic to the island of Maui in the Hawaiian Islands. The small, five-inch-long bird lives only in eastern Maui, where it is dependent on high-elevation mesic and wet forests of \u02bb \u014dhi\u02bb a lehua (\"Metrosideros polymorpha\") and koa (\"Acacia koa\"). These two species of trees attract insects, causing the Maui nukupu\u02bb u to have a higher chance of finding a meal near these trees. Context_7 : Microlepia strigosa, known as hay-scented fern, lace fern, rigid lace fern and palapalai in Hawaiian, is a fern indigenous to the Hawaiian islands and is also native to other parts of the tropics and subtropics including India and Malaysia. This fern belongs to a group of about seventy \"Microlepia\" species in the bracken or hay-scented fern family (Dennstaedtiaceae). There are two indigenous species and a hybrid found in the main Hawaiian Islands.

It rises in the Little Belt Mountains and flows northeast past Utica and Hobson. It is joined by Dry Wolf Creek in northern Fergus County, and itself joins the Missouri in the White Cliffs Area approximately 18\u00a0mi (29\u00a0km) northwest of Winifred. Context_2 : Smith River is a tributary of the Missouri River, in central Montana, in the United States.

Context_3 : The Lewis and Clark Bridge is a historic bridge in Wolf Point, Montana, which once carried Montana Highway 13 across the Missouri River between McCone and Roosevelt counties. It is also known as Wolf Point Bridge, Missouri River Bridge, or Site No. 24RV438. The bridge is a five-span Pennsylvania through truss; its longest span is the longest through truss span in the state at 400 ft . Completed in 1930 by the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Company, the bridge was the first bridge across the Missouri River at Wolf Point and the only bridge along the river for a 350 mi stretch. The bridge's opening ceremony, which took place on July 9, drew over 10,000 visitors and included five bands and a fireworks display. After its completion, the bridge became a popular tourist attraction for motorists in northeastern Montana and a point of civic pride for Wolf Point's residents. Context_4 : Cow Creek is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 35 mi long, in north central Montana in the United States. Cow Creek rises in the southern foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains in western Blaine County and flows east and then south, joining the Missouri approximately 25 mi northeast of Winifred, Montana\u2014or 22 mi upstream from the Fred Robinson Bridge. Cow Creek flows down to the Missouri in a canyon that passes through the Missouri Breaks, which are severely eroded badlands that extend out on either side from the Missouri River. The floor of Cow Creek canyon provided a pathway of travel from the Montana plains north of the river, down to the Missouri \u2013 at the mouth of Cow Creek, Cow Island made fording the Missouri easier \u2013 a steep but short trail on the south bank of the Missouri opposite Cow Creek completed this route which led from the northern Montana plains to the central and southern Montana plains. This pathway was used by migrating buffalo/bison and nomadic American Natives for centuries. During the steamboat era on the Missouri River, when low water prevented riverboats getting up to Fort Benton, the mouth of Cow Creek became a river landing and freighting depot, and it was the start of the Cow Island Trail by which freight was moved on to Fort Benton by going north up Cow Creek and then west. In 1877 the Nez Perce Indian Tribe, fleeing to Canada, had several skirmishes along Cow Creek including the \"Battle of Cow Island\", and several days later at a camp on Cow Creek the Nez Perce, thinking themselves now beyond the reach of the U.S. Army, made the fateful decision to slow down, rather than push on for the Canada\u2013US border. Today, modern highways have by passed Cow Creek, and the buffalo and the nomadic Indian are gone. Cow Creek is dormant, in one of the most remote spots of the isolated regions of the vast area known as the Montana Missouri Breaks. Context_5 : Lewis and Clark Pass, el. 6424 ft is a mountain pass on the continental divide in Montana. It lies at the head of the drainages of the west flowing Blackfoot River and the east flowing Dearborn River. The pass is in the Helena National Forest in Lewis and Clark County. The Continental Divide Trail traverses north and south through the pass. At the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition the pass was a much-used pathway where the native people living in what today is Montana crossed over the continental divide. The pass was crossed by Meriwether Lewis on July 7, 1806, on the return leg of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with a party of nine men and his dog Seaman. The pass was named for the expedition's two leaders\u2013Lewis and William Clark. Lewis and Clark Pass is the only roadless pass on the entire Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. It has gone from being one of the most used continental divide passes prior to the pioneer era to one of the least visited passes today. It can be accessed by a 1.5 mi trail. Visitors will encounter the pass much as Lewis did in 1806. The furrows left by the countless dog and horse travois that crossed the pass are still visible (though fading) and this is one of the places along the expedition's route that visitors may still encounter a grizzly bear. On a clear day, like Meriwether Lewis in 1806 one can see Square Butte in Cascade County, Montana, 40 mi to the northeast. Context_6 : The Cracon du Nez (also known as Gross Condunez) occasionally also misspelled (on Google Maps and Google Earth) as the Crocon du Nez, is a sharp sided ridge that divides the Teton River and the Missouri River in Chouteau County, Montana (47.874719\u00b0 -110.598212\u00b0), at a point where the increasing erosion at a large bend of the Missouri River has caused the two rivers to be a mere third of a mile (about 650 yards) apart. The Cracon du Nez ridge is an example of Missouri River stream bank erosion developing toward a future \"stream capture\" of the Teton River flow. A trail runs along the top of the ridge, where in 1865 Little Dog, a chief of the Piegan Blackfoot tribe was ambushed and killed by rebellious and jealous warriors from his own Piegan band. An abandoned railroad tunnel runs under the ridge, part of the former Montana Central Railway branch line of the Great Northern railroad running from Havre to Fort Benton, Great Falls, Helena and Butte. U.S. Highway 87 passes by the ridge and allows the traveler to see the Cracon du Nez. The name is derived from the French and means bridge of the nose, and was probably given by the French boatmen who comprised keelboat crews in the fur trade in the upper Missouri River in Montana during the early decades of the 1800s. Context_7 : Lewis and Clark County is a county located in the U.S. state of Montana. As of the 2010 census, the population was 63,395. Its county seat is Helena, the state capital. The numerical designation for Lewis and Clark County (used in the issuance of the state's license plates) is 5. The county was established in 1865 as Edgerton County, and was renamed \"Lewis and Clark County\" two years later. The present name was given in honor of explorers Lewis and Clark. Context_8 : The 2011 Missouri River floods was a flooding event on the Missouri River in the United States. The flooding was triggered by record snowfall in the Rocky Mountains of Montana and Wyoming along with near-record spring rainfall in central and eastern Montana. All six major dams along the Missouri River released record amounts of water to prevent overflow which led to flooding threatening several towns and cities along the river from Montana to Missouri; in particular Bismarck, North Dakota; Pierre, South Dakota; Dakota Dunes, South Dakota; South Sioux City, Nebraska, Sioux City, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; Council Bluffs, Iowa; Kansas City, Missouri; Jefferson City, Missouri, as well as putting many smaller towns at risk. According to the National Weather Service, in the second half of the month of May 2011, almost a year's worth of rain fell over the upper Missouri River basin. Extremely heavy rainfall in conjunction with an estimated 212 percent of normal snowpack in the Rocky Mountains contributed to this flooding event. Context_9 : The Dearborn River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 70 mi (113 km) long, in central Montana in the United States. It rises in the Lewis and Clark National Forest, near Scapegoat Mountain in the Lewis and Clark Range of the Rocky Mountains at the continental divide, in western Lewis and Clark County. It flows generally southeast through secluded canyons, and joins the Missouri near Craig. Context_10 : The Red Rock River is a roughly 70 mi river in southwestern Montana in the United States. Its drainage basin covers over 1548 mi2 . Its furthest tributary, Hell Roaring Creek, originates in the Beaverhead National Forest within a few hundred meters of the North American Continental Divide and Montana-Idaho border near Brower's Spring, at an elevation of about 9100 ft . Brower's Spring is near the furthest headwaters of the Missouri River, one of the major watercourses of the central United States. The drainage flows north and west with its name changing to \"Red Rock Creek\" into the Red Rock Lakes in the middle of a wide grassy valley; the Red Rock River issues from the west side of Lower Red Rock Lake. It flows west, receiving many tributaries such as Peet Creek and Long Creek, widening into the Lima Reservoir and then passing through a canyon, which ends near Lima, Montana. From there, it flows northwest through a valley, passing Kidd and Red Rock, and into Clark Canyon Reservoir. Under the waters of the lake was once the confluence of the Red Rock and Horse Prairie Creek, forming the Beaverhead River, a tributary of the Jefferson River, in turn a headwater of the Missouri River. fact_1 : The Dearborn River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 70 mi (113 km) long, in central Montana in the United States. fact_2 : Lewis and Clark County is a county located in the U.S. state of Montana.

His eighteen-year term as General Secretary was second only to that of Joseph Stalin in duration. During Brezhnev's rule, the global influence of the Soviet Union grew dramatically, in part because of the expansion of the Soviet military during this time. His tenure as leader was marked by the beginning of an era of economic and social stagnation in the Soviet Union.

The First Chief Directorate was formed within the KGB directorate in 1954, and after the collapse of the Soviet Union was renamed as the Central Intelligence Service and finally the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR RF). Although the agency \"SVR\" restyle in 1991 implies a generic overseas surveillance activity, the primary foreign intelligence service in Russia and the Soviet Union has been the GRU, a military intelligence organization and special operations force shrouded in secrecy, most famed for stealing the blueprints of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project and barring entry into its headquarters to anyone, even the leader of the Soviet Union proper, without a formal authentication.

He was the eighth and last leader of the Soviet Union, having been General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991. He was the country's head of state from 1988 until 1991 (titled as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 1988 to 1989, as Chairman of the from 1989 to 1990, and as Soviet Union]] from 1990 to 1991). Context_4 : Soviet deportations from Lithuania were a series of 35 mass deportations carried out in Lithuania, a country that was occupied as a constituent socialist republic of the Soviet Union, in 1941 and 1945\u20131952. At least 130,000 people, 70% of them women and children, were forcibly transported to labor camps and other forced settlements in remote parts of the Soviet Union, particularly in the Irkutsk Oblast and Krasnoyarsk Krai. Among the deportees were about 4,500 Poles. These deportations do not include Lithuanian partisans or political prisoners (approximately 150,000 people) deported to Gulags (prison camps). Deportations of the civilians served a double purpose: repressing resistance to Sovietization policies in Lithuania and providing free labor in sparsely inhabited areas of the Soviet Union. Approximately 28,000 of Lithuanian deportees died in exile due to poor living conditions. After Stalin's death in 1953, the deportees were slowly and gradually released. The last deportees were released only in 1963. Some 60,000 managed to return to Lithuania, while 30,000 were prohibited from settling back in their homeland. Similar deportations took place in Latvia, Estonia, and other parts of the Soviet Union (see Soviet deportations from Estonia and population transfer in the Soviet Union). Lithuania observes the annual Mourning and Hope Day on June 14 in memory of those deported.

These directives for the Eighth Five-Year Plan was approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and by the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union but no final version was apparently ever ratified by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, some of the changes envisioned were made. Context_6 : Karl Selter (born June 24, 1898 in Koeru, Estonia \u2013 died January 31, 1958 in Geneva, Switzerland) was an Estonian politician and a Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia. He served as Minister of Economic Affairs from 1933 to 1938 and as minister of Foreign affairs from 1938 to 1939. His historically most memorable act was to sign a non-aggression and mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet leaders in Moscow in September 1939. This was also his personal and national Estonian most tragic act. It followed a brutal ultimatum from the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov on September 24. Molotov said to Setler: Estonia gained sovereignty when the Soviet Union was powerless, but you \u201cdon\u2019t think that this can last\u2026 forever\u2026 The Soviet Union is now a great power whose interests need to be taken into consideration. I tell you\u2014the Soviet Union needs enlargement of her security guarantee system; for this purpose she needs an exit to the Baltic Sea \u2026 I ask you, do not compel us to use force against Estonia.\u201d The enforced in this manner treaty gave the Soviet army a right to set up military bases in Estonia, and it significantly reduced Estonia's independence until Estonia was formally incorporated into the Soviet Union between June and August 1940. Selter left Estonia in November 1939, resigning both as Foreign Minister and as a member of Parliament. He moved to Geneva, Switzerland as a diplomat. After Germany occupied Estonia between 1941 and 1944, and after it was re-incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1944, he stayed in Switzerland as an exiled diplomat and politician.

Personal friend of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Willy Brandt and Giorgio Napolitano, Zagladin was the theorist of a reformed communism, very close to European social democracy. Context_8 : The Soviet Union was dissolved on December 26, 1991. It was a result of the declaration number 142-\u041d of the Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The declaration acknowledged the independence of the former Soviet republics and created the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), although five of the signatories ratified it much later or did not do so at all. On the previous day, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the eighth and final leader of the Soviet Union, resigned, declared his office extinct, and handed over its powers \u2013 including control of the Soviet nuclear missile launching codes \u2013 to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. That evening at 7:32, the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time and replaced with the pre-revolutionary Russian flag. Context_9 : Under the 1977 Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state. The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a prime minister in the First World, whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a president in the First World. In the Soviet Union's seventy-year history there was no official \"leader of the Soviet Union\" office, but during most of that era there was a \"de facto\" top leader who usually led the country through the office of the Premier or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In the ideology of Vladimir Lenin the head of the Soviet state was a collegiate body of the vanguard party (see \"What Is to Be Done?\"). Context_10 : The Barricades (Latvian: \"Barik\u0101des\" ) were a series of confrontations between Latvia and forces loyal to the Soviet Union in January 1991 which took place mainly in Riga. The events are named for the popular effort of building and protecting barricades from 13 January until about 27 January. Latvia, which had declared restoration of independence from the Soviet Union a year earlier, anticipated that Soviet Union might attempt to regain control over the country by force. After attacks by the Soviet OMON on Riga in early January, the government called on people to build barricades for protection of possible targets (mainly in the capital city of Riga and nearby Ulbroka, as well as Kuld\u012bga and Liep\u0101ja). Six people were killed in further attacks, several were wounded in shootings or beaten by OMON. Most victims were shot during the Soviet attack on the Latvian Ministry of the Interior on January 20. One other person died in a building accident reinforcing the barricades. Casualties among Soviet loyalists are considered likely, but the exact number remains unknown. A total of 15,611 people have registered as having been participants of the Barricades. fact_1 : Vadim Valentinovich Zagladin (June 23, 1927 - November 17, 2006), Soviet politician and ideologist, was one of the leading theoreticians of Perestroika. fact_2 :  He was the eighth and last leader of the Soviet Union, having been General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991.

When Ivan, together with his wife, arrives in America, \"the land of freedom,\" he learns four \"lesson[s] in Americanism\" that turn him into a respectful husband with regard to his wife.

When she succumbs under the weight of the bundle, Ivan starts prodding her with a stick, threatening to beat her. A gentleman approaches them, picks up the bundle and puts it on Ivan's back. The gentleman takes the stick from Ivan, hands it to the wife and shows her how to prod Ivan. The second \"lesson in Americanism\" takes place in the couple's new home at Odessa Inn. Threatening his wife, Ivan asks her to take off his shoes. He beats her and knocks her to the floor. A man comes in and asks Ivan to put the wife in bed. After Ivan reluctantly does that, the man knocks him down to the floor the way Ivan did to his wife. The third lesson takes place in the countryside. The couple no longer lives at the inn but owns a house and some land. The wife no longer wears a scarf. She toils in the garden, while Ivan sits in a chair smoking a pipe.

Context_5 : Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} ( ; ]    ; 24 August 1899 \u2013 14 June 1986) was an Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator, and a key figure in Spanish-language literature. His best-known books, \"Ficciones\" (\"Fictions\") and \"El Aleph\" (\"The Aleph\"), published in the 1940s, are compilations of short stories interconnected by common themes, including dreams, labyrinths, libraries, mirrors, fictional writers, philosophy, and religion. Context_6 : Borges on Mart\u00edn Fierro concerns Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges's comments on Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez's nineteenth century poem \"Mart\u00edn Fierro\". Like most of his compatriots, Borges was a great admirer of this work, which he often characterized as the one clearly great work in Argentine literature. Because \"Mart\u00edn Fierro\" has been widely considered (beginning with Leopoldo Lugones's \"El Payador\", 1916) the fountainhead or pinnacle of Argentine literature, Argentina's \"Don Quixote\" or \"Divine Comedy\", and because Borges was certainly Argentina's greatest twentieth-century writer, Borges's 1953 book of essays about the poem and its critical and popular reception - \"El \"Mart\u00edn Fierro\"\" (written with Margarita Guerrero) - gives insight into Borges's identity as an Argentine. Context_7 : Jorge Luis Borges and mathematics concerns several modern mathematical concepts found in certain essays and short stories of Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986), including concepts such as set theory, recursion, chaos theory, and infinite sequences, although Borges' strongest links to mathematics are through Georg Cantor's theory of infinite sets, outlined in \"The Doctrine of Cycles\" (\"La doctrina de los ciclos\"). Some of Borges' most popular works such as \"The Library of Babel\" (\"La Biblioteca de Babel\"), \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" (\"El Jard\u00edn de Senderos que se Bifurcan\"), \"The Aleph\" (\"El Aleph\"), an allusion to Cantor's use of the Hebrew letter aleph (formula_1) to denote cardinality of transfinite sets. and \"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim\" (\"El acercamiento a Almot\u00e1sim\") illustrate his use of mathematics. Context_8 : Harto The Borges is a documentary film by Eduardo Montes-Bradley. \"Harto The Borges\" explores the narcissistic side of Jorge Luis Borges, the author of El Aleph, his frequent and often criticized comments to the press, his distinctive and gentle ironies.

Context_10 : A Bao A Qu is a legendary Mewar creature described in Jorge Luis Borges's 1967 \"Book of Imaginary Beings\". Borges claimed to have found it either in an introduction to the \"Arabian Nights\" by Richard Francis Burton, or in the book \"On Malay Witchcraft\" (1937) by C.C. Iturvuru. The Burton reference was given in the original Spanish, but it was changed to the Iturvuru reference in the English text, possibly to make it sound more exotic, or as a reference to Borges' friend C. C. Iturburu. The writer Antares conjectures that Borges's tale might be inspired by Orang Asli myth, and that \"A Bao A Qu\" is a slurring of \"abang aku\" meaning \"my elder brother\". fact_1 : Wilhelm Reich (24 March 1897 \u2013 3 November 1957) was an Austrian psychoanalyst, a member of the second generation of analysts after Sigmund Freud. fact_2 : Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} ( ; ]    ; 24 August 1899 \u2013 14 June 1986) was an Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator, and a key figure in Spanish-language literature.

It is an annual plant that grows from 5 to 50\u00a0cm tall. Linear or deltate leaves, about 4-34 per plant, are scattered along the elongate, glabrous stem. The leaves are generally 1\u20136\u00a0mm long and 0.3-0.7\u00a0mm wide. Petioles and scapes are absent. Inflorescences are 3\u201318\u00a0cm long. Flowers are pink, white, or mauve and bloom from March to July in the southern hemisphere. \"S. fissilobum\"'s wide distribution ranges across northern Australia from the western Kimberley region and Northern Territory eastward as far as Mount Surprise in Queensland. Its habitat is recorded as being wet sands at swamp edges in association with grasslands and sedgelands. Due to its weak stem, this species often threads its way through supporting branches and leaves of the dense grass and sedge cover. \"S. fissilobum\" is most closely related to \"S. aquaticum\" and \"S. oviflorum\". Its conservation status has been assessed as data deficient. Context_2 : Pleiacanthus is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the aster family containing the single species Pleiacanthus spinosus (formerly \"Stephanomeria spinosa\"), which is known by the common name thorn skeletonweed, or thorny skeletonweed. It is native to the western United States from Montana and Idaho to southern California and Arizona, where it grows in many types of mostly dry habitat from deserts to mountains. It is a spindly subshrub producing several slender stems up to 40 or 50 centimeters tall from a woody caudex. The stems divide many times into short, rigid branches which narrow to sharp thorn-tips. The plant is mostly hairless except for brownish woolly tufts at the base and below the basal leaves. The leaves are small and linear on the lower stem, and reduced to scale-like growths on the upper branches. Flower heads occur near the ends of the branches. Each has a cylindrical base wrapped in one layer of phyllaries. The head contains 3 to 5 ray florets, each with an elongated tube and a pale to bright pink ligule. The fruit is an achene tipped with a cluster of pappus bristles which are not plumelike as are those of the \"Stephanomeria\" species with which this plant was once classified. Context_3 : Euphorbia trigona (also known as African milk tree, cathedral cactus, Abyssinian euphorbia, and high chaparall ) is a perennial plant that originally comes from Central Africa. It has an upright stem that is branched into three or four sides. The stem itself is dark green with V-shaped light green patterns. The about 5mm long thorns are placed in pairs of two on the stem's ridges. The drop shaped leaves grow from between the two thorns on each ridge. The plant has never been known to flower, and is possibly a hybrid. As with many other \"Euphorbia\" species, the latex from the plant is poisonous and can cause skin irritations. The trigona can withstand brief cold temperatures of up to -3 degrees. It prefers sandy soil but can withstand most types of soil, provided it is well draining. It can root very easily from stem cuttings, if allowed to dry for 3-7 days before planting so that it can form a callus and not rot. It grows from 1.5 - 3 meters. It is a pest-free plant. A problem that some trigonas face is that they are susceptible to falling over when fully grown because of their shallow and small root system Context_4 : Rorippa palustris is a species of flowering plant in the mustard family. It is widespread and native to parts of Africa, and much of Asia, Europe and Eurasia, North America and the Caribbean. It can also be found in other parts of the world as an introduced species and a common weed, for example, in Australia and South America. It is an adaptable plant which grows in many types of damp, wet, and aquatic habitat. It may be an annual, biennial, or perennial plant, and is variable in appearance as well. It produces an erect stem, sometimes with branches, attaining a maximum height of just over one meter. The leaves are up to 30 centimeters long and have toothed to deeply lobed edges. The inflorescence is a raceme of mustardlike flowers with spoon-shaped yellow petals each a few millimeters in length. The fruit is a dehiscent and smoothly valved silicle, up to a centimeter long, and containing anywhere from 20 to 90 minute seeds. Context_5 : Rorippa austriaca is a species of flowering plant in the mustard family known by the common names Austrian yellow-cress and Austrian fieldcress. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, and it is known in North America as an introduced species and sometimes a noxious weed. It can grow in disturbed habitat, such as roadsides, and in very wet habitat such as mudflats. It is a perennial herb growing upright to erect, reaching a maximum height near one meter. The branching stem bears hairless blue-green lance-shaped leaves up to 10 centimeters long. The bases of the upper leaves clasp the stem. The inflorescence is a raceme at the top of the stem and the ends of stem branches. The mustardlike flowers have small yellow petals. The fruit is a plump silique a few millimeters long, but many plants do not fruit and seed production is rare. Reproduction in this species is more often vegetative, the plants concentrating their growth in belowground tissue and spreading clonally. The root system of the plant is particularly aggressive, sending up many new plants as it spreads. Context_6 : Stephanomeria elata is a species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common names Santa Barbara wirelettuce and Nuttall's wirelettuce. It is native to Oregon and California, where it grows in coastal and inland mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada. It can be found in many types of habitat. It is an annual herb producing a slender, erect stem often exceeding one meter in maximum height. It is hairy to hairless and often glandular. The leaves are mostly located in a basal rosette, the largest reaching 10 centimeters long. Smaller, much-reduced leaves occur farther up the stem. The leaves drop early, leaving the plant naked for most of the year. Flowers occur singly or in small clusters along the stiff branches. Each head contains up to 15 or 16 ray florets, each with an elongated tube and a pink ligule 6 or 7 millimeters long. The fruit is an achene tipped with a spreading cluster of long, plumelike pappus bristles. Context_7 : In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. Context_8 : Stephanomeria diegensis is a species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common name San Diego wirelettuce. It is native to the coastal hills and ranges of southern California and Baja California, where it grows in many types of open habitat. It evolved as a hybrid of \"Stephanomeria exigua\" and \"S. virgata\". Furthermore, it is thought to be the result of homoploid hybrid speciation, which is uncommon. The plant is frequently misidentified as one of its parents, especially if older taxonomic keys are used. This is an erect annual herb easily exceeding two meters in height. Its slender stem has many spreading branches. The basal leaves are linear to lance-shaped and up to 10 centimeters long. The leaves wither early and are absent for most of the year, giving the plant a twiglike appearance. Leaves on the upper stem are small and reduced. The inflorescences are usually clusters of flower heads located at intervals on the stiff branches. Each head has a cylindrical base lined with phyllaries. These are often glandular. The head contains several ray florets, each with an elongated tube and a white or pink-tinged ligule measuring around a centimeter long. The fruit is a grooved achene tipped with a spreading cluster of long, plumelike pappus bristles. Context_9 : Maquira is a genus of trees in the Moraceae family, native to South America. Context_10 : Stylidium dunlopianum is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the genus \"Stylidium\" (family Stylidiaceae). It is an erect perennial plant that grows from 15 to 50\u00a0cm tall. Obovate leaves, about 6-12 per plant, form a basal rosette with some scattered along the stem. The leaves are generally 20\u201360\u00a0mm long and 7\u201319\u00a0mm wide. This species generally has one to five scapes and cymose inflorescences that are 13\u201340\u00a0cm long. Flowers are pink or mauve. \"S. dunlopianum\"'s distribution ranges from the Mitchell River area in Western Australia east to the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. Its typical habitats include sandy or black organic soils along creekbanks, near rainforests, or in seepage areas in \"Melaleuca leucadendra\" swamps. It flowers in the southern hemisphere from May to November. \"S. dunlopianum\" is most closely related to \"S. rotundifolium\", but differs most significantly by its thickened stem base and growth habit. \"S. dunlopianum\" is a perennial whereas \"S. rotundifolium\" is an annual. Its conservation status has been assessed as data deficient. fact_1 : Maquira is a genus of trees in the Moraceae family, native to South America. fact_2 : In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species.

Context_8 : In 2014, a series of protests, political demonstrations, and civil insurrection began in Venezuela due to the country's high levels of urban violence, inflation, and chronic shortages of basic goods attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls. While protests occurred in January 2014, after the murder of actress and former Miss Venezuela M\u00f3nica Spear, mass protesting began in earnest that February following the attempted rape of a student on a university campus in San Crist\u00f3bal. Subsequent arrests and killings of student protestors spurred their expansion to neighboring cities and the involvement of opposition leaders. The year's early months were characterized by large demonstrations and violent clashes between protestors and government forces that resulted in nearly 4,000 arrests and 43 deaths, including both supporters and opponents of the government. Toward the end of 2014, and into 2015, continued shortages and low oil prices caused renewed protesting. By 2016, protests occurred following the controversy surrounding the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections as well as the incidents surrounding the 2016 recall referendum. On 1 September 2016, the largest demonstration of the protests occurred, with over 1 million Venezuelans, or over 3% of the entire nation's population, gathered to demand a recall election against President Maduro, with the event being described as the \"largest demonstration in the history of Venezuela\". Following the suspension of the recall referendum by the government-leaning National Electoral Council (CNE) on 21 October 2016, the opposition organized another protest which was held on 26 October 2016, with over 1.2 million Venezuelans participating. After some of the largest protests occurred in a late-2016, Vatican-mediate dialogue between the opposition and government was attempted and ultimately failed in January 2017. Concentration on protests subsided in the first months of 2017 until the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis occurred when the pro-government Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela attempted to assume the opposition-led National Assembly and removed their immunity, though the move was reversed days later, demonstrations grew \"into the most combative since a wave of unrest in 2014\". The protests are considered to be the Mother of all Protests.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.", "input": "Context_1 : A vocal register is a range of tones in the human voice produced by a particular vibratory pattern of the vocal folds. These registers include modal voice (or normal voice), vocal fry, falsetto, and the whistle register. Context_2 : A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\"passaggio\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \"Fach\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. Context_3 : \"My Friend\" is a song performed by Croatian singer Jacques Houdek. The song represented Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. It was released as a digital download on 2 March 2017, and is the first Croatian entry to contain lyrics in the Italian language. Houdek alternates between singing in Italian using his chest register and in English using his head and falsetto registers. Context_4 : The bass singing voice has a vocal range that lies around the second E below middle C to the E above middle C (i.e., E\u2013E). As with the contralto singing voice being the rarest female voice type, the bass voice is the rarest for males, and has the lowest vocal range of all voice types. However, the bass voice is determined not only by its vocal range, but also by its timbre, which tends to be darker than that of a baritone voice. Context_5 : Falsettone is a term used in modern Italian musicology to describe a vocal technique used by male opera singers in the past, in which the fluty sounds typical of falsetto singing are amplified by using the same singing technique used in the modal voice register. The result is a bright, powerful tone, often very high-pitched, although the sound is still different from and more feminine than what is produced by the modal voice. The term \"falsettone\" is also used for the mixed vocal register that can be achieved using this technique. Context_6 : Georgia Brown, pseudonym of Rossana Monti (born June 29, 1980) is an Italian Brazilian singer noted for her extensive vocal range. She was listed in the 2005 \"Guinness World Records\" for hitting the highest vocal note and for possessing the greatest vocal range for a female, claimed to be exactly eight octaves from G-G using scientific pitch notation. However, as of 2013, Tim Storms holds the record for the widest vocal range of any human with 10 octaves. Context_7 : The vocal fry register (also known as pulse register, laryngealization, pulse phonation, creak, croak, popcorning, glottal fry, glottal rattle, glottal scrape, or strohbass) is the lowest vocal register and is produced through a loose glottal closure which will permit air to bubble through slowly with a popping or rattling sound of a very low frequency. During this phonation, the arytenoid cartilages in the larynx are drawn together which causes the vocal folds to compress rather tightly and become relatively slack and compact. This process forms a large and irregularly vibrating mass within the vocal folds that produces the characteristic low popping or rattling sound when air passes through the glottal closure. The register (if well controlled) can extend far below the modal voice register, in some cases up to 8 octaves lower, such as in the case of Tim Storms who holds the world record for lowest frequency note ever produced by a human, a G\u22127, which is only 0.189\u00a0Hz. Humans however can only hear sounds down to 12\u00a0Hz under ideal conditions. Context_8 : In vocal music, the head voice, depending on vocal pedagogy, is a particular part of the vocal range, or type of vocal register, or a vocal resonance area. Context_9 : Falsetto is the vocal register occupying the frequency range just above the modal voice register and overlapping with it by approximately one octave. It is commonly cited in the context of singing. Context_10 : Falsetto ] (Italian diminutive of \"falso\", \"false\") is the vocal register occupying the frequency range just above the modal voice register and overlapping with it by approximately one octave. fact_1 :  Houdek alternates between singing in Italian using his chest register and in English using his head and falsetto registers. fact_2 : In vocal music, the head voice, depending on vocal pedagogy, is a particular part of the vocal range, or type of vocal register, or a vocal resonance area.

Earlier periods are subject to definition debates. The Franks, for instance, were a union of Germanic tribes; nevertheless, some of the Franks later identified themselves as Dutch, Flemish, French and again others as Germans. The capital of medieval ruler Charlemagne's empire was the city of Aachen, now part of Germany, yet he was a Frank. France was named after the Franks and the Dutch and Flemish people are the only ones to speak a language that descends from Frankish (the language of the Franks). Hence nearly all continental Western European historians can claim his victories as their heritage. The Holy Roman Empire he founded was largely but far from entirely German speaking. The Kingdom of Prussia, which unified Germany in the 19th century, had significant territory in what is now Poland. In the early 19th century, the philosopher Schlegel referred to Germany as a \"Kulturnation\", a nation of shared culture and political disunity, analogous to ancient Greece. Until the unification of 1871, Austria was considered a part of Germany even though much of its empire was not in the Holy Roman Empire and was non-German. Context_2 : Group C of UEFA Euro 2016 contained Germany, Ukraine, Poland and Northern Ireland. Germany was the only former European champion in this group, having won the championship three times (in 1972 and 1980 as West Germany and in 1996 as unified Germany). Matches were played from 12 to 21 June 2016. Context_3 : SMS \"Delphin\" was a \"Cam\u00e4leon\"-class gunboat of the Prussian Navy (later the Imperial German Navy) that was launched in 1860. A small vessel, armed with only three light guns, \"Delphin\" served during the Second Schleswig War of 1864 and the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, part of the conflicts that unified Germany. The ship was present at, but was only lightly engaged in the Battle of Jasmund during the Second Schleswig War. The ship spent much of the rest of her career in the Mediterranean Sea, going on three lengthy deployments there in 1865\u20131866, 1867\u20131870, and 1871\u20131873. During the last tour, she took part in operations off the coast of Spain with an Anglo-German squadron during the Third Carlist War, where she helped to suppress forces rebelling against the Spanish government. For the rest of the 1870s, she served as a survey vessel in the North and Baltic Seas before being decommissioned in August 1881, stricken from the naval register the following month, and subsequently broken up for scrap. Context_4 : Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in Germany have evolved significantly over the course of the last decades. During the 1920s, LGBT people in Berlin were generally tolerated by society and many bars and clubs specifically pertaining to gay men were opened. Although same-sex sexual activity between men was already made illegal under Paragraph 175 by the German Empire in 1871, Nazi Germany extended these laws during World War II, which resulted in the persecution and deaths of thousands of homosexual citizens. The Nazi extensions were repealed in 1950 and same-sex sexual activity between men was decriminalised in both East and West Germany in 1968 and 1969, respectively. The age of consent was equalized in unified Germany in 1994. Context_5 : Richard Bickerton Pemell Lyons, 1st Earl Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons, 2nd Baron Lyons, 2nd Baronet, of Christchurch (26 April 1817 \u2013 5 December 1887) was an eminent British diplomat, the favourite of Queen Victoria. Lyons was an imperative element of British diplomacy during each of the four great crises of the second half of the 19th century: Italian unification, the American Civil War, the decline of the Ottoman Empire, and the replacement of France, by the unified Germany, as the dominant Continental power. He is best known for solving the Trent Affair during the American Civil War, for laying the foundations for the Special Relationship, and for predicting, 32 years before World War One, the occurrence of an imperial war between France and Germany that would destroy Britain\u2019s international dominance. Context_6 : The Deutsche Mark (] , \"German mark\"), abbreviated \"DM\" or \u00a0\u00a0 , was the official currency of West Germany from 1948 until 1990 and later the unified Germany from 1990 until 2002. It was first issued under Allied occupation in 1948 to replace the Reichsmark, and served as the Federal Republic of Germany's official currency from its founding the following year until the adoption of the euro. In English, but not in German, it is commonly called the \"Deutschmark\" ( ). Context_7 : A trade restriction is an artificial restriction on the trade of goods and/or services between two countries. It is the byproduct of protectionism. However, the term is controversial because what one part may see as a trade restriction another may see as a way to protect consumers from inferior, harmful or dangerous products. For instance Germany required the production of beer to adhere to its purity law. The law, originally implemented in Bavaria in 1516 and eventually becoming law for newly unified Germany in 1871, made many foreign beers unable to be sold in Germany as \"beer\". This law was struck down in 1987 by the European Court of Justice, but is still voluntarily followed by many German breweries.

The ship was present at, but was only lightly engaged in the Battle of Jasmund during the Second Schleswig War. She served in a variety of roles during peacetime, including fishery protection and survey work. \"Comet\" went on one lengthy deployment abroad, with an assignment to the Mediterranean Sea from 1876 to 1879. She saw little active service after returning to Germany and was decommissioned and hulked in 1881. The vessel remained in the navy's inventory until at least 1891, being broken up sometime thereafter. Context_9 : Bismarckia is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the palm family endemic to western and northern Madagascar where they grow in open grassland. The genus is named for the first chancellor of the German Empire Otto von Bismarck and the epithet for its only species, Bismarckia nobilis, comes from Latin for 'noble'. Context_10 : Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 \u2013 30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck (] ), was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\". However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and promoted Germanophobia in France.

The album was released on CD in 1998 [EMI 7 46609-2] but deleted soon after that, and it got reissued on CD on August 2012 as a 2-CD set with \"Sleepwalking.\" Some of the songs are available on compilation albums. One of the songs, \"The Garden of England\", was recorded at Beatles producer George Martin's AIR studio in Montserrat. All the songs were original Rafferty compositions, though one \u2013 \"Johnny's Song\" \u2013 was a remake of a song which had been previously released by his former band Stealers Wheel, and another \u2013 \"Didn't I\" \u2013 was a remake of a song from Rafferty's 1971 album \"Can I Have My Money Back\".

I See Red was first recorded by Anni-Frid Lyngstad of ABBA, under the name \"Frida\" for her first English-language studio album, \"Something's Going On\". Lyngstad's version did not chart other than South Africa, although subsequent cover versions by other artists such as the Irish folk group, Clannad, included in their album, \"Magical Ring\", resulted in a moderate success. Clannad's version was the follow-up single to their breakthrough hit \"Theme from Harry's Game\". Gerry Rafferty himself also recorded a version on his 1992 album, \"On a Wing and a Prayer\".

One of the singles was \"Shipyard Town\", also released on several compilation albums. It was regarded by most of Rafferty's fans as the best album since \"Night Owl\". After the rather, some felt, over-engineered nature of \"Sleepwalking\", the album was a welcome return to form with a more stripped-back nature and less fastidiously-engineered songs.

Ieyasu seized power in 1600, received appointment as shogun in 1603, and abdicated from office in 1605, but remained in power until his death in 1616. His given name is sometimes spelled Iyeyasu, according to the historical pronunciation of the kana character \"he\". Ieyasu was posthumously enshrined at Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b with the name T\u014dsh\u014d Daigongen (\u6771\u7167\u5927\u6a29\u73fe ) .

He was the eldest son of Tokugawa Hidetada, and the grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Iemitsu ruled from 1623 to 1651, and during this period he crucified Christians, expelled all Europeans from Japan and closed the borders of the country, a foreign politics policy that continued for over 200 years after its institution. It is debatable whether Iemitsu can be considered a kinslayer for making his younger brother Tadanaga commit suicide by seppuku. Iemitsu also had well-known homosexual preferences, and it is speculated he was the last direct male descendant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, thereby ending the patrilineality of the shogunate by the third generation. Context_3 : The Japanese Left Army was a Japanese army in the 16th-century Japanese invasions of Korea. Under the command of Ukita Hideie in the late 16th century, it consisted mainly of the former First division led by Konishi Yukinaga, the Fourth Division led by Shimazu Yoshihiro and the Eighth Division led by Ukita Hideie.

He was the eldest son of Date Masamune, born in 1596 by Lady Iisaka (a concubine). Coming of age while living with Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he received a character from Hideyoshi's name and took the adult name of Hidemune.

However, the band's eponymous vocalist was unhappy with Mosimann's production, claiming it was too \"smoothed and polished\", and poorly representative of the band's established sound. The majority of songs on \"The Manson Family Album\" were later re-recorded or remixed with Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor at the Record Plant in Los Angeles. The album's title is a double entendre; it also relates to the commune of cult leader Charles Manson.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.", "input": "Context_1 : In chemistry and physics, atomic theory is a scientific theory of the nature of matter, which states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms. It began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms. Context_2 : Zeno's paradoxes are a set of philosophical problems generally thought to have been devised by Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea (ca. 490\u2013430 BC) to support Parmenides' doctrine that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, the belief in plurality and change is mistaken, and in particular that motion is nothing but an illusion. It is usually assumed, based on Plato's \"Parmenides\" (128a\u2013d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these paradoxes because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view. Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes \"is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one.\" (\"Parmenides\" 128d). Plato has Socrates claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point (\"Parmenides\" 128a\u2013b). Context_3 : Atomism (from Greek \u1f04\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd , \"atomon\", i.e. \"uncuttable\", \"indivisible\") is a natural philosophy that developed in several ancient traditions. The atomists theorized that nature consists of two fundamental principles: \"atom\" and \"void\". Unlike their modern scientific namesake in atomic theory, philosophical atoms come in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes, each indestructible, immutable and surrounded by a void where they collide with the others or hook together forming a cluster. Clusters of different shapes, arrangements, and positions give rise to the various macroscopic substances in the world. Context_4 : Buddhist atomism is a school of atomistic Buddhist philosophy that flourished on the Indian subcontinent during two major periods . During the first phase, which began to develop prior to the 4th century BCE, Buddhist atomism had a very qualitative, Aristotelian-style atomic theory. This form of atomism identifies four kinds of atoms, corresponding to the standard elements. Each of these elements has a specific property, such as solidity or motion, and performs a specific function in mixtures, such as providing support or causing growth. Like the Hindus and Jains, the Buddhists were able to integrate a theory of atomism with their logical presuppositions. Context_5 : Atomism or social atomism is a sociological theory arising from the scientific notion \"atomic theory\", coined by the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus and the Roman philosopher Lucretius. In the scientific rendering of the word, atomism refers to the notion that all matter in the universe is composed of basic indivisible components, or atoms. When placed into the field of sociology, atomism assigns the individual as the basic unit of analysis for all implications of social life. This theory refers to \"the tendecy for society to be made up of a collection of self-interested and largely self-sufficient individuals, operating as separate atoms\". Therefore, all social values, institutions, developments and procedures evolve entirely out of the interests and actions of the individuals who inhabit any particular society. The individual is the \u2018atom\u2019 of society and therefore the only true object of concern and analysis. Context_6 : The unmoved mover (Ancient\u00a0Greek: \u1f43 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6 , \"ho ou kino\u00famenos kine\u00ee\", \"that which moves without being moved\") or prime mover (Latin: \"primum movens\" ) is a concept advanced by Aristotle as a primary cause or \"mover\" of all the motion in the universe. As is implicit in the name, the \"unmoved mover\" moves other things, but is not itself moved by any prior action. In Book 12 (Greek \"\u039b\") of his \"Metaphysics\", Aristotle describes the unmoved mover as being perfectly beautiful, indivisible, and contemplating only the perfect contemplation: itself contemplating. He equates this concept also with the active intellect. This Aristotelian concept had its roots in cosmological speculations of the earliest Greek Pre-Socratic philosophers and became highly influential and widely drawn upon in medieval philosophy and theology. St. Thomas Aquinas, for example, elaborated on the unmoved mover in the \"Quinque viae\". Context_7 : The Pluralist school was a school of pre-Socratic philosophers who attempted to reconcile Parmenides' rejection of change with the apparently changing world of sense experience. The school consisted of Anaxagoras, Archelaus, and Empedocles. It can also be said to have included the Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus. The Pluralists rejected the idea that the diversity of nature can be reduced to a single principle (monism). Anaxagoras posited that nature contained an innumerable number of principles, while Empedocles reduced nature to four elements (fire, air, earth, and water) which could not be reduced to one another and which would be sufficient to explain change and diversity. Context_8 : Leucippus ( ; Greek: \u039b\u03b5\u03cd\u03ba\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 , \"Le\u00fakippos\"; fl. 5th cent. BCE) is reported in some ancient sources to have been a philosopher who was the earliest Greek to develop the theory of atomism\u2014the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms. Leucippus often appears as the master to his pupil Democritus, a philosopher also touted as the originator of the atomic theory. However, a brief notice in Diogenes Laertius\u2019s life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed. As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus's word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century. Furthermore, in his \"Corpus Democriteum\", Thrasyllus of Alexandria, an astrologer and writer living under the emperor Tiberius (14\u201337 CE), compiled a list of writings on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus. The present consensus among the world's historians of philosophy is that this Leucippus is historical. The matter must remain moot unless more information is forthcoming from the record. Context_9 : Parmenides of Elea ( ; Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f41 \u1f18\u03bb\u03b5\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ; fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher from Elea in Magna Graecia (Greater Greece, included Southern Italy). He was the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy. The single known work of Parmenides is a poem, \"On Nature\", which has survived only in fragmentary form. In this poem, Parmenides describes two views of reality. In \"the way of truth\" (a part of the poem), he explains how reality (coined as \"what-is\") is one, change is impossible, and existence is timeless, uniform, necessary, and unchanging. In \"the way of opinion\", he explains the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. Context_10 : The School of Abdera (or the Abderites) was a Pre-Socratic school of thought, founded in Abdera, Thrace around 440 to 430 BC. Its proponents, Leucippus and Democritus, were the earliest atomists. Leucippus is believed to be the founder, and was born at either Abdera or Miletus. Democritus, his student, was native to Abdera. Metrodorus of Chios and Anaxarchus of Abdera were also members, the latter being the teacher of Pyrrho who eventually came to lead the school and later founded Pyrrhonism. fact_1 :  It can also be said to have included the Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus. fact_2 : Leucippus ( ; Greek: \u039b\u03b5\u03cd\u03ba\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 , \"Le\u00fakippos\"; fl.

Context_4 : Asian American literature is the body of literature produced in the United States by writers of Asian descent. Asian American literature became a category during the 1970s but didn't see a direct impact in viewership until later in the 1970s. Perhaps the earliest references to Asian American literature appeared with David Hsin-fu Wand's \"Asian American Heritage: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry\", published in 1974. One of the earlier pieces of Asian American literature produced by Combined Asian Resources Project (CARP) was \"Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian-American Writers\" (1974). This anthology collected staples of long-forgotten Asian American literature and criticized the lack of visibility of this literature. This anthology brought to light the necessity of visibility and criticism of Asian American literature; with visibility came recognition of new literature. Elaine Kim's seminal book of criticism, \"Asian American Literature: An Introduction to the Writings and Their Social Context\", was published in 1982 and was the first critical book on the topic. Context_5 : Japanese Americans (\u65e5\u7cfb\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba , Nikkei Amerikajin ) are Americans who are fully or partially of Japanese descent, especially those who identify with that ancestry, along with their cultural characteristics. Japanese Americans were among the three largest Asian American ethnic communities during the 20th century, but since the 2000 census, they have declined in number to constitute the sixth largest Asian American group at around 1.3 million, including those of partial ancestry. According to the 2010 census, the largest Japanese American communities were found in California with 272,528, Hawaii with 185,502, New York with 37,780, Washington with 35,008, Illinois with 17,542, and Ohio with 16,995. Southern California has the largest Japanese American population in North America, and the city of Torrance holds the densest Japanese American population in the 48 contiguous states. Context_6 : Lotus Long (July 18, 1909 \u2013 September 14, 1990) was an American actress. She was born Lotus Pearl Shibata in New Jersey, to a father of Japanese ancestry and a mother of Hawaiian ancestry. She came to Southern California during the 1920s to act in Hollywood films, and usually portrayed ethnic Asian female characters in supporting roles. She used the name \"Lotus Long\" for stage and film. Because of her adopted surname, people generally assumed that she was of Chinese ancestry \u2013 something she later relied on to avoid mass incarceration in American internment camps with other persons of Japanese ancestry, both legal permanent residents and American citizens, during World War II. Context_7 : Mark Izu is an American jazz double bass player and composer. He is of Japanese ancestry and frequently combines jazz with Asian traditional musics (particularly the ancient Japanese court music known as \"gagaku\") in his compositions. He has performed with Anthony Brown and Jon Jang. Izu is a seminal leader in the Asian American Jazz movement. His compositions include symphony, film, theater, dance and jazz. The principal curator of the original Asian American Jazz Festival held at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park for nearly two decades, he helped establish the genre. In addition to the double bass, he also plays the Japanese \"sh\u014d\" and Chinese \"sheng\" (both mouth organs). Context_8 : Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian-American Writers is a 1974 anthology by Frank Chin, Jeffery Paul Chan, Lawson Fusao Inada, Shawn Wong and other members of the Combined Asian Resources Project (CARP). It helped establish Asian American Literature as a field by recovering and collecting representative selections from Chinese-, Japanese-, and Filipino-Americans from the past fifty years\u2014many of whom had been mostly forgotten. This pan-Asian anthology included selections from Carlos Bulosan, Diana Chang, Louis Chu, Momoko Iko, Wallace Lin, Toshio Mori, John Okada, Oscar Pe\u00f1aranda, Sam Tagatac, Hisaye Yamamoto, Wakako Yamauchi, many of whom are now staples in Asian American literature course. Because of this anthology and the work of CARP, many of these authors have been republished; at that time, however, they received little attention from publishers critics because they didn't subscribe to popular stereotypes but depicted what Elaine H. Kim calls the \"unstereotyped aspects of Asian American experience\". The \"aiiieeeee!\" of the title comes from a stereotypical expression used by Asian characters in old movies, radio and television shows, comic books, etc. These same stereotypes affected the anthology itself: when the editors tried to find a publisher, they had to turn to a historically African-American press because, as Chin states:The blacks were the first to take us seriously and sustained the spirit of many Asian American writers... [I]t wasn't surprising to us that Howard University Press understood us and set out to publish our book with their first list. They liked our English we spoke [sic] and didn't accuse us of unwholesome literary devices.

Anipamil has been shown to be a more effective antiarrhythmic medication than verapamil because it does not cause hypertension as seen in verapamil. It is able to do this by bonding to the myocardium tighter then verapamil. Context_5 : The term mass media refers to any means or technology used to communicate a message to large groups of people. Popular forms of mass media include television, the Internet, and newspapers. Mass media are specifically intended to reach larger audiences. The term is often divided into two broad categories: that of electronic mass media and that of print mass media. Electronic mass media require their audiences to interact with electronics in order to receive the message. They attempt to recreate or represent a message through moving pictures and/or sound. Four common examples of electronic media used in Canadian society are television, radio, films, and the Internet. Print mass media, on the other hand, refers to any media that is distributed to audiences in a printed form, on paper. Examples of this include newspapers, printed books, and magazines. The mass media model in Canada is different from the mass media model of the United States as well as the rest of the world. According to John A. Irving, mass media functions differently in Canadian society because of a lack of collective identity; this is in reference to Canada's languages (and related cultures) as well as its proximity to the United States. Irving states that such cultural dualism means that only some of the population responds to the mass media in English, while the other portion remain uninfluenced by English-based media. In terms of the proximity to the United States, he explains that \"most of the difficulties that threaten the mass media in Canada are the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism.\" Because of the United States' overwhelming influence on Canadian mass media, Canada has not been able to form its own identity in the media. These two factors have slowed down the process of the creation of a Canadian community. Mass media help in forming a community through communication. When a large group of people is in communication with one another through media, an identifiable culture is formed. Individuals in dialectic experience a sense of membership and collective identity. Context_6 : The portrayal of the family structure in the media is important because the media reinforces different gender stereotypes in society today. The media tends to highlight the \"traditional American family\" as opposed to nonconventional configurations. Social Scientists have found that home, family and romance are three of the most important components of the way characters are presented. Moreover, these qualities are often presented in a stereotypical and traditional fashion. In the past few years, the traditional American family has shifted from its original patriarchal structure to a more gender-equivalent dynamic. For example, two-married-parent families were the most common type of family unit a generation ago; however, in the year 2000 that particular family structure could only be found in one out of four households. The depictions of these changes in the media can reinforce or debunk society's views on raising a family. Media channels such as children's books, television, movies and advertisements are direct touch points for both youth and parents to process shifting gender roles within the family. More specifically, as roles such as \"dumb\" fathers, single mothers, step mothers and stay-at-home dads continue to be portrayed in the media, these roles will mirror and shift in reality as well. Context_7 : Uterine cancer or womb cancer is any type of cancer that emerges from the tissue of the uterus. It can refer to several types of cancer, with cervical cancer (arising from the lower portion of the uterus) being the most common type worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries. Endometrial cancer (or cancer of the inner lining of the uterus) is the second most common type, and fourth most common cancer in women from developed countries. Risk factors depend on specific type, but obesity, older age, and human papillomavirus infection add the greatest risk of developing uterine cancer. Early on, there may be no symptoms, but irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or fullness may develop. If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods. When the cancer has extended beyond the uterine tissue, more advanced treatments including combinations of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery may be required. Context_8 : Cis AB is a rare mutation in the ABO gene which complicates the basic inheritance pattern and blood-transfusion compatibility matching for ABO blood typing. There are different DNA mutations of either type A or Type B alleles that change several amino acids in enzyme transferase A or B, homologous enzymes differing in only four of 354 amino acids (R176G, G235S, L266M, and G268A). A single change in ABO gene DNA could reverse type B to type A and then, a new hybrid enzyme will produce both weak B and A2 (in serum test, A2B and A2B3)). The most common mutation is an A105 allele variation in exon 7 nucleotide position G803C changing Glycine (type A) to Alanine (type B). There are another 8 alleles reported in BGMUT, the most discovered reciently in China and Taiwan. In the cis-AB genotype, both antigens are expressed, like in a standard (trans) AB genotype. In a traditional AB phenotype, A and B antigenes are inherited separately from the father and mother while a cis-AB allele comes from one parent only. In a serum test, cis-AB tests almost the same as a traditional AB, but people with this rare type have problems with blood transfusions. Some of them need components like washed red blood cells or autotransfusion of serum and blood. Context_9 : In DVD authoring, a write strategy is a set of low-level parameters that enables an optical disc drive to write on a specific type of blank media according to its optimum specifications. The media type is identified by the manufacturer and media ID, which is often unrelated to the brand of the media due to rebadging. Write strategies are essential for compatibility with various types of blank media, and are typically stored in the drive's firmware. If a drive lacks a write strategy for a media type, it will only be able to write using minimum speed. Drive manufacturers typically include new or improved write strategies as part of a firmware upgrade, in order to extend or improve compatibility with blank media. In cases where official support for a drive has been discontinued or is deemed unsatisfactory, users have come up with ways to patch the write strategies by modding the drive's firmware. Context_10 : Skin cancer, or neoplasia, is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in horses, accounting for 45 to 80% of all cancers diagnosed. Sarcoids are the most common type of skin neoplasm and are the most common type of cancer overall in horses. Squamous-cell carcinoma is the second-most prevalent skin cancer, followed by melanoma. Squamous-cell carcinoma and melanoma usually occur in horses greater than 9-years-old, while sarcoids commonly affect horses 3 to 6 years old. Surgical biopsy is the method of choice for diagnosis of most equine skin cancers, but is contraindicated for cases of sarcoids. Prognosis and treatment effectiveness varies based on type of cancer, degree of local tissue destruction, evidence of spread to other organs (metastasis) and location of the tumor. Not all cancers metastasize and some can be cured or mitigated by surgical removal of the cancerous tissue or through use of chemotherapeutic drugs. fact_1 : Smoky is a 1966 Western film, directed by George Sherman. fact_2 : Fess Elisha Parker Jr. (August 16, 1924 \u2013 March 18, 2010) was an American film and television actor best known for his portrayals of Davy Crockett in the Walt Disney 1955\u20131956 TV miniseries and as Daniel Boone in a television series from 1964 to 1970.

First, at approximately 40\u00a0Ma the relative plate motions switched from orthogonal convergence to right-lateral strike slip. The variance in location of the triple junction may have also been related to the formation of an independent basin block. This formation could have been produced by fore-arc bending of the Pacific Plate, due to oblique underthrusting prior to 1\u00a0Ma which produced stresses sufficient to break the Pacific Plate and isolate the block. Transpression of 15\u201330\u00a0mm/yr since 5\u00a0Ma has been taking place, as well as varying amounts of both transpression and transtension occurring before then. To the northwest of the triple junction the Pacific plate currently has 15 degrees of oblique convergence, passing under the North American plate along the Queen Charlotte transform fault zone.

A tower testing station consists of two steel stands and one or more foundations, on which a sample of the tower can be built. The number of test conditions is normally limited to between six and eight individual cases, with loading condition such as reduced wind and ice. The towers to be tested are erected on rigid foundation and the wire ropes attached to the loading point required. Loading may either be applied by 'dead' weights using scale pans, winches or hydraulic rams. In the latter cases a load cell or dyamometer is placed in the rigging adjacent to the point of loading at the structure. The loading methods induce strain by pulling cables away from the tower to the specified loads. The pulling load is indicated through a strain gauge placed on the pulling point. Loading points on a tower naturally encompasses longitudinal, transverse and vertical components, either as individual or a combined resultant load.

Context_2 : Healthy Way LA (abbreviated HWLA) was a free public health care program available to underinsured or uninsured, low-income residents of Los Angeles County. The program, administered by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, was a Low Income Health Program (LIHP) approved under the 1115 Waiver. HWLA helped to narrow the large gap in access to health care among low-income populations by extending health care insurance to uninsured LA County residents living at 0 percent to 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Individuals eligible for HWLA were assigned to a medical home within the LA County Department of Health Services (LADHS) or its partners, thus gaining access to continuous primary care, preventive and specialty services, mental health services, and other support systems. HWLA was one of the few sources of coordinated health care for disadvantaged adults without dependents in LA County. HWLA was succeeded by My Health LA, a no-cost health care program for low-income Los Angeles County residents launched on October 1, 2014. Context_3 : The Health Care Justice Act (20 ILCS 4045 ) encouraged the Illinois General Assembly to implement a health care access plan by July 1, 2007, that would provide affordable, accessible, quality health care for all Illinoisans. The Health Care Justice Campaign (a project of Campaign for Better Health Care) won passage of the act in 2004. The act encouraged Illinois to create a health care plan that would provide preventive, acute and long-term health care services to all citizens of Illinois. It also suggests the importance of not only ensuring availability for health care, but continuing to maintain and improve the quality of health care services (Illinois Department of Public Health). Context_4 : The American Hospital Association (AHA) is a professional association that seeks to promote quality health care provision by hospitals and health care networks through public policy and providing information about health care and health administration to health care providers and the public. Founded in 1898 with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Washington, D.C., the AHA hosts a Resource Center with over 47,000 books on health care (some services fee based) and maintains a Health Planning and Administration (HEALTH) database that provides current information on health care unrelated to clinical treatment.

It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into Abbvie in 2013. In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion. Context_6 : Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation model (PCBH) is a psychological approach to population-based clinical health care that is simultaneously co-located, collaborative, and integrated within the primary care clinic. The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population. This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in primary care. Primary Care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice. Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day. Many patients present with mental health care needs whose symptomology may overlap with medical disorders and which may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms. In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (e.g. stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change, through behavioral intervention, that can improve outcomes for these health problems. Over 50% of medical visits to primary care clinics today are related to chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity). As we learn more and more about the contributing factors to the development and maintenance of these medical problems, there is growing evidence that the PCBH model affords us the opportunity for early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems. Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians. The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint. BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients\u2019 changing needs In this review the terms Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation and Behavioral Health Consultation will be used interchangeably. Context_7 : GeoAccess, Inc. was the company that pioneered the use of geographic data to analyze the accessibility of health care networks. Prior to GeoAccess\u2019 work in the early 1990s, the accessibility of health care networks was estimated by comparing zip codes of health care providers and consumers. GeoAccess developed software applications which allowed the accessibility of health care networks to be accurately measured based on the geographic coordinates of health care provider locations. For the first time, employers and government-sponsored programs could establish access standards to take the actual accessibility of health care providers into account when selecting health care networks. By the mid-1990s, GeoAccess-based analysis was the industry standard for measuring the accessibility of health care networks.

With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. Context_2 : Heavy metal drumming is a style of rock music drumkit playing that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock drum playing, heavy metal drummers play with emphatic beats, and overall loudness using an aggressive performing style. Heavy metal (or \"metal\") drumming is traditionally characterized by emphatic rhythms and dense bass guitar-and-drum sound. The essence of metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the \"trifecta of speed, power, and precision\". Context_3 : Acid rock is a loosely defined type of rock music that evolved out of the mid-1960s garage punk movement and helped launch the psychedelic subculture. The style is generally defined by heavy, distorted guitars, lyrics with drug references, and long improvised jams. Distinguishing acid rock from other genres can be tenuous, as much of the style overlaps with 1960s punk, proto-metal, and heavy, blues-based hard rock. Context_4 : \"Psychotic Reaction\" is a song by the American garage rock band Count Five, released in June 1966 on their debut studio album of the same name. It peaked at No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and was among the first successful acid (or psychedelic) rock songs, containing the characteristics that would come to define acid rock: the use of feedback and distortion replacing early rock music's more melodic electric guitars. Context_5 : No Turning Back is the second album by heavy metal band Jack Starr's Burning Starr. Released in 1986 by the Canadian label Napalm Records. Context_6 : Proto-prog (short for \"proto-progressive\") is the first wave of British progressive rock musicians who branched from psychedelia or the advanced music that slightly predates the full-fledged prog era. Progressive rock (originally \"progressive pop\") evolved from psychedelic/acid rock music, specifically a strain of classical/symphonic rock led by the Nice, Procol Harum, and the Moody Blues. Proto-prog musicians harnessed modern classical and other genres usually outside of traditional rock influences, longer and more complicated compositions, interconnected songs as medley, and studio composition. Context_7 : This is a list of rock music genres consisting of subgenres of popular music that have roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, and which developed into a distinct identity as rock music in the 1960s, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. By the late 1960s, a number of identifiable rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene. New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques. Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history. Context_8 : Bardo Pond are an American psychedelic rock band formed in 1991, and who are currently signed to London-based label Fire Records. The current members are Michael Gibbons (guitar), John Gibbons (guitar), Isobel Sollenberger (flute and vocals), Clint Takeda (bass guitar) and Jason Kourkounis (drums). Bardo Pond's music is often classified as space rock, acid rock, post-rock, shoegazing, noise or psychedelic rock. Some Bardo Pond album titles have been derived from the names of esoteric psychedelic substances. Their sound has been likened to Pink Floyd, Spacemen 3 and My Bloody Valentine amongst others. Context_9 : Vincebus Eruptum ( ; pseudo-Latin) is the debut studio album by American rock band Blue Cheer. Released on January 16, 1968, the album features a heavy-thunderous blues sound, which would later be known as heavy metal. It also contains elements of acid rock, grunge, experimental rock, blues rock, stoner rock, and garage rock. A commercial and critical success, \"Vincebus Eruptum\" peaked at number 11 on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart and spawned the top-20 hit cover of Eddie Cochran's \"Summertime Blues\". Being an example of hard rock, it is also lauded as one of the first heavy metal albums. Context_10 : Blues rock is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock: electric guitar, electric bass, and drums, often with Hammond organ. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way it inspired and influenced hard rock, Southern rock, and early heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence in the 2010s, with performances and recordings by popular artists. fact_1 : No Turning Back is the second album by heavy metal band Jack Starr's Burning Starr. fact_2 : Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom. fact_3 :  With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.

Despite having four starters from the 2004 team selected in the first round of 2005 NFL Draft, Auburn finished the season with a 9\u20133 record, including a 7\u20131 record in the Southeastern Conference. The Tigers shared the SEC Western Division championship with LSU, but because the Bayou Bengals defeated Auburn 20\u201317 in overtime on October 22, the Tigers did not advance to the SEC Championship Game. Head coach Tommy Tuberville became only the third Tigers coach to lead Auburn to a fourth consecutive win over arch rival Alabama when the Tigers defeated the Crimson Tide 28\u201318 at Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium on November 19. Auburn finished the season ranked #14 in both the Coaches Poll and AP Poll, with a #13 consensus ranking. Context_2 : The 1896 LSU Tigers football team represented the LSU Tigers of Louisiana State University during the 1896 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association football season.

The Tigers were coached by university professor Dr Charles E. Coates against in-state school Tulane of New Orleans. The game sparked a rivalry between the Tigers and the Green Wave that has lasted generations. Future Louisiana governor Ruffin G. Pleasant was the quarterback and captain of the LSU team. In the first game against Tulane, LSU football players wore purple and gold ribbons on their uniforms. According to legend, purple and gold were chosen because they were Mardi Gras colors, and the green of Mardi Gras was sold out. An LSU baseball team had also worn purple and gold in its first varsity game against Tulane earlier in 1893, even though LSU's official colors at the time were actually blue and white.

The Tigers were coached by third-year head coach Justin Fuente and played their home games at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee. The Tigers competed as a member of the American Athletic Conference. Memphis began the year with low expectations since they finished at the bottom of the American Athletic Conference and posted a 3\u20139 (1\u20137 The American) record in 2013. However, the Tigers turned completely around. First, they finished in a three-way tie with Cincinnati and UCF for the conference title by posting a 10\u20133 (7\u20131 The American) record. It was their first conference championship (shared) since 1971 when Memphis was part of the Missouri Valley Conference. The 2014 10-win season equaled the total number of wins Memphis posted over the 2010\u20132013 seasons.

Marshall was the founder and long-time head coach of the Detroit Heralds (renamed the Detroit Tigers in 1921) of the early National Football League. Marshall, as a student at the University of Detroit, founded the Heralds in 1905, as an amateur team, after the university didn't field a team that year due to financial issues. While the university's football team resumed play in 1906, the Heralds continued to play as an amateur team. In 1911, the team dropped its amateur status and became semi-professional and left the campus. The team would go on to regularly play teams from the \"Ohio League\", namely the Canton Bulldogs and Massillon Tigers. In 1920, the American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League in 1922) was established. While the Heralds didn't officially join the association, they are listed in league standings for the season. The Heralds, under Marshall, had a 1\u20133 record, while inclement weather eliminated their November schedule, financially devastating the team. In 1921, the Heralds were reorganized into the Detroit Tigers. Marshall remained the team's head coach, however financial issues caused that team to fold by year's end.

Its main exponent was Max Meldrum, who developed a unique theory of painting based on the importance of tonal values and objective optical analysis, resulting in simple representational works characterised by a \"misty\" or atmospheric quality. Meldrum's published theories of art created a storm in the Australian art world, and his school of painting attracted equally passionate followers and critics. Artists who adopted Meldrum's methods became derisively known as \"Meldrumites\". They rejected the then-popular Heidelberg School tradition with its emphasis on colour and narrative, and attacked various forms of modern art which Meldrum considered to be ego-based and technically inferior. Ironically, Australian Tonalism's conceptual complexities and illusionary soft focus aesthetic is now regarded as a precursor to modernist styles of painting, including minimalism.

They created sharp-focus photographs of natural American Western objects and scenery, skillfully composing with subtleties of tone, light and texture. This approach was entirely radical. From 1910 to the early 1930s, the dominant style was East Coast Pictorialism in which objects were shot with haze and gauze to purposely blur the image for a soft focus effect. The aim was to mimic Impressionist paintings. With the emerging West Coast Movement, photography no longer imitated painting and developed as a separate art form. The new movement spread in the 1950s as the West Coast artists championed the use of natural environmental forms and clarity of detail\u2014very novel concepts at the time.

The term refers to the formal structure of role and status that can form in a small, stable group. An individual may belong to multiple social systems at once; examples of social systems include nuclear family units, communities, cities, nations, college campuses, corporations, and industries. The organization and definition of groups within a social system depend on various shared characteristics such as location, socioeconomic status, race, religion, societal function, or other distinguishable features. Context_2 : A Blood Pledge (Hangul: \uc5ec\uace0\uad34\ub2f4 5: \ub3d9\ubc18\uc790\uc0b4 ; RR: \"Yeogogoedam 5: dongbandjasal \" ; also known as Whispering Corridors 5: A Blood Pledge and Suicide Pact) is a K-Horror film, and the fifth installment of the \"Whispering Corridors\" series of South Korean horror films set in girls' high schools that began with 1998's film of the same name. Aside from the setting and overall themes, it is unrelated to the other films in the series. Context_3 : Whispering Corridors () is a 1998 South Korean horror film. It was part of the explosion in Korean cinema following the liberalization of censorship in the aftermath of the end of the country's military dictatorship, and makes a strong social commentary on authoritarianism and conformity in the harsh South Korean education system. Context_4 : The Uninvited is a 2009 American psychological horror film directed by the Guard Brothers, and starring Emily Browning, Elizabeth Banks, Arielle Kebbel and David Strathairn. It is a remake of the 2003 South Korean K-Horror film \"A Tale of Two Sisters\", which is in turn one of several film adaptations of the Korean folk tale Janghwa Hongryeon jeon. The film received mixed reviews. Context_5 : The knowledge gap hypothesis explains that knowledge, like other forms of wealth, is often differentially distributed throughout a social system. Specifically, the hypothesis predicts that \"as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher socioeconomic status tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments, so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease\". Phillip J. Tichenor, then Associate Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication, George A. Donohue, Professor of Sociology, and Clarice N. Olien, Instructor in Sociology \u2013 three University of Minnesota researchers \u2013 first proposed the knowledge gap hypothesis in 1970. Context_6 : The AGIL paradigm is a sociological scheme created by American sociologist Talcott Parsons in the 1950s. It is a systematic depiction of certain societal functions, which every society must meet to be able to maintain stable social life. The AGIL paradigm is part of Parsons's larger action theory, outlined in his notable book \"The Structure of Social Action\", in \"The Social System\" and in later works, which aims to construct a unified map of all action systems, and ultimately \"living systems.\" Indeed, the actual AGIL system only appeared in its first elaborate form in 1956, and Parsons extended the system in various layers of complexity during the rest of his intellectual life. Towards the end of his life, he added a new dimension to the action system, which he called the paradigm of the human condition; within that paradigm, the action system occupied the integral dimension. Context_7 : The \"rhetoric of social intervention\" (RSI) model is a systemic communication theory of how human beings symbolically constitute, maintain, and change social systems (e.g., organizations, societies, and cultures). The RSI model was developed in the writings of communication theorist William R. Brown. The model provides a framework for analyzing and interpreting social system change and its side effects from a communication perspective. It also suggests a methodology for acting as an intervener to encourage and/or discourage social system change. The model offers an alternative approach to understanding social system change by its emphasis on communication as the driver of change in contrast to models that focus on social, political, economic, and technological forces as catalysts for change. The RSI model is envisioned as three communication subsystems that function as starting points for interpreting or enacting social system change. The subsystems, known as attention, power, and need, form the RSI model framework. This entry describes the assumptive foundations of the RSI model. Then it discusses the attention, power, and need patterns of communication that that model identifies as points for generating social system change and continuity. Context_8 : Joe Robot and Anthropos were social robots at Media Lab Europe. They were developed to aid in research on anthropomorphism and to explore the illusion of life and intelligence during the development of a meaningful social interaction between artificial systems and people. As artificial systems enter our social space, we will inherently project/impose our interpretation on their actions similar to the techniques we employ in rationalising, for example, a pet's behaviour. This propensity to anthropomorphise should not be seen as a hindrance to social system development, but rather a useful mechanism that requires judicious examination and employment in social system research. A fundamental balance between function and form for human-robot interaction is necessary. Context_9 : The UNISIST model of information dissemination was proposed in 1971 by the United Nations. UNISIST (United Nations International Scientific Information System) is a model of the social system of communication, which consists of knowledge producers, intermediaries, and users. These groups of people (or actors) are different kinds of professionals. The social system also contains institutes such as research institutes, publishers, and libraries. The actors and institutions perform information services such as writing, publishing, storing and retrieving documents and information. The actors are communicating in both formal and informal ways and they are producing different kinds of documents such as journal articles, books, book reviews, proceedings, bibliographies and catalogues, dictionaries, handbooks, encyclopedias and review articles. Context_10 : In the social sciences, social structure is the patterned social arrangements in society that are both emergent from and determinant of the actions of the individuals. On the macro scale, social structure is the system of socioeconomic stratification (e.g., the class structure), social institutions, or, other patterned relations between large social groups. On the meso scale, it is the structure of social network ties between individuals or organizations. On the micro scale, it can be the way norms shape the behavior of individuals within the social system. fact_1 : A Blood Pledge (Hangul: \uc5ec\uace0\uad34\ub2f4 5: \ub3d9\ubc18\uc790\uc0b4 ; RR: \"Yeogogoedam 5: dongbandjasal \" ; also known as Whispering Corridors 5: A Blood Pledge and Suicide Pact) is a K-Horror film, and the fifth installment of the \"Whispering Corridors\" series of South Korean horror films set in girls' high schools that began with 1998's film of the same name. fact_2 :  Aside from the setting and overall themes, it is unrelated to the other films in the series. fact_3 : Whispering Corridors () is a 1998 South Korean horror film. fact_4 :  It was part of the explosion in Korean cinema following the liberalization of censorship in the aftermath of the end of the country's military dictatorship, and makes a strong social commentary on authoritarianism and conformity in the harsh South Korean education system.

Context_2 : In the culture of ancient Greece, the term paideia (also spelled paedeia) ( ; Greek: \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 ) referred to the rearing and education of the ideal member of the polis. It incorporated both practical, subject-based schooling and a focus upon the socialization of individuals within the aristocratic order of the polis. The practical aspects of this education included subjects subsumed under the modern designation of the liberal arts (rhetoric, grammar and philosophy are examples), as well as scientific disciplines like arithmetic and medicine. An ideal and successful member of the polis would possess intellectual, moral and physical refinement, so training in gymnastics and wrestling was valued for its effect on the body alongside the moral education which the Greeks believed was imparted by the study of music, poetry and philosophy. This approach to the rearing of a well-rounded Greek male was common to the Greek-speaking world, with the exception of Sparta where a rigid and militaristic form of education known as the \"agoge\" was practiced. Context_3 : Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as \"histories\" in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies\u2014\"Julius Caesar\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and \"Coriolanus\"\u2014are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy. They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies. Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the \"problem play,\" for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending. The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars. Context_4 : Sir Thomas Arundell (1454\u20131485) was an English nobleman.

Arundell then gave his support to Henry Tudor in his claim to the throne. His marriage to the heiress, Katherine Dynham, brought great wealth to the Arundell family. She was one of the four sisters and coheirs of John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham. Context_5 : In the First Folio, the plays of William Shakespeare were grouped into three categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies. The histories\u2014along with those of contemporary Renaissance playwrights\u2014help define the genre of history plays. The histories might be more accurately called the \"English history plays\" and include the outliers \"King John\" and \"Henry VIII\" as well as a continuous sequence of eight plays covering the Wars of the Roses. These last are considered to have been composed in two cycles. The so-called first tetralogy, apparently written in the early 1590s, deals with the later part of the struggle and includes \"Henry VI, parts one\", \"two\" & \"three\" and \"Richard III\". The second tetralogy, finished in 1599 and including \"Richard II\", \"Henry IV, Part 1\", \"Henry IV, Part 2\" and \"Henry V\", is frequently called the \"Henriad\" after its protagonist Prince Hal, the future Henry V.

Henry did so in 1485 and Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth, where Hugh was present. Hugh was appointed Keeper of the Great Wardrobe by King Henry VII on 21 September 1485, was knighted in January 1486 at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV, and married Elizabeth Courtenay, daughter of Sir Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon, in 1490. Sir Hugh Conway was appointed Sheriff of Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire by Henry VII in 1500. Sir Hugh was a son of John \u2018 Aer Conwy Hen \u2019 of Bodrhyddan Hall and Constable of Rhuddlan Castle, Flintshire, Wales, by his first marriage, and descended from the ancient line of Conway (Conwy = Wales) and de Crevecouer (The Journal Of The Flintshire Historical Society (Appendix D: Conwy Pedigree (British Museum Harleian MS 1971))).

It dramatises the events of \"Bloody Sunday\" through the eyes of the families of the dead and injured, specifically those of Leo Young, older brother of John Young, who was killed on the day. The timescale covers events in the years prior to Bloody Sunday, and subsequent events up to and including the Widgery Tribunal. Context_2 : Bloody Sunday is a 2002 film about the 1972 \"Bloody Sunday\" shootings in Derry, Northern Ireland. Although produced by Granada Television as a TV film, it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 16 January, a few days before its screening on ITV on 20 January, and then in selected London cinemas from 25 January. The production was written and directed by Paul Greengrass. Though set in Derry, the film was actually shot in Ballymun in North Dublin.

One of U2's most overtly political songs, its lyrics describe the horror felt by an observer of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, mainly focusing on the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry where British troops shot and killed unarmed civil rights protesters and bystanders. At the same time, the lyrics reject hate and revenge as a response, as noted in the line \"There's many lost, but tell me who has won.\" Along with \"New Year's Day,\" the song helped U2 reach a wider listening audience. It was generally well received by critics on the album's release. Context_5 : The Bloody Sunday Inquiry, also known as the Saville Inquiry or the Saville Report after its chairman, Lord Saville of Newdigate, was established in 1998 by British Prime Minister Tony Blair after campaigns for a second inquiry by families of those killed and injured in Derry on Bloody Sunday during the peak of ethno-political violence known as The Troubles. It was published on 15 June 2010. The inquiry was set up to establish a definitive version of the events of Sunday 30 January 1972, superseding the tribunal set up under Lord Widgery that had reported on 19 April 1972, 11 weeks after the events, and to resolve the accusations of a whitewash that had surrounded it. Context_6 : Riot control refers to the measures used by police, military, or other security forces to control, disperse, and arrest people who are involved in a riot, demonstration, or protest. If a riot is spontaneous and irrational, actions which cause people to stop and think for a moment (e.g. loud noises or issuing instructions in a calm tone) can be enough to stop it. However, these methods usually fail when there is severe anger with a legitimate cause, or the riot was planned or organized. Law enforcement officers or military personnel have long used less lethal weapons such as batons and whips to disperse crowds and detain rioters. Since the 1980s, riot control officers have also used tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and electric tasers. In some cases, riot squads may also use Long Range Acoustic Devices, water cannons, armoured fighting vehicles, aerial surveillance, police dogs or mounted police on horses. Officers performing riot control typically wear protective equipment such as riot helmets, face visors, body armor (vests, neck protectors, knee pads, etc.), gas masks and riot shields. However, there are also cases where lethal weapons are used to violently suppress a protest or riot, as in the Boston Massacre, Haymarket Massacre, Banana Massacre, Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Kent State Massacre, Soweto Uprising, Mendiola Massacre, Bloody Sunday (1905) and Bloody Sunday (1972).

Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers and some were shot while trying to help the wounded. Other protesters were injured by rubber bullets or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles. The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as \"1 Para\".

Context_9 : Bloody Sunday or Belfast's Bloody Sunday was a day of violence in Belfast, Ireland (present-day Northern Ireland) on 10 July 1921, during the Irish War of Independence.

There was also shooting between republicans and police, and it is claimed that some police patrols fired indiscriminately at Catholic civilians. Seventeen people were killed on 10 July, and a further eleven were killed or fatally wounded over the following week. At least 100 people were injured.

Construction on the power station began in May 2000 and the first unit was commissioned in December 2005. The remaining three were operational by December 2006. The entire project cost US$904.10\u00a0million, of which US$320\u00a0million was provided by the World Bank. The power station operates by shifting water between an upper and lower reservoir to generate electricity. The lower reservoir was formed with the creation of the Tongbai Lower Dam on the Baizhang River. The Tongbai Upper Reservoir, which already existed before construction began, is in an adjacent valley above the east side of the lower reservoir on Tongbai Creek. During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Tongbai Lower Reservoir up to the upper reservoir. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant. The power station is operated by Shenergy Company.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.", "input": "Context_1 : In computer science, type safety is the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents type errors. A type error is erroneous or undesirable program behaviour caused by a discrepancy between differing data types for the program's constants, variables, and methods (functions), e.g., treating an integer (int) as a floating-point number (float). Type safety is sometimes alternatively considered to be a property of a computer program rather than the language in which that program is written; that is, some languages have type-safe facilities that can be circumvented by programmers who adopt practices that exhibit poor type safety. The formal type-theoretic definition of type safety is considerably stronger than what is understood by most programmers. Context_2 : Uterine cancer or womb cancer is any type of cancer that emerges from the tissue of the uterus. It can refer to several types of cancer, with cervical cancer (arising from the lower portion of the uterus) being the most common type worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries. Endometrial cancer (or cancer of the inner lining of the uterus) is the second most common type, and fourth most common cancer in women from developed countries. Risk factors depend on specific type, but obesity, older age, and human papillomavirus infection add the greatest risk of developing uterine cancer. Early on, there may be no symptoms, but irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or fullness may develop. If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods. When the cancer has extended beyond the uterine tissue, more advanced treatments including combinations of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery may be required. Context_3 : Cayenne is a dependently typed functional programming language created by Lennart Augustsson in 1998, making it one of the earliest dependently type programming language (as opposed to proof assistant or logical framework). A notable design decision is that the language allows unbounded recursive functions to be used on the type level, making type checking undecidable. Most dependently typed proof assistants and later dependently typed languages such as Agda included a termination checker to prevent the type checker from looping, while the contemporary Dependent ML restricted the expressivity of the type-level language to maintain decidability. Context_4 : A pidgin , or pidgin language, is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common: typically, a mixture of simplified languages or a simplified primary language with other languages' elements included. It is most commonly employed in situations such as trade, or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the groups). Fundamentally, a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, as it is constructed impromptu, or by convention, between individuals or groups of people. A pidgin is not the native language of any speech community, but is instead learned as a second language. A pidgin may be built from words, sounds, or body language from multiple other languages and cultures. They allow people who have no common language to communicate with each other. Pidgins usually have low prestige with respect to other languages. Context_5 : Ramkali is a sweet early morning raga in Hindustani classical music which belongs to Bhairav thaat. In this raga, as in Bhairav, second degree (rishabh) and sixth degree (dhaivat) are flat. The vadi-samvadi are P/S, the aroha is S r G M P, G M d N S' and the avroha is S' N d P m P, d (N)d P, G M r S. Flat nishad (seventh degree) and sharp madhyama (fourth degree) are used often. Context_6 : In computer programming, an enumerated type (also called enumeration, enum, or factor in the R programming language, and a categorical variable in statistics) is a data type consisting of a set of named values called \"elements\", \"members\", \"enumeral\", or \"enumerators\" of the type. The enumerator names are usually identifiers that behave as constants in the language. An enumerated type can be seen as a degenerate tagged union of unit type. A variable that has been declared as having an enumerated type can be assigned any of the enumerators as a value. In other words, an enumerated type has values that are different from each other, and that can be compared and assigned, but are not specified by the programmer as having any particular concrete representation in the computer's memory; compilers and interpreters can represent them arbitrarily. Context_7 : The Vij\u00f1\u0101na Bhairava Tantra (sometimes spelled in a Hindicised way as \"Vigyan Bhairav Tantra\") is a key text of the Trika school of Kashmir Shaivism in Sanskrit language.

These include several variants of breath awareness, concentration on various centers in the body, non-dual awareness, chanting, imagination and visualization and contemplation through each of the senses. A prerequisite to success in any of the 112 practices is a clear understanding of which method is most suitable to the practitioner.

Context_8 : Called the \"most photographed house in the state\" of Maine, the Wedding Cake House, known formally as the George W. Bourne House, is a historic house located at 104 Summer Street in Kennebunk, Maine. The home was built in 1825 by shipbuilder George W. Bourne (1801\u20131856), who later built a frame barn which he connected to the main house with a carriage house. In 1852, the barn caught fire and the carriage house was demolished to keep the fire from spreading to the house. Bourne, who during a European tour had been impressed by the Gothic beauty of the cathedral at Milan, rebuilt the carriage house and barn in what later came to be known as Carpenter Gothic style. Using hand tools, he crafted five buttresses with pinnacles on top of each. Then in order to tie the new structures in with the existing house, he added six buttresses with pinnacles to the house and then joined them together with intricate woodwork. His only help in doing this was Thomas Durrell, an apprentice ship's carpenter. Bourne spent the rest of his life adding to these embellishments.

It was first identified in Australia in the plant species \"Lactuca sativa\" in 1963 by Stubbs et al. Since then it has been identified in many other plant species including \"Datura stramonium\" and \"Nicotiana glutinosa\". The virus is transmitted by the insect vector \"Hyperomyzus lactucae\" the insect can become infected by feeding on an infected plant. It then acts as a reservoir for the virus in which it can multiply. The virus is also transmitted congenitally to its progeny Context_2 : Olea hochstetteri (East African olive, black ironwood) is a species of tree of the Oleaceae family, often considered a subspecies of Olea capensis.

The conjecture sets up a situation in which a monopolist sells a durable good to a market where resale is impossible and faces consumers who have different valuations. The conjecture proposes that a monopolist that does not know individuals' valuations will have to sell its product at a low price if the monopolist tries to separate consumers by offering different prices in different periods. This is because the monopoly is, in effect, in price competition with itself over several periods and the consumer with the highest valuation, if he is patient enough, can simply wait for the lowest price. Thus the monopolist will have to offer a competitive price in the first period which will be low. The conjecture holds only when there is an infinite time horizon, as otherwise a possible action for the monopolist would be to announce a very high price until the second to last period, and then sell at the static monopoly price in the last period. The monopolist could avoid this problem by committing to a stable linear pricing strategy or adopting other business strategies.

Context_2 : Light crude oil is liquid petroleum that has a low density and flows freely at room temperature. It has a low viscosity, low specific gravity and high API gravity due to the presence of a high proportion of light hydrocarbon fractions. It generally has a low wax content. Light crude oil receives a higher price than heavy crude oil on commodity markets because it produces a higher percentage of gasoline and diesel fuel when converted into products by an oil refinery. Context_3 : Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil is a type of sweet crude oil (sweet crude oil), found primarily in the Appalachian basin in the Marcellus Formation in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, and takes its name for the state of Pennsylvania, where it was first extracted in 1859 from the Drake Well. The area's Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil has superior qualities and is free of asphaltic constituents, contains only trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen, and has excellent characteristics for refining into lubricants. The success of drilling for oil at this well led to \"an international search for petroleum, and in many ways eventually changed the way we live.\" There is archaeological evidence that Native Americans harvested \"the oil for medicinal purposes by digging small pits around active seeps and lining them with wood\" at least as far back as 1410 AD. European settlers skimmed the \"oil from the seeps and using the petroleum as a source of lamp fuel and machinery lubrication.\" Context_4 : Sweet crude oil is a type of petroleum. The New York Mercantile Exchange designates petroleum with less than 0.42% sulfur as \"sweet\". Petroleum containing higher levels of sulfur is called sour crude oil. Context_5 : Crude oil washing (COW) is washing out the residue from the tanks of an oil tanker using the crude oil cargo itself, after the cargo tanks have been emptied. Crude oil is pumped back and preheated in the slop tanks, then sprayed back via high pressure nozzles in the cargo tanks onto the walls of the tank. Due to the sticky nature of the crude oil, the oil clings to the tank walls, and such oil adds to the cargo 'remaining on board' (the ROB). By COWing the tanks, the amount of ROB is significantly reduced, and with the current high cost of oil, the financial savings are significant, both for the Charterer and the Shipowner. If the cargo ROB is deemed as 'liquid and pumpable' then the charterers can claim from the owner for any cargo loss for normally between 0.3% up to 0.5%. It replaced the \"load on top\" and \"seawater washing\" systems, both of which involved discharging oil-contaminated water into the sea. MARPOL 73/78 made this mandatory equipment for oil tankers of 20,000 tons or greater deadweight. Context_6 : Oil reserves in Libya are the largest in Africa and among the ten largest globally with 46.4 Goilbbl as of 2010. Oil production was 1.65 Moilbbl/d as of 2010, giving Libya 77 years of reserves at current production rates if no new reserves were to be found. Libya is considered a highly attractive oil area due to its low cost of oil production (as low as $1 per barrel at some fields in 2002), low sulfur content, being classified as \"sweet crude\" and in its proximity to European markets. Libya's challenge is maintaining production at mature fields, while finding and developing new oil fields. Most of Libya remains under-explored as a result of past sanctions and disagreements with foreign oil companies. Context_7 : Brent Crude is a major trading classification of sweet light crude oil that serves as a major benchmark price for purchases of oil worldwide. This grade is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulphur content. Brent Crude is extracted from the North Sea and comprises Brent Blend, Forties Blend, Oseberg and Ekofisk crudes (also known as the BFOE Quotation). The Brent Crude oil marker is also known as Brent Blend, London Brent and Brent petroleum.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.", "input": "Context_1 : A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, as well as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games (Including \"Dungeons & Dragons\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Context_2 : In tabletop role-playing games, the character race represents the people to which a player character (PC) or a non-player character (NPC) belongs. \"People\" is to be taken in the broader sense, and may encompass ethnic groups, species, nationality or social groups. Context_3 : Bokosuka Wars (\u30dc\u30b3\u30b9\u30ab\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba ) is a 1983 action-strategy role-playing video game developed by K\u014dji Sumii (\u4f4f\u4e95\u6d69\u53f8) and released by ASCII for the Sharp X1 computer, followed by ports to the MSX, FM-7, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801 and NEC PC-9801 computer platforms, as well as an altered version released for the Family Computer console and later the Virtual Console service. It revolves around a leader who must lead an army in phalanx formation across a battlefield in real-time against overwhelming enemy forces while freeing and recruiting soldiers along the way, with each unit able to gain experience and level up through battle. The player must make sure that the leader stays alive, until the army reaches the enemy castle to defeat the leader of the opposing forces. Context_4 : Hack and slash, or hack and slay (H&S or HnS), refers to a type of gameplay that emphasizes combat. The term \"hack and slash\" was originally used to describe a play style in tabletop role-playing games, carrying over from there to MUDs, MMORPGs, and role-playing video games. In arcade/console-style action video games, the term has a different usage, specifically implying a focus on real-time combat with hand-to-hand weapons as opposed to guns or fists. The term is often written in hyphenated form and with the conjunction contracted, e.g. hack-and-slash, hack 'n' slay. Context_5 : A party is a group of characters adventuring together in a role-playing game. In tabletop role-playing, a party is composed of a group of players, occasionally with the addition of non-player character allies (sometimes called \"henchmen\") controlled by those players or by the gamemaster. In computer games, the relationship between the party and the players varies considerably. Online role-playing games or MMORPG parties are often, in the above sense, of the same constituency as tabletop parties, except that the allies are always controlled to a lesser or greater extent by the computer AI. In single-player computer games, the player generally controls all party members to a varying degree. Context_6 : A player character (also known as PC and playable character) is a fictional character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it. Context_7 : A character sheet is a record of a player character in a role-playing game, including whatever details, notes, game statistics, and background information a player would need during a play session. Character sheets can be found in use in both traditional and action role-playing games. Almost all roleplaying games make use of character sheets in some fashion; even \"rules-light\" systems and freeform role-playing games record character details in some manner. Context_8 : Live action role-playing games, known as LARPs, are a form of role-playing game in which live players/actors assume roles as specific characters and play out a scenario in-character. Technically, many childhood games may be thought of as simple LARPs, as they often involve the assumption of character roles. However, the scope of this article concerns itself mainly with LARPing in a technical sense: the organized live-action role-playing games whose origins are closely related to the invention of tabletop role-playing games in America in the 1970s. Context_9 : Hoplites were citizen-soldiers of Ancient Greek city-states who were primarily armed with spears and shields. Hoplite soldiers utilized the phalanx formation in order to be effective in war with fewer soldiers. The hoplites were primarily represented by free citizens\u2014propertied farmers and artisans\u2014who were able to afford the bronze armour suit and weapons (estimated at a third to a half of its able-bodied adult male population). Hoplites were not professional soldiers and often lacked sufficient military training. Although some states did maintain a small elite professional unit, hoplite soldiers were relied on heavily and made up the bulk of ancient Greek armies of the time. Context_10 : An experience point (often abbreviated to exp or XP) is a unit of measurement used in tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) and role-playing video games to quantify a player character's progression through the game.

The play was partially written in Rome, and has a theme that was new for the Scandinavians, because the dramatist had to deal with tragicomedy of money, and, while making a forcible plea for honesty to contrive to produce a stirring and entertaining play on what might seem so prosaic a foundation as business finance. The play was actually first performed in a Swedish translation, at Stockholm, a few days before it was produced at Christiania. After that the play also reached Berlin, Munich, Vienna, and other German and Austrian theaters. It was played in Paris, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Libre in 1894.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.", "input": "Context_1 : The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer across to the enormous Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury. Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers, as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to be ellipsoidal in shape, though only two of those, Titan and Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second-largest moon (after Jupiter's Ganymede) in the Solar System, with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes found nowhere else in the solar system; and Enceladus since its chemical composition is similar to that of comets. In particular, Enceladus emits jets of gas and dust which could indicate presence of liquid water under its south pole region and could potentially harbor a global ocean under its surface. Context_2 : The atmosphere of Titan is the layer of gases surrounding Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. It is the only thick atmosphere of a natural satellite in the Solar System. Context_3 : The Nice ( ) model is a scenario for the dynamical evolution of the Solar System. It is named for the location of the Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d'Azur, where it was initially developed, in Nice, France. It proposes the migration of the giant planets from an initial compact configuration into their present positions, long after the dissipation of the initial protoplanetary gas disk. In this way, it differs from earlier models of the Solar System's formation. This planetary migration is used in dynamical simulations of the Solar System to explain historical events including the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System, the formation of the Oort cloud, and the existence of populations of small Solar System bodies including the Kuiper belt, the Neptune and Jupiter trojans, and the numerous resonant trans-Neptunian objects dominated by Neptune. Its success at reproducing many of the observed features of the Solar System means that it is widely accepted as the current most realistic model of the Solar System's early evolution, although it is not universally favoured among planetary scientists. Later research revealed a number of differences between the original Nice model's predictions and observations of the current Solar System, for example the orbits of the terrestrial planets and the asteroids, leading to its modification. Context_4 : The Galilean moons are the four largest moons of Jupiter\u2014Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They were first seen by Galileo Galilei in January 1610, and recognized by him as satellites of Jupiter in March 1610. They are the first objects found to orbit another planet. Their names derive from the lovers of Zeus. They are among the largest objects in the Solar System with the exception of the Sun and the eight planets, with a radius larger than any of the dwarf planets. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, and is even bigger than the planet Mercury. The three inner moons\u2014Io, Europa, and Ganymede\u2014are in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance with each other. Because of their much smaller size, and therefore weaker self-gravitation, all of Jupiter's remaining moons have irregular forms rather than a spherical shape. Context_5 : Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8\u00a0years at an average distance of 30.1 AU . It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol \u2646, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident. Context_6 : Located at a varying distance no closer than 33 million miles from the earth, Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the \"Red Planet\" because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. Context_7 : Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although it has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (\u2644) represents the god's sickle. Context_8 : Ganymede (Jupiter III) is the largest and most massive moon of Jupiter and in the Solar System. The ninth largest object in the Solar System, it is the largest without a substantial atmosphere. It has a diameter of 5,268 km and is 8% larger than the planet Mercury, although only 45% as massive. Possessing a metallic core, it has the lowest moment of inertia factor of any solid body in the Solar System and is the only moon known to have a magnetic field. It is the third of the Galilean moons, the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet, and the seventh satellite outward from Jupiter, Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively. Context_9 : Titan is the largest moon of Saturn. It has a substantial atmosphere and is the most Earth-like satellite in the Solar System, making it a popular science fiction setting. Science fiction set on Titan can be roughly divided into the pre- and post-Pioneer eras, with a division set by the flyby of Saturn by the Pioneer 11 space probe on April 5, 1973, which showed that Titan's surface was too cold to sustain (Earthlike) life. Somewhat later, the arrival of Cassini\u2013Huygens mission in 2004 with the Huygens probe's landing in 2005 showed the presence of hydrocarbon lakes on Titan, leading to further changes in its depiction in science fiction. Context_10 : Callisto (Jupiter IV) is the second-largest moon of Jupiter, after Ganymede. It is the third-largest moon in the Solar System after Ganymede and Saturn's largest moon Titan, and the largest object in the Solar System not to be properly differentiated. Callisto was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei. At in diameter, Callisto has about 99% the diameter of the planet Mercury but only about a third of its mass. It is the fourth Galilean moon of Jupiter by distance, with an orbital radius of about . It is not in an orbital resonance like the three other Galilean satellites\u2014Io, Europa, and Ganymede\u2014and is thus not appreciably tidally heated. Callisto's rotation is tidally locked to its orbit around Jupiter, so that the same hemisphere always faces inward; Jupiter appears to stand nearly still in Callisto's sky. It is less affected by Jupiter's magnetosphere than the other inner satellites because of its more remote orbit, located just outside Jupiter's main radiation belt. fact_1 : Callisto (Jupiter IV) is the second-largest moon of Jupiter, after Ganymede. fact_2 :  It is the third-largest moon in the Solar System after Ganymede and Saturn's largest moon Titan, and the largest object in the Solar System not to be properly differentiated. fact_3 :  Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (\u2644) represents the god's sickle.

Women and children are subjected within Lesotho to involuntary domestic servitude and children, to a lesser extent, to commercial sexual exploitation. Basotho victims of transnational trafficking are most often taken to South Africa. Long-distance truck drivers offer to transport women and girls looking for legitimate employment in South Africa. En route, some of these women and girls are raped by the truck drivers, then later prostituted by the driver or an associate. Many men who migrate voluntarily to South Africa to work illegally in agriculture and mining become victims of labor trafficking. Victims work for weeks or months for no pay; just before their promised \u201cpay day\u201d the employers turn them over to authorities to be deported for immigration violations. Women and children are exploited in South Africa in involuntary domestic servitude and commercial sex, and some girls may still be brought to South Africa for forced marriages in remote villages. Some Basotho women who voluntarily migrate to South Africa seeking work in domestic service become victims of traffickers, who detain them in prison-like conditions and force them to engage in prostitution. Most internal and transnational traffickers operate through informal, loose associations and acquire victims from their families and neighbors. Chinese and reportedly Nigerian organized crime units, however, acquire some Basotho victims while transporting foreign victims through Lesotho to Johannesburg, where they \u201cdistribute\u201d victims locally or move them overseas.

Context_7 : Chills is a feeling of coldness occurring during a high fever, but sometimes is also a common symptom which occurs alone in specific people. It occurs during fever due to the release of cytokines and prostaglandins as part of the inflammatory response, which increases the set point for body temperature in the hypothalamus. The increased set point causes the body temperature to rise (pyrexia), but also makes the patient feel cold or chills until the new set point is reached. Shivering also occurs along with chills because the patient's body produces heat during muscle contraction in a physiological attempt to increase body temperature to the new set point. When it does not accompany a high fever, it is normally a light chill. Sometimes a chill of medium power and short duration may occur during a scare, especially in scares of fear, commonly interpreted like or confused by trembling.

Context_10 : The Bod\u00f8 affair was a diplomatic scandal involving Sweden-Norway (then a dual monarchy) and the United Kingdom, which lasted from 1818 to 1821.

The Stockholm foreign ministry, which handled the foreign affairs of Norway at that time, seemed unreasonably favorable to British claims over the Bod\u00f8 incident, thereby angering Norwegians and arousing their nationalism. In 1821 compensation was paid to the British company over Norwegian objections.

In the Bill of Rights of the Philippine constitution, \"habeas corpus\" is guaranteed in terms almost identically to those used in the U.S. Constitution. in Article 3, Section 15 of the Constitution of the Philippines states that \"The privilege of the writ of \"habeas corpus\" shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion when the public safety requires it\". Context_2 : The Military Commissions Act of 2009, which amended the Military Commissions Act of 2006, was passed to address concerns by the United States Supreme Court. In \"Boumediene v.

Context_3 : The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 (sess. ii, chap. 28, 14\u00a0Stat.\u00a0385 ) is an act of Congress that significantly expanded the jurisdiction of federal courts to issue writs of habeas corpus. Passed February 5, 1867, the Act amended the Judiciary Act of 1789 to grant the courts the power to issue writs of habeas corpus \"in all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or any treaty or law of the United States.\" Prior to the Act's passage, prisoners in the custody of one of the states who wished to challenge the legality of their detention could petition for a writ of habeas corpus only in state courts; the federal court system was barred from issuing writs of habeas corpus in their cases. The Act also permitted the court \"to go beyond the return\" and question the truth of the jailer's stated justification for detaining the petitioning prisoner, whereas prior to the Act courts were technically bound to accept the jailer's word that the prisoner was actually being held for the reason stated. The Act largely restored habeas corpus following its 1863 suspension by Congress, ensuring that anyone arrested after its passage could challenge their detention in the federal courts, but denied habeas relief to anyone who was already in military custody for any military offense or for having aided the Confederacy.

Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236 (1963) was a Supreme Court case in which the court first ruled that state inmates had the right to file a writ of habeas corpus challenging both the legality and the conditions of their imprisonment. Prior to this, starting with \"Pervear v. Massachusetts\", 72 U.S. 475 (1866) , the court had maintained a \"hands off\" policy regarding federal interference with state incarceration policies and practices, maintaining that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states.

It began in the House of Representatives as an indemnity bill, introduced on December 5, 1862, releasing the president and his subordinates from any liability for having suspended habeas corpus without congressional approval. The Senate amended the House's bill, and the compromise reported out of the conference committee altered it to qualify the indemnity and to suspend habeas corpus on Congress's own authority. Abraham Lincoln signed the bill into law on March 3, 1863, and suspended habeas corpus under the authority it granted him six months later. The suspension was partially lifted with the issuance of Proclamation 148 by Andrew Johnson, and the Act became inoperative with the end of the Civil War.

Guantanamo Bay is not formally part of the United States, and under the terms of the 1903 lease between the United States and Cuba, Cuba retained ultimate sovereignty over the territory, while the United States exercises complete jurisdiction and control. The case was consolidated with habeas petition \"Al Odah v. United States\".

It was marked by the reign of Amenhotep IV, who changed his name to Akhenaten (1353\u20131336 BC) in order to reflect the dramatic change of Egypt's polytheistic religion into one where the sun disc Aten was worshipped over all other gods. Aten was not solely worshipped (the religion was not monotheistic), but the other gods were worshipped to a significantly lesser degree. The Egyptian pantheon of the equality of all gods and goddesses was restored under Akhenaten's successor, Tutankhamun. Context_2 : The terms Muisca religion and mythology refer to the pre-Columbian beliefs of the Muisca indigenous people of the Cordillera Oriental highlands of the Andes in the vicinity of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

Although S\u00e4ttler claimed that it was the continuation of an ancient pagan religion, it has been recognised by academics as being \"instead the single-handed creation of a highly gifted and educated man\", this figure being S\u00e4ttler himself. Adonism is a polytheistic religion, revolving around a belief that there are five principal gods: Belus, Biltis, Adonis, Dido and Molchos. Adonis is the most prominent of these in the group's theology, being a benevolent figure that S\u00e4ttler equated with the Christian figure of Satan. In contrast to Adonis, Molchos is believed by Adonists to be malevolent, and to be responsible for the enslavement of humanity through monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam: the religion therefore has \"a pronounced anti-Christian bias\".

Context_4 : In economics and finance, present value, also known as present discounted value, is the value of an expected income stream determined as of the date of valuation. The present value is always less than or equal to the future value because money has interest-earning potential, a characteristic referred to as the time value of money, except during times of negative interest rates, when the present value will be more than the future value. Time value can be described with the simplified phrase, \"A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow\". Here, 'worth more' means that its value is greater. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because the dollar can be invested and earn a day's worth of interest, making the total accumulate to a value more than a dollar by tomorrow. Interest can be compared to rent. Just as rent is paid to a landlord by a tenant, without the ownership of the asset being transferred, interest is paid to a lender by a borrower who gains access to the money for a time before paying it back. By letting the borrower have access to the money, the lender has sacrificed the exchange value of this money, and is compensated for it in the form of interest. The initial amount of the borrowed funds (the present value) is less than the total amount of money paid to the lender.

Wealth is measured in three forms: net worth, net worth minus home equity, and liquid assets. Net worth consists of all the aspects mentioned above. Net worth minus home equity is the same except it does not include home ownership in asset calculations. Liquid assets are resources that are readily available such as cash, checking and savings accounts, stocks, and other sources of savings. There are two types of assets: tangible and intangible. Tangible assets most closely resemble liquid assets in that they include stocks, bonds, property, natural resources, and hard assets not in the form of real estate. Intangible assets are simply the access to credit, social capital, cultural capital, political capital, and human capital.

Context_5 : A micellar cubic phase is a lyotropic liquid crystal phase formed when the concentration of micelles dispersed in a solvent (usually water) is sufficiently high that they are forced to pack into a structure having long-ranged positional (translational) order. For example, spherical micelles a subic packing of a body-centred cubic lattice. Normal topology micellar cubic phases, denoted by the symbol I, are the first lyotropic liquid crystalline phases that are formed by type I amphiphiles. The amphiphiles' hydrocarbon tails are contained on the inside of the micelle and hence the polar-apolar interface of the aggregates has a positive mean curvature, by definition (it curves away from the polar phase). Inverse topology micellar cubic phases (such as the Fd3m phase) are observed for some type II amphiphiles at very high amphiphile concentrations. These aggregates, in which water is the minority phase, have a polar-apolar interface with a negative mean curvature. The structures of the normal topology micellar cubic phases that are formed by some types of amphiphiles (e.g. the oligoethyleneoxide monoalkyl ether series of non-ionic surfactants are the subject of debate. Micellar cubic phases are isotropic phases, but are distinguished from micellar solutions by their very high viscosity. When thin film samples of micellar cubic phases are viewed under a polarising microscope they appear dark and featureless.

Context_10 : The far-right tradition in France finds its origins in the Third Republic with Boulangism and the Dreyfus Affair. The modern \"far right\" or radical right grew out of two separate events of 1889: the splitting off in the Socialist International of those who chose the nation and the culmination of the \"Boulanger Affair\", which championed the demands of the former Minister of War General Georges Boulanger. The Dreyfus Affair provided one of the political division lines of France. Nationalism, which had been before the Dreyfus Affair a left-wing and Republican ideology, turned after that to be a main trait of the right-wing and, moreover, of the far right. A new right emerged, and nationalism was reappropriated by the far right who turned it into a form of ethnic nationalism, itself blended with anti-Semitism, xenophobia, anti-Protestantism and anti-Masonry. The Action fran\u00e7aise, first founded as a review, was the matrix of a new type of counter-revolutionary right-wing, and continues to exist today.

The deal was at that time the largest in baseball history, in terms of both total value and average annual salary. To honor his father, Bonds switched his jersey number to 25 once he signed with the Giants, as it had been Bobby's number in San Francisco. (His number during most of his stay with the Pirates, 24, was retired in honor of Mays anyway).

He was the first Christian king of all of Mercia, though it is not known when or how he converted from Anglo-Saxon paganism. His accession marked the end of Oswiu of Northumbria's overlordship of southern England, and Wulfhere extended his influence over much of that region. His campaigns against the West Saxons led to Mercian control of much of the Thames valley. He conquered the Isle of Wight and the Meon valley and gave them to King \u00c6thelwealh of the South Saxons. He also had influence in Surrey, Essex, and Kent. He married Eormenhild, the daughter of King Eorcenberht of Kent. Context_2 : The Weorgoran (Old English: \"\u2009\" \"people of the winding river\") were a people of Saxon England, a precursor of the minor kingdom of Hwicce. The Weorgoran were centered on Worcester (\"Weorgoran ceaster \"). They were probably (though not certainly) West Saxons and occupied the area some time after the defeat of the Britons at the Battle of Dyrham in 577. The settlement was elevated to a bishopric in 680. Context_3 : Eohric (died 902) was a Danish Viking king of East Anglia. The name \"Eohric\" is the Old English form of the Old Norse \"Eir\u00edkr\". Little is known of Eohric or of the kingdom of East Anglia in his time. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" recorded that an army from East Anglia raided Mercia and Wessex, and a West Saxon army raided East Anglia in retaliation. The Vikings met a section of the West Saxons at the Battle of the Holme on 13 December 902, and Eohric was killed. Context_4 : The Saxons (Latin: \"Saxones\" , Old English: \"Seaxe\" , Old Saxon: \"Sahson\" , Low German: \"Sassen\" , German: \"Sachsen\" , Dutch: \"Saksen\" , Welsh: \"Saeson\" ) were a group of Germanic tribes first mentioned as living near the North Sea coast of what is now Germany (Old Saxony), in the late Roman empire. They were soon mentioned as raiding and settling in many North Sea areas, as well as pushing south inland towards the Franks. Significant numbers settled in large parts of Great Britain in the early Middle Ages and formed part of the merged group of Anglo-Saxons who eventually organised the first united Kingdom of England. Many Saxons however remained in Germania (Old Saxony c. 531-804), where they resisted the expanding Frankish Empire through the leadership of the semi-legendary Saxon hero, Widukind. Initially, Saxons of Britain and those of Old Saxony (Northern Germany) were both referred to as 'Saxons' in an indiscriminate manner. The term Anglo-Saxon, in turn, came into practice in the 8th century (probably by Paul the Deacon) to distinguish English Saxons from continental Saxons (Ealdseaxe, 'old Saxons'). Context_5 : Cenberht (Old English: C\u0113nberht or C\u0153\u0305nberht ) (died c. 661) was a king in the lands of the West Saxons. Context_6 : The Battle of Bensington was a major battle fought between Mercia, led by King Offa, and the West Saxons led by Cynewulf of Wessex. It ended with a victory for the Mercians, and the West Saxons recognizing Mercian overlordship. Context_7 : Lychpit is now the name of a modern housing development adjacent to Old Basing near Basingstoke, Hampshire. The modern development started in the early 1980s but the area has an ancient past associated with that of Old Basing. The name derives from a wooded dell that still exists at the western end of Little Basing. Lych or Lich being the Old English name for a corpse, it is assumed that the pit was therefore some kind of mass burial ground, local tradition associating it with the Danish victory over Alfred's Saxons at the Battle of Basing in 871. Another possibility is that it was used to bury casualties of the Battle of Basing House, where Oliver Cromwell's troops laid siege to and eventually sacked this large private house. Several of the local roads bear the names of Cromwell's officers e.g. Norton Ride and Gage Close. Context_8 : The Battle of Aclea occurred in 851 between the West Saxons led by \u00c6thelwulf, King of Wessex and the Danish Vikings. It resulted in a West Saxon victory. Context_9 : \u00c6thelwulf (Old English for \"Noble Wolf\"; died 13 January 858) was King of Wessex from 839 to 858. In 825, his father, King Egbert, defeated King Beornwulf of Mercia, ending a long Mercian dominance over Anglo-Saxon England south of the Humber. Egbert sent \u00c6thelwulf with an army to Kent, where he expelled the Mercian sub-king and was himself appointed sub-king. After 830, Egbert maintained good relations with Mercia, and this was continued by \u00c6thelwulf when he became king in 839, the first son to succeed his father as West Saxon king since 641. Context_10 : \u00c6thelberht (or Ethelbert; Old English: \"\u00c6\u00feelberht\" , meaning \"magnificent noble\") was the King of Kent from 858 and of Wessex from 860 until his death in 865. He was the third son of \u00c6thelwulf of Wessex and his first wife, Osburh. In 855 he became under-king of Kent while his father, \u00c6thelwulf, visited Rome. His brother \u00c6thelbald was left in charge of the West Saxons. After his father's death in 858 he succeeded him as king of Kent and the other eastern parts of the kingdom. When \u00c6thelbald died childless in 860, the kingship of the West Saxons also passed to \u00c6thelberht. fact_1 : The Battle of Aclea occurred in 851 between the West Saxons led by \u00c6thelwulf, King of Wessex and the Danish Vikings. fact_2 : \u00c6thelwulf (Old English for \"Noble Wolf\"; died 13 January 858) was King of Wessex from 839 to 858.

It was also located a mile north of where the wagon road had its junction with a cutoff to the north to the wagon road called the Upper Emigrant Road between Fredricksburg, Texas and Comanche Springs, now Fort Stockton, Texas, where it joined the Lower Emigrant Road. It was later a stopping place on the route of San Antonio - El Paso Mail and the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line.

This family came from Germany on the ship Rainer and landed in Philadelphia in 1749 with one individual named Christian Kneip. After living his life in the Pennsylvania area, including marrying and having children, serving in the American Revolution on the side of the Patriots, his son, also named Christian, migrated south along the Great Wagon Road to settle in Rowan County near the present town of Salisbury.

Context_9 : Historic Lausanne, also often called Lausanne Landing of the 1790s-1820s was a small settlement at the mouth of Nesquehoning Creek on the Lehigh River in marshy delta-like flood plain. Some historic references will instead mention the 'Landing Tavern', and the reader must understand that Lausanne was a township organized in the wilderness with an almost unyeilding terrain hostile to man, but along an ancient Amerindian Trail, \"the \u201cWarriors' Path\u201d\" the white man could not resist traveling since it connected the Susquehanna River settlements of the lower Wyoming Valley to those around Philadelphia. During the American Revolution, this route would become the rough 'Lausanne-Nescopeck Road', and after the turn of the century with a charter (1804), be improved into the wagon road toll road the Lehigh and Susquehanna Turnpike. The fan-shaped plain provided some of the flattest landscape terrain in the entire area, so could also support a few small farm plots, boat building, and a lumbermill. With the widespread deforestation creating the nation's first energy crises, what it also did was attract attention of timber and lumber companies, for the Lehigh could (at least, seasonally with preparation) support river arks. The Nesquehoning Creek mouth issues behind a small river island and sits above the long curved lake-like upper pool of the Lehigh below the outlet of the gorge, and its delta's smoothly sloped sides made an attractive landing beach, giving name to the Inn. With the popularity of the route and the roughness of the country, often called \"\u201cThe Switzerland of America\u201d\" the location was a natural rest stop for the next leg to the north involved a steep climb and was over nine miles to the area of Beaver Meadows.

Context_2 : The Kellex Corporation was a wholly owned subsidiary of M. W. Kellogg Company. Kellex was formed in 1942 so that Kellogg's operations relating to the Manhattan Project could be kept separate and secret. \"Kell\" stood for \"Kellogg\" and \"X\" for secret. The new company's goal was to design a facility for the production of enriched uranium through gaseous diffusion. In gaseous diffusion, isotopes of Uranium-235 could be separated from Uranium-238 by turning uranium metal into uranium hexafluoride gas and straining it through a barrier material. Context_3 : The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) is a facility located in McCracken County, Kentucky, near Paducah, Kentucky that produced enriched uranium 1952\u20132013.

Context_5 : The Manhattan Project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District; \"Manhattan\" gradually became the codename for the entire project. Along the way, the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys. The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2\u00a0billion (about $ in 2016 dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and producing the fissionable materials, with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons. Context_6 : Gaseous diffusion is a technology used to produce enriched uranium by forcing gaseous uranium hexafluoride (UF) through semipermeable membranes. This produces a slight separation between the molecules containing uranium-235 (U) and uranium-238 (U). By use of a large cascade of many stages, high separations can be achieved. It was the first process to be developed that was capable of producing enriched uranium in industrially useful quantities. Context_7 : K-25 was the codename given by the Manhattan Project during World War II for the project to produce enriched uranium for atomic bombs using the gaseous diffusion method. Originally the codename for the product, over time it came to refer to the project, the production facility located at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the main gaseous diffusion building, and ultimately the site. When it was built in 1944, the four-story K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was the world's largest building, with over 1640000 sqft of floor space and a volume of 97500000 cuft .

Context_10 : The Ames Project was a research and development project that was part of the larger Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bombs during World War II. It was founded by Frank Spedding from Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa as an offshoot of the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago devoted to chemistry and metallurgy, but became a separate project in its own right. The Ames Project developed the Ames Process, a method for preparing pure uranium metal that the Manhattan Project needed for its atomic bombs and nuclear reactors. Between 1942 and 1945, it produced over 1000 ST of uranium metal. It also developed methods of preparing and casting thorium, cerium and beryllium. In October 1945 Iowa State College received the Army-Navy \"E\" Award for Excellence in Production, an award usually only given to industrial organizations. In 1947 it became the Ames Laboratory, a national laboratory under the Atomic Energy Commission. fact_1 : Poplar Creek is a tributary of the Clinch River in Anderson and Roane counties in East Tennessee. fact_2 :  Draining a watershed area of more than 82 mi2 , it enters the Clinch near the former K-25 site, a short distance downstream from the confluence of East Fork Poplar Creek, its largest tributary. fact_3 : K-25 was the codename given by the Manhattan Project during World War II for the project to produce enriched uranium for atomic bombs using the gaseous diffusion method.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.", "input": "Context_1 : Environmental DNA or eDNA is DNA that is collected from a variety of environmental samples such as soil, seawater, or even air rather than directly sampled from an individual organism. As various organisms interact with the environment, DNA is expelled and accumulates in their surroundings. Example sources of eDNA include, but are not limited to, feces, mucus, gametes, shed skin, carcasses and hair. Such samples can be analyzed by high-throughput DNA sequencing methods, known as metagenomics, for rapid measurement and monitoring of biodiversity. In order to better differentiate between organisms within a sample, DNA metabarcoding is used in which the sample is analyzed and uses previously studied DNA libraries to determine what organisms are present (e.g. BLAST). The analysis of eDNA has great potential, not only for monitoring common species, but to genetically detect and identify other extant species that could influence conservation efforts. This method allows for biomonitoring without requiring collection of the living organism, creating the ability to study organisms that are invasive, elusive, or endangered without introducing anthropogenic stress on the organism. Access to this genetic information makes a critical contribution to the understanding of population size, species distribution, and population dynamics for species not well documented. The integrity of eDNA samples is dependent upon its preservation within the environment. Soil, permafrost, freshwater and seawater are well-studied macro environments from which eDNA samples have been extracted, each of which include many more conditioned subenvironments. Because of its versatility, eDNA is applied in many subenvironments such as freshwater sampling, seawater sampling, terrestrial soil sampling (tundra permafrost), aquatic soil sampling (river, lake, pond, and ocean sediment), or other environments where normal sampling procedures can become problematic. Context_2 : Xenoestrogens are a type of xenohormone that imitates estrogen. They can be either synthetic or natural chemical compounds. Synthetic xenoestrogens are widely used industrial compounds, such as PCBs, BPA, and phthalates, which have estrogenic effects on a living organism even though they differ chemically from the estrogenic substances produced internally by the endocrine system of any organism. Natural xenoestrogens include phytoestrogens which are plant-derived xenoestrogens. Because the primary route of exposure to these compounds is by consumption of phytoestrogenic plants, they are sometimes called \"dietary estrogens\". Mycoestrogens, estrogenic substances from fungi, are another type of xenoestrogen that are also considered mycotoxins. Context_3 : Pharmacokinetics (from Ancient Greek \"pharmakon\" \"drug\" and \"kinetikos\" \"moving, putting in motion\"; see chemical kinetics), sometimes abbreviated as PK, is a branch of pharmacology dedicated to determining the fate of substances administered to a living organism. The substances of interest include any chemical xenobiotic such as: pharmaceutical drugs, pesticides, food additives, cosmetic ingredients, etc. It attempts to analyze chemical metabolism and to discover the fate of a chemical from the moment that it is administered up to the point at which it is completely eliminated from the body. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how an organism affects a drug, whereas pharmacodynamics is the study of how the drug affects the organism. Both together influence dosing, benefit, and adverse effects, as seen in PK/PD models. Context_4 : Wigglesworthia glossinidia is a species of gram-negative bacteria which was isolated from the gut of the tsetse fly. \"W. glossinidia\" is a bacterial endosymbiont of the tsetse fly. Because of this relationship, \"Wigglesworthia\" has lost a large part of its genome and has one of the smallest known genomes of any living organism, consisting of a single chromosome of 700,000 bp and a plasmid of 5,200. Together with \"Buchnera aphidicola\", \"Wigglesworthia\" has been the subject of genetic research into the minimal genome necessary for any living organism. \"Wigglesworthia\" also synthesizes key B-complex vitamins which the tsetse fly does not get from its diet of blood. Without the vitamins \"Wigglesworthia\" produces, the tsetse fly has greatly reduced growth and reproduction. Since the tsetse fly is the primary vector of \"Trypanosoma brucei\", the pathogen that causes African trypanosomiasis, it has been suggested that \"W. glossinidia\" may one day be used to help control the spread of this disease. Context_5 : A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques (i.e., a genetically \"engineered\" organism). GMOs are used to produce many medications and genetically modified foods and are widely used in scientific research and the production of other goods. The term GMO is very close to the technical legal term, 'living modified organism', defined in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which regulates international trade in living GMOs (specifically, \"any living organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology\"). Context_6 : Heuchera is a genus of evergreen, herbaceous perennial plants in the family Saxifragaceae, all native to North America. Common names include alumroot and coral bells. Context_7 : Pando (Latin for \"I spread\"), also known as the Trembling Giant, is a clonal colony of a single male quaking aspen (\"Populus tremuloides\") determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers and assumed to have one massive underground root system. The plant is estimated to weigh collectively 6000000 kg , making it the heaviest known organism. The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms. Context_8 : Glottiphyllum is a genus of about 57 species of succulent subtropical plants of the family \"Aizoaceae\". Context_9 : In sociology, the social organism is an ideological concept in which a society or social structure is viewed as a \"living organism\". From this perspective, typically, the relation of social features, e.g. law, family, crime, etc., are examined as they interact with other features of society to meet social needs. All elements of a society or social organism have a function that maintains the stability and cohesiveness of the organism. Context_10 : An epibiont (from the Ancient Greek meaning \"living on top of\") is an organism that lives on the surface of another living organism. An epibiont is, by definition, harmless to its host and in this sense, the relationship between the two organisms can be considered neutralistic or commensalistic (as opposed to, for example, parasitic, in which case one organism benefits at the expense of the other, or mutualistic, in which both organisms obtain some explicit benefit from their coexistence). Although there is no direct effect of the epibiont to the host, there are often indirect effects resulting from this interaction and change in the surface of the host. This has been found to be especially important to marine organisms and aquatic ecosystems as surface qualities do impact necessary ecological functions such as drag, radiation absorption, nutrient uptake etc. Examples of common epibionts are barnacles, remoras and algae, many of which live on the surfaces of larger marine organisms such as whales, sharks, sea turtles and mangrove trees. The host of the epibiont is typically referred to as the basibiont (\"living underneath\"). fact_1 : Heuchera is a genus of evergreen, herbaceous perennial plants in the family Saxifragaceae, all native to North America. fact_2 : Glottiphyllum is a genus of about 57 species of succulent subtropical plants of the family \"Aizoaceae\".

Its name was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1979. Gluck is named for the Austrian composer Christoph Willibald Gluck, who lived from 1714 to 1787. Context_2 : D\u00e9janire is an opera (trag\u00e9die lyrique) in 4 acts composed by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns to a libretto in French by Louis Gallet and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. The last of Saint-Sa\u00ebns' operas, it premiered on 14 March 1911 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Monte-Carlo. One of the opera's central characters, Hercule (Hercules), had been the subject of two earlier symphonic poems by Saint-Sa\u00ebns \u2013 \"Le Rouet d'Omphale\" (1872) and \"La Jeunesse d'Hercule\" (1877). The story is based on \"The Trachiniae\" by Sophocles (also the source for Handel's opera \"Hercules\"). Context_3 : Paride ed Elena (] ; \"Paris and Helen\") is an opera by Christoph Willibald Gluck. It is the third of Gluck's so-called reform operas for Vienna, following \"Alceste\" and \"Orfeo ed Euridice\", and the least often performed of the three. Like its predecessors, the libretto was written by Ranieri de' Calzabigi. The opera tells the story of the events between the Judgment of Paris and the flight of Paris and Helen to Troy. It was premiered at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 3 November 1770. Context_4 : L'\u00eele de Merlin, ou Le monde renvers\u00e9 (Merlin's Island, or the World Upended) is an op\u00e9ra comique in one act composed by Christoph Willibald Gluck to a 1753 French libretto by Louis Anseaume based on Alain Ren\u00e9 Lesage and D'Orneval's 1718 vaudeville comedy \"Le monde renvers\u00e9\". Gluck's version was first performed on 3 October 1758 at the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace in Vienna. Context_5 : Charles-Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns (] , traditionally pronounced ] in French; (9 October 183516 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), \"Danse macabre\" (1874), the opera \"Samson and Delilah\" (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\"Organ\") Symphony (1886) and \"The Carnival of the Animals\" (1886). Context_6 : The city of Paris has been an important center for European music since the Middle Ages. It was noted for its choral music in the 12th century, for its role in the development of ballet during the Renaissance, in the 19th century it became famous for its music halls and cabarets, and in the 20th century for the first performances of the Ballets Russes, its jazz clubs, and its part in the development of serial music. Paris has been home to many important composers, to name a few: Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Franz Liszt, Jacques Offenbach, Georges Bizet, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Hector Berlioz, Paul Dukas, Gabriel Faur\u00e9, C\u00e9sar Franck, Charles Gounod, Jules Massenet, Vincent d'Indy, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Erik Satie, Igor Stravinsky, Sidney Bechet... Context_7 : Henri-Joseph Rigel (9 February 1741 \u2013 2 May 1799) was a German-born composer of the Classical era who spent most of his working life in France. He was born in Wertheim am Main where his father was musical intendant to the local prince. After an education in Germany, where his teachers included Niccol\u00f2 Jommelli, Rigel moved to Paris in 1767. He quickly acquired a reputation in musical circles and published harpsichord pieces, string quartets, symphonies and concertos. He began composing for the Concert Spirituel, most notably four hi\u00e9rodrames (oratorios on sacred themes): \"La sortie d'Egypte\" (1774), \"La destruction de Jericho\" (1778), \"Jepht\u00e9\" (1783) and \"Les Macchab\u00e9es\" (score lost). These show the influence of Christoph Willibald Gluck, and Gluck himself praised \"La sortie d'\u00c9gypte\". Between 1778 and 1799 Rigel also wrote 14 operas, including the \"op\u00e9ra comique\" \"Le savetier et le financier\" (1778). Context_8 : Salieri's opera was first performed at the Vienna Burgtheater on 2 June 1771, and his composition was much influenced by the aesthetics of Christoph Willibald Gluck, who attempted to reform \"opera seria\" by tying the drama more closely to the music. Salieri's overture follows the principles set out by Gluck in the preface to \"Alceste\". Other Gluckian influences display themselves in the frequent interplay of soloist and chorus, and the heavy use of chorus overall. Context_9 : The following discography for Gluck's opera \"Orfeo ed Euridice\" is mainly based on the research of Giuseppe Rossi, which appeared in the programme notes to the performance of the work at the 70th Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in 2007, under the title \"Discografia \u2013 Christoph Willibald Gluck \u2013 Orfeo ed Euridice (Orph\u00e9e et Eurydice)\". Rossi's data has been checked against the sources referenced in the notes. Context_10 : Christoph Willibald (Ritter von) Gluck (] ; 2 July 1714 \u2013 15 November 1787) was a composer of Italian and French opera in the early classical period. Born in the Upper Palatinate (now part of Germany) and raised in Bohemia, he gained prominence at the Habsburg court at Vienna, where he brought about the practical reform of opera's dramaturgical practices that many intellectuals had been campaigning for over the years. With a series of radical new works in the 1760s, among them \"Orfeo ed Euridice\" and \"Alceste\", he broke the stranglehold that Metastasian \"opera seria\" had enjoyed for much of the century. fact_1 : Christoph Willibald (Ritter von) Gluck (] ; 2 July 1714 \u2013 15 November 1787) was a composer of Italian and French opera in the early classical period. fact_2 : Charles-Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns (] , traditionally pronounced ] in French; (9 October 183516 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era.

For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes\u2019 theorem, a person\u2019s age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age. Context_2 : In computability theory the \"s\" theorem, (also called the translation lemma, parameter theorem, and the parameterization theorem) is a basic result about programming languages (and, more generally, G\u00f6del numberings of the computable functions) (Soare 1987, Rogers 1967). It was first proved by Stephen Cole Kleene (1943). The name \"s\" comes from the occurrence of a \"s\" with subscript \"n\" and superscript \"m\" in the original formulation of the theorem (see below). Context_3 : born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia or Giuseppe Ludovico De la Grange Tournier (also reported as Giuseppe Luigi Lagrange or Lagrangia) (25 January 1736 \u2013 10 April 1813), was an Italian Enlightenment Era mathematician and astronomer. He made significant contributions to the fields of analysis, number theory, and both classical and celestial mechanics. Context_4 : In number theory, Lagrange's theorem is a statement named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange about how frequently a polynomial over the integers may evaluate to a multiple of a fixed prime. More precisely, it states that if \"p\" is a prime number and formula_1 is a polynomial with integer coefficients, then either: Context_5 : Paul Guldin (original name Habakkuk Guldin; 12 June 1577 (Mels) \u2013 3 November 1643 (Graz)) was a Swiss Jesuit mathematician and astronomer. He discovered the Guldinus theorem to determine the surface and the volume of a solid of revolution. (This theorem is also known as the Pappus\u2013Guldinus theorem and Pappus's centroid theorem, attributed to Pappus of Alexandria.) Guldin was noted for his association with the German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler. Guldin composed a critique of Cavalieri's method of Indivisibles. Context_6 : Sakura Kinomoto (\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u685c , Kinomoto Sakura ) is the main protagonist and title character of Clamp's manga series \"Cardcaptor Sakura\". In the English anime adaptation by Nelvana of the series, \"Cardcaptors\", her name is changed to Sakura Avalon, though it was changed back to her original name in the dub of the 2nd film by Bang Zoom! Entertainment. For the alternative English dub by Omni Productions, her original name was fully kept, making it more faithfully closer to the original Japanese version. For all Japanese-language productions of the anime (including movies, audio CDs, and video games), Sakura is voiced by Sakura Tange. For the Nelvana English-language dub production, she is voiced by Carly McKillip through \"Cardcaptors\" and the first movie. She is voiced in the second movie by Kari Wahlgren. For the alternative English dub produced by Omni Productions to air on Animax Asia, she was voiced by Andrea Kwan. Context_7 : Ganja (Azerbaijani: \"G\u0259nc\u0259\" ] ) is Azerbaijan's second largest city with a population of around 325,200. It was named Elisabethpol (Russian: \u0415\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043f\u043e\u0301\u043b\u044c , \"Yelizavetpol\"; ] ) in the Russian Empire period. The city regained its original name, Ganja, in 1920 during the first part of its incorporation into the Soviet Union. However, its name was changed again in 1935 to Kirovabad (Russian: \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0301\u0434 ; ] ) and retained that name through most of the rest of the Soviet period. In 1989, during Perestroika, the city regained its original name. Context_8 : Colonnade Row, also known as LaGrange Terrace, on present-day Lafayette Street in New York City's NoHo neighborhood, is a landmarked series of Greek revival buildings originally built in the early 1830s. They are believed to have been built by Seth Geer, although the project has been attributed to a number of other architects. The buildings' original name comes from the Marquis de Lafayette's estate in France, but the series of nine row houses, of which four remain, owe their existence to John Jacob Astor, who bought the property and whose grandson John Jacob Astor III later lived at No. 424. The buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name LaGrange Terrace and the facades remain standing on Lafayette Street south of Astor Place. Context_9 : EPRU Stadium, also known by its original name of Boet Erasmus Stadium, was a stadium in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. The letters \"EPRU\" in the name represent the Eastern Province Rugby Union, the company behind the stadium's historic primary tenants, the Mighty Elephants. The original name Boet Erasmus Stadium was named after Boet Erasmus, a former mayor of Port Elizabeth. The stadium held a capacity of 33,852 people and served primarily as a venue for rugby union matches but also hosted a number of football fixtures. Context_10 : Ptychography ( ; \"\u03c0\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf-\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1\", from \u03c0\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae = fold + \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae = writing/scripture) is a technique invented by Walter Hoppe that aims to solve the diffraction-pattern phase problem by interfering adjacent Bragg reflections coherently and thereby determine their relative phase. In the original formulation, Hoppe envisaged that such interference could be effected by placing a very narrow aperture in the plane of the specimen so that each reciprocal-lattice point would be spread out and thus overlap with other points. The name ptychography, from the Greek for \"fold\", derives from this optical configuration; each reciprocal lattice point is convolved with some function, and thus made to interfere with its neighbors. In fact, measuring only the intensities of interfering adjacent diffracted beams still leads to an ambiguity of two possible complex conjugates for each underlying complex diffraction amplitude. The original formulation of ptychography is equivalent to the well known theorem that for a finite specimen (that is one delineated by a narrow aperture, sometimes known as a \"finite support\"), the one-dimensional phase problem is soluble to within an ambiguity of 2N, where N is the number of Fourier components that make up the specimen. However, such ambiguities may be resolved by changing the phase, profile or position of the illuminating beam in some way. The fact that not only the intensities of the diffracted beams but also the intensities lying midway between the beams, where the convolved Bragg beams interfere, is an alternative statement of the Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem for components of diffracted intensity. These components generally have twice the frequency (in reciprocal space) of their underlying complex amplitudes. fact_1 : In number theory, Lagrange's theorem is a statement named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange about how frequently a polynomial over the integers may evaluate to a multiple of a fixed prime. fact_2 : born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia or Giuseppe Ludovico De la Grange Tournier (also reported as Giuseppe Luigi Lagrange or Lagrangia) (25 January 1736 \u2013 10 April 1813), was an Italian Enlightenment Era mathematician and astronomer.

The poem, which is commonly used in wedding speeches and readings is quoted frequently. It was included in a 1936 anthology entitled \"Best Loved Poems of American People\", edited by a Hazel Felleman, and published by Doubleday (ISBN\u00a0 ) and appears without further attribution in \"The Family Book of Best Loved Poems\", edited by David L. George and published in 1952 by Doubleday & Company, Inc., then of Garden City, New York. German translations of the poem circulate with the title \"Ich liebe Dich\" (\"I Love You\") but are (wrongly) credited to the Austrian poet Erich Fried. The translation(s) led to the speculation that the poem was just a translation of Erich Fried's work and Roy Croft was a pseudonym used by a translator who wanted to keep all royalties from publication (rather than sharing them with Fried's estate) or who simply did not want to go through the trouble of obtaining a license from a foreign entity. Taking into account that the poem was already published in 1936 (where Erich Fried was only 15) it seems very unlikely that Erich Fried could be the author.

Context_4 : Ray Martin (Raymond Stuart Martin; born Kurt Kohn and later anglicised his name) (11 October 1918 - 7 February 1988) was a British-Austrian orchestra leader. He was noted for his light music compositions. Allmusic journalist, Bradley Torreano stated \"Ray Martin created a legacy for himself in British popular music through his work with his orchestra during the 1950s. His regular appearances on radio and television kept him in the public spotlight, while his position at EMI Records made him an influential producer at the label. His use of pseudonyms has blurred the path of his career through the years, making his many contributions even harder to keep track of. But his original compositions are what really made him popular; tracks like \"Marching Strings\" have become stables of many public and city bands and orchestras since their release\". Context_5 : \"They Call the Wind Maria\" is an American popular song with lyrics written by Alan J. Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe for their 1951 Broadway musical, \"Paint Your Wagon\", which is set in the California Gold Rush. Rufus Smith originally sang the song on Broadway, and Joseph Leader was the original singer in London's West End. It quickly became a runaway hit, and during the Korean War, the song was among the \"popular music listened to by the troops\". Vaughan Monroe and his Orchestra recorded the song in 1951, and it was among the \"popular hit singles at the record stores\" that year. It has since become a standard, performed by many notable singers across several genres of popular music. A striking feature of the song in the original orchestration (also used in many cover versions), is a driving, staccato rhythm, played on the string instruments, that evokes a sense of restless motion. Context_6 : Bob Dylan ( ; born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, painter, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when he became a reluctant \"voice of a generation\" with songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\", which became anthems for the Civil Rights Movement and anti-war movement. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Context_7 : Cory Morrow (born May 1, 1972 in Houston, Texas) is a Texas Country singer/songwriter who has gained popularity throughout the Southwest. Morrow started playing guitar at Memorial High School in Houston. He continued to develop as a musician while attending Texas Tech University, where he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. In 1993, Morrow moved to Austin, Texas to pursue music as a career. He is also considered part of the Red Dirt music scene, that differentiates itself from the popular Nashville music scene. Morrow has sold over 200,000 albums independently. Morrow's 2002 release Outside the Lines reached No.\u00a028 on Billboard's Country Album chart, No.\u00a03 on the magazine's Internet Sales chart, No.\u00a08 on its Independent Album chart and No.\u00a016 on Heatseekers chart. SoundScan ranked him No.\u00a07 among \u201ccountry debut artists\u201d that year. Context_8 : British pop music is popular music, produced commercially in the United Kingdom. It emerged in the mid-to late 1950s as a softer alternative to rock 'n' roll and later to rock music. Like American pop music it has a focus on commercial recording, often orientated towards a youth market, as well as that of the Singles Chart usually through the medium of relatively short and simple love songs. While these basic elements of the genre have remained fairly constant, pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of popular music, particularly borrowing from the development of rock music, and utilising key technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes. From the British Invasion of the 1960s, led by The Beatles, British pop music has alternated between acts and genres with national appeal and those with international success that have had a considerable impact on the development of the wider genre and on popular music in general. Context_9 : Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.

Exploration and Production are deemed to fall within the \"upstream\" sector of the oil and gas industry. Exploration, by earth scientists, and petroleum engineering are the oil and gas industry's two main subsurface disciplines, which focus on maximizing economic recovery of hydrocarbons from subsurface reservoirs. Petroleum geology and geophysics focus on provision of a static description of the hydrocarbon reservoir rock, while petroleum engineering focuses on estimation of the recoverable volume of this resource using a detailed understanding of the physical behavior of oil, water and gas within porous rock at very high pressure. Context_2 : In petroleum geology, source rock refers to rocks from which hydrocarbons have been generated or are capable of being generated.

It was designed by V. M. Melnikov, an alumnus of Isaev, within Korolev's Bureau, for the Molniya fourth stage, the Block-L. It was also the first Soviet engine designed for start and restart in vacuum and had the highest \"I\" at the time of its deployment. Context_2 : The PGM-19 Jupiter was the first nuclear tipped, medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) of the United States Air Force (USAF). It was a liquid-propellant rocket using RP-1 fuel and LOX oxidizer, with a single Rocketdyne LR70-NA (model S-3D) rocket engine producing 667\u00a0kN of thrust. It was armed with the 1.1\u00a0megaton W49 nuclear warhead. The prime contractor was the Chrysler Corporation. Context_3 : The HWK 109-507 was a liquid-propellant rocket engine developed by Germany during World War II. It was used to propel the Hs 293 anti-ship guided missile. Context_4 : Project Wizard was a Cold War-era anti-ballistic missile system to defend against short and medium-range threats of the V-2 rocket type. It was contracted by the US Army Air Force in March 1946 with the University of Michigan's Aeronautical Research Center (MARC). A similar effort, Project Thumper, started at General Electric. Context_5 : A liquid-propellant rocket or liquid rocket is a rocket engine that uses liquid propellants. Liquids are desirable because their reasonably high density allows the volume of the propellant tanks to be relatively low, and it is possible to use lightweight centrifugal turbopumps to pump the propellant from the tanks into the combustion chamber, which means that the propellants can be kept under low pressure. This permits the use of low-mass propellant tanks, resulting in a high mass ratio for the rocket. Context_6 : The GE X-405 \u2014 U.S. Navy designation XLR50-GE-2 \u2014 was a pump-fed liquid-propellant rocket engine burning RP-1 and LOX in a gas generator cycle developed by General Electric. It was used to power the first stage of the Vanguard rockets on the Vanguard project. As was common to engines based on the V-2 experience, the turbine was driven by steam generated by catalytic decomposition of HO and the combustion chamber was regeneratively cooled. The engine was gimbaled to supply thrust vectoring. Also, the exhaust gases of the turbine were ducted to dual auxiliary nozzles that acted as verniers to enable roll control of the rocket. Context_7 : The V-2 (German: \"Vergeltungswaffe 2\" , \"Retribution Weapon 2\"), technical name Aggregat 4 (A4), was the world's first long-range guided ballistic missile. The missile with a liquid-propellant rocket engine was developed during the Second World War in Germany as a \"vengeance weapon\", assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings against German cities. The V-2 rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into outer space by crossing the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944. Context_8 : The Bell Aerosystems Company XLR81 (Model 8096) was an American liquid-propellant rocket engine, which was used on the Agena upper stage. It burned UDMH and RFNA fed by a turbopump in a fuel rich gas generator cycle. The turbopump had a single turbine with a gearbox to transmit power to the oxidizer and fuel pumps. The thrust chamber was all-aluminum, and regeneratively cooled by oxidizer flowing through gun-drilled passages in the combustion chamber and throat walls. The nozzle was a titanium radiatively cooled extension. The engine was mounted on an hydraulic actuated gimbal which enabled it thrust vectoring to control pitch and yaw. Engine thrust and mixture ratio were controlled by cavitating flow venturis on the gas generator flow circuit. Engine start was achieved by solid propellant start cartridge. Context_9 : The F-1 is a gas-generator cycle rocket engine developed in the United States by Rocketdyne in the late 1950s and used in the Saturn V rocket in the 1960s and early 1970s.

Nationalism, which had been before the Dreyfus Affair a left-wing and Republican ideology, turned after that to be a main trait of the right-wing and, moreover, of the far right. A new right emerged, and nationalism was reappropriated by the far right who turned it into a form of ethnic nationalism, itself blended with anti-Semitism, xenophobia, anti-Protestantism and anti-Masonry.

Context_2 : Pauline Duchambge n\u00e9e de Montet (1778 \u2013 23 April 1858) was a French Creole pianist, singer, and composer. Duchambdge (Montet) was born in Martinique, West Indies and was the daughter of a noble family. She was taken to Paris, where she received a convent education and studied the piano from composer and author Jean Baptiste Desormery, son of the famous comic opera actor and composer L\u00e9opold-Bastien Desormery. Pauline composed and performed as a singer and a pianist. She studied harmony and composition with Daniel Auber and with Luigi Cherubini, who wrote several compositions for her. She also studied piano and composition with Jan Ladislav Dussek. Pauline left the convent in 1792 and married Baron Duchambge in 1796. In 1798 at the age of 20, she lost both her parents and with them the family fortune. Soon afterwards she was later divorced. It was after these events that Duchamge musical education began in earnest. She studied church music with Jan Dussek, Luigi Cherubini and D.F.E Auber. In 1815, Duchambge met the French poet and novelist, Marceline Desbordes-Valmore beginning a lifelong friendship and collaboration. Their friendship is documented by a lengthy correspondence and a number of songs by Duchambge on Debordes-Valmore\u2019s texts including L\u2019adieu tout bas, La fianc\u00e9e del marin, Je pense \u00e0 lui, La jeune Ch\u00e2telaine, R\u00eave du mousse, La sinc\u00e8re and La valse et l\u2019automne. Duchambge also composed music to texts and romances of other female authors such as Mme Amble Tastu and Mme Emile De Girardin. Pauline Duchambge wrote over three hundred romances, a very popular genre in the nineteenth century. Auber deposited three hundred of Duchambge\u2019s songs in the Biblioth\u00e8que du Conservatoire in Paris. Eleven of Duchambge's individual songs and albums of songs were published between 1827 and 1841 by some of the leading Parisian publishers: Jean Antoine Meissonnier, Jacques-Joseph Frey, A. Petibon, and Ignace Pleyel. Her works reached a German audience through the Berlin publisher Maurice Schlesinger and the Schott firm in Mainz. In addition to songs, Duchambge wrote a few piano pieces. Duchambge had a difficult life, struggling with poverty, delicate health, and the disenchantments of love; her music expresses her emotions. She commented: \"Love, it is life! but a life full of troubles, illusions, deceptions, repentance, discouragements\u2026. \" Context_3 : Around the World is a musical based on the Jules Verne novel, \"Around the World in Eighty Days\", with a book by Orson Welles and music and lyrics by Cole Porter.

In fact, since Coleman and Darion wrote \"Changing Partners\" the same year, with Darion as lyricist and Coleman as composer, while Gimbel wrote the English lyric for \"Sway\" the same year, it can be concluded that Coleman wrote the music and Darion and Gimbel the lyrics.

He researched schizophrenia and similar disorders and used religious terms \"to make things more vivid\". \"When I was writing it, I saw these terms and medical things that were just brilliant,\" he said. \"Like there was a guy who felt that his skin was inside out. I read that and was like 'Oh my God! That's unbelievable; I've got to write about that.'\" Petrucci wrote the music and lyrics to the acoustic \"The Silent Man\". LaBrie described the lyrics as dealing with \"communication breakdown, for instance between a father and a son. We feel that we have to play certain roles when around one of our parents, and we never really get to know the real person. I'm lucky that I behave with my own father like I would a friend. We can joke around and go for a beer.\" A full live performance of the suite can be found on the 2000 \"Live Scenes from New York\" album.

Context_10 : An analytical balance (often called a \"lab balance\") is a class of balance designed to measure small mass in the sub-milligram range. The measuring pan of an analytical balance (0.1 mg or better) is inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that dust does not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance's operation. This enclosure is often called a draft shield. The use of a mechanically vented balance safety enclosure, which has uniquely designed acrylic airfoils, allows a smooth turbulence-free airflow that prevents balance fluctuation and the measure of mass down to 1 \u03bcg without fluctuations or loss of product. Also, the sample must be at room temperature to prevent natural convection from forming air currents inside the enclosure from causing an error in reading. Single pan mechanical substitution balance maintains consistent response throughout the useful capacity is achieved by maintaining a constant load on the balance beam, thus the fulcrum, by subtracting mass on the same side of the beam to which the sample is added. fact_1 : Ruth Baird Bryan Leavitt Owen Rohde, best remembered as Ruth Bryan Owen, (October 2, 1885 \u2013 July 26, 1954) was a politician and the first woman appointed as a United States ambassador. fact_2 :  The daughter of attorney William Jennings Bryan and Mary E.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.", "input": "Context_1 : Tropical Storm Ana was the earliest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in the United States in any given year. A relatively rare pre-season system, Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed as a subtropical cyclone from a non-tropical low north of the Bahamas, and intensified to attain peak winds of 60 mph before transitioning into a fully tropical cyclone early on May 9. Sustained in part by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, Ana made landfall along the northeast coast of South Carolina early the next morning, becoming the earliest U.S. landfalling system on record. Overall, damage from the storm was minor. Heavy rainfall and gusty winds affected parts of the Carolinas, and some vulnerable beaches endured coastal flooding and several feet of erosion. Gusty winds damaged trees and powerlines, causing sporadic power outages, and a weak tornado was reported in association with Ana. In North Carolina, two deaths\u2014one direct and one indirect\u2014were attributed to the storm. Context_2 : Tropical Storm Amelia was a weak, poorly organized tropical storm that formed during the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season. Amelia developed from a tropical wave that moved through the Atlantic Ocean uneventfully. The disturbance then entered an area of the Gulf of Mexico that was conducive to tropical cyclogenesis and became the first tropical depression of the season, after which it was forecast to make landfall before any significant intensification. However, the tropical depression defied predictions, quickly strengthening into a weak tropical storm just hours before making landfall in Corpus Christi. The storm lasted roughly a day over land before becoming unidentifiable after being active for just under 48\u00a0hours. After dissipating, the storm caused a severe flooding disaster in Texas. Context_3 : Tropical Storm Jerry was a tropical storm that caused severe flooding throughout the southeast United States in August of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Jerry, the tenth tropical storm of the season, formed from a tropical wave that moved off the African coast in early August, which organized into a tropical depression and tropical storm between the Bahamas and Florida later in the month, before striking Florida in the latter part of the month. Its remnant circulation persisted until five days after landfall. The rainfall it produced, amounting to over 12 in in several locations across Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, was responsible for $40\u00a0million (2005\u00a0USD) in damage and 6 deaths. At the time, Jerry was the earliest tenth storm to form in a season on record, until Jose in the 2005 season overtook it. Tropical Storm Jerry was also the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in South Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Context_4 : Tropical Storm Ana was the first named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season and the first tropical cyclone to impact the Caribbean islands during 2009. Forming out of an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave on August\u00a011, Ana briefly attained tropical storm intensity on August\u00a012 before weakening back to a depression. The following day, the system degenerated into a non-convective remnant low as it tracked westward. On August\u00a014, the depression regenerated roughly 1,075\u00a0mi (1,735\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands. Early on August\u00a015, the storm re-attained tropical storm status, at which time it was named Ana. After reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1003\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.65\u00a0inHg), the storm began to weaken again due to increasing levels of wind shear and the unusually fast movement of Ana. In post-storm analysis, it was discovered that Ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on August\u00a016, before reaching any landmasses. Context_5 : The 1960 Texas tropical storm brought severe but localized flooding to southeastern Texas in June\u00a01960. The first tropical cyclone and first tropical storm of the annual season, this system developed from an area of showers and thunderstorms in the Bay of Campeche on June\u00a022. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened and was estimated to have reached tropical storm status on June\u00a023. Early on the following day, the storm peaked with winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h). Later that day, it made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas, at the same intensity. The storm weakened slowly and moved across the Central United States, before dissipating over Illinois on June\u00a029. Context_6 : Tropical Storm Arthur caused minimal flooding in the Carolinas in mid-June\u00a01996. The first tropical cyclone and named storm of the annual Atlantic hurricane season, Arthur originated from an area of increased convection east of the Bahamas on June\u00a016. Gradually, the system increased in organization, and was designated as a tropical depression on June\u00a017. The depression tracked north-northwest and became Tropical Storm Arthur while just offshore the Southeastern United States on June\u00a019. Later that day, Arthur peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h), but weakened slightly before making landfall in North Carolina early the following day. After striking North Carolina, Arthur tracked out to sea and weakened further to a tropical depression. By June\u00a021, Arthur transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Overall, impact from Arthur was minimal, limited to light rainfall and moderate surf in North and South Carolina, as well as a tornado in Florida. Total damage amounted to $1\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD), but no fatalities were reported. Oddly enough, 18 years later in 2014, around the same time, another tropical cyclone with the same name impacted areas very similar to where this tropical storm impacted. Context_7 : Severe Tropical Storm Khanun, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Enteng, was the first tropical cyclone to directly impact Korea in two years. It is the 8th named storm, the 3rd severe tropical storm, and overall, the 13th tropical cyclone to be monitored by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) during 2012. Khanun was also the first tropical storm to make a landfall over Korea in 2012. Khanun means \"jack fruit\" in Thai. Context_8 : The 2015 Atlantic hurricane season was the third consecutive year to feature below-average activity, with eleven named storms. The season began on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates adopted by convention that historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season's first storm, Tropical Storm Ana, developed on May 8; the season's final storm, Hurricane Kate, lost its tropical characteristics on November 11. Context_9 : Tropical Storm Bonnie was a weak but persistent tropical cyclone that brought heavy rains to the Southeastern United States in May\u00a02016. The second storm of the season, Bonnie formed from an area of low pressure northeast of the Bahamas on May\u00a027, a few days before the official hurricane season began on June\u00a01. Moving steadily west-northwestwards, Bonnie intensified into a tropical storm on May\u00a028 and attained peak winds six hours later. However, due to hostile environmental conditions, Bonnie weakened to a depression hours before making landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina, on May\u00a029. Steering currents collapsed afterwards, causing the storm to meander over South Carolina for two days. The storm weakened further into a post-tropical cyclone on May\u00a031, before emerging off the coast while moving generally east-northeastwards. On June\u00a02, Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression just offshore North Carolina as conditions became slightly more favorable. The next day, despite increasing wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures, Bonnie reintensified into a tropical storm and reached its peak intensity. The storm hung on to tropical storm strength for another day, before weakening into a depression late on June\u00a04 and became post-tropical early the next day. Context_10 : Tropical Storm Arthur was the first Atlantic tropical storm that formed during the month of May since 1981. The first tropical cyclone of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, the storm formed on May\u00a030, 2008 from the interaction of two tropical waves and the remnants of the eastern Pacific Tropical Storm Alma, which had crossed into the western Caribbean Sea. The system quickly organized and was named Tropical Storm Arthur on May 31, while crossing the shore of Belize. It dissipated two days later over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. Arthur and its remnants triggered severe flooding which killed a reported nine people and affected 100,000 more in Belize. Damage was light to moderate, estimated at $78\u00a0million (2008\u00a0USD). fact_1 :  The season began on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates adopted by convention that historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. fact_2 :  The season's first storm, Tropical Storm Ana, developed on May 8; the season's final storm, Hurricane Kate, lost its tropical characteristics on November 11. fact_3 : Tropical Storm Ana was the earliest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in the United States in any given year. fact_4 :  A relatively rare pre-season system, Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.", "input": "Context_1 : Ecology is a new science and considered as an important branch of biological science, having only become prominent during the second half of the 20th century. Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in philosophy, particularly from ethics and politics. Its history stems all the way back to the 4th century. One of the first ecologists whose writings survive may have been Aristotle or perhaps his student, Theophrastus, both of whom had interest in many species of animals and plants. Theophrastus described interrelationships between animals and their environment as early as the 4th century BC. Ecology developed substantially in the 18th and 19th century. It began with Carl Linnaeus and his work with the economy of nature. Soon after came Alexander von Humboldt and his work with botanical geography. Alfred Russel Wallace and Karl M\u00f6bius then contributed with the notion of biocoenosis. Eugenius Warming\u2019s work with ecological plant geography led to the founding of ecology as a discipline. Charles Darwin\u2019s work also contributed to the science of ecology, and Darwin is often attributed with progressing the discipline more than anyone else in its young history. Ecological thought expanded even more in the early 20th century. Major contributions included: Eduard Suess\u2019 and Vladimir Vernadsky\u2019s work with the biosphere, Arthur Tansley\u2019s ecosystem, Charles Elton's \"Animal Ecology\", and Henry Cowles ecological succession. Ecology influenced the social sciences and humanities. Human ecology began in the early 20th century and it recognized humans as an ecological factor. Later James Lovelock advanced views on earth as a macro-organism with the Gaia hypothesis. Conservation stemmed from the science of ecology. Important figures and movements include Shelford and the ESA, National Environmental Policy act, George Perkins Marsh, Theodore Roosevelt, Stephen A. Forbes, and post-Dust Bowl conservation. Later in the 20th century world governments collaborated on man\u2019s effects on the biosphere and Earth\u2019s environment. Context_2 : In fluid dynamics, the mixing length model is a method attempting to describe momentum transfer by turbulence Reynolds stresses within a newtonian fluid boundary layer by means of an eddy viscosity. The model was developed by Ludwig Prandtl in the early 20th century. Prandtl himself had reservations about the model, describing it as, \"only a rough approximation,\" Context_3 : What Engineers Know and How they Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990) (ISBN\u00a0 ) is a historical reflection on engineering practice in US aeronautics from 1908 to 1953 written by an accomplished practitioner and instructor. This period represents the dawn of aviation which was fraught with uncertainties and numerous paths to many possible worlds. The book captures two main conclusions from this period. The first order conclusion of this book is about \"what engineers know.\" Five case studies from the history of aeronautical engineering are used to argue engineering often demands its \"own\" scientific discoveries. Thus, engineering should be understood as a knowledge-generating activity that includes applied science but is not limited to applied science. The second order conclusion of this book pertains to \"how engineers know\" by using the same case studies to reveal patterns in the nature of all engineering. These patterns form an \u201cepistemology\u201d of engineering that may point the way to an \u201cengineering method\u201d as something distinct from scientific method. Walter Vincenti ends the work with a general \"variation-selection model\" for understanding the direction of technological innovation in human history. The book is filled with numerous additional observations and stories told by a practitioner and instructor. This may be why Dr. Michael A. Jackson, author of \"Structured Design\" and \"Problem Frames\", once concluded a keynote address to engineers with the statement, \"Read Vincenti's book. Read it carefully. Read it one hundred times.\" Context_4 : An engineering apprenticeship in the United Kingdom is an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering or electrical engineering or aeronautical engineering to train craftsmen, technicians, senior technicians, Incorporated Engineers and Chartered Engineer for vocational oriented work and professional practice. Chartered Engineers are usually formed through a university degree programme at the Masters Engineering level and may undertake a short form of post graduate apprenticeship. A typical example is the apprenticeships formerly available at the BTH and EEC at Rugby in England. Subjects covered included mathematics, engineering sciences, limits and fits, metallurgy, foundry technology, engineering drawing, design, materials science for engineering materials, metalworking by hand, operating machine tools, and basic features of engineering design. Also refer to apprenticeship and the UK and German section. Elite technical apprenticeships (4-6 years long) have been a decades long tradition at UK companies such as BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce Holdings, Bombardier Aerospace (Short Brothers), and Babcock International. Context_5 : There have been three major Yakut writing systems in use since the early 20th century. The first systematic alphabet was developed by Semyon Novgorodov, and was based on the International Phonetic Alphabet. Novgorodov's alphabet was developed in 1917, and continued in use until 1929. In addition to the characters shown below, Novogorodov also introduced four letters to represent the diphthongs found in Yakut: /\u026fa\u0361/ \u2013 \uab60, /ie\u0361/ \u2013 \uab61, /uo\u0361/ \u2013 \uab63, and /y\u00f8\u0361/ \u2013 w. Vowel and consonant length was indicated with the colon (e.g. a:, t:). While this alphabet was in use, various changes were implemented, including the addition of capital letters. After 1929, Novgorodov's alphabet was replaced by a form of Latin script based on the Uniform Turkic Alphabet. This was in turn replaced in 1939 by an alphabet using the Cyrillic script. Prior to the Novgorodov alphabet, various \"ad hoc\" phonetic Latin and Cyrillic-based systems had been developed. Context_6 : Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to David Hilbert's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th century. Metamathematics provides \"a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic\" (Kleene 1952, p.\u00a059). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition \"2+2=4\" as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition \"'2+2=4' is valid\" as belonging to metamathematics. Context_7 : Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll (] ; 4 February 1811 \u2013 13 October 1899), was a French organ builder. He has the reputation of being the most distinguished organ builder of the 19th century. He pioneered innovations in the art and science of organ building that permeated throughout the profession and influenced the course of organ building and organ composing through the early 20th century. The organ reform movement sought to return organ building to a more Baroque style; but since the 1980s, Cavaill\u00e9-Coll's designs have come back into fashion. After Cavaill\u00e9-Coll's death, Charles Mutin maintained the business into the 20th century. Cavaill\u00e9-Coll was the author of many scientific journal articles and books on the organ in which he published the results of his researches and experiments. He was the inventor of several organ sounds/ranks/stops such as the \"fl\u00fbte harmonique\". Context_8 : Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker, CSI, FRS (14 June 1868\u00a0\u2013 4 November 1958) was an English physicist and statistician of the 20th century. Walker studied mathematics and applied it to a variety of fields including aerodynamics, electromagnetism and the analysis of time-series data before taking up a teaching position at Cambridge University. Although he had no experience in meteorology, he was recruited for a post in the Indian Meteorological Department where he worked on statistical approaches to predict the monsoons. He developed the methods in the analysis of time-series data that are now called the Yule-Walker equations. He is known for his groundbreaking description of the Southern Oscillation, a major phenomenon of global climate, and for discovering what is named after him as the Walker circulation, and for greatly advancing the study of climate in general. He was also instrumental in aiding the early career of the Indian mathematical prodigy, Srinivasa Ramanujan. Context_9 : Rockdale, also known as The Robinson/Stirling Place, is a historic home and farm complex located at Fallston, Harford County, Maryland, United States. It is a farm developed from the late 18th century through the early 20th century. The dwelling is in three parts. The east room of the east wing is the earliest section dating from the 18th century. The largest or main portion of the dwelling dates from between 1815 and 1830. The north wing, a bay centered in the south fa\u00e7ade of the second story, and a small conservatory, date from the very early 20th century. The main house is five bays in length, two and a half stories, of stone construction, stuccoed and scored. The home is surrounded by several outbuildings, trees, and other plantings, and the remains of formal gardens and garden structures developed in the early 20th century. It was the residence of William E. Robinson (1860-1935), an entrepreneur in the local canning industry. Context_10 : Ludwig Prandtl (4 February 1875 \u2013 15 August 1953) was a German engineer. He was a pioneer in the development of rigorous systematic mathematical analyses which he used for underlying the science of aerodynamics, which have come to form the basis of the applied science of aeronautical engineering. In the 1920s he developed the mathematical basis for the fundamental principles of subsonic aerodynamics in particular; and in general up to and including transonic velocities. His studies identified the boundary layer, thin-airfoils, and lifting-line theories. The Prandtl number was named after him. fact_1 : In fluid dynamics, the mixing length model is a method attempting to describe momentum transfer by turbulence Reynolds stresses within a newtonian fluid boundary layer by means of an eddy viscosity. fact_2 :  The model was developed by Ludwig Prandtl in the early 20th century. fact_3 : Ludwig Prandtl (4 February 1875 \u2013 15 August 1953) was a German engineer. fact_4 :  He was a pioneer in the development of rigorous systematic mathematical analyses which he used for underlying the science of aerodynamics, which have come to form the basis of the applied science of aeronautical engineering.

Many remnants of former case declinations remain in the Dutch language, but none of them are productive. One exception is the genitive case, which retains a certain productivity in the language. Although in the spoken language the case system was probably in state of collapse as early as the 16th century, cases were still prescribed in the written standard up to 1946/1947. This article describes the system in use until then. For a full description of modern Dutch grammar, see Dutch grammar. See also History of Dutch orthography. Context_2 : The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet. Context_3 : Witte Boekje (English: \"White Booklet\") is the popular name for the Spelling Guide of Our Language (Spellingwijzer Onze Taal), a publication of the Genootschap Onze Taal.

All these publications are explanations of the official spelling rules, as set by the Dutch Language Union. Context_4 : Latin spelling, or Latin orthography, is the spelling of Latin words written in the scripts of all historical phases of Latin from Old Latin to the present. All scripts use the same alphabet, but conventional spellings may vary from phase to phase. The Roman alphabet, or Latin alphabet, was adapted from the Old Italic script to represent the phonemes of the Latin language. The Old Italic script had in turn been borrowed from the Greek alphabet, itself adapted from the Phoenician alphabet. Context_5 : CNaVT, or Certificaat Nederlands als Vreemde Taal (Certificate of Dutch as Foreign Language), is an internationally recognised certificate proving the language ability in Dutch language of the holders. To obtain the certificate, Dutch learners must pass the CNaVT examination, organised by the Catholic University of Leuven. The Dutch Language Union has commissioned this collaboration. CNaVT is also a member of the Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE). The examinations is set according to different levels in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and is offered in accordance to various needs of the examinees. The certificate is widely recognised as a proof of ability in Dutch in the Netherlands and Belgium and is useful for immigration, work and also admission to educational institutions.

Context_7 : The following list is a comparison of basic Proto-Slavic vocabulary and the corresponding reflexes in the modern languages, for assistance in understanding the discussion in Proto-Slavic and History of the Slavic languages. The word list is based on the Swadesh word list, developed by the linguist Morris Swadesh, a tool to study the evolution of languages via comparison, containing a set of 207 basic words which can be found in every language and are rarely borrowed. However, the words given as the modern versions are \"not\" necessarily the normal words with the given meaning in the various modern languages, but the words directly descended from the corresponding Proto-Slavic word (the \"reflex\"). The list here is given both in the orthography of each language, with accent marks added as necessary to aid in pronunciation and Proto-Slavic reconstruction. See below for a capsule summary of how to pronounce each language, as well as some discussion of the conventions used.

Dutch is spoken as a native language by about 60% of the population, most of them being bilingual with Sranan Tongo, Saramaccan, Hindustani, and other languages. Nevertheless, Dutch is the sole official language of the country. Surinamese Dutch is easily intelligible with other forms of Dutch. Furthermore, as opposed to other languages that have different forms in the Americas (e.g., American English vs. British English) the regulation and thus standardised spelling of the Dutch language is done through a joint Dutch-Belgian-Surinamese organization, the Dutch Language Union, and thus has no regional differences regarding spelling. Suriname has been an associate member of this Nederlandse Taalunie since 2005. Therefore, many typical Surinamese words were added to the official Wordlist of Standard Dutch, known as \"the Green Booklet\" (\"Groene Boekje\").

The river Hofreist\u00e6\u00e5na flows south out of this lake and eventually feeds into the river Bjerkreimselva. Context_7 : A spring creek is a type of free flowing river whose name derives from its origin: an underground spring or set of springs which produces sufficient water to consistently feed a unique river. The water flowing in a spring creek may additionally be fed by snow pack or rain run-off, as in most traditional free-flowing rivers, but often the entire water source for a spring creek is an aquifer or other underground water source. For this reason, spring creeks are often filled with very pure, clean water and also demonstrate water flows that are smooth, consistent, and unwavering throughout the seasons of the year - unlike rivers filled with run-off or spring and summer melt-off from snow pack, whose water flows, water clarity, and water conditions often vary highly over the course of the year. In addition, water temperatures in spring creeks tend to vary less throughout the seasons of the year than traditional creeks and rivers because they are fed by underground water sources. Because of the depths of these water sources, spring creeks often emerge from their source or headwaters very cold and stay that way over the length of their runs. In addition, due to the consistent water flows and the fact that spring creek water is \"pushed\" by the force of pressure from the source rather than \"pulled\" by the force of gravity downhill, spring creeks can flow through very flat sections of land with minimal depths over grades that might not sustain run-off creeks and rivers. In these low-grade or flat sections of spring creeks, water flows can appear almost laminar with the surface of the creek appearing to be nearly flat and without the prominent riffles and surface disturbances caused by more rough or uneven surface bottoms found below free-stone run-off creeks and rivers surfaces. Context_8 : Lake Erie Basin consists of Lake Erie and surrounding watersheds, which are typically named after the river, creek, or stream that provides drainage into the lake.

The basin is part of the Great Lakes Basin and Saint Lawrence River Watershed, which feeds into the Atlantic Ocean. 80% of the lake's water flows in from the Detroit River, with only 9% coming from all of the remaining watersheds combined. (The remainder (11%) is derived from direct precipitation into the lake.) A littoral zone serves as the interface between land and lake, being that portion of the basin where the lake is less than 15 ft in depth. Context_9 : Brule Glacial Spillway is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated State Natural Area that encompasses the valley of the upper reaches of the Bois Brule River. This valley was carved by the outlet of Glacial Lake Duluth, which occupied what is now the western portion of Lake Superior, during the retreat of the Superior lobe of Wisconsin glaciation. This outlet flowed southwestward through the valley, to what is now the St. Croix River. As the glacier melted, and the level of Lake Superior dropped, the direction of flow shifted to its present northeastward course, towards Lake Superior. A high point in a vast bog near Solon Springs marks the divide between the watersheds of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. This divide was used for thousands of years, by Native Americans, European explorers, fur traders, and settlers as a portage between the two watersheds.
