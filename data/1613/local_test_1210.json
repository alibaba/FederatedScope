However, an agent that is trained using reinforcement learning is only capable of achieving the single task that is specified via its reward function. Such an approach does not scale well to settings in which an agent needs to perform a diverse set of tasks, such as navigating to varying positions in a room or moving objects to varying locations. Instead, we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically discover the range of tasks that it is capable of performing in its environment. We use a generator network to propose tasks for the agent to try to achieve, each task being specified as reaching a certain parametrized sub-set of the state-space. The generator network is optimized using adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the appropriate level of difficulty for the agent. Our method thus automatically produces a curriculum of tasks for the agent to learn. We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efficiently and automatically learn to perform a wide set of tasks without requiring any prior knowledge of its environment. Our method can also learn to achieve tasks with sparse rewards, which traditionally pose significant challenges.", "output": "Automatic Goal Generation for Reinforcement Learning Agents", "category": "Title Generation 636.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a part of an article.

Several classical probabilistic inference tasks (such as MAP and computing marginals) have not yet received a lot of attention for this formalism. The contribution of this paper is that we develop efficient inference algorithms for these tasks. This is based on a conversion of the probabilistic logic program and the query and evidence to a weighted CNF formula. This allows us to reduce the inference tasks to wellstudied tasks such as weighted model counting. To solve such tasks, we employ state-ofthe-art methods. We consider multiple methods for the conversion of the programs as well as for inference on the weighted CNF.

That is, it is usually not explored which background information makes NC true or false. The present paper aims to fill this gap. For us, \u201c(objective) background knowledge\u201d is restricted to information that can be expressed as probability events. Any other configuration is regarded as being subjective and a property of the a priori probability distribution. We study NC in two specific settings. In the first case, a complete description of some individuals is known, e.g. one knows of each of a group of individuals whether they are black and whether they are ravens. In the second case, the number of individuals having a particular property is given, e.g. one knows how many ravens or how many black things there are (in the relevant population). While some of the most famous answers to the paradox are measure-dependent, our discussion is not restricted to any particular probability measure. Our most interesting result is that in the second setting, NC violates a simple kind of inductive inference (namely projectability). Since relative to NC, this latter rule is more closely related to, and more directly justified by our intuitive notion of inductive reasoning, this tension makes a case against the plausibility of NC. In the end, we suggest that the informal representation of NC may seem to be intuitively plausible because it can easily be mistaken for reasoning by analogy.", "output": "On Nicod\u2019s Condition, Rules of Induction and the Raven Paradox", "category": "Title Generation 636.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a part of an article.

We propose here an efficient algorithm which is convergent under linear function approximation while planning using temporally abstract actions. We show how this algorithm can be used along with randomly generated option models over multiple time scales to plan agents which need to act real time.

In doing so, they enable effective collaboration and prevent emotional and physical harm. Consider a restaurant kitchen where cooks and assistants perform tasks such as passing knives and cutting vegetables. When handing over a knife to the chef, assistants do so in a way that does not look like they are about to stab the chef. Not only will they orient the knife in the right way, but they should take care not to approach the chef menacingly and without prior warning, while the chef has their back to them. The underlying normative principle could be roughly stated as a rule: \u201cIf you need to hand over a potentially dangerous object with a sharp blade, do not point it with the blade at the other person, but rather grasp it carefully by the blade and hand it over with the bland side or handle facing the other person\u201d. The tacit understanding among the kitchen staff is that everyone will abide by this principle, thus enabling safe exchanges of knives and other potentially dangerous objects. Failing to follow the rule will likely result in blame and reprimand from the chef, which then has to be addressed either by apologizing or by offering an explanation as to why the rule violation was justified [2]. Clearly, social and moral norms play an important functional role in the human cognitive architecture: they are at work in perception to detect morally charged contexts and norm violations, they are employed during decision-making and behavior execution, and they are referred to in communications about normative behavior and norm violations. In other words, normative processing is deeply integrated into the human cognitive system and affects virtually every aspect of the architecture (from perception, to reasoning, to action, to communication). Hence, this type of norm-based processing is also critical for robots in many human-robot interaction scenarios (e.g., when helping elderly and disabled persons in assisted living facilities, or assisting humans in assembly tasks in factories or even the space station). Human beings expect their interactants, including intelligent robots, to follow social and moral norms, and disappointing those expectations will lead to impoverished interactions at best, but can lead to emotional and physical harm in the worst cases. In this position paper, we will briefly describe how several components in an integrated cognitive architecture can be used to implement processes that are required for normative human-robot interactions, especially in collaborative tasks where actions and situations could potentially be perceived as threatening and thus need a change in course of action to mitigate the perceived threats. We will focus on affordancebased reasoning to infer complex affordance relationships between an agent and objects in the environment, and analogical reasoning to decide the appropriateness of the action plan by comparing against other past situations.", "output": "Enabling Basic Normative HRI in a Cognitive Robotic Architecture", "category": "Title Generation 636.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a part of an article.

Historical milestones have been frequently associated with computers matching or outperforming humans in difficult cognitive tasks (e.g. face recognition [2], personality classification [3], driving cars [4], or playing video games [5]), or defeating humans in strategic zero-sum encounters (e.g. Chess [6], Checkers [7], Jeopardy!

In contrast, less attention has been given to developing autonomous machines that establish mutually cooperative relationships with people who may not share the machine\u2019s preferences. A main challenge has been that human cooperation does not require sheer computational power, but rather relies on intuition [11], cultural norms [12], emotions and signals [13, 14, 15, 16], and pre-evolved dispositions toward cooperation [17], common-sense mechanisms that are difficult to encode in machines for arbitrary contexts. Here, we combine a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm with novel mechanisms for generating and acting on signals to produce a new learning algorithm that cooperates with people and other machines at levels that rival human cooperation in a variety of two-player repeated stochastic games. This is the first general-purpose algorithm that is capable, given a description of a previously unseen game environment, of learning to cooperate with people within short timescales in scenarios previously unanticipated by algorithm designers.

Existing approaches to causal prediction queries have a number of limitations. First, they exhaustively search over an acyclic causal network to find the most likely k effect events; however, data from real event streams frequently reflect cyclic causality. Second, they contain conservative assumptions intended to exclude all possible non-causal links in the causal network; it leads to the omission of many less-frequent but important causal links. We overcome these limitations by proposing a novel event precedence model and a runtime causal inference mechanism. The event precedence model constructs a first order absorbing Markov chain incrementally over event streams, where an edge between two events signifies a temporal precedence relationship between them, which is a necessary condition for causality. Then, the run-time causal inference mechanism learns causal relationships dynamically during query processing. This is done by removing some of the temporal precedence relationships that do not exhibit causality in the presence of other events in the event precedence model. This paper presents two query processing algorithms \u2013 one performs exhaustive search on the model and the other performs a more efficient reduced search with early termination.

In previous work, this problem is often solved with a heuristic as an unsupervised task. As an unsupervised problem, it is difficult to measure how well a given algorithm performs. In addition, we show that the quality of the windowing is dependent on which task an analyst wants to perform on the network after windowing. Therefore the time scale detection problem should not be handled independently from the rest of the analysis of the network.

The images were captured from a systematically sampled view sphere around the object/scene, and are annotated with accurate ground truth 6D poses of all modeled objects.

The architecture, called SimNets, is driven by two operators, one being a similarity function whose family contains the convolution operator used in ConvNets, and the other is a new soft max-min-mean operator called MEX that realizes classical operators like ReLU and max pooling, but has additional capabilities that make SimNets a powerful generalization of ConvNets. Three interesting properties emerge from the architecture: (i) the basic input to hidden layer to output machinery contains as special cases kernel machines with the Exponential and Generalized Gaussian kernels, the output units being \u201dneurons in feature space\u201d (ii) in its general form, the basic machinery has a higher abstraction level than kernel machines, and (iii) initializing networks using unsupervised learning is natural. Experiments demonstrate the capability of achieving state of the art accuracy with networks that are an order of magnitude smaller than comparable ConvNets.", "output": "SimNets: A Generalization of Convolutional Networks", "category": "Title Generation 636.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a part of an article.

Having such a huge number of apps and developers can pose a challenge to app users and new publishers on the store. Discovering apps can be challenging if apps are not correctly published in the right category, and, in turn, reduce earnings for app developers. Additionally, with over 41 categories on Google Play Store, deciding on the right category to publish an app can be challenging for developers due to the number of categories they have to choose from. Machine Learning has been very useful, especially in classification problems such sentiment analysis, document classification and spam detection. These strategies can also be applied to app categorization on Google Play Store to suggest appropriate categories for app publishers using details from their application. In this project, we built two variations of the Na\u0131\u0308ve Bayes classifier using open metadata from top developer apps on Google Play Store in other to classify new apps on the store. These classifiers are then evaluated using various evaluation methods and their results compared against each other. The results show that the Na\u0131\u0308ve Bayes algorithm performs well for our classification problem and can potentially automate app categorization for Android app publishers on Google Play Store.", "output": "Applying Na\u0131\u0308ve Bayes Classification to Google Play Apps Categorization", "category": "Title Generation 636.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a part of an article.

However, these algorithms typically require a huge amount of data before they reach reasonable performance. In fact, their performance during learning can be extremely poor. This may be acceptable for a simulator, but it severely limits the applicability of deep RL to many real-world tasks, where the agent must learn in the real environment. In this paper we study a setting where the agent may access data from previous control of the system. We present an algorithm, Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations (DQfD), that leverages this data to massively accelerate the learning process even from relatively small amounts of demonstration data. DQfD works by combining temporal difference updates with large-margin classification of the demonstrator\u2019s actions. We show that DQfD has better initial performance than Deep Q-Networks (DQN) on 40 of 42 Atari games and it receives more average rewards than DQN on 27 of 42 Atari games. We also demonstrate that DQfD learns faster than DQN even when given poor demonstration data.", "output": "Learning from Demonstrations for Real World Reinforcement Learning", "category": "Title Generation 636.json"}]
