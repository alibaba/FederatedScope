I just finished this nice long read, and I must say it was very well written: Trollope shows us a fascinating view of how the changes in society can affect the people living in it.  We are given a view of all sorts of characters: from the volatile, swindler Melmotte to the swaggering, gambling coward Felix Carbury, to his antithesis, his staid, country cousin Roger Carbury, and Felix's silly & conniving mother Lady Carbury, to his sweet & saintly sister Hetta Carbury...the mousey Marie Melmotte, the marriage schemer Georgiana Longestaffe, the wonderful yet fallible Paul Montague, and the independent & brash American, Mrs. Hurtle.  These & many other characters collide to give us a fascinating read, as their lives intertwine again & again, on so many levels.      The staid & proper upper-crust Victorian society of yesteryear is slowly melting away, as English virtue & honor is being overtaken by lying, cheating, swindling, stealing, and much more.  Where being a proper, honorable gentleman used to bring its own reward, now it is the more \"modern\" social rules that are taking effect in London society.  Will virtue or vice triumph in the end?  An excellent read, highly recommended!", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of \"evil\" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.    Now let me rewiew this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts?  no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a \"barbie\" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.    All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good read.", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

While I enjoy Greenberg's radio show, I was extremely disappointed in this book.  Throughout the book, Greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio.  Unfortunately, unlike on the radio, when Mike Golic is always available to slap some sense into Greenberg, this book is purely 100% Greenberg.    I am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives, yet try to act like they have \"struggled\" in life.  Greenberg has had to \"struggle\" thru a cushy upbringing, going to exclusive schools such as Northwestern and eventually landing his gig at ESPN.    For those of you in the Chicago area, I hope that you caught Debra Pickett's article on Greenberg in the Chicago Sun-Times.  While Greenberg professes to be a family man, the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic, himself, while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool.  Keeping with his privileged existence, the pool was located at the East Bank Club in Chicago, yet another privileged club to which Greenberg belongs.    I should receive a refund for slopping thru this \"book.\"  Hopefully, this review will prevent other people from making the mistake I did.

But I don't understand why after reading this book.  I saw flashes of Koontz as a contender with this story, but in the end the book limped along on half-drawn characters and stilted dialogue.  Koontz came up with a grand slam premise, and it was the strength of the premise that dragged me across the finish line.  Without that I'm not so sure I would've made it.      The characters aren't all badly drawn, but none of them really feel complete.  The dialogue is at times atrocious, at others simply frigid.  As a case in point, I have not forgotten--nor will I ever forget--the preposterousness with which one of the characters described the monster in detail AS HE'S BEING EATEN.  I almost took off my running shoes at that point.  Almost.      Koontz can write well when he puts his mind to it.  But Phantoms proves too stiff and underdeveloped to truly showcase his talent.

In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.    If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.    The first chapter is written in a maudlin, \"those-were-the-good-old-days\" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say \"Erin Go Braugh\" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.    Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as \"It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism,\" or \"they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism.\" These \"Morris mind-reads\" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.    Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!    But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.    Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.    Benjamin Franklin said \"Statistics is a liar.\" Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.    Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in \"Moby Dick,\" we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: \"I caught a fish this big!\"    There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.    In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1103.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given books product reviews in English language.

Unlike so many tutorial or reference books on the subject of Illustrator, this book only skims the surface of the key functions of Illustrator.    Things to be aware of:  There are no companion CD tutorials - you're on your own.   This book does not give you detailed information on how to do anything.  A few step-by-step examples are given on some certain methods, but mostly not.  The few examples of \"How to\" are very high level and do not go into any detail.  This book will not serve as a good reference book - information is to high level and does not include details.
