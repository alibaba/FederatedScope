If such  objection  is made,  the  Parties  concerned  shall make every          reasonable effort to settle promptly the dispute concerning the bill in          question.  If the  objection is sustained and the billed Party has paid          the  disputed  bill,  the agreed  upon  overpayment  shall be  refunded          promptly to the objecting  Party by the billing Party together with any          financial charges calculated thereon at a rate determined in accordance          with  Subparagraph  14.3 of this  Agreement from the date of payment of          the  bill  to the  date on  which  the  refund  is  transmitted  to the          objecting Party.

If full  payment  is not  received          within such  specific  period,  the billing Party or CBP may notify the          Managing  Group  of the  status  of the  matter  and  request  that the          Managing  Group  reclaim  the  capacity  in  TAT-14   assigned  to  the          defaulting Party.\n\n21.2     The  Managing  Group shall have the option of  reclaiming  the capacity          assigned  to a Party that is in default  with any  payment  required by          this  Agreement  or is in default  with any other  material  obligation          under this  Agreement,  if such default has existed for a period of six          (6)  months.   The  Managing  Group  shall  consider  any   extenuating          circumstances  not within the specific  control of the defaulting Party          and the  interests of any Party or Parties  that have jointly  assigned          capacity with the  defaulting  Party in  determining  whether or not to          reclaim  the  capacity  assigned  to such  defaulting  Party.  Prior to          reclaiming  the capacity  the  Managing  Group will notify the Party in          writing that it is in default and of the intent to reclaim the capacity          after one (1) month.

The remaining Parties shall          not be  obliged  to make any  payment  to a  defaulting  Party  for the          reclaimed capacity.  Except for the rights and obligations as specified          in Paragraphs 25 and 29 the rights and obligations under this Agreement          of a defaulting  Party shall  terminate at the time the Managing  Group          reclaims all of the capacity previously assigned to a defaulting Party.

All capitalized terms used and not defined in this Amendment shall have the meaning as set out in the Agreement. 2. The supply terms set forth in Section 1 of Amendment #2 (the Prior Supply Terms) are hereby deleted in their entirety. In their place, the Parties agree to the following (and Section 2.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended as needed to implement the following): Sanofi Pasteur agrees to purchase and ADMA to manufacture [***] Batches of Product, which Batches will be produced over a period from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a detailed supply plan provided to ADMA by Sanofi Pasteur (the Updated Supply Plan) that describes the agreed-upon timing for production of such Batches of Product, which supply plan is made an integral part hereof and shall be binding on the Parties.

The Parties agree to amend the Agreement to impose on ADMA an obligation to supply a minimum of [***] Batches of Product for that period stalling from Q4 2018 up to Q4 2019, as further specified in Exhibit A attached hereto. Should ADMA fail to supply a minimum of [***] Batches of Product (the Minimum Volume) of Product during the time period as specified in this Amendment #3, ADMA agrees that Sanofi Pasteur shall be entitled to obtain from ADMA as liquidated damages, and not a penalty, amounting to $[***] ([***]) USD. ADMA accepts and declares that the amount of the liquidated damages is a fair and equitable compensation, and not a penalty, for such failure in reaching the volume commitment within the timelines agreed herein and in regard to the value and use of the Source Plasma. In addition to the Minimum Volume of Product to be manufactured by ADMA, should ADMA deliver the Minimum Volume of Product but fail to meet the Updated Supply Plan as provided in Exhibit A as attached hereto and made an integral part hereof, then it is agreed upon by the Parties that ADMA shall pay to Sanofi Pasteur an amount equal to $[***] ([***]) USD for each Batch of Product that is less than the agreed upon quantity in Exhibit A, as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty.

Furthermore, should ADMA's compliance status under the FDA Warning Letter be escalated, and if such consequence limits ADMA's ability to supply the Batches of Product as specified in this Amendment #3 and the Updated Supply Plan or in case of failure by ADMA to supply any Batch of Product under this Amendment, Sanofi Pasteur shall be entitled to terminate immediately this Agreement upon written notice to ADMA and Sanofi Pasteur shall not be obligated to provide any additional payments (as outlined in Section 5 below and payments for any of the unproduced or delivered production batches) to ADMA from the date of such termination. In such a case, the remaining Source Plasma shall be immediately returned to Sanofi Pasteur, under ADMA's liability and expenses. Shipment of the Source Plasma to Sanofi Pasteur shall be made in compliance with the transportation conditions as provided in the Quality Agreement (as defined below), to be further amended by the Parties as contemplated in Section 9 below.\n\nBPC Initials ___ Sanofi Pasteur Initials ___ 2\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential treatment has been requested with respect to portions of this agreement as indicated by [***] and such confidential portions have been deleted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 4.

In consideration for certain quantities of Product that ADMA would have been contractually obligated to supply, and that Sanofi Pasteur would have been contractually obligated to purchase, under the Agreement, but that will now not be supplied and purchased as a result of the Parties' agreement in Section 2 above, Sanofi Pasteur agrees to pay ADMA an amount of seven million (7,000,000 USD) (the Compensation Fee) in five installments and will be invoiced as follows: (a) [***] USD upon execution of this Amendment #3 (b) [***] USD on March 1, 2018 (c) [***] USD on June 1, 2018 (d) [***] USD on September 1, 2018 (e) [***] USD on December 1, 2018 Such payments shall be made in accordance with Section 3.4 of the Agreement; provided, however, that the initial payment described in Section 5(a) above shall be due no later than December 31,2017.

Reseller acknowledges and agrees that it does not have the right to assign sub-resellers under this Agreement  outside of the Territory, except with the prior written consent of Diversinet.     Furthermore, if Reseller terminates the AMC in the manner contemplated in Schedule 3, the exclusive license above shall revert to being a non- exclusive license.    In either case, Reseller will have the non-exclusive right to contract in the rest of the world, excluding the United States. If Reseller identifies End- Users in the United States, with the prior written consent of Diversinet, Reseller may sell the Products to the End-Users. United Stated revenues  will not be counted against the AMC however Reseller will be entitled to the discount rates as indicated in Schedule 3..    In addition, Diversinet hereby grants to Reseller the right to use those Diversinet trademarks and copyrighted materials with respect to the  Products solely for the purpose of marketing and distribution of the Products as authorized hereunder. Reseller acknowledges that the use of such  trademarks and copyrighted materials does not create in its favour any right, whether of ownership or otherwise, to such trade-marks and  copyrighted materials, and that all rights arising from the use thereof by Reseller shall inure to the benefit of Diversinet.     Reseller agrees that the rights granted to Reseller in this Section 1 are solely for the purpose of supplying the Products to Reseller, its Customers  and End-Users located in the Territory. Any use outside of the rights granted herein shall require an additional license from Diversinet.     2. Ownership and Representations  (a) Except as expressly granted herein, Diversinet does not grant any further rights, license or immunity to Reseller, and hereby retains and  does not waive any rights it may have with respect to patents, trade-marks, copyrights, moral rights or other intellectual property or  proprietary rights enforceable under the laws of any country. Reseller shall not authorize anyone to reverse engineer, decompile, alter,  transfer, modify or create a derivative work from any of the Products, nor may Reseller itself engage in so doing.     (b) Reseller shall not make any representations or warranties regarding the use or operation of the Products other than those included in any  promotional materials provided by Diversinet and any Product documentation provided by Diversinet.     3. Term and Renewal  The term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue in effect for a period of five (5) years (the Initial Term), unless sooner  terminated in accordance with the provisions set out herein. Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for  consecutive one (1) year periods, unless terminated by Reseller within sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any renewal term,  as the case may be (the Initial Term and each renewal term, collectively, the Term). Any annual renewal would be subject to the payment, if  applicable, of the AMC as agreed to by the parties, however such AMC will not be less than the previous year AMC times 115%, payable in  applicable quarterly instalments.    4. Termination  (a) Either Party may terminate this Agreement:  (i) Upon thirty (30) days' written notice to Reseller if Reseller fails to make any AMC payment when due under this Agreement, or when  an audit, as set out in Section 13, by Diversinet reveals any under-payment for any payment due, and it is not paid within the thirty (30)  day written notice period;   (ii) providing thirty (60) days' written notice to the other Party if the other Party breaches any material term or condition of this Agreement,  and fails to cure such breach within the 60 day period;  (iii) upon providing thirty (30) days' written notice to Reseller if Reseller terminates the provisions of the Annual Minimum Commitment  and fails to meet the sales targets as set out in Schedule 3.    (b) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice and without further action by Diversinet in the event that:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Reseller ceases carrying on its business, or if a petition shall be filed, an order shall be made or an effective resolution is passed for the  winding-up, dissolution or liquidation of Reseller.    (c) Termination under Subsection 4(a) shall trigger a phase-out period during which Reseller may continue to provide products and  services to Customers. Such phase-out period shall be the longer of (i) the remaining term of the agreement between the Reseller and its  Customers, and (ii) 18 months.    (d) Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason: (1) all rights granted to Reseller hereunder shall automatically come to an  end and revert to Diversinet, including without limitation any right to use, operate and provide customer service or support for the Products;  (2) Reseller shall immediately pay to Diversinet all amounts due and outstanding hereunder as of the date of such termination or expiration;  and (3) within five (5) days of termination of this Agreement, for whatever reason, Reseller, must: (a) destroy all copies of the Products and  any associated Products documentation in its possession or under its direct control; and (b) deliver to Diversinet a written certificate  warranting that it has complied with the foregoing obligations.    1. Customer Orders  (a) Customer Agreements. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Reseller's Customers will acquire the Products and related services under  contract with Reseller, that Diversinet shall not have any contractual interest in Reseller's Customer relationships. Prior to Reseller  committing to provide any Products to a Customer, Reseller shall cause Customer to enter into purchase agreement(s) with Reseller with  respect to each of the Products purchased by Customer (each, a Customer Agreement). Reseller agrees that it shall include terms and  conditions in its Customer Agreements that are sufficient to protect Diversinet's interests as reflected in this Agreement, including, but not  limited to, those terms set out in Schedule 4 hereto. Such Customer Agreements shall be subject to Diversinet's approval, which approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld. Reseller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all Customers abide by the terms of the  applicable Customer Agreement(s). Furthermore, Reseller shall enforce its Customer Agreements against Customer when requested to do so  by Diversinet. For greater clarity, Diversinet expects that the Reseller will include all of the points covered in Section 4 in its end user  agreement. When the Reseller receives a customer order they will fax both the end user agreement and the details of the order to Diversinet  and if the end user agreement contains all of the points outlined in Section 4 then Diversinet will approve the order and ship the required  products to the Reseller.    (b) Ordering Process. Reseller shall submit all orders to Diversinet for the applicable Products. Reseller's submission of orders to Diversinet  shall comply at all times with Diversinet's reasonable procedures and requirements and are subject to acceptance by Diversinet acting  reasonably.

Delivery  (a) Subject to Reseller's compliance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement, Diversinet shall provide to Reseller or to  Customers the Products properly ordered by Reseller and accepted by Diversinet in material compliance with the applicable terms hereof,  notwithstanding any inconsistent or additional terms which Reseller includes in any Customer agreement.    (b) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, delivery of the Products shall take place via electronic transmission or by courier, and will take  place within two (2) Business Days of a written request or purchase order for software and within five (5) Business Days for a standard  appliance.

Reseller shall have fifteen (15) calendar days after the later of (i)  the delivery of any of the Products by Diversinet; or (ii) any applicable evaluation period; to inspect the Products and ensure their  substantial compliance with the corresponding documentation. Unless Reseller notifies Diversinet within such fifteen (15) day period that  any of the Products fail to substantially comply with the relevant documentation, such Products shall be deemed accepted. In the event  Reseller rejects any of the Products, Reseller shall give Diversinet written notice of rejection, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for  such rejection. Diversinet will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct any nonconformance and re-deliver such Products to Reseller.    1. Reseller Covenants  (a) Manner of Performance.

(d) Branding. Reseller may provide its own branding for the Products; however Reseller will include a powered by Diversinet tag or such  similar identifiers as mutually agreed to by the Parties.

Providing proof of an exemption from any such duty, tax or charge is the responsibility of Reseller. Diversinet acknowledges and  agrees that Reseller shall withhold any applicable non-resident withholding taxes from any amount owing hereunder and remit such taxes to  the applicable federal taxing authority without provision for gross-up, if Diversinet becomes a non-resident of Canada or assigns the  Agreement to a non-resident of Canada and if Diversinet does not provide Reseller with an appropriate exemption thereto.    (e) Network Charges.

The Parties agree that any other information of a confidential or proprietary nature provided by one Party to the other from time  to time, whether marked as Proprietary,  Confidential,  Secret  or any other designation implying confidentiality, is owned by the  disclosing Party (all such information hereafter, collectively Trade Secrets). Both Parties shall treat the other Party's Trade Secrets with  the same care as they treat their own confidential information of a like nature, but in no case shall the receiving Party use less care in  handling the Trade Secrets than would be reasonable under the circumstances. The Parties agree not to make the other Party's Trade  Secrets available in any form to any third party, or use the other Party's Trade Secrets for any purpose other than as set forth in this  Agreement or as authorized by the other Party in writing. The Parties' obligations under this subsection shall survive the termination or  expiration of this Agreement.    (b) General Exclusions: The Parties' obligations set out in this section shall not apply to any information which is:  (i) rightfully in a Party's possession before receipt from the other Party;  (ii) independently developed by a Party without reference to the other Party's Trade Secrets;  (iii) approved for release by written agreement with the other Party;  (iv) rightfully in the public domain;  (v) disclosed by requirement of a governmental agency or third party as expressly required by operation of law, regulation or court order.

(c) It is expressly agreed that a violation of this section will cause irreparable harm to the owning Party and that a remedy at law would be  inadequate. Therefore, in addition to any and all other remedies available at law, the owning Party shall be entitled to seek (without posting  of a bond) preliminary, injunctive, emergency or equitable relief in the event of any actual or threatened violation of any or all of the  provisions hereof.    3.

If such examination reveals  a deficiency in any amounts paid, Reseller agrees to pay any such deficiency forthwith upon demand, plus interest calculated in accordance with  Section (Late Charges and Taxes) above and, if in excess of 5%, the cost of the audit incurred by Diversinet.    4. Limited Warranty  EACH PARTY DOES NOT WARRANT TO THE OTHER THAT THE MATERIALS IT PROVIDES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT  WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS CUSTOMERS, OR THAT THEIR OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED  OR ERROR FREE.     Diversinet warrants as follows:  (a) Each of the Products operates in substantial accordance with its documentation (Operation Warranty).

(e) The Products do not contain any virus, Trojan horse, worm, trapdoor, backdoor, malicious code or other code or device designed to  interfere with proper use of the Software or cause harm or injury.    (h) As of the Effective Date, to the best of its knowledge, none of the Products infringes upon any third party's patent rights (Limited Patent  Warranty).    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, DIVERSINET PROVIDES THE PRODUCTS, DOCUMENTATION AND OTHER RELATED  SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY, THE BUNDLED PRODUCT)  TO RESELLER AS IS  WITHOUT WARRANTY, MAKES NO OTHER  WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OF PERFORMANCE, AND  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, REGARDING THE  BUNDLED PRODUCTS, EITHER AS A UNIT, OR AS INDIVIDUAL PARTS. EXCEPT AS ABOVE SET FORTH, DIVERSINET SHALL BEAR NO  RISK AS TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUNDLED PRODUCT, AND ALL RISK IS TO BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN RESELLER AND IT  CUSTOMERS AND END-USERS, OR ANY OTHERS WHO USE THE BUNDLED PRODUCT (USERS). EXCEPT AS ABOVE SET FORTH,  SHOULD THE BUNDLED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE, DIVERSINET SHALL NOT BEAR ANY COST WHATSOEVER FOR ANY SERVICE,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION TO ANY PARTY. USERS SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ADEQUATELY PROTECTING DATA USED IN  CONNECTION WITH THE BUNDLED PRODUCT. EXCEPT AS ABOVE SET FORTH, DIVERSINET SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST  DATA, RERUN TIME, INACCURATE INPUT, WORK DELAYS OR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF SECURITY FOR PROPRIETARY DATA OR ANY  OTHER INJURIES OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM USE OF THE BUNDLED PRODUCT.    Neither Diversinet, nor its subsidiaries, nor their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, assignees, co-developers, servants and  contractors, nor the Reseller has any right to make any other representation, warranty or promise of any kind with respect to any of the Products. This Agreement does not, in itself, grant any patent license or patent right of any manner or kind. Reseller will be solely responsible for  determining which patent rights it may need to use the Products and for obtaining such licenses, where applicable. So long as the terms of this  agreement are respected, Diversinet agrees that it will not bring any suit, claim or demand against Reseller, its Customers or End-Users for breach  of Diversinet's patent rights in the Products, if any.    5. Limitation of Liability and Damages  (a) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT DIRECT FORESEEABLE DAMAGES, IN NO EVENT SHALL DIVERSINET BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR  LOSSES) AS A RESULT OF THE USE, SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE BUNDLED PRODUCT, WHETHER BY WAY OF A LEGAL  THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY,  EVEN IF DIVERSINET HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     (b) RESELLER WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION OR REPARATIONS ON TERMINATION OR  EXPIRATION OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER THE LAW OF THE TERRITORY OR OTHERWISE, OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY  PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS SECTION HAS BEEN INCLUDED AS A MATERIAL  INDUCEMENT FOR DIVERSINET TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT DIVERSINET WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO  THIS AGREEMENT BUT FOR THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AS SET FORTH HEREIN.    (c) The availability of the MobiSecure\u2122 Strong Authentication service depends on many factors, including Customer's connection to the  Internet, End Users' connection to the Internet, the availability of the Internet and the Internet backbone and equipment that, by its nature,  is not fault tolerant. Diversinet does not and cannot control the flow of data to or from Diversinet's network and other portions of the  Internet. Such flow depends in large part on the performance of Internet services provided or controlled by third parties. At times, actions or  inaction of such third parties can impair or disrupt Customers' connections to the Internet (or portions thereof). Although Diversinet will use  commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions it deems appropriate to remedy and avoid such events, Diversinet cannot guarantee that  such events will not occur. Accordingly, Diversinet shall have no responsibility for any failure to meet the requirements hereunder, with  respect to performance issues, including without limitation: (i) caused by factors outside of Diversinet's reasonable control; (ii) that result  from any actions or omissions of Customers, End Users or any third parties; (iii) that result from Customers' equipment and/or third party  equipment (not within the sole control of Diversinet); (iv) caused by any act or failure to act by Customer or as a result of any Third Party  Software.    (d) NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IN NO EVENT SHALL DIVERSINET'S LIABILITY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (OR THE  BUNDLED PRODUCT) EXCEED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT (100%) OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE LICENSE FEES, ROYALTIES  AND SUPPORT FEES PAID BY RESELLER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE  GIVING RISE TO THE ALLEGED LIABILITY ON THE PART OF DIVERSINET.     (e) The limitations set forth in Section 15(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) shall not apply in respect of (i) breach of confidentiality obligations; (ii) breach  of privacy provisions as detailed in Schedule 6; (iii) the intellectual property indemnity; (iv) any Abandonment committed by Diversinet; or  (v) any willful gross misconduct (including fraud). Abandonment means Diversinet's cessation or suspension of, or refusal to perform, its  obligations under this Agreement, and such cessation, suspension or refusal (i) was knowingly intended by Diversinet to cause harm to  Reseller, and (ii) was not the result of a termination of this Agreement by Diversinet in accordance with Section 4 (Termination).    1. Indemnification  (a) Reseller Indemnity. Reseller shall indemnify and hold harmless Diversinet and/or any of its directors, officers, agents, employees,  contractors, parent companies, affiliates, and/or subsidiaries (collectively, the Diversinet Parties) from and against any claim, suit or  proceeding by a third party based on or arising out of (i) the acts or omissions of Reseller in connection with its performance or failure  to perform any other obligations in this Agreement or any agreement with a Customer, and (ii) any unauthorized representation or any  misrepresentation of fact to any third party with respect to one or more of the Diversinet Parties or Products made by Reseller or any  director, officer, agent, or employee of Reseller, provided that:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Diversinet promptly notifies Reseller in writing of any such claim and Reseller has sole control of any related investigation,  defense and settlement negotiations; and  (ii) Diversinet fully cooperates with Reseller, at Reseller's expense, in defending or settling such claim.    (b) Infringement Indemnity. Diversinet shall diligently defend, indemnify and hold Reseller harmless, at its own expense, any action, loss,  cost or expense brought against Reseller to the extent that it is based upon a claim that Reseller's use of the unmodified Products as  permitted herein infringes upon a third party's intellectual property rights, and will pay the resulting costs, damages and legal fees  finally awarded against Reseller through settlement, judgment, arbitration, mediation or otherwise in such action that are attributable to  such claim, provided that:    (i) Reseller promptly notifies Diversinet in writing of any such claim under patent law and Diversinet has sole control of any related  investigation, defense and settlement negotiations; and  (ii) Reseller fully cooperates with Diversinet, at Diversinet's expense, in defending or settling such claim.    (c) Should any of the Products become, or in Diversinet's sole opinion is likely to become, the subject of any third party intellectual  property infringement claim, Reseller shall permit Diversinet, at Diversinet's sole option and expense, to:    (i) procure for Reseller the right to continue to use such Product; or   (ii) modify such Product so that it becomes non-infringing;     (d) Diversinet shall have no liability for any claim based upon:    (i) use of other than a current or the last prior release to the current unaltered version of the Products; or  (ii) use, operation or combination of the Products with non-Diversinet programs, data, equipment or documentation in a manner not  reasonably contemplated by this Agreement, if such infringement would have been avoided but for such uses, operation, or  combination; or   (iii) Reseller's or its agent's activities after Diversinet has notified Reseller that such use may result in infringement provided that the  Reseller has been provided with access to an updated version that would not be infringing.    (e) THE FOREGOING STATES OUT THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF DIVERSINET, AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF  RESELLER AND END-USER, WITH RESPECT TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY THE  PRODUCTS.    2. Escrow Agreement  The Parties agree to execute an escrow agreement, within 90 days of the Effective Date, with a nationally recognized escrow agent with respect to  the source code for the Products and name Reseller as a beneficiary.

The Physician's Tool  This is a windows based application which permits doctors and authorized 'circle of care'  workers to access patient records stored in the  information repository. These users may add, delete or update the patient records and may also 'Validate' existing records. Validation consists  of marking the records as 'Validated' and making them read only from that point to maintain record values that the physician has agreed to by  validating the record.    The Physician's Tool also can create and display secured messages to the patient which will be protected by the Diversinet MobiSecure\u00ae Health platform. The tool can also display a complete record of messages sent to the patient with associated time and date of acknowledgment  from the patient. The administrator users of the tool can also add and delete doctors and other circle of care worker accounts in order to  administer the operation of the clinical side of the Diversinet Platform.    Message Manager  The Message Manager is a tool used to collect and display incoming patient messages to the clinic and answer's to previously sent  questions from the clinic. The Message Manager permits the user to prepare reply messages as well as automatically preparing an audit trail of  all display and reply activities.    Message Generator  The Message Generator is an extension of the messaging tool in the Physician's Tool above, used to create user reminder messages based  upon reminder criteria and the user records in the repository for recurring action requirements. Examples include recurring tests (i.e. PAP,  colonoscopy, recurring blood work supporting medications), reminders about health and lifestyle choices, medication reminders.)     2.

THE DIET CENTER.\n\n         1.1 Women.com will name an area, in which eDiets content will be published (such area, the Diet Center). Links (presented as Diet Center logos) to the Diet Center will be located on three Women.com channels (the Fitness Channel www.women.com/fitness; the Health Channel www.women.com/health; and the Food Channel www.women.com/food) and two subchannels within such channels to be determined in accordance with Exhibit B hereto. The first page of the Diet Center (the Gateway Page) will have the look and feel of the Women.com Sites as specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Diet Center shall be branded with an icon that includes the eDiets logo. There will be no Women.com or eDiets registration required to enter and use the Gateway Page of the Diet Center.

COMMENCEMENT OF APPOINTMENT 2.1 The Appointment will begin on 27 January 2020 or such other date as the parties shall agree and when the Executive is not subject to any restrictions to prevent the commencement of his employment with the Company. There is no period of previous employment with the Company. 2.2 The Appointment may be terminated in accordance with clause 15 (or in furtherance of any right either party may have at common law). 3. EXECUTIVE'S DUTIES 3.1 The Executive shall serve the Company as Chief Financial Officer and as an Executive Director of WPP plc, and/or in such other capacity or capacities, within the Group as the Company may reasonably require from time to time, but subject always to it being consistent with his status, skills and experience. 3.2 During the Appointment the Executive shall: (a) diligently exercise such powers and perform such duties as may from time to time be assigned to him by the Board of WPP plc; (b) accept any offices or directorships as reasonably required by the Company; (c) use his best endeavours to promote, protect, develop and extend the business of the Company and any Group Company; (d) comply with all reasonable and lawful directions given to him by the Board of WPP plc; (e) comply with all policies and procedures of the Company and/or the Group.

PLACE OF WORK 4.1 The Executive's normal place of work shall be the Company's head office in the UK from time to time as the Company may reasonably determine, for the proper performance of his duties. The Executive shall travel to such places (inside and) outside the UK as may be required in order to properly perform his duties, in particular, to the head office in the USA. In connection therewith, the Executive is likely from time to time to be required to work outside the UK for periods exceeding one month. 4.2 There are currently no additional terms which apply where the Executive is required to work outside the UK for a period exceeding one month, but the Company reserves the right to issue such terms, and any such terms will be notified to the Executive. 5. WORKING HOURS 5.1 The parties agree that the Executive's role and senior status are such that the Executive will determine the whole of his working time himself and his working time cannot be measured or pre-determined and, accordingly, that the Appointment falls within the scope of Regulation 20 of the Working Time Regulations 1998, meaning that the restrictions on working time set out in the Working Time Regulations do not apply to him. 5.2 During the Appointment, unless prevented by ill-health or accident and except during holiday taken in accordance with clause 11, the Executive shall devote the whole of his time, skill and attention during normal business hours, and at such other times as may be reasonably necessary (without additional remuneration), to his duties under this Agreement. 6. REMUNERATION 6.1 The Company will pay the Executive a salary of \u00a3740,000 and a fixed benefits allowance of \u00a330,000 per annum. The salary (and so far, as is reasonably possible) the benefits allowance will accrue from day to day and be payable in equal instalments in arrears on or around the 25th day of every month, less deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions and shall be inclusive of any fees receivable by the Executive as a director of any Group Company. 6.2 The Executive's salary will be reviewed by the Compensation Committee every two years. There will be no salary review after notice to terminate this Agreement has been given by either party. The Company has no obligation to increase the Executive's salary following a review. 6.3 The Executive will be eligible to participate in any bonus or discretionary remuneration plan on such terms as the Compensation Committee may from time to time decide and always subject to the terms of the Executive Remuneration policy as approved by shareholders of WPP plc and to additional terms and conditions including the malus and clawback provisions of all relevant share or stock plans and as referred to in Schedule 2. 6.4 Any bonus payment to the Executive shall be purely discretionary and shall not form part of the Executive's contractual remuneration under this Agreement. Payment of a bonus to the Executive in 5\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\none year shall confer no right on the Executive to receive a bonus in any other year. Specifically, but without limitation, the Executive shall have no right to be considered for, or payment of, a bonus where the Executive is subject to, or may about to be subject to, an ongoing investigation or disciplinary process into facts or matters which could lead to such bonus being forfeited, or reduced and in all events if the Appointment has terminated for any reason or if he is under notice of termination whether given by the Executive or the Company at or prior to the date when a bonus might otherwise have been payable. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Executive is exonerated of any of the allegations made during any such disciplinary process or if any investigation does not result in any material action against the Executive, he will (once the disciplinary process or investigation is concluded) have the right to be considered for a bonus as if there had been no such investigation or disciplinary process. If any bonus becomes payable in such circumstances it will be paid without delay following the conclusion of the disciplinary process or investigation. 6.5 The Executive hereby irrevocably consents to the Company, at any time during the Appointment or on its termination (however arising), deducting from salary or any other payments due to the Executive in respect of the Appointment any monies due from him to the Company or any Group Company. 6.6 The Executive agrees that every benefit arising out of or in connection with his employment whilst he remains a director is subject to change (including detrimental change without compensation) where any particular benefit paid, or otherwise owing or becoming payable to him in the future, breaches or may breach the terms of the shareholder approved Executive Compensation Policy at any time. 7. EXPENSES\n\nThe Company will reimburse the Executive (on production of such evidence as it may reasonably require) the amount of all travelling and other expenses properly and reasonably incurred by him in the discharge of his duties in strict accordance with the Company's expenses policy from time to time. 8. PENSION 8.1 The Company operates a Group pension plan (the Plan). The Executive is entitled to participate in the Plan (or such pension scheme as may be established by the Company to replace the Plan), subject to its trust deeds and rules from time to time. The Executive has opted out of the Plan. Whilst his status remains so, he will receive in lieu the annual sum of 10% of his current salary, paid monthly in instalments, together with his salary. 8.2 The Company reserves the right to terminate the Plan at any time without replacing it. In this event, and assuming he is, or has been, a member, the Executive's rights (if any) will be in accordance with the said trust deeds and rules. 8.3 The Executive has been grated Fixed Protection. The Company acknowledges that once the Executive has informed the Company that he has Fixed Protection, under Regulation 5D of the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Automatic Enrolment) Regulations 2010 it does not need to automatically-enrol or automatically re-enrol the Executive into a pension scheme. The Company therefore agrees not to enrol the Executive in the Plan or any other pension scheme at any time after the Executive has informed the Company that he has Fixed Protection 2016,\n\nThe Company agrees in the meantime that it will not enrol the Executive into the Plan or any other pension scheme unless it is compelled to do so by law or the parties agree in writing otherwise. If the Company is compelled to enrol the Executive into the Plan or another pension scheme under law, or the Executive opts to join the Plan or any other pension scheme the Executive acknowledges and agrees that: 6\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(a) the Company has no liability to him if payment of any contribution to, or the provision of any benefit under, the Plan (whether by itself or when aggregated with any contribution to or any increase in value of the Executive's rights under any other arrangement) gives rise to an annual allowance or lifetime allowance charge (within the meaning of the Finance Act 2004) and that the Company has no responsibility to make any enquiry or advise the Executive as to the possibility of any such charge; (b) he is liable for reporting and paying any such charge in accordance with the Finance Act 2004; and (c) the Company has no liability to him in respect of any loss for any reason of enhanced protection, fixed protection, fixed protection 2014, fixed protection 2016 or any similar protection allowed in future (for the purposes of the Finance Act 2004) if applicable to the Executive. 9. INSURANCES 9.1 In partial spend of the fixed benefits allowance referred to in sub-clause 6.1, the Executive and his spouse or civil partner and any children under the age of 21 (or 24 if in full time education) are entitled to membership of a private medical insurance scheme. 9.2 The Executive is entitled to membership of a Group income protection plan and life assurance cover, which will be paid for by the Company. 9.3 Participation in all insurance schemes from time to time is subject to: (a) the terms of the relevant insurance scheme, as amended from time to time; (b) the rules or the insurance policy of the relevant insurance provider, or WPP Healthcare Trust as amended from time to time; and (c) the Executive (and where relevant any other potential beneficiary) satisfying the normal underwriting requirements of the relevant insurance provider and the premium being at a rate which the Company considers reasonable. 9.4 If the insurer refuses for any reason to provide the benefit to the Executive (or any relevant dependant) the Company shall not be liable to provide to the Executive any replacement benefit of the same or similar kind or to pay any compensation in lieu of such benefit. Full details of the insurance schemes are available from the Company's Worldwide Compensation and Benefits Director. 9.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Company's sole obligations in respect of the insurance benefits referred to in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2 is to pay the premia from time to time requested by the provider and to pay to the Executive any sums as may from time to time be received by the Company from the provider in respect of any claim made by the Executive (for him or a dependent) under any insurance scheme. 9.6 The Company shall have the right at its sole discretion to alter the cover provided or any term of any insurance scheme or to cease to provide (without replacement) any insurance scheme or cover at any time. 9.7 The Executive is entitled to the benefit of any indemnity in the Company's articles of association and may also entitled to the benefit of cover under such directors and officers liability insurance policy as may be maintained by the Company from time to time. 7\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n10.

(a) Provided the Executive complies with the Company's sickness absence notification and certification requirements, the Executive shall be entitled to receive his full salary and contractual benefits during any period of sickness absence not exceeding 26 weeks in any rolling period of 12 months. These payments shall be inclusive of any Statutory Sick Pay due. No payment of salary will be made during any subsequent period of absence when the Executive is eligible to receive benefits under the Group income protection plan referred to in sub clause 9.2. 10.2 If the Company so reasonably requires, the Executive agrees to consent to a medical examination by a medical practitioner nominated by the Company, at the Company's expense. The Executive agrees that the Company may have access to reports and results produced in connection with any such examination and that it may discuss the contents of the report with the relevant medical practitioner, subject to the Executive being given the opportunity to review and comment on the report before it is disclosed to anyone within the Company. 10.3 If the Executive is absent due to illness for more than one month, the Board shall be entitled at any time thereafter to appoint an executive director or employee to perform the Executive's duties and to exercise his powers until the Executive is able to resume his duties, following which such substitute will cease to act in the Executive's role. 10.4 The Company reserves the right to terminate the Appointment under the terms of this Agreement even when this would or might cause the Executive to forfeit any entitlement to sick pay or Group income protection benefit. 11. HOLIDAYS 11.1 The Company's holiday year runs from 1 January to 31 December (the Holiday Year).

If, at the Termination Date, the Executive has taken more holiday than he has accrued, the Executive hereby expressly consents to the Company deducting an appropriate amount from any payments otherwise due him. Deductions and payments in lieu of holiday are to be calculated on the basis that a day's holiday is equal to 1/260 of the Executive's basic salary. 12. OTHER INTERESTS\n\nDuring the Appointment, the Executive may not accept any employment with or appointment to any office, whether paid or unpaid, in relation to anybody, whether corporate or not (other than a Group Company), or directly or indirectly be interested in any manner in any other business except: 8\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(a) as holder or beneficial owner (for investment purposes only) of any class of securities in a company if those securities are listed or dealt in on a Recognised Investment Exchange and the Executive (together with his spouse, children, parents and parents' issue) neither holds nor is beneficially interested in more than 1% of the securities of that class; or (b) with the consent in writing of the Company, which may be given subject to any terms which the Company requires. 13. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 13.1 In this clause 13, Confidential Information means information (whether or not recorded in documentary form, or stored on any magnetic or optical disk or memory) relating, without limitation, to the business, clients, customers, products, affairs and finances of the Company or any Group Company for the time being confidential to the Company or any Group Company or in relation to which the Company or any Group Company is subject to a duty of confidentiality and trade secrets including, without limitation, technical data and know-how relating to the business of the Company or any Group Company or of any persons having dealings with the Company or any Group Company, whether or not such information (if it is not in oral form) is marked confidential, and includes, without limitation: (a) existing and prospective activities of the Company or any Group Company, including timing, business plans and financial information; (b) existing and prospective terms of business, prices and pricing strategies and structures, profit margins, trading arrangements, discounts and rebates of the Company or any Group Company; (c) existing and prospective marketing information, plans, strategies, tactics and timing relating to the Company or any Group Company; (d) existing and prospective lists of suppliers and rates of charge relating to the Company or any Group Company; (e) existing and prospective financial and other products or services, including applications, designs, technical data and qualifications relating to the Company or any Group Company; (f) existing and prospective software applications relating to the Company or any Group Company; (g) information relating to existing and prospective officers, employees and consultants of the Company or any Group Company including their engagement, their contractual terms including commission and bonuses and information relating to the termination of their employment or appointment with the Company or any Group Company; (h) any disputes and litigation proposed, in progress or settled in relation to the Company or any Group Company; (i) any invention, technical data, know-how or other manufacturing information of the Group or its customers/clients; and (j) existing and prospective research and development activities. 13.2 The Executive must not make use of or divulge to any person or entity, and must use his best endeavours to prevent the unauthorised use, publication or disclosure of, any Confidential 9\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInformation which is disclosed or made available to the Executive, either directly or indirectly, during the course of, or in connection with, the Executive's employment or his holding any office within the Group from any source within the Company or any Group Company and shall be under an obligation promptly to report to the Group any such unauthorised use or disclosure which comes to his knowledge. 13.3 This clause 13 does not apply to information which: (a) is used or disclosed in the proper performance of the Executive's duties or with the prior written consent of the Company or any Group Company; (b) is ordered to be disclosed by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise required to be disclosed by law; (c) is already in the public domain (other than as a result of unauthorised disclosure by the Executive or any other person); or (d) is already lawfully possessed by the Executive without any obligations of confidentiality or restrictions on use. 13.4 The Executive shall not, during the Appointment or at any time thereafter, make, except for the benefit of the Company or any Group Company, any copy, record or memorandum (whether or not recorded in writing or on computer disk or tape) of any Confidential Information and any such copy, record or memorandum made by the Executive during the Appointment shall be and remain the property of the Company and accordingly shall be returned by the Executive to the Company on the Termination Date or when required to do so by the Company. 13.5 The Executive shall not other than in the ordinary course of the Appointment without the prior written consent of the Board either directly or indirectly publish any opinion, fact or material or deliver any lecture or address or participate in the making of any film, radio broadcast or television transmission or communicate with any representative of the media or any third party relating to: (a) the business or affairs of the Company or of any other Group Company or to any of its or their officers, employees, customers, clients, suppliers, distributors, agents or shareholders; or (b) the development or exploitation of any Intellectual Property Rights, including Confidential Information. 13.6 Each of the restrictions in each sub clause above will be enforceable independently of each of the others and its validity will not be affected if any of the others are invalid. If any of those restrictions are void but would be valid if some part of the restriction were deleted, the restriction in question will apply with such modification as may be necessary to make it valid. 13.7 For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement precludes the Executive from making a protected disclosure within the meaning of Part 4A (Protected Disclosures) of the Employment Rights Act 1996. 14.

This assignment shall take effect upon the creation of each of the Intellectual Property Rights but if for any reason this does not occur, he agrees that he will hold all such Intellectual Property Rights on trust for the benefit of the Company until such time as it does. 14.4 The Executive agrees to sign all documents and to do all other acts which the Company requests (at its expense) to enable the Company to enjoy the full benefit of this clause 14. This includes joining in any application, which may be made in the Company's sole name for registration of any Intellectual Property Rights (such as a patent, trademark or registered design), and assisting the Company in defending and enforcing such rights during and after the employment (at the Company's expense). 14.5 Without prejudice to the generality of clause 13 (Confidential Information), the Executive may only use the Intellectual Property Rights and IP Materials to perform his obligations under this Agreement, and shall not disclose any Intellectual Property Rights or IP Materials to any third party without the express prior written consent of the Company. 14.6 The Executive waives all moral rights in IP Materials to which he may otherwise be entitled under the law of any relevant jurisdiction and which cannot be vested or assigned pursuant to sub clause 14.2 or 14.3.

Any delay by the Company in exercising its rights shall not constitute a waiver thereof. 15.10 On the Termination Date or, at the request of the Board on either party giving notice to terminate this Agreement, the Executive will immediately: (a) deliver to the Company all other property in his possession, custody or under his control belonging to any Group Company including (but not limited to) computers and any other electronic devices, business cards, credit and charge cards, security passes, original and copy documents or other media on which information is held in his possession relating to the business or affairs of any Group Company; and (b) to the extent possible, irretrievably delete (without keeping any copies in any format) any information relating to the business or affairs of the Company or any Group Company or any of its or their business contacts from any computer or communications systems, including any website or email account, owned or used by the Executive outside the Company's premises and notify the Company of any passwords the Executive used in relation to its computer system. 15.11 If the Executive's rights or benefits under any share option or share incentive scheme in which the Executive may participate (as set out at the date hereof in Schedule 2) are affected by the termination of the Employment, his rights will be determined solely in accordance with the rules of the relevant scheme and the Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation for the loss of any rights or benefits under such scheme. 15.12 If the Appointment is terminated for the purpose of the reconstruction or amalgamation of the Company or by reason of the Company transferring all or a substantial part of its business to another company and the Executive is offered employment by the reconstructed or amalgamated or transferee company on similar terms to the terms of this Agreement, the Executive will have no claim 13\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nagainst the Company or such reconstructed or amalgamated or transferee company in respect of the termination of the Appointment. 16. GARDEN LEAVE 16.1 Following service of notice to terminate the Appointment by either party or if the Executive purports to terminate the Appointment in breach, the Board may suspend all or any of the Executive's duties and powers for such periods and on such terms as he considers expedient and this may include a term that: (a) the Executive must stay away from all or any of the Company's premises, and/or (b) will not be provided with any work, and/or (c) will have no business contact with all or any of the Group's agents, employees, customers, clients, distributors and suppliers, and/or (d) will have no access to the Company's communications systems.\n\n(referred to as Garden Leave). 16.2 During any period of Garden Leave the Company will continue to pay the Executive's salary, benefits allowance and maintain the benefits to which he is contractually entitled prior to the commencement of his Garden Leave (for the avoidance of doubt the Executive shall not be entitled to any bonus or discretionary payment(s) during any period of Garden Leave). 16.3 During any period of Garden Leave may appoint a replacement to exercise any of the Executive's duties and responsibilities and may require the Executive to take such actions as he reasonably requires to effect a proper handover of any of his duties and responsibilities. Alternatively, the Company may require the Executive to carry out exceptional duties or special projects outside the normal scope of his duties and responsibilities (provided such projects are broadly commensurate with his status). 16.4 During any period of Garden Leave the Executive's employment will continue and the Executive will continue to be bound by his obligations under this Agreement and by his general duties of fidelity and good faith (and, where applicable, as a fiduciary). The Executive agrees that the Company may, if it so chooses, announce to third parties that the Executive has resigned or been given notice (as the case may be) but the Executive will not make any comment on his status or change of duties, except to confirm he is on garden leave. 17. OFFICE AS A DIRECTOR 17.1 Any office or directorship which the Executive holds in any Group Company is subject to the articles of association of the relevant company from time to time. 17.2 The Executive is required to familiarise himself with all his responsibilities as a director, legal and/or otherwise. 17.3 Upon termination of this Agreement, or on the Board's request, the Executive will resign from any office held by him in any Group Company without any claim for compensation. 17.4 The Executive shall, at the time of signing this Agreement, appoint the Company as his attorney by executing a Power of Attorney in the form set out in Schedule 1 so that the Company can give effect to the provisions of sub clause 17.3 above and clause 14 above as required. 14\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n17.5 In the event that the Executive fails to be re-elected as a director of any Group Company, or if the Executive resigns as a director of any Group Company at the Company's request, this Agreement shall not automatically terminate and the Executive will continue as an employee of the Company unless and until either party elect to terminate the employment (either in accordance with clause 15.1, or where the Company may have a right to terminate his employment summarily under clause 15 or at common law). 17.6 The Executive must not resign from any directorship or office of any Group Company, except on termination of this Agreement (by either party), on the Board's request or as provided in the articles of association of the Company, and he must not do anything that would cause him to be disqualified from continuing to act as a director. 18. PROTECTIVE COVENANTS 18.1 The Executive acknowledges that his senior position with the Company and any Group Company gives him access to and the benefit of confidential information vital to the continuing business of the Company and any Group Company and influence over and connection with the Company's customers, clients, suppliers, distributors, agents, employees, workers, consultants and directors and those of any Group Company in or with which the Executive is engaged or in contact and acknowledges and agrees that the provisions in Schedule 3 are reasonable in their application to him and necessary but no more than sufficient to protect the interests of the Company and any Group Company. 18.2 If any person offers to the Executive any arrangement, contractual or otherwise, and whether paid or unpaid, which might or would cause the Executive to breach any of the covenants in Schedule 3, he will notify that person of the terms of that Schedule 3 and provide that person with a complete copy of it. 19. DATA PROTECTION 19.1 The Company takes its data protection obligations very seriously and complies with its legal obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018 to protect the privacy and security of the Executive's personal information. As a data controller the Company is required to inform the Executive how we hold and use his information. 20. GRIEVANCE AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE 20.1 If the Executive is dissatisfied with any disciplinary decision relating to him, including any decision to dismiss him, he will have the right to appeal to the Chairman of WPP plc, whose decision will be final. 20.2 If the Executive seeks to redress any grievance relating to his employment, the Executive should raise this in the first instance with the Chairman. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved, the Executive should then apply in writing to the Board and the Board's decision will be final. 20.3 The Company may suspend the Executive from any or all of his duties for as long as is reasonably necessary to investigate any matter in which the Executive is implicated or involved, whether directly or indirectly, or in the event that the Company believes that the Executive's presence in the office would be detrimental to any investigation or to other employees or to the Executive. The provisions of clause 16.1 (a) to (d) and 16.2 will apply during any such period of suspension, with any additional terms depending on the circumstances that may be notified to the Executive in writing at that time. 15\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n21.

If Accuray approves the issuance of a Quote, Accuray shall issue a Quote to Distributor  based on the Product configuration and Services requested by the Customer, including pricing for such Products and  Services as provided in Section 2.2 above. The Quote issued by Accuray in relation to a Customer opportunity shall serve  as the basis of any offer made by Distributor to that Customer and shall remain valid for at least six months (unless earlier  declined by Distributor), and Distributor shall submit an amended Quote request to Accuray in the event adjustments to a  Quote are requested by the Customer. Any such amended Quote request from Distributor shall again be subject to the  Accuray approval process set forth in this Section 2.3.2.     3\n\n\n\n\n\n     2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order,  which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the Purchase Order). Accuray shall either  accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of  such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall  be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized  representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the  terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be  bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.  The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address:     Accuray Incorporated  ATTN: Contracts Administration  1310 Chesapeake Terrace  Sunnyvale, CA 94089  Main: (408) 716-4600  Fax: (408) 789-4205  Email: Orders@accuray.com     2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase  Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor  and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a  Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both  the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that  the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.     2.4. Standard Lead Time. As of the Effective Time and to the best of Accuray's knowledge, Accuray's standard lead time for delivery of  Products is six months.     3. DUTIES OF DISTRIBUTOR     3.1. Independent Distributor. Distributor shall be and must at all times make it clear that it is an independent entity contracting with  Accuray, and is not the employee, representative or agent of Accuray. Distributor does not have the ability or authority to enter  into any legal agreements or obligations that would bind Accuray in any manner.     3.2. Market Knowledge, Promotion and Sales. Distributor will develop a thorough and complete understanding of the Products and  Services. Distributor will use its knowledge and understanding to identify and cultivate potential Customers. Distributor agrees to  use commercially reasonable efforts to introduce, promote the sale of, and obtain orders for the Products and Services in connection  with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, including, without limitation, including the Products and Services in each of  Distributor's      4\n\n\n\n\n\n     Oncology Care Systems price book and sales operation system, such that all of Distributor's sales representatives can access  quotations for Products and Services at least as easily as all other systems then available for purchase from Distributor. Moreover,  Distributor represents and warrants that, on the date hereof and during the Term of this Agreement and any extension thereof, it (i)  possesses the knowledge, experience, skills, and ability required to properly fulfill its obligations under this Agreement; and (ii) has  the required facilities, manpower, capacity, financial strength, and knowledge to market and distribute Accuray's Products and  Services in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases.     3.3.

Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor  and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as  determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months  prior to the expected shipment date.     3.7. Customer Complaints. Distributor shall report promptly and in writing to Accuray any complaints or expressions of dissatisfaction by  the Customers to Distributor relating to the Products or Services. Any such reports shall be provided to Accuray via electronic mail  to the following address: complaints@accuray.com.     3.8. Warranty. Distributor will not make any warranties or representations in Accuray's name or on Accuray's behalf other than the  warranty provided by Accuray pursuant to Section 4.6 unless approved in advance in writing by Accuray.     3.9. Service Agreements. Distributor will make commercially reasonable efforts to sell a Service Agreement to each Customer. For the  avoidance of doubt, (i) the obligations of the parties with respect to the Service Agreement are as set forth in Sections 3.6 and 4.8  and (ii) the failure of Distributor to sell a Service Agreement to any Customer shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement.     3.10. Upgrades. Any Product upgrades released by Accuray (other than Bug Fixes and Safety Updates, which are addressed in Section  4.6.3 and 4.6.4 respectively) can be purchased at the discretion of the Distributor pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.3.  Such      5\n\n\n\n\n\n     upgrades will be available at the prices listed in the then current price list as of the date of the Quote (unless prior written approval  by Accuray for application of an earlier price list is obtained) for the upgrade, less any applicable discounts as specified in Exhibit A  hereto.     3.11. Compliance with Laws.     3.11.1. Compliance Generally. Distributor has and will have during the Term of this Agreement and any extension thereof the ability  to distribute, market and sell the Products and Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in full compliance  with all governmental, regulatory and other requirements under any applicable law. Furthermore, Distributor agrees to  comply with all applicable international, national, regional and local laws applicable to the performance of its duties  hereunder or to any transactions involving the Products or Services contemplated hereunder.     3.11.2. United States Laws. Distributor understands that, because it is distributing the Products and Services of Accuray, a  corporation subject to the laws of the United States of America, Distributor must, when carrying out its duties pursuant to  this Agreement, avoid violations of certain of such laws. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:     3.11.2.1. Restrictive Trade Practices or Boycotts, U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 15, Chapter VII, Part 760.     3.11.2.2. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. Code Title 15, \u00a7 78.     3.11.2.3. Export Controls, imposed by U.S. Executive Order or implementing regulations of the U.S. Departments of  Commerce, Defense or Treasury.     3.11.3. No Illegal Activity. Neither party (nor their sub-distributors, if any (Sub-Distributors)) shall engage in any illegal activities.  A party will not be held responsible for any activities of the other party or the other party's Sub-Distributors that may be  considered to be illegal. For example, neither party supports the practice of bribes or under-the-table payments. Each party  will ensure a like clause is included in each agreement it has with its Sub-Distributors, and monitor activities of its Sub- Distributors closely. In the event a party deems that its good-will has been or may potentially be affected by any such  illegal activity of the other party or the other party's Sub-Distributors, then such party reserves the right to terminate this  Agreement or any portion thereof that relates to or is materially affected by such illegal activity with no further liability to  the other party or the other party's Sub-Distributors. Such party assumes no liability for such illegal activity and the other  party hereby indemnifies and holds such party, its officers and assigns, harmless from any loss, damage and liability  arising from or in connection with such illegal activity.     3.12. Sales Targets. Distributor shall not be subject to any minimum purchase requirements, but shall agree to the annual sales targets set  forth in Schedule 2.5(d)(i)(2) of the Strategic Alliance Agreement and to using its customary standard sales processes, including,  without limitation, the MTA process, with respect to sales of Systems.     6\n\n\n\n\n\n     3.13. Affiliates; Distributors. Siemens shall cause any of its Affiliates or distributors purchasing Systems or Services pursuant to the terms  of this Agreement to agree to be bound by and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of the  Strategic Alliance Agreement related to or applicable to such purchase, unless such Affiliate or distributor is already party to a  distribution agreement for Products with Accuray.     4. DUTIES OF ACCURAY     4.1. Fulfillment and Shipment.     4.1.1. Fulfillment of Executed Purchase Orders. Accuray is responsible for ensuring that the Products supplied are of good quality as  further described below. Accuray will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Distributor or Customer, as  applicable, in a timely manner those Products and Services required to fill confirmed Purchase Orders received from  Distributor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.     4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor  shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor  may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's  reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray  shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra  insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the  need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray,  if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if  a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses  required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was  October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.     4.2. Product and Service Pricing. Accuray will provide its then current U.S. list pricing for its Products and Services to Siemens once per  year during the Term of this Agreement and any extension thereof, or upon request from Siemens. All prices will be stated in US  Dollars, unless another currency is agreed upon in writing by Accuray.     4.3. Product Specifications and Promotional Literature. Accuray will provide product specifications and promotional literature to Distributor  from time to time during the Term of this Agreement and any extension thereof. Distributor may use product specifications and  promotional literature in Distributor's dealings with Customers. Accuray may introduce changes and upgrades to the Products.  Accuray will use commercially reasonable efforts to give Distributor as much advance notice of upgrades as is feasible.     4.4. Regulatory Clearance.

Distributor will provide any  assistance or documentation reasonably requested by Accuray and at Accuray's expenses to assist Accuray with its obligations  under this Section 4.4. Accuray will be registered as the sole owner of any rights, title and interest to any of the Products or Spare  Parts, as the case may be; provided, however, that should any applicable law or regulation require that Distributor alone be entitled  to such ownership rights, Distributor shall hold this approval as trustee for Accuray and hereby consents to transfer or sublicense  such approval to Accuray free of charge or to support Accuray in its efforts to re-obtain the approval for the benefit of Accuray or a  third party named by Accuray upon expiration or termination of this Agreement. Lists indicating, as of the Effective Date, (i) the  countries in which Accuray has obtained regulatory approvals for the Products and Services and (ii) the countries in which Accuray  has a direct presence or has a distributor for the sales of Systems specifically for such country are being delivered to Siemens  concurrently with the execution of this Agreement. Accuray shall provide to Siemens updates of such lists on a quarterly basis.     4.5. Import License. Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for  all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement;  provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the  sales of Systems in the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such  Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with  Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will obtain and  maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the Products and Services ordered by such Customer.     4.6. Warranty.     4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and  perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory  clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not  to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (Warranty Period). Installation of  the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's  acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray  does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation  (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall  Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation  thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor      8\n\n\n\n\n\n     shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any  software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or  representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE  FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND  REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES  ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.     4.6.2. Hardware and Software. If a Customer notifies Accuray in writing during the Warranty Period of a defect in a Product that  causes the Product to fail to conform to the foregoing warranty, Accuray shall at its option either repair or replace the non- conforming Product or, if in Accuray's opinion such repair or replacement is not commercially reasonable, Accuray shall  refund a pro-rated portion of the price paid by the Customer for such Product calculated based on a straight-line  depreciation over a 5-year period beginning on the date of delivery. This will be Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation  and such Customer's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective Products and parts.     4.6.3. Software and Bug Fixes. Notwithstanding Section 4.6.2, for a period of 10 years following Installation of a System, Accuray will  provide to Customer, without charge, Bug Fixes with respect to any software included in the System. This is Accuray's  sole and exclusive obligation and Customer's and Distributor's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective software.  By way of clarification, Accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such Bug Fixes available to Customer, and Accuray  shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the Customer and Accuray) for installation or implementation of such  Bug Fixes at the Customer's site. Bug Fix means an error correction or minor change in the existing software and/or  hardware configuration that is required in order to enable the existing software and/or hardware configuration to perform to  the existing functional specification(s).     4.6.4. Safety Updates. Notwithstanding Section 4.6.2 and any obligations according to law, for a period of 10 years following  Installation of a System, Accuray will provide to Customer, without charge, Safety Updates with respect to any hardware or  software included in the System. This is Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and Customer's and Distributor's sole  and exclusive remedy in relation to any Safety Update required to be provided by applicable law in the Customer's  jurisdiction. By way of clarification, Accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such Safety Update available to Customer,  and Accuray shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the Customer and Accuray) for installation or  implementation of such Safety Update at the Customer's site. Safety Update means an error correction or change in the  existing software and/or hardware configuration that is required for safety in order to enable the existing software and/or  hardware configuration to perform to the existing functional specification(s) in accordance with applicable law in the  Customer's jurisdiction.     4.6.5. Warranty Exclusions. All warranty replacement of Products and parts shall be limited to malfunctions which are due and  traceable to defects in original material or workmanship of Products. The warranties set forth in this Section 4.6 shall be  void      9\n\n\n\n\n\n     and of no further effect in the event of abuse, accident, alteration, misuse or neglect of Products, including but not limited  to user modification of the operating environment specified by Accuray and user modification of any software.     4.6.6. Warranty Basis. Any limitation of liability under any warranty contained herein shall be an integral part of such warranty,  which limits its scope (Section 444, second alternative German Civil Code shall not apply). Any limitation of liability for any  defects contained herein shall be void insofar as Accuray has intentionally failed to disclose such defect.     4.7. Installation. Unless otherwise agreed by Accuray and Distributor (including, without limitation, pursuant to the terms of any  distribution agreement entered into pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement), Accuray shall be responsible for  installation of Accuray Products at Customer sites.     4.8. Service Agreements. Accuray will provide its then current Service Agreements to Distributor from time to time during the Term of this  Agreement and any extension thereof, or upon request from Distributor. All prices will be stated in US Dollars, unless another  currency is agreed upon in writing by Accuray. Such Service Agreements are to be offered to the Customer on the terms as set forth  in those agreements, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of Accuray. Accuray shall execute a  Service Agreement with the Customer upon receipt of (i) a copy of such Service Agreement executed by the Customer, and (ii) any  payments then due under such Service Agreement; provided, however, that Accuray shall have no obligation to enter into such  Service Agreement if it materially deviates from the form Service Agreement provided to Distributor; provided, further, that if  Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor for the sales of Systems specifically for the  country in which the Customer requests Services, as a condition to any sale of Services to such Customer, Accuray may require  Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the  Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor may (at its sole discretion) enter into such Service  Agreement with such Customer and will provide directly to such Customer the Services required to be performed under such Service  Agreement. If Accuray enters into such Service Agreement with such Customer, Accuray will be responsible for and will provide to  such Customer (either directly or through one or more of its distributors) the services required to be performed under such Service  Agreement.     4.9. Customer Training. If training of Customer's personnel is included in a Purchase Order confirmed by Accuray, Accuray will provide  such training in accordance with Accuray's then current training offerings and will coordinate with the Customer in order to provide  such training at Accuray's facility in Sunnyvale, California (or such other facility as may be agreed upon by Customer and  Accuray). For the purposes of such training, Accuray will be responsible for the travel and accommodation expenses of its  personnel, while Customer shall be responsible for the travel and accommodation expenses of its personnel. All Customer training  provided by Accuray will be conducted in English and, to the extent a Customer or its personnel do not have adequate English  language reading and comprehension skills, Accuray will provide an interpreter and translation services sufficient to enable the  Customer and its personnel to meaningfully and effectively participate in Accuray training courses.     10\n\n      4.10.

Distributor Personnel Sales Training. Accuray shall provide training of Distributor's sales personnel responsible for sales of Products  and Services to Distributor free of charge. Such training shall be at the times, in such locations, and in the scope agreed upon by  Distributor and Accuray in good faith; provided, however, that such training shall be provided to such Distributor personnel in  each Accuray Region at least once per year. Each party shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including travel and lodging,  incurred by it or its personnel to attend or provide such training. Accuray will provide additional training to Distributor's personnel  as may be reasonably requested by Distributor on a time and materials basis according to Accuray's then current price lists.     4.13. Support of Distributor's Efforts. Accuray shall, at its own expense:     4.13.1. assign a dedicated marketing point of contact for Distributor's marketing and sales personnel, which employee may be based  at any of Distributor's facilities as requested by the Steering Committee; and     4.13.2. provide global sales and marketing support, including support for individual sales opportunities, to Distributor; provided,  however, that the scope, duration, location, availability, and timing of such support shall be subject to commercially  reasonable limits and shall be determined pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(iii) of the Strategic Alliance Agreement.     4.14. Compliance with Laws. Accuray will be responsible for complying with (i) applicable U.S. laws, (ii) where Products are being shipped  to Distributor and unless otherwise agreed by Accuray and Distributor, applicable laws, codes, registrations, regulations, and  ordinances related to the export of the Products to Distributor, and (iii) any other applicable laws as they pertain to the Products, the  regulatory clearance, and safety in accordance with Accuray's written Specifications for the intended use.

Accuray shall advise Distributor in writing within two weeks of the confirmation of the  Purchase Order of any information or data required by Accuray to comply with an Export Regulation, including without limitation:\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) All applicable export list numbers, including the Export Control      11\n\n\n\n\n\n     Classification Number according to the U.S. Commerce Control List (ECCN);     (b) The statistical commodity code according to the current commodity classification for foreign trade statistics and the  HS (Harmonized System) coding;     (c) The country of origin (non-preferential origin); and     (d) Accuray's declaration of preferential origin (in case of European suppliers) or preferential certificates (in case of  non-European suppliers).     4.15.

Unless advised otherwise, all prices quoted by Accuray include the cost of  packing and crating for delivery.     5.2.3. Taxes. By way of clarification, all Accuray prices referenced in this Agreement, and all other amounts payable by Distributor to Accuray pursuant to this Agreement are net of any value added tax or federal, state, county or municipal sales or use tax,  excise or similar charge, withholding tax, or other tax assessment (except for any taxes that are assessed against income)  (collectively, the Taxes). The parties agree that it is their intention that Accuray will not bear any economic burden  relating to the Taxes. Subject to the foregoing and to compliance with applicable laws, Accuray and Distributor agree to  cooperate with each other as reasonably requested to establish the responsibilities of the parties relating to the payment  and withholding of Taxes, filing of documents, and other matters in order to achieve an efficient tax result.     5.3. Compensation. Except as otherwise provided herein, Distributor's only compensation for its efforts on Accuray's behalf shall be the  margins it earns on the resale of Products and      12\n\n\n\n\n\n     commissions on sales of Services, and Distributor shall bear all of the expenses which it incurs in making those efforts.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Accuray does not approve the issuance of a Quote to a potential Customer and  later contracts directly (or through one of its distributors) with such potential Customer, of which Accuray shall inform Distributor  without undue delay, Distributor shall receive credit for any sales of Systems to such potential Customer pursuant to and subject to  the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Section 3.4 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement.     5.4.

This document  lists the minimum requirements for suppliers of Siemens Medical Solutions describing  \u00b7 how parts, components and systems are identified with their attributes and  \u00b7 how attributes are labeled both as plain text as well as barcode on products and its packaging. Detailed specifications with regards to the labeling  of products are defined for the individual product concerned.     2 Definitions and abbreviations      2.1 Material No.     The Siemens Medical Solutions Material No. is used to uniquely identify products (parts, components and systems). It consists of an 8-digit  identification no. assigned by Siemens Medical Solutions.     Previously, the term Part no. was also used; it is replaced by the term Material No..      2.2 Revision     The Revision (abbreviated Rev.) serves to distinguish between different update statuses of hardware. It is assigned by Siemens Medical  Solutions.     The English term Revision replaces the German term Erzeugnisstand (abbreviated ES) and Ausf\u00fchrungsstand (abbreviated AS).     2.3 Serial No.     The Serial No. is an identifying attribute used to uniquely identify hardware or software with the same Material No. .     For suppliers the Serial No. can consist of up to 15 alphanumeric digits; it is however recommended to use only a 6 digit numerical Serial No. where  possible.     The Serial No. may contain a dash (-) or a slash (/), but no other special characters (e.g. # + * ?). Spaces, lower-case letters or language-specific  characters (e.g. \u00c4, \u00d6, \u00dc) are not allowed within the Serial No. .     The characters L, SxxL or Sxx at the end or the beginning of the Serial No. should be avoided (xx = any alphanumerical character).     For any Serial No. that is numeric only (i.e. has no letters) it is allowed to omit printing of leading zeros (\u201e0).     It is recommended to use the Serial No. of the supplier if it complies with the principles described above.     2.4 Data Identifier     Data Identifiers are used in the barcode to indicate that the information following the Data Identifier is data of a certain attribute. The Data  Identifier enables the barcode reading program to recognize that the following information represents a certain type of attribute.     Data Identifiers to be used:\n\n   3\n\n1P    Material No.   2P   Revision (for packaging only)  S    Serial No.   Q   Quantity (for packaging only)  14D    Expiration date (for packaging only)   T   Batch (for packaging only)\n\n\n\n\n\n     2.5 Expiration date     The format of the expiration date shall be definite and specified as follows: YYYYMMDD     2.6 Batch     The batch is an alphanumeric ident number with 10 digits, used to identify parts manufactured or shipped together. Is no batch provided on the  packing but required, a batch is initiated in the stock.     2.7 Shelf life     If a shelf life is defined for parts the shelf life has to be filed in calendar days. (365 days per year)     3 Reference documents     n.a.     4 Requirements     4.1 Identification of parts, components and systems     Non-serialized parts (including spare parts) and components are identified using a Material No. . If necessary, different statuses of a part,  component or system can be distinguished via the Revision.     Serialized parts, components and systems are identified using the combination of Material No. and Serial No. . In addition, the Revision may be  used to distinguish between different statuses of hardware.     4.2 Labeling of parts, components, systems and its packaging     In general, requirements with respect to labeling have to be defined for the product concerned. However, minimum requirements are specified in  order to allow proper identification throughout all processes involved. This chapter lists those minimum requirements.     For all material numbers specified by Siemens the parts and its packaging have to be labeled according to the requirements listed below. The label  depends on whether a part/component/system     \u00b7 is serialized  \u00b7 contains a revision level  \u00b7 is classified as an IVK (Installed Volume Component)  \u00b7 shall be handled by expiration date or batch     Siemens defines those requirements per individual Material No. .     4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   5\n\nColor     Usually white label with black printing other colors are allowed as long as barcode/plain text  can be read         Barcode content    1P <Material No. >       S <Serial No.>         Additionally for packaging only    2P <product Revision>       Q <quantity of products in this packaging (numeric only), usually 1>              It is not allowed to label Revision and Quantity on product identification labels!              e.g.: 1P01234567 as barcode *) (1P) Model No. 01234567           S1001 as barcode *) (S) Serial No. 1001\n\n   Each symbol structure with start and stop character including Data Identifier (e.g. 1P or  S), but without symbol check character.              No space allowed between Data Identifier and attribute.              It is not allowed to print any other information in the barcode fields described above.         Barcode type    Code 39 according to ISO/IEC 16388         Narrow element (bar or space)    Min. 0,17 mm         Ratio of wide element to narrow element    Min. 2,25 : 1         Barcode height    Min. 2 mm, typical 4mm         Plain text (below barcode)    (1P) Model No.: <Material No.>       (S) Serial No.: <Serial No.>         Additionally for packaging only    (2P) Revision: <product Revision>       (Q) Quantity: <quantity of products in this packaging (numeric only), usually 1>              It is not allowed to label Revision and Quantity on product identification labels!\n\n   Data Identifier (e.g. 1P or S) in brackets in front of data element title (e.g. ''Model No.  or Serial No.) in plain text!              e.g.: (1P) Model No.: 01234567 *) (1p) Model No. 01234567       (S) Serial No.: 1001 *) (S) Serial No. 1001\n\n   Note: Due to 21CFR1020.30 section e) the term Model No. shall be used instead of the  term Material No. in plain text on all labels.\n\n\n\nIt is not allowed to print any other information near the data fields described above. If any  other information is printed, it must be printed in a manner so that it can't be misinterpreted  as being part of the fields described above; this can be done by printing other information at  the very right side of the label.         Additionally for products only\n\n\n\nFor IVKs or System IVKs, the text IVK or SYSTEM IVK shall be printed on the very  right side of the label. It has to be ensured that this text can't be misinterpreted as being part  of the Serial No. ; this can be done by printing this text on a different level. [Siemens  Medical Solutions decides and specifies whether a product is an IVK or System IVK.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally for packing only    The Expiration date of parts with Shelf life is fixed below the quantity as following:       Expiration date: <date of expiration> YYYYMMDD\n\n   For parts which require a Batch, the batch is fixed below the Expiration date as following:  AAAAAAAAAA              For a transition period the batch can also be fixed above the material number         Font    Universe, if not possible use similar font (e.g. Helvetica)\n\n*) In case of limited space, it is possible to print the bar code next to (and not under) the clear text.     4.3 Spacing      Minimum distances are:\n\n\n\n\n\n   5) Expiration date and 6) Batch can be printed in barcode additionally.\n\n(A)    Horizontal distance from edge (quiet zone)   >5 mm  (B)    Vertical distance from edge   >2 mm  (C)    Vertical distance between printing areas   >1 mm\n\nLegend:  a) printing area for barcode             b) printing area for plain text\n\nFor a transition period the batch can also be fixed above the material number     6\n\n\n\n\n\n     5 Basic requirements for packaging     Especially for spare parts appropriate packaging are required for the global shipping process. Should those packaging contain wood, generally  non wood-packaging according IPPC (International Plant Protection Convention) shall be used, but fumigation of such packaging is not  allowed.     Packaging shall be designed in a suitable way to protect the packed good against transportation load according to IEC 60721-3-2 class's 2M2/2K4     International pictograms following the IEC 60601 series shall be used for parts which fall under specific restrictions for transport or storage.     The specification of packaging especially for spare parts is within the responsibility of the Business Unit responsible for the product.     6 Literature     ISO/IEC 16388 Information technology \u2014 Automatic identification and data capture techniques \u2014 Bar code symbology specifications \u2014 Code  39.

XIMAGE will make best efforts to support Morpho by any means available. Such an undertaking is made in the knowledge that a telecommunications line between the site and XIMAGE may not be in existance.\n\nPROGRAM means ForceField PSS software developed by XIMAGE including the Sybase and Focus software and includes all software provided under the Maintenance Agreement.\n\nPROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS means the specifications published by XIMAGE for a particular version of the Program (if no such specification is available, then the relevant documentation for a particular version of the Program).\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE shall mean the Date of Installation of the PSS in Kuwait, i.e. December 10, 1993.\n\nERROR means any material failure to operate in accordance with the program specifications delivered from the specifications appended to the base agreement.

TERM OF AGREEMENT\n\nXIMAGE's obligations hereunder shall become effective upon the      Effective Date and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, shall      remain in full force and effect for at least one year thereafter. This      Agreement shall automatically renew for consecutive one (1) year terms      at XIMAGE's then prevailing rates at the end of each one (1) year term      unless either party gives at least sixty (60) days prior written notice      of the non-renewal of this Agreement.\n\n3.

Correction of Errors is subject to      MORPHO's prompt notification to XIMAGE of the nature and description of      the Error provided that the Error is not caused by the abuse, misuse or      neglect of the products by MORPHO. In addition, XIMAGE will provide the      following as additional Customer Support Services:\n\n(a)  telephone support as reasonably requested by MORPHO at the rate of           $100 per hour for all hours in excess of 40 hours in any one-year           term;\n\n(b)  on-site visits to MORPHO's sites as determined to be necessary by           Morpho for Error correction, unless error correction is normally           performed via Dial up from the XImage facility in San Jose;\n\n(c)  give title to all modifications and improvements to the PSS           Software which XIMAGE generally makes available to its other           customers (at no additional Charge) under standard software           maintenance agreements relating to the Software.\n\nIf MORPHO requests XIMAGE to perform any other services, the related terms and conditions shall be based on further separate agreement between the parties.

WARRANTY AND LIMITATION\n\n11.1     PPG SHANGHAI warrants only its title to the Products and that the        &bbsp; Products will be as set forth in the warranty statement, if any, on the          Products' labeling or in the absence of any such warranty statement          that the Products will conform to PPG SHANGHAI's standard warranty when          they are taken from PPG SHANGHAI's warehouse by DISTRIUTOR or its          transport agent. DISTRIBUTOR is not authorized to make warranties or          representations on behalf of PPG SHANGHAI and shall make no such          warranties or representations. THESE ARE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIONS OR          WARRANTIES THAT PPG SHANGHAI MAKES, AND ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED          WARRANTIES UNDER STATUTE OR ARISING OTHERWISE IN LAW FROM A COURSE OF          DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY          OF MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, ARE          DISCLAIMED BY PPG SHANGHAI. In the event that the Product fails to          conform to the warranties herein given, DISTRIBUTOR's exclusive remedy          and PPG SHANGHAI's sole responsibility is, at PPG SHANGHAI's option,          limited to the replacement of such nonconforming Product at PPG          SHANGHAI's expense or the refund of the purchase price attributable to          a specific delivery as to which a claim is made. For the avoidance of          doubt, PPG SHANGHAI hereby declares and represents that PPG SHANGHAI is          not responsible for any damage to the Products after they have been          taken away from PPG SHANGHAI's warehouse and caused by DISTRIBUTOR or          its transport agent.\n\n11.2     It is PPG SHANGHAI's responsibility to ensure that mis-delivery of          Product is kept to the minimum. DISTRIBUTOR shall inspect the Products          within 48 hours upon delivery. In case of discrepancy found in Products\n\n\n\n\n\n         delivered, DISTRIBUTOR shall report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing,          detailing all the discrepancies within 48 hours after delivery. PPG          SHANGHAI will not accept any claims for discrepancy in delivery beyond          the 48 hours period. If Products are found damaged upon delivery,          DISTRIBUTOR or its customers who directly receive the delivery shall          report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing within 48 hours. The necessary and          sufficient evidence (and photos) required for insurance claim must be          submitted altogether. None of the damaged Products shall be disposed of          until the claim is settled by the insurance company or PPG SHANGHAI.\n\n11.3     DISTRIBUTOR assumes all responsibility, risk and liability arising from          (i) the unloading, discharge, storage, handling and use of the          Products, including use thereof alone or in combination with other          substances; (ii) the improper functioning or failure of unloading,          discharge, transportation or storage systems equipment used by          DISTRIBUTOR, whether furnished or recommended by PPG SHANGHAI or not;          and (iii) the failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations          governing unloading, discharge, storage, handling and use of the          Products.\n\n12.      FORCE MAJEURE\n\nPPG SHANGHAI's failure or inability to make, or DISTRIBUTOR's failure or inability to take, any delivery or deliveries when due, or the failure or inability of either party to effect timely performance of any other obligation required of it hereunder, if caused by force majeure as hereinafter defined, shall not constitute a default hereunder or subject the party affected by force majeure to any liability to the other; provided, however, that the party so affected shall promptly notify the other of the existence thereof and of its expected duration and the estimated effect thereof upon its ability to perform its obligations hereunder. Such party shall promptly notify the other party when such force majeure circumstance has ceased to affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder. The quantity to be delivered hereunder shall be reduced to the extent of the deliveries omitted for such cause or causes, unless both parties agree that the total quantity to be delivered hereunder shall remain unchanged. For so long as its ability to perform hereunder is affected by such force majeure circumstance, PPG SHANGHAI may, at its option, elect to allocate its total production of Product among its various requirements therefor (e.g., manufacturing and sales) in such manner as PPG SHANGHAI deems practicable and which, in the opinion of PPG SHANGHAI, is fair and reasonable. During the time that PPG SHANGHAI is unable to make deliveries or otherwise perform, it shall not be obligated to procure, or to use its best efforts to procure, any quantity of Product sold hereunder from any alternate producer or supplier. As used herein, the term force majeure shall mean and include any act of God, nature or the public enemy, accident, explosion, operation malfunction or interruption, fire, storm, earthquake, flood, drought, perils of the sea, strikes, lockouts, labor disputes, riots, sabotage, embargo, war (whether or not declared and whether or not the United States of America is a participant), federal, state or municipal legal restriction or limitation or compliance therewith, inability to obtain export licenses, failure or delay of transportation, shortage of, or inability to obtain, raw materials, supplies, equipment, fuel, power, labor, or other operational necessity, interruption, or curtailment of power supply, or any other circumstance of a similar or different nature beyond the reasonable control of the party affected thereby. In this connection, a party shall not be required to resolve labor disputes or disputes with suppliers of raw materials, supplies, equipment, fuel or power, except in accordance with such party's business judgment as to its best interest.\n\n13.      PRODUCT HANDLING\n\nDISTRIBUTOR acknowledges that it has experience and expertise in handling and storing the Products, and that DISTRIBUTOR has the obligation to handle, store and distribute the Products safely and properly.\n\n14.      PRODUCT SAFETY\n\nPPG SHANGHAI and DISTRIBUTOR recognize the importance of product safety considerations and the need to protect persons and property against unsafe conditions that could occur from the improper use, transportation, storage, handling, distribution or disposal of the Products sold hereunder. PPG SHANGHAI and DISTRIBUTOR will follow PPG's Responsible Care(R) Distributor Guidelines as set forth in the attached Appendix I (Responsible Care(R) is a registered trademark in the United States of the American Chemistry Council ). Accordingly, PPG SHANGHAI will furnish certain information to DISTRIBUTOR regarding product safety and handling aspects of the Products, and DISTRIBUTOR, in addition to its independent responsibility to obtain and implement a product safety program regarding the Products, will implement and conform to PPG SHANGHAI's product safety recommendations and Responsible Care(R) Distributor Guidelines, DISTRIBUTOR will also provide its customers, employees and other third parties foreseeably exposed to the Products with appropriate warnings, advice and other material regarding the Products, including all product safety and handling material provided by PPG SHANGHAI, and will ensure that the Products are used, stored, handled, distributed, transported and disposed of in a manner consistent with all of the above recommendations.\n\n15.      PRODUCT DISCONTINUANCE\n\nDISTRIBUTOR acknowledges that it has express notice that PPG or PPG SHANGHAI may at any time discontinue the production and/or sale of any of the Products. If PPG or PPG SHANGHAI does discontinue the production and/or sale of any of the Products, this Agreement shall automatically terminate with respect to such discontinued Product, and DISTRIBUTOR shall not be entitled to claim or receive\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom PPG or PPG SHANGHAI any compensation, reimbursement or damages of any nature as a result (direct or indirect) of PPG or PPG SHANGHAI's discontinuance of the production and/or sale of the affected Product.\n\n16.      LIMITATION OF DAMAGES\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, on the termination of this Agreement for any cause whatsoever, DISTRIBUTOR shall not be entitled to claim or receive from PPG SHANGHAI any compensation, reimbursement, or damages on account of any expenditure or commitment of any kind in connection with its business or on account of goodwill or on account of loss of prospective profits or otherwise.

The MAs shall also furnish such budgetary estimates of the cost of such operation and maintenance of the APCN 2 as the Management Committee may reasonably request. Following the RFS Date, the MAs shall provide the O&MSC and the Management Committee with such reports as it may reasonably require on the operation of the APCN 2 including any proposals for planned repair or improvement work, together with appropriately revised budgetary estimates relating to the operation and maintenance of the APCN 2. The O&MSC may review and amend the practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of the Wet Segment, subject to the approval of the Management Committee. To facilitate in the maintenance of the APCN 2, the MAs may revise the allocation of responsibilities amongst themselves for the Wet Segment between the Cable Landing Points and any such decision shall be subject to the approval of the Management Committee.   10.4 The MAs shall have the right to deactivate the Wet Segment or any part thereof, in order to perform their duties. Prior to such deactivation, reasonable notice shall be given to, and coordination shall be made with, the other Parties hereto. To the extent possible, sixty (60) days prior to initiating action, the MA involved shall advise the other Parties hereto in writing of the timing, scope, and costs of significant planned maintenance operations, of significant changes to existing operations and maintenance methods and of contractual arrangements for cable ships that will have a significant impact on operation or maintenance costs. Should one or more Parties representing at least two- thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interests in accordance with Schedule B, wish to review such an operation or change prior to its occurrence, such Party or Parties shall notify the appropriate Maintenance Authority and a O&MSC Co-Chairman in writing within thirty (30) days of such advice. Upon such notification, the O&MSC shall initiate action to convene an ad hoc meeting for such review.   10.5 Notwithstanding Paragraph 32, each MA shall be authorized to pursue claims in its own name, on behalf of the Parties, in the event of any damage or loss to the APCN 2 and may file appropriate lawsuits or other proceedings on behalf of the Parties. The MA shall immediately inform the Management Committee and comply with any direction   22\n\n\n\n\n\n  therefrom. Subject to obtaining the prior concurrence of the Management Committee, a MA may settle or compromise any such claims and execute releases and settlement agreements on behalf of the Parties as necessary to effect a settlement or compromise.   10.6 Each Party that has designed or procured equipment used in the APCN 2 shall give necessary information relating to the operation and maintenance of such equipment to the MA responsible for operating and maintaining such equipment, as reflected in this Paragraph 10. Each Maintenance Authority shall have prompt access necessary for the performance of its   10.7 [Missing]   interruption. if the MA responsible, as specified in this Paragraph 10, fails to restore those facilities to efficient working order and operation within a reasonable time after having been called upon to do so by any other Party to whom capacity is assigned by this Agreement, the Management Committee may, to the extent that it is practical to do so, place, or cause to be placed, such facilities in efficient working order and operation and charge the Parties their proportionate shares of the costs reasonably incurred in doing so.   10.8 Each Party to this Agreement, at its own expense, shall have the right to inspect from time to time the operation and maintenance of any portion of the APCN 2 and to obtain copies of the maintenance records. For this purpose, the Maintenance Authority shall retain significant records, for a period of not less than five (5) years from the date of the record.

USE OF SEGMENT T   11.1 The Terminal Parties hereby grant to the Parties accessing APCN 2 at their respective terminal station, the right of use in the relevant Segment T (hereinafter referred to as Terminal Station Right of Use) on the terms and conditions stated in this Paragraph 11, to the extent required for the use of its Allocated Capacity, for the purpose of using APCN 2 and carrying on the related activities at that location in accordance with this Agreement. This Terminal Station Right of Use shall commence on the RFS Date and shall continue for the duration of this Agreement.   11.2 In the event that an agreement for another cable system utilizing any Terminal Station of the APCN 2 is terminated prior to the termination of this Agreement, the owner of the respective Segment T, with the agreement of the Parties hereto, shall take all necessary   23\n\n\n\n\n\n  measures to ensure that the Terminal Station in question will be available for the APCN 2 for the duration of this Agreement on fair and equitable terms. If the Terminal Station in question is not available for the landing and terminating of the APCN 2 for any reason, the owner of the Terminal Station shall provide reasonable advance notice to all Parties and such owner, in agreement with the Parties hereto, shall take all necessary measures to ensure that another appropriate Terminal Station will be available for the APCN 2 for the duration of this Agreement on terms and conditions similar to those contained in this Agreement. Applicable costs to the Parties will be determined by the Management Committee.   11.3 For each Terminal Station Right of Use, the Parties hereto shall not be required to pay any additional charges over and above the Capital Costs and O&M costs.   11.4 Notwithstanding Subparagraph 11.1 of this Agreement, a Party thereby granted a Terminal Station Right of Use interest in Segment T may, prior to the commencement of that Terminal Station Right of Use interest, elect to renounce its Terminal Station Right of Use entitlement and to instead have use of any Segment T for the duration of this Agreement on such terms and conditions as are agreed between that Party and the relevant Terminal Party, and in such event the provisions of Subparagraphs 11.1 of this Agreement shall apply in relation to such use except insofar as they may be modified by such agreements. This Subparagraph 11.4 shall not operate to confer on a Party any financial or other benefit of substance to which that Party would not otherwise be entitled under this Agreement.   11.5 The Terminal Parties agree to grant a Terminal Station Right of Use to APCN 2 IRU purchasers.   11.6 In the event of a sale or other disposition of Segment T1, T2,T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9 and T10, or part thereof prior to the termination of this Agreement, the owner shall share with the other Parties hereto any net proceeds, or costs, of such sale or disposition received, or expended, by the owner, to the extent allocable to the Capital Costs, in the proportions set forth in Schedule B.   12. ACQUISITION AND USE OF CAPACITY   12.1 Capacity of APCN 2 can only be used by a carrier.   12.2 Parties shall obtain Allocated Capacity in the form of MIU on an ownership basis as shown in Schedule C, in return for their financial investment as identified in Schedule B.   12.3 Procedures for Parties activation of their Allocated Capacity will be developed by the AR&RSC and the NA for Management Committee approval.   24\n\n\n\n\n\n  ASSIGNMENT OF CAPACITY   12.4 For each MIU of its Allocated Capacity, a Party is allowed to assign two (2) half STM-l circuits on any Path within the APCN 2. All such circuits are ring-protected. Additional ring-protected half STM-1 circuits may be granted proportionately to a Party's Allocated Capacity as shown in Schedule C at the discretion of the Management Committee according to the recommendation of the AR&RSC and the NA.   12.5 The Parties may designate a portion of their Allocated Capacity in specific Paths of the APCN 2 as:   (i) Jointly Assigned Circuit (hereinafter referred to as JAC) which shall be considered as consisting of two half STM-I circuits, with one half STM-1 circuit assigned to a Party, which together with the corresponding half STM-1 circuit, shall be used for the provision of international telecommunications services between such a Party and another Carrier that has received the right of use pursuant to this Paragraph 12 or an APCN 2 IRU purchaser. Any alteration to the JAC is subject to bilateral agreement between both Carriers.   (ii) Wholly Assigned Circuit (hereinafter referred to as WAC) which shall be considered as consisting of two half STM-1 circuits assigned to one Party.   USE OF WHOLLY ASSIGNED CIRCUIT   12.6 A Party is allowed to use its WAC for the provision of international telecommunications services with itself, its Subsidiary, its Parent Company and/or the Subsidiary of the Party's Parent Company provided that the correspondent parties are also Carriers.   12.7 A Party is also allowed to use its WAC to interconnect with other communication systems for the provision of international telecommunications services terminating outside the APCN 2 landing Countries. If such WAC is originated from any APCN 2 landing Country, such Party must be a Carrier of that Country.   12.8 A Party is also allowed to use its WAC for the provision of international telecommunications services with its Affiliate and/or the Affiliate of the Party's Parent Company provided that this Affiliate is a Carrier and a cash contribution is made by the Party to a special fund dedicated solely to fund future upgrades to increase the Equipped Capacity. The amount of the contribution is described in Annex 7.   PORTABILITY OF CAPACITY   12.9 A Party is allowed to de-assign its JAC and/or WAC to its Allocated Capacity provided that bilateral agreement is given by the concerned Camera and according to the guidelines to be developed by the AR&RSC and the NA.   12.10 Re-assignment of Allocated Capacity which resulted from the de-assignment of the JAC and/or WAC shall give priority to the assignment of Allocated Capacity which has not   25\n\n\n\n\n\n  been de-assigned before, in the event that there is any conflicting requirement for use of capacity on the APCN 2.   12.11 Under no circumstances shall a Party's JAC and/or WAC be de-activated due to the assignment of other Parties' Allocated Capacity.   TRANSFER OF CAPACITY   12.12 For the purpose of this Agreement, Transfer of capacity (hereinafter called Transfer) is the making available of all the right of use of the capacity being made available that is accorded to a Party by this Agreement to a third party without transferring the Party's other obligations and rights including the right of Transfer.   12.13 Transfer of a Party's Allocated Capacity to its Subsidiary or its Parent Company or the Subsidiary of the Party's Parent Company is allowed provided that the capacity transferred is in multiples of the MIU and that the recipient of the transferred capacity is a Carrier.   12.14 Transfer of a Party's Allocated Capacity to its Affiliate and/or the Affiliate of the Party's Parent Company is also allowed provided that the capacity transferred is in multiples of the MIU and that the recipient of the transferred capacity is a Carrier. For the Transfer to an Affiliate, the transferring party shall make a cash contribution to a special fund dedicated solely to fund future upgrades to increase the Equipped Capacity. The amount of the contribution is described in Annex 7.   12.15 The conditions applicable to the use and Transfer of capacity as specified in Annex 7 shall be relaxed after the Equipped Capacity is expanded to four (4) times of Initial Equipped Capacity or two (2) years after the RFS date whichever comes first unless an earlier date is approved by the Management Committee. Any relaxations on these conditions shall be approved by a vote of the members of the Management Committee representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B.   12.16 The Unallocated Capacity in the APCN 2 shall be owned by the Parties in common and undivided shares in accordance with the percentages in Schedule C.   12.17 IRU Capacity will be sold at the MJU level. Such IRU Capacity will be sold from the Unallocated Capacity. Proceeds from the sale of such IRU Capacity shall be used to fund the Expansion of the APCN 2 Equipped Capacity.   12.18 A Party or IRU purchaser may use its MIU with itself, another Party, or IRU purchaser to form matched circuits.   12.19 The distribution of capacity from the initial Unallocated Capacity shall be made no later than three (3) years from the RFS date on a pro rata basis, in MIUs, in accordance with the percentages in Schedule C. The exact time to implement such distribution of capacity   26\n\n\n\n\n\n  shall be decided by a vote of members of the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B.   12.20 Once the Equipped Capacity is expanded to six (6) times of Initial Equipped Capacity or three (3) years after the RFS date whichever comes first unless an earlier date is approved by the Management Committee, any Party is entitled to sell IRU to other Carriers from its Allocated Capacity on a private basis without any restrictions except that the IRU shall be for the life of APCN 2. The terms and conditions including pricing of such private IRU sales are bilateral matters between granting Party and purchaser.   12.21 When Unallocated Capacity is depleted, and during the period until the availability of additional Unallocated Capacity, a Party may be allowed to sell IRU to other Carriers from its Allocated Capacity privately subject to the Management Committee's approval on a case by case basis. The terms and conditions including pricing of such private IRU sales are bilateral matters between granting Party and purchaser.   12.22 Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Paragraph 12, when the Equipped Capacity is expanded to six (6) times of Initial Equipped Capacity or three (3) years after the RFS date whichever comes first, any Party is entitled to make available any of its Allocated Capacity for use by other Carriers on any commercial basis without any restrictions.   12.23 Guidelines for use of the IRU Capacity and Terms and Conditions of the IRU agreement shall be developed by the I&ASC and approved by a vote of members of the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B. The NA shall be authorized to execute IRU agreements for one or more whole MIUs with APCN 2 IRU Capacity purchasers on behalf of the Parties to this Agreement. No provisions of the IRU agreement shall override the provisions of this Agreement.   12.24 Schedules B, C, and D shall be modified by the NA, as appropriate, to reflect any revised ownership of capacity or sales of IRU Capacity pursuant to this Paragraph 12.   12.25 The Management Committee may authorize use of the Unallocated Capacity for restoration of telecommunications services and other purposes. The terms and conditions of such use shall be determined by the Management Committee based, in part, on terms to be agreed to by the relevant Terminal Parties of the APCN 2, in recognition of the technical and operational impact on the Terminal Station operations. Parties will receive revenues in accordance with Schedule C.   12.26 The communications capability of any capacity may be optimized by the Parties to whom such capacity is allocated by the use of equipment which will more efficiently use such capacity provided that the use of such equipment does not cause an interruption of, or interference, impairment, or degradation to, the use of any other capacity in the APCN 2 or prevent the use of similar equipment by other Parties. A Party to whom capacity is allocated shall permit the use of such equipment by a Carrier to which such Party has   27\n\n\n\n\n\n  made available the use of any such capacity, provided that such Carrier agrees that its use of the equipment will satisfy the conditions set forth in this Subparagraph 12.26.   12.27 A Party may sell capacity in fascicles smaller than a STM-1 in the APCN 2 at any time on any basis other than by transfer of ownership. The APCN 2 shall not be responsible for aggregating such capacity to the STM-1 level.   13. EXPANSION OF EQUIPPED CAPACITY   13.1 Any upgrade of Equipped Capacity of APCN 2, including any costs, financial adjustments and allocation of capacity associated with such upgrade, shall be approved by vote of members of the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B.   13.2 All Parties shall have the might to a pro-rata share of the upgrade capacity in accordance with Schedule C. However, no Party shall be forced to participate in such an upgrade. Parties not   14. INCREASE OR DECREASE OF DESIGN CAPACITY   14.1 In the event that the Initial Parties consider that it is beneficial to increase the Design Capacity of APCN 2, a Design Capacity expansion, including any costs, financial adjustments and allocation of capacity associated with such upgrade, shall be decided by the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B. However, no Party shall be forced to participate in such an upgrade, in the event that incremental funding is required to execute such an upgrade. Schedules B and C shall be appropriately modified to reflect the revisions associated with such increase of Design Capacity.   14.2 In the event that the capacity which APCN 2 or any Segment thereof is capable of providing is reduced below the capacity required to support the Allocated Capacity on its existing or planned routings as a result of physical deterioration, or for other reasons beyond the control of the Parties, the Management Committee shall initiate a review of the capacity routings, in order to support the rerouting of such Allocated Capacity.   14.3 In the event that the capacity which APCN 2 or any Segment thereof is capable of providing is lower than the capacity needed to support the routing of circuits assigned in APCN 2, the Allocated Capacity of the Parties may be reduced or changed as necessary and agreed by the Parties affected, and financial adjustments shall be made among the Parties, as necessary, on the terms and conditions to be agreed by the Management Committee. The Schedules shall be modified, as appropriate, to reflect the revised Allocated Capacity associated with such decrease of the Design Capacity.   28\n\n\n\n\n\n  15. OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE TRANSITING FACILITIES TO EXTEND APCN2 CAPACITY TO EXTEND APCN 2 CAPACITY   15.1 The Terminal Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to provide and maintain or cause to be provided and maintained in working order for the duration of this Agreement, the necessary transit facilities within their respective Countries as may be reasonably required for extending capacity in the APCN 2 so as to provide connections to the other international cables' transmission facilities.   15.2 The facilities provided pursuant to Subparagraph 15.1 shall be suitable for extending capacity in the APCN 2 of all payload types as defined in Subparagraph 15.3 and shall be furnished and maintained on terms and conditions which shall be no less favorable than those granted to another Carrier for transmission facilities of similar type and quantity transiting the location involved. Such terms and conditions shall not be inconsistent with applicable governmental regulations in the Countries in which the facilities are located.   15.3 As required the Terminal Parties shall support payloads of STM-l, STM-4, STM-l6 and STM-64.   16. OBLIGATION TO CONNECT THE APCN 2 WITH INLAND SYSTEMS   16.1 The Parties shall, at their own expense, on or before the RFS Date, do or cause to be done, all such acts and things as may be necessary within its operating Country to provide and maintain throughout the period of this Agreement suitable connection of capacity from APCN 2 with appropriate inland communications facilities in its operating Country.   16.2 The Terminal Parties will provide connection to APCN 2 to other Carriers within their Countries on terms and conditions negotiated and agreed by the parties concerned.   17. DIRECT ACCESS TO NETWORK INTERFACE AND EQUAL ACCESS TO TERMINAL STATION   17.1 The Terminal Parties agree to confer the right of Direct Access at the Network Interface to each Party and all other Carriers that have received the Right of Use pursuant to Paragraph 12. The connection to the Network Interface at specific Terminal Stations shall be provided at a reasonable cost in accordance with the physical, engineering and any locally applicable arrangements between the Carriers accessing the Network Interface and the respective Terminal Parties at the Terminal Station.   17.2 Upon request by the Parties or the other Carriers, the Terminal Party shall enter into negotiation in good faith with these parties to agree the above arrangements in a timely manner. Any arrangements agreed upon shall be reasonable and non-discriminatory.   29\n\n\n\n\n\n  17.3 The physical and engineering arrangements to be negotiated shall include all reasonable arrangements such as mid-span interconnection, equipment co-location (whether physical or virtual), or the sharing of Direct Access facilities by one or more Carriers in accordance with applicable commercial arrangements to be negotiated between the Terminal Party and the Carriers concerned.   17.4 The Terminal Parties shall not and hereby pledge not to impede or cause to impede any qualified Carriers in exercising their right of Direct Access hereby conferred, including but not limited to the negotiation between the non-Terminal Parties and Carriers for their own facilities to access their Allocated Capacity including for purpose of providing backhaul and transiting facilities.   18. DURATION OF AGREEMENT AND REALIZATION OF ASSETS   18.1 This Agreement shall become effective on the date and year first above written and shall continue in operation for at least an initial period of twenty-five (25) years following the RFS Date (hereinafter referred to as initial Period) and shall be terminable thereafter by agreement of the Parties.

The Management Committee must not unreasonably withhold or delay its approval.   22.3 A Party may at any time assign, sell or transfer the whole of' its rights and obligations under this Agreement to:   (a) a successor of that Party; (b) a Parent Company of that Party; (e) a Subsidiary or Affiliate of that Party; and (d) another Subsidiary or Affiliate of that Party's Parent Company.   22.4 A Party (hereafter Assignor) may assign, sell or transfer a portion of its rights under this Agreement to a Parent Company, its Subsidiary, and/or the Subsidiary of the Party's Parent Company (hereafter Assignee). Such partial assignment shall be allowed only once to any such Assignee, and shall not negate any of the obligations of the Assignor. If the Assignor is an Initial Party, then the Initial Party status of the Assignor shall be maintained and the Assignor's voting rights shall be shared with such Assignee. The relevant Schedules to this Agreement shall be revised to reflect each such partial assignment permitted hereunder, showing the Assignee as a Party. No subsequent assignment shall be effected by the Assignee except as provided in Subparagraph 22.3(a).   22.5 Without limiting the applicability of Subparagraph 22.4, a Party may assign its rights, title and interests in any portion of APCN 2 within the territorial limits of any Country (both under the current and any future configuration) to a Subsidiary, Parent Company or a Subsidiary of a Parent Company of that Party only if:   a) the Assignee shall own and be responsible for the capital, operations and maintenance costs listed against the Party for that portion of APCN 2 within the territorial limits of any Country (both under the current and future configuration); the Party shall own and be responsible for the capital, operating and maintenance costs listed against the Party for the remainder of APCN 2; and   b) the Assignee will have no tights and obligations independent from the rights and obligations of the Party in respect of the assigned portion of the APCN 2   33\n\n\n\n\n\n  The aforementioned provision shall not be used to circumvent the provisions under Paragraph 12.   22.6 A Party exercising its rights under Subparagraphs 22.2, 22.3, 22.4 or 22.5 must give notice in writing to all other Parties in a timely manner.   23. DEFAULT   23.1 If any Party fails to make any payment required by this Agreement on the date when it is due and such default continues for a period of at least one (1) month after the payment due date, the CBP shall notify the billed Party and also the Management Committee in writing of the status of the matter and will request the reclamation of capacity, as provided for in this Paragraph 23, if full payment is not received within two (2) months of such notification. If full payment is not received within such specified period, the Management Committee may reclaim the Capacity in the APCN 2 allocated to the billed Party.   23.2 The Management Committee shall consider any extenuating circumstances not within the specific control of the billed Party in determining whether or not to reclaim the capacity assigned to such billed Party. If the Management Committee nevertheless reclaims any capacity in the APCN 2 assigned to such defaulting Party, the defaulting Party shall not be entitled to any payment or credit for the reclaimed capacity. The Management Committee shall determine arrangements for disposition of any reclaimed capacity. All rights of a defaulting Party under this Agreement shall terminate as of the time all its capacity in the APCN 2 is reclaimed by the Management Committee; and concurrent with such reclamation of capacity, the defaulting Party will no longer be deemed to be a Party to this Agreement. Such reclamation shall not relieve the defaulting Party from its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to the payment of its unpaid accounts, which have been incurred prior to the actual reclamation. The defaulting Party is not entitled to any reimbursement of any amounts it had paid under this Agreement. In such circumstances, the Schedules shall be revised to reflect the default of a Party and the reallocation of interests pursuant to the arrangements determined by the Management Committee.   23.3 Notwithstanding Subparagraph 23.2, reclamation of a Terminal Party's capacity will not release the Terminal Party from providing, operating and maintaining its respective Terminal Station until a reasonable agreement is negotiated in order to ensure the continuous operation of the said Terminal Party's Terminal Station after reclamation of its capacity.   24.

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflict or choice-of-law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 8.2 Alternative Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy or claim between or among the Parties (whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, including the meaning of its provisions or the performance of any such provisions by a Party, its breach, termination, invalidity or otherwise (each, a Dispute) will be resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in this Article VIII, which will be the sole and exclusive procedure for the resolution of any such Dispute. 8.2.1 Negotiations. The Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute promptly by negotiations among executives of the Parties who have authority to settle the Dispute. The disputing Party will give the other Party or Parties, as applicable, written notice of the Dispute. Within twenty (20) days after receipt of said notice, the receiving Party or Parties will submit to the other a written response. The notice and response will include: (a) a statement of each Party's position and a summary of the evidence and arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of the executive who will represent that Party.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that monetary damages (even if available) may not be an adequate remedy in the event that a Party does not perform the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with their specified terms or otherwise breaches any provisions of this Agreement. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Party will be entitled to seek from the arbitrator or arbitration tribunal, and the arbitrator or arbitration tribunal will be empowered to grant, an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief (whether preliminary, permanent, temporary, conservatory or otherwise, and including temporary restraining orders) to prevent such breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in equity. The Party alleging the breach shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such award, but the Parties reserve all rights to otherwise contest the propriety of any award of injunctive relief. In addition, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Party will be entitled to seek in a court of competent jurisdiction an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement pending an arbitration under Section 8.2.2.

No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Subject to Section 3.3, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n9.5 Notice.
