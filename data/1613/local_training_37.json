Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God, fully divine and fully human, and the savior of humanity whose coming as Christ or the Messiah was prophesied in the Old Testament. Christian theology is expressed in ecumenical creeds. These professions of faith state that Jesus suffered, died, was buried, and was resurrected from the dead, in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the remission of their sins. The creeds further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven, where he reigns with God the Father, and that he will return to judge the living and dead and grant eternal life to his followers. His ministry, crucifixion and resurrection are often referred to as \"the gospel\", meaning \"good news\". The term gospel also refers to written accounts of Jesus's life and teaching, four of which\u201a\u00c4\u00eeMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John\u201a\u00c4\u00eeare considered canonical and included in Christian Bibles.", "output": "[Christianity] has how many types of worship places?, [Christianity] has how many worship place types?, How many variations of worship places are present in [Christianity]?, How many different types of worship places does [Christianity] have?, How many types of places of worship are associated with [Christianity]?, What is the number of worship places that [Christianity] has?", "category": "Question Rewriting 1030.json"}, {"instruction": "Compose a new way to ask the same question.

The term in its architectural sense is most often used by Christians to refer to their religious buildings; they can be used by other religions. In traditional Christian architecture, the church is often arranged in the shape of a Christian cross. When viewed from plan view the longest part of a cross is represented by the aisle and the junction of the cross is located at the altar area. Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the heavens and inspiring church visitors. Modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use; and, similarly, many original church buildings have been put to other uses. The earliest identified Christian church was a house church founded between 233 and 256.

Rome eventually emerged as the dominant power on the peninsula, extending across the entire Mediterranean and beyond as the leading political and religious centre of Western civilisation. During the Dark Ages, the Italian Peninsula faced calamitous invasions by barbarian tribes, but beginning around the 11th century, numerous Italian city-states rose to great prosperity through shipping, commerce and banking.

As a small spiral galaxy falls into the central parts of M31, most of the outer layers of the smaller spiral are stripped away.

The internal diversity of Chinese has been likened to that of the Romance languages, but may be even more varied. There are between 7 and 13 main regional groups of Chinese, of which the most spoken by far is Mandarin, followed by Wu, Yue and Min. Most of these groups are mutually unintelligible, although some, like Xiang and the Southwest Mandarin dialects, may share common terms and some degree of intelligibility. All varieties of Chinese are tonal and analytic. Standard Chinese is a standardized form of spoken Chinese based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin. It is the official language of China and Taiwan, as well as one of four official languages of Singapore.", "output": "Is there a TV channel in [Chinese language], and if so, which one?, Of the following TV stations, which one is in [Chinese language]?, What channels are for those that speak [Chinese language]?, What is the name of the [Chinese language] channel?, What are TV channel that are in [Chinese language]?", "category": "Question Rewriting 1030.json"}, {"instruction": "Compose a new way to ask the same question.

With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically \"developed\" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing.

It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetallic element and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds with most elements. Photosynthesis releases oxygen, and respiration consumes oxygen. Changes in phosphate are related to changes in oxygen concentrations. Oxygen was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774, but Priestley is often given priority because his work was published first. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion.

Bourbon kings first ruled Navarre and France in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma. Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs. The royal Bourbons originated in 1268, when the heiress of the lordship of Bourbon married a younger son of King Louis IX. The house continued for three centuries as a cadet branch, while more senior Capetians ruled France, until Henry IV became the first Bourbon king of France in 1589. Bourbon monarchs then unified France with the small kingdom of Navarre, which Henry's father had gained by marriage in 1555, and ruled until the 1792 overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution. Restored briefly in 1814 and definitively in 1815 after the fall of the First French Empire, the senior line of the Bourbons was finally overthrown in the July Revolution of 1830.

The film was co-directed by Bob Peterson, with music composed by Michael Giacchino. Docter began working on the story in 2004, which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration.

Hydrogen is found naturally in the molecular H\u201a\u00c7\u00c7 form. To exist as a liquid, H\u201a\u00c7\u00c7 must be cooled below hydrogen's critical point of 33 K. However, for hydrogen to be in a full liquid state without boiling at atmospheric pressure, it needs to be cooled to 20.28 K. One common method of obtaining liquid hydrogen involves a compressor resembling a jet engine in both appearance and principle. Liquid hydrogen is typically used as a concentrated form of hydrogen storage. As in any gas, storing it as liquid takes less space than storing it as a gas at normal temperature and pressure. However, the liquid density is very low compared to other common fuels. Once liquefied, it can be maintained as a liquid in pressurized and thermally insulated containers.

It was originally called L-hexuronic acid, but, when it was found to have vitamin C activity in animals, the suggestion was made to rename it. The new name, ascorbic acid, is derived from a- and scorbutus, the disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. Because it is derived from glucose, many non-human animals are able to produce it, but humans require it as part of their nutrition.

The cosmodrome was originally constructed as a launch site for intercontinental ballistic missiles called Svobodny-18. It was initially selected as a replacement for Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, which became independent as Kazakhstan after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However the development of Svobodny was subsequently ended in 2007 in favour of a totally new space port, the Vostochny Cosmodrome. The breakup of the Soviet Union left their primary cosmodrome at Baikonur in a foreign country, Kazakhistan. An arrangement to rent the facilities was arranged. Launches were moved to other facilities, like Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but this location is too far north to be useful for many launches. Studies for a far-east location closer to the latitude of Baikonur started, and initially settled on the existing missile base at Svobodny. This was located near the railway station of Ledyanaya, and had been used for several decades by the 27th rocket division of Strategic Rocket Forces.", "output": "What space agency is [Svobodny Cosmodrome] a spaceport for?, [Svobodny Cosmodrome] is the spaceport for which space agency?, [Svobodny Cosmodrome] is a spaceport of which space agency?, The spaceports of [Svobodny Cosmodrome] belong to which space agency?, The spaceports of [Svobodny Cosmodrome] belong to what space agency?", "category": "Question Rewriting 1030.json"}, {"instruction": "Compose a new way to ask the same question.

The term is also used to translate equivalent Asian styles, as in imperial China and Japan. In Great Britain and Ireland, the correct spelling of the aristocratic title of this rank is marquess. In Great Britain and Ireland, the title ranks below a duke and above an earl.

The dignity, rank or position of the title is referred to as a marquisate or marquessate. The theoretical distinction between a marquess and other titles has, since the Middle Ages, faded into obscurity. In times past, the distinction between a count and a marquess was that the land of a marquess, called a march, was on the border of the country, while a count's land, called a county, often was not. As a result of this, a marquess was trusted to defend and fortify against potentially hostile neighbors and was thus more important and ranked higher than a count.", "output": "[Marquess] has the noble title of what?, A [Marquess] has what noble title?, What noble title does [Marquess] have?, The noble it of [Marquess] is what?, What noble title is attributed to [Marquess]?", "category": "Question Rewriting 1030.json"}, {"instruction": "Compose a new way to ask the same question.

The late symptoms of the infection are referred to as AIDS. This stage is often complicated by an infection of the lung known as pneumocystis pneumonia, severe weight loss, a type of cancer known as Kaposi's sarcoma, or other AIDS-defining conditions.

Named for the Halqemeylem name for the Golden Ears, it had originally served the communities of Agassiz and Rosedale as M.V. Agassiz. Built in 1931, it had a vehicle capacity of just 16 cars. Tolls of 40 cents per car and driver, and 10 cents per additional passenger, were initially charged but these were removed on 15 February 1972, and the service remained free thereafter. In 1978, after many years of complaints about safety and reliability another ferry \u201a\u00c4\u00ec M.V. Kulleet \u201a\u00c4\u00ec was put into service alongside T'Lagunna.

The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Other stars, mostly in the Milky Way, are visible from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, and the brightest stars gained proper names. Extensive catalogues of stars have been assembled by astronomers, which provide standardized star designations. For at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Once the hydrogen in the core of a star is nearly exhausted, almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime and, for some stars, by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes.

Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900.

He later broadened his influences to include 1970s R&B, baroque pop, trip hop, arena rock, house, folk, alternative, electronica, synthpop, industrial, and classical music. West was raised in a middle-class household in Chicago, Illinois, and began rapping in the third grade, becoming involved in the city's hip hop scene. West attended art school for one semester before dropping out to pursue music entirely in the late 1990s. Although his real desire was to become a rapper, record executives did not take West seriously, viewing him as a producer first and foremost.

Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps. The gas is then exhausted. Because something is \"thrown away\" this type of engine is also known as open cycle. There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle. The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber. This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine. The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant. Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles. As in most cryogenic rocket engines, some of the fuel in a gas-generator cycle is used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber. Available construction materials cannot withstand the extreme temperatures of rocket combustion processes by themselves, while cooling permits the use of rocket engines for relatively long burn times.Ethanol:;Type: Rocket engine fuel. ;", "output": "what rocket engine designer designs a bipropellant rocket engine with [Ethanol] and [Gas-generator cycle]?, Who designed a bipropellant rocket engine with [Ethanol] and [Gas-generator cycle]?, Designing a bipropellant rocket engine with [Ethanol] and [Gas-generator cycle] describes what rocket engine designer?, The bipropellant rocket engine with [Ethanol] and [Gas-generator cycle] is designed by who?", "category": "Question Rewriting 1030.json"}, {"instruction": "Compose a new way to ask the same question.

It is defined as the amount of any chemical substance that contains as many elementary entities, e.g., atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons, as there are atoms in 12 grams of pure carbon-12, the isotope of carbon with relative atomic mass 12 by definition. This number is expressed by the Avogadro constant, which has a value of 6.02214129\u221a\u00f310^. It is one of the base units in the International System of Units; it has the unit symbol mol. The mole is widely used in chemistry as a convenient way to express amounts of reactants and products of chemical reactions. For example, the chemical equation 2 H\u201a\u00c7\u00c7 + O\u201a\u00c7\u00c7 \u201a\u00dc\u00ed 2 H\u201a\u00c7\u00c7O implies that 2 mol of dihydrogen and 1 mol of dioxygen react to form 2 mol of water.

Common uses for organic solvents are in dry cleaning, as paint thinners, as nail polish removers and glue solvents, in spot removers, in detergents and in perfumes. Water is a solvent for polar molecules and the most common solvent used by living things; all the ions and proteins in a cell are dissolved in water within a cell. Solvents find various applications in chemical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas industries, including in chemical syntheses and purification processes. The global solvent market is expected to earn revenues of about US$33 billion in 2019. The dynamic economic development in emerging markets like China, India or Brazil will especially continue to boost demand for solvents.

Generally, a song is considered the smallest standalone work of music, especially when involving singing. The common elements of music are pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture. The word derives from Greek \u0152\u00ba\u0152\u00f8\u0153\u00d6\u0153\u00c9\u0152\u03c0\u0152\u222b\u0152\u00c6. In its most general form the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music, the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic dissemination of music. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions, through improvisational music to aleatoric forms. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within the arts, music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art, and auditory art.

The Kelvin scale is an absolute, thermodynamic temperature scale using as its null point absolute zero, the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics. The kelvin is defined as the fraction \u00ac\u03c0\u201a\u00c5\u00d1273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. In other words, it is defined such that the triple point of water is exactly 273.16 K. The Kelvin scale is named after the Belfast-born, Glasgow University engineer and physicist William Lord Kelvin, who wrote of the need for an \"absolute thermometric scale\". Unlike the degree Fahrenheit and degree Celsius, the kelvin is not referred to or typeset as a degree. The kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement in the physical sciences, but is often used in conjunction with the degree Celsius, which has the same magnitude.

Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where the production of nickel-56 is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is exothermic. Consequently, radioactive nickel is the last element to be produced before the violent collapse of a supernova scatters precursor radionuclide of iron into space. Like other group 8 elements, iron exists in a wide range of oxidation states, \u201a\u00e0\u00ed2 to +6, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water.

A follower of veganism is known as a vegan. Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans refrain from consuming animal products, not only meat but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances. The term ethical vegan is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals for any purpose. Another term is environmental veganism, which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable. The term vegan was coined in 1944 by Donald Watson when he co-founded the Vegan Society in England, at first to mean \"non-dairy vegetarian\" and later \"the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals.\" Interest in veganism increased in the 2010s.

Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; France covers 640,679 square kilometres and has a population of 66.6 million. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic. The capital of France is Paris, the country's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The Constitution of France establishes the state as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. During the Iron Age, what is now France was inhabited by the Gauls, a Celtic people. The Gauls were conquered by the Roman Empire in 51 BC, which held Gaul until 486. The Gallo-Romans faced raids and migration from the Germanic Franks, who dominated the region for hundreds of years, eventually creating the medieval Kingdom of France. France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, with its victory in the Hundred Years' War strengthening French state-building and paving the way for a future centralized absolute monarchy.2011 Tour de France:;Type: Competition. ;", "output": "What competition is an event of [France] and is of the same competition type as [2011 Tour de France]?, What [France] competition event is the same type of competition as the [2011 Tour de France]?, [France] hosted the [2011 Tour de France] which was what type of competition?, What competition takes place in [France] and shares the competition type of the [2011 Tour de France]?, The [2011 Tour de France] is what type of competition that takes place in [France]?, Which competition is an event of [France] and is of a Competition type that is the Type of competition of [2011 Tour de France]?", "category": "Question Rewriting 1030.json"}, {"instruction": "Compose a new way to ask the same question.

First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man Project Mercury which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" by the end of the 1960s, which he proposed in a May 25, 1961 address to US Congress. Project Mercury was followed by the two-man Project Gemini. The first manned flight of Apollo was in 1968. Kennedy's goal was accomplished on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Lunar Module on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module, and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24.

Humans normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 11 spans about 134.5 million base pairs and represents between 4 and 4.5 percent of the total DNA in cells. It is one of the most gene- and disease-rich chromosomes in the human genome. Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 11 likely contains between 1,300 and 1,700 genes. A recent study shows that 11.6 genes per megabase, including 1,524 protein-coding genes and 765 pseudogenes can be found on chromosome 11.

It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. It defines twenty-two named units, and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that started in 1948. It is based on the metre-kilogram-second system of units rather than any variant of the centimetre\u201a\u00c4\u00ecgram\u201a\u00c4\u00ecsecond system. SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves.
