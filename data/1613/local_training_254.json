The warranty shall not apply only if:\n\n     (a)     the Software and MarketSite.net Service has been not properly                 installed and used at all times and in accordance with the                 Documentation; and\n\n     (b)     Corio has requested modifications, alterations or additions to                 the Software and MarketSite.net Service that cause it to deviate                 from the Documentation.\n\n7.4     Product Warranty - Year 2000 Compliance. Commerce One warrants that the         Software and MarketSite.net Service, when used in accordance with its         associated documentation, is in all material respects capable upon         installation of accurately processing, providing and/or receiving date         data from, into and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries,         including the years 1999 and 2000, and leap year calculations; provided         that all licensee and third party equipment, systems, hardware, software         and firmware used in combination with the Software and MarketSite.net         Service properly exchange date data with the Software and MarketSite.net         Service\n\n                                     8\n\n9         OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF         MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n8       INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n8.1     By Commerce One. Commerce One shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless         Corio and its Customers from any and all damages, liabilities, costs and         expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Corio or its         Customers arising out of any claim that the Software infringes any         patent, copyright, trademark or trade right secret of a third party;         provided that Corio or its Customer promptly notifies Commerce One in         writing of any such claim and promptly tenders the control and the         defense and settlement of any such claim to Commerce One at Commerce         One's expense and with Commerce One's choice of counsel. Corio or its         Customer shall cooperate with Commerce One, at Commerce One's expense,         in defending or settling such claim and Corio or its Customer may join         in defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense. If the         Software is, or in the opinion of Commerce One may become, the subject         of any claim of infringement or if it is adjudicatively determined that         the Software infringes, then Commerce One may, at its sole option and         expense, either (i) procure for Corio the right from such third party to         use the Software, (ii) replace or modify the Software with other         suitable and substantially equivalent products so that the Software         becomes noninfringing, or if (i) and (ii) are not practicable after         Commerce One has exhausted all diligent efforts, (iii) terminate this\n\n\n\n\n\n     Agreement and refund to Corio a pro-rated portion of the fees paid         hereunder.\n\n8.2     Limitations. Commerce One shall have no liability for any infringement         based on (i) the use of the Software other than as set forth in the         Documentation; or (ii) the modification of the Software by a party other         than Commerce One, when such infringement would not have occurred but         for such modification.\n\n9       LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n     EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING UNDER SECTION 8 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO         EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR         THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY         PAID BY CORIO HEREUNDER FOR THE TRANSACTION WHICH THE LIABILITY RELATES         TO DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THE         CAUSE OF ACTION TO WHICH THE LIABILITY RELATES. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY         ARISING UNDER SECTION 8 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER         PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR         COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY         INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY         THEORY OF LIABILITY AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF         THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9         REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.\n\n                                     9\n\n10         LIABILITY RELATES. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING UNDER SECTION 8 OF THIS         AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE         OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE         GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES         HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH         PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE PARTIES         AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9 REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.\n\n10      CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n     Each party hereby agrees that it shall not use any Confidential         Information received from the other party other than as expressly         permitted under the terms of a non-disclosure agreement to be         concurrently executed with this Agreement.\n\n11      TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n11.1    Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date         and shall continue in full force and effect for an initial period of         five (5) years. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for         subsequent one (1) year periods unless either party provides the other         party with written notification at least thirty (30) days prior to the         expiration of the initial five (5) year term or any one (1) year renewal         thereof of its intention to terminate this Agreement.\n\n11.2    Termination. If either party materially breaches any term or condition         of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within-thirty (30) days         after receiving written notice of the breach, the nonbreaching party may         terminate this Agreement on written notice at any time following the end         of such-thirty (30) day period. This Agreement shall terminate         immediately upon notice if either party becomes insolvent (i.e., becomes         unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come         due) or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Compliance by         the Software with the Software's specifications after expiration of the         Warranty Period shall be deemed a material condition of this Agreement.\n\n11.3    Effect of Termination. The following Sections shall survive the         termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason: 4.2, 5.3, 7,         8, 9, 10, 12 and 14. Corio's right to allow its then-existing Customers         and their Software Users to use and access the Software in accordance         with Section 2 of this Agreement and all payment obligations related         thereto shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.         Commerce One's obligation to provide Software support and maintenance to         Corio and its Customers shall survive any termination or expiration of         this Agreement, provided Corio continues to make its annual support and         maintenance payments as specified in this Agreement. Upon termination or         expiration of this Agreement, each party shall otherwise return or         destroy any Confidential Information of the other party provided,         however, Corio may retain any Confidential Information necessary for         Corio to continue supporting it's then-existing Customers.\n\n12      SOURCE CODE ESCROW.\n\n12.1    Escrow Account. Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date, Commerce         One agrees to execute an escrow agreement by and among Corio, Commerce         One and a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the ESCROW AGENT). The         Escrow Agent shall require Commerce One to place in an\n\n                                    10\n\n11         escrow account in California a copy of the source code of the Software\n\n\n\n\n\n     including all Updates and Upgrades thereto, documentation and similar         materials (the SOURCE CODE). The escrow agreement shall contain, at a         minimum, the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 12. Corio         shall bear all fees, expenses and other charges to open and maintain         such escrow account. If a Release Condition (as defined in Section 12.2         of this Agreement) occurs and the Escrow Agent provides the Source Code         to Corio under the escrow agreement, Corio agrees to hold the Source         Code in confidence pursuant to the provisions contained in Section 10 of         this Agreement, and not to use them for any purpose other than those         purposes contemplated under Section 12.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.2    Release. Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing if it believes that         one of the following events (the RELEASE CONDITIONS) has occurred and         that it intends to seek release of the Source Code from the escrow         account: (i) Commerce One's dissolution or ceasing to do business in the         normal course, or (ii) Commerce One's repeated and material breach of         its support and maintenance obligations under Section 5 of this         Agreement and such breach is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt         of written notice thereof from Corio. If Commerce One notifies Corio in         writing that it disputes whether any such event has occurred, officers         of each of the parties shall negotiate for a period of ten (10) business         days to attempt to resolve the dispute. At the end of such ten (10)         business day period, if the parties have not resolved the dispute, the         matter shall be referred to arbitration in the manner provided in         Section 14.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.3    License. Upon the release of the Source Code to Corio pursuant to         Section 12.2 of this Agreement, Corio shall have a royalty-free,         nonexclusive, nontransferable, right and license in the Territory to use         and modify the Source Code to support and maintain the Software until         the expiration or termination of Corio's Customers' End User License         Agreements. The object code derived from the Source Code so modified         shall be subject to the same rights and restrictions on use,         reproduction and disclosure that are contained in this Agreement with         respect to the Software. Corio shall not distribute, sell or sublicense         the Source Code. Subject to the licenses expressly granted in this         Agreement, Commerce One shall retain all right, title and interest in         and to the Source Code. This license shall be deemed to extend worldwide         in scope if Corio, at the time one or more Release Conditions has         occurred, has been granted worldwide license rights by Commerce One         under Section 2 of this Agreement.\n\n13      SHARED RESOURCES.\n\n13.1    Operations. To the extent not provided for within the Statement of Work         covered by the Implementation Fee, Commerce One shall provide Corio with         access to Commerce One operations personnel as reasonably requested by         Corio, subject to payment by Corio of Commerce One's standard fees [*].         These Commerce One operations personnel shall work together with Corio         personnel to optimize the architecture and performance of the Software         and MarketSite.net Service in a hosted environment. Commerce One shall         only commit personnel with expertise in installations, operating         environments and networking functionality.\n\n13.2    Consulting. To the extent not provided for within the Statement of Work         covered by the Implementation Fee, Commerce One shall provide Corio with         access to Commerce One consulting personnel as reasonably requested by         Corio, subject to payment by Corio of Commerce One's standard fees [*].

Commerce One may, in its sole but         reasonable discretion, elect to assign resources from a third party         systems integrator subject to advance notification to Corio of such         election.\n\n13.3    Engineering. Commerce One shall provide Corio with reasonable access to         Commerce One engineering personnel at no additional cost to Corio. Joint         engineering work may include product development, including without         limitation, technical and functional application development and         integration.\n\n13.4    Other. All services provided hereunder, in addition to services         subsequently requested by Corio (e.g. customization of the Software)         shall be subject to the terms of a separate agreement between the         parties.\n\n13.5    Ownership. Subject to Commerce One's pre-existing ownership of any         materials or technology provided to Corio, the results of all such         development efforts set forth in this Section 13, including all         intellectual property rights in any software interface coding or         programs created solely by Corio during the term of this Agreement to         enable the Software to operated within the Corio Servers' hosted         environment (DEVELOPMENTS), shall be owned by Corio, unless such         Developments are supported on an ongoing basis by Commerce One in which         case Commerce One will retain all ownership rights, including\n\n\n\n\n\n     intellectual property rights in the Developments. To the extent that         Commerce One would otherwise have a claim of ownership in such         Developments, Commerce One hereby assigns all rights in and to such         Developments to Corio. Further, Commerce One represents and warrants         that all Commerce One employees, agents, contractors or consultants that         will be provided to work together with Corio have or will have signed         agreements with customary terms containing confidentiality provisions         and assignment of inventions (EMPLOYEE NDA/INVENTION AGREEMENT). Corio         covenants and warrants that it will not disclose to Commerce One or its         officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors or consultants any         proprietary information, including without limitation any technical         information related to Developments created solely by Corio under this         Agreement, except upon the written authorization to do so by a Corporate         Officer of Commerce One. Commerce One covenants that during the term of         this Agreement, it will continue to require all Commerce One employees,         agents, contractors or consultants to sign an Employee NDA/Invention         Agreement and that Commerce One will furnish to Corio copies of such         signed agreements upon Corio's request. Ownership of intellectual         property rights to any enhancements, modifications or derivative works         to the Software itself which may be developed jointly by the parties or         solely by Corio shall be negotiated by the parties prior to the start of         any such development work.\n\n13.6    Independent Development: Covenant not to Sue. Nothing in this Agreement         will be construed to prohibit either parties' right to independently         develop the Developments contemplated above. Each party covenants that         it shall not, under any circumstances, sue the other party (or its         officers, directors, successors and assigns) or any of that parties'         licensees, customers, or distributors (Protected Entities) for patent         infringment under any future patents or future patent rights relating to         said Developments, that either party owns or controls, so long as that         Protected Entity has a license from Commerce One or Corio to the         Software, or to a product that is a modification of, derivative work         based on, or replacement for the Software. The foregoing covenant is         binding on Corio's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the         benefit of any\n\n                                    12\n\n13         of Commerce One's successors and assigns, and is binding on Commerce         One's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the benefit of any         of Corio's successors and assigns.\n\n14      MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n14.1    Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement or any rights or         obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without         the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the         foregoing, either party shall have the right to assign this Agreement in         connection with the merger or acquisition of such party or the sale of         all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement without         such consent, except in the case where such transaction involves a         direct competitor of the other party where consent of the other party         will be required. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and         inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and         permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this Section 14.1         shall be null and void.\n\n14.2    Waiver and Amendment. No modification, amendment or waiver of any         provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and         signed by the party to be charged. No failure or delay by either party         in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement, except         as specifically provided herein, shall operate as a waiver of any such         right, power or remedy.\n\n14.3    Choice of Law; Arbitration; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by         the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws         provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts         for the International Sale of Goods.

A judgment upon the award may be entered         in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without         limitation the courts in San Francisco, California. The non-prevailing         party in the arbitration shall pay all fees and charges of the American         Arbitration Association; each party, however, shall be responsible for         the payment of all fees and expenses connected with the presentation of         its respective case.\n\n14.4    Notices.

Notice shall be sent to the parties at the         addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement or at such other         address as shall be specified by either party to the other in writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5    Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors with         respect to each other. Each party is not and shall not be deemed to be         an employee, agent, partner or legal representative of the other for any         purpose and shall not have any right, power or authority to create any         obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other.\n\n14.6    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of         competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be         changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the\n\n                                    13\n\n14         objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by         law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full         force and effect.\n\n14.7    Force Majeure.

Commerce One understands and agrees that Corio shall solely         direct the provision of Corio Services and may subcontract certain         portions of the Corio Services to third parties at any time during the         term of the Agreement.\n\n14.9    Bankruptcy.

Any and all information pertaining to Operator and its business that is disclosed to Owner or discovered by Owner in  connection with any audit hereunder shall be subject to the Confidentiality and Disclosure Agreement without regard to whether it has been  designated as such and Owner shall be subject to the same restrictions and standard of care set forth therein with respect to Operator's  confidential information.\n\n6.6 Credit Inquiries.\n\n     If a customer, vendor, or other Person requests financial information concerning Owner, Operator may provide such customer, vendor, or  Person a certificate or affidavit, on behalf of Owner, to the effect that Owner owns the Gathering System, free and clear of any mortgage or other  liens or encumbrances except for (1) encumbrances consisting of zoning or planning restrictions, servitudes, permits, and other restrictions or  limitations on the use of immovable property that do not materially detract from the value of, or impair the use of, the Gathering System by Owner  in the operation of its business, (2) liens arising by operation of law in the ordinary course of business and in an aggregate amount that is not  material in relation to the value of the Gathering System, (3) liens for current taxes, assessments, or governmental charges or levies, and (4) such  other liens or encumbrances, if any, of which Operator has actual knowledge at the time.\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VII  FORCE MAJEURE\n\n7.1 Procedure.\n\n     If either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, other than the  obligation to indemnify and to make payments then or thereafter due hereunder, upon such Party giving notice and full particulars of such Force  Majeure in writing to the other Party as soon as reasonably possible after the occurrence of the cause relied on, then the obligations of the Party  giving such notice, so far as they are affected by such Force Majeure, will be suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused but for  no longer period, and such cause must as far as possible be remedied with all reasonable and diligent dispatch by the Party claiming such in order  to put itself in a position to carry out its obligations under this Agreement. Such notifying Party must also provide notice of the date of termination  of such Force Majeure event. A Force Majeure event affecting the performance by either Party shall not relieve it of liability in the event of its  negligence, where such negligence was a cause of the Force Majeure event, or in the event of its failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to  remedy the situation and remove the cause with all reasonable dispatch.\n\n7.2 Strikes.\n\n     It is understood and agreed that the settlement of strikes or lockouts is entirely within the discretion of the Party directly involved in the strike  or lockout, and that the above requirement that any Force Majeure must be remedied with all reasonable dispatch will not require the settlement of  strikes or lockouts by acceding to the demands of the opposing party when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having the  difficulty.\n\nARTICLE VIII  INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION\n\n8.1 Operator Insurance.\n\n     8.1.1 Operator, with respect to Operator's activities provided for under this Agreement, shall maintain the following insurance coverage with  responsible insurance carriers and/or through a program of self-insurance:\n\n18\n\n  (a)   Workers' Compensation. Operator shall maintain statutory worker's compensation insurance, covering all of its and its Affiliates'  employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable  to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident. In addition, Operator shall maintain employer's liability  insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each  employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit.

The Owner Indemnified Parties' additional insured status will not limit the  application of insurance protection as required by this Agreement which arises out of the Operator's indemnity obligations. These policies shall  provide primary coverage for claims in which Operator has agreed to hold harmless and/or to indemnify the Owner Indemnified Parties. No  other insurance clause may be invoked by any insurer. This coverage shall apply whether or not the indemnification is valid. Operator shall  have its insurer(s) waive its right of subrogation against Owner Indemnified Parties on all insurance carried. Unless expressly stated to the  contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or prohibited by applicable law or legal statute, Operator's indemnification obligations under this  Agreement shall not be limited by amount or in scope to coverage provided by insurance which is required under this Agreement.\n\n     8.1.3 Upon request, Operator agrees to furnish to Owner certificates of insurance or other evidence satisfactory to Owner to demonstrate  that the required insurance has been procured and is in force. The certificate shall accurately reflect the required insurance coverages and shall  provide that in the event of modification, expiration, cancellation or material change in a policy affecting the certificate holder, thirty days prior  written notice shall be given to the certificate holder. Operator waives all rights against Owner for recovery of damages to the extent such  damages are covered by the insurance maintained in accordance with this Section 8.1.\n\n8.2 Contractors.\n\n     Operator shall attempt to obtain reasonable indemnification and insurance protection from contractors performing services for Owner to protect  Owner and Operator. Operator shall require each of its contractors to carry insurance coverage substantially equivalent to the insurance required  of Operator above, and to include provisions for its contractors to name Owner and Operator as additional insureds, with the exception of  Workers' Compensation Insurance, and state that such policies will be primary to and non-contributory with any other insurance maintained by  Operator and Owner. With respect to Workers' Compensation\n\n19\n\n\n  (c)   Commercial Automobile Insurance. Operator shall maintain Commercial Automobile Insurance coverage, including, without limitation,  bodily injury and property damage for owned, hired, rented, and non-owned automotive equipment with a limit of not less than one million  dollars ($1,000,000) per accident.\n\n  (d)   Umbrella Liability Insurance.

The Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund's being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify the Fund of any such action shall not relieve the Fund from any liability that the Fund may have to the person against whom such action is brought by reason of any such untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of the Fund's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1. The Fund's indemnification agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1 and the Fund's representations and warranties in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Integrity, its officers and governors, or any controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of any Shares.

The Fund agrees to notify Integrity promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the Fund or any of its officers or trustees in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares. 4\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Integrity agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Fund, its several officers and trustees, and any person who controls the Fund within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the costs of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) that the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, but only to the extent that such liability or expense incurred by the Fund, its officers or trustees, or such controlling person resulting from such claims or demands shall arise out of or be based upon (a) any unauthorized sales literature, advertisements, information, statements, or representations or (b) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and used in the answers to any of the items of the registration statement or in the corresponding statements made in the prospectus or statement of additional information, or shall arise out of or be based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in connection with such information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and required to be stated in such answers or necessary to make such information not misleading.

If the indemnifying party opts to assume the defense of such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than (a) reasonable costs of investigation or the furnishing of documents or witnesses and (b) all reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel to such indemnified party if (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the indemnified party shall have concluded reasonably that representation of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them in the conduct of the defense of such action.

POLICY CANCELLATION\n\n         Cancellation of any policy in force, when requested in writing by the          insured, will be honored by MICOA, except for those MICOA is not          otherwise permitted to cancel.\n\nD.       EXPIRATIONS\n\n         1.       In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason,                   MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to                   sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations                   for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The                   purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on                   business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full                   months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be                   completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date.                   In return for this payment, for a two-year period following                   the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly                   sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals                   or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of                   termination of this Agreement.\n\n         2.       If Agency enters into a subagency agreement under which the                   subagency has the right to retain ownership of expirations on                   business produced by the subagency, then the purchase of                   expirations under subparagraph 1 above will not include the                   purchase of those subagency expirations, and the purchase                   price paid to Agency will not include the commissions paid for                   such business produced by the subagency.\n\n                                      -3-\n\nE.       AGENCY'S ERRORS AND OMISSION, AND FIDELITY & ELECTRONIC CRIME INSURANCE\n\n         The Agency will maintain valid errors and omissions insurance, with          minimum limits of $1,000,000 per incident, and a fidelity and          electronic crime policy through an insurer, both of which shall contain          terms and limits of coverage acceptable to MICOA covering the Agency's          solicitors and each of its employees. The Agency shall provide MICOA a          copy of each policy; doing so on a regular and current basis shall be a          precondition to all of Agency's rights under this Agreement, including          but not limited to the payment of all earned commissions.\n\nF.       TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT\n\n         1.       This agreement shall terminate:\n\n                  a.       Automatically if any public authority cancels or                            declines to renew the Agency's license or Certificate                            of Authority.\n\n                  b.       Immediately if either party gives detailed written                            notice to the other of alleged gross and willful                            misconduct, fraud or material misrepresentation.\n\n         2.       This Agreement shall terminate, subject to any automatic                   renewal or extension for one year as required by law, upon                   either party giving at least one hundred twenty (120) days                   advance written notice to the other, if not otherwise contrary                   to applicable law or this Agreement.\n\n         3.       If the Agency is delinquent in either accounting or payment of\n\n\n\n\n\n                  monies due MICOA, MICOA may by written notice to the Agency                   immediately terminate, suspend or modify any of the provisions                   of this agreement. Such action shall not be taken by MICOA                   over minor differences between the records of the Agency and                   MICOA.\n\n         4.       All supplies, including forms and policies furnished by MICOA                   and any copies or other reproductions of them, shall remain                   the property of MICOA and shall be returned to MICOA or its                   representative upon demand.\n\nG.       INDEMNIFICATION\n\n         The respective parties shall indemnify and hold one another harmless as          follows:\n\n                                      -4-\n\n         1.       MICOA shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any                   MICOA act or omission, except to the extent the Agency has                   caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.\n\n         2.       Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any                   act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has                   caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.\n\n         3.       The Agency and MICOA shall properly notify one another upon                   receiving notice of the commencement of any action related to                   such liabilities. MICOA shall be entitled to participate in                   any such action or in consultation with Agency and its carrier                   to assume the defense of any such action. If MICOA assumes the                   defense of any such action, it shall not be liable to the                   Agency for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred                   on the Agency's behalf absent MICOA's advance approval of such                   expenses.\n\n         4.       Neither party shall, except at its own risk and expense,                   voluntarily assume any liability, make any payment or incur                   any expense without the prior written consent of the other.\n\nH.       POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES\n\n         1.       Other Programs. Agency and MICOA agree that Agency may be                   offered the opportunity to support MICOA's workers'                   compensation, and its other nonphysician professional                   liability or product programs in Nevada when MICOA proceeds                   with related marketing plans. Such plans may also include                   Agency's involvement in sales of MICOA commercial and personal                   products. Appropriate agreements must be negotiated separately                   from this agreement for each such product, and for each such                   territory, including but not limited to Nevada.\n\n         2.       Territory. Agency and MICOA further agree to consider, subject                   to successful negotiation of appropriate agreements separate                   from this agreement, expansion of Agencies' sales territories                   for MICOA beyond Nevada.\n\nI.       MISCELLANEOUS\n\n         1.       Amendment. This agreement may be amended only in writing by                   mutual agreement of the Agency and MICOA, except that MICOA's                   name herein shall be deemed changed automatically for purposes                   of this agreement without written amendment upon approval of                   any such change by MICOA's domiciliary regulator.\n\n         2.       Non Waiver. Any failure by MICOA to insist upon compliance                   with any provisions of this Agreement or of the rules and                   regulations of MICOA shall not be construed as or constitute a                   waiver of them by MICOA.\n\n                                      -5-\n\n         3.       Integrated Agreement. This Agreement and its attachments as                   modified from time to time supersedes and replaces as of its                   effective date, all previous agreements, if any, between MICOA                   and the Agency. There are other agreements between MICOA and                   the Agency's parent corporation, SC&W, which are not                   superceded.\n\n         4. &bbsp;     Independent Contractor. The Agency is an independent insurance                   Agency and independent contractor, and not an employee,                   manager, officer or owner of MICOA.\n\n         5.       Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted under the                   laws of the State of Nevada. Any provisions of this Agreement                   or any amendments to the Agreement that are or become in                   conflict with any applicable statutes or regulations shall be                   deemed to be amended to conform to those statutes or                   regulations.\n\n         6.       Counterparts. This Agreement and any Exhibits which require                   signatures may be executed in counterparts which shall\n\n\n\n\n\n                  together be regarded as binding upon the Parties.\n\n         7.       Authority. The persons signing below represent and warrant                   that they are duly authorized representatives of the                   respective Parties, fully willing and able to execute this                   Agreement.\n\n         8.       Assignment. MICOA may assign this Agreement to its parent,                   affiliate, or subsidiary corporations who are licensed                   insurers upon written notice to Agency. Agency may not assign                   this Agreement without the written permission of MICOA or its                   successors or assigns.\n\n         9.       Resolution of Disputes. In the event of any dispute arising                   out of this Agreement, MICOA and Agency agree to submit such                   dispute to arbitration as follows:\n\n                  a.       There shall be three arbitrators; one shall be                            selected by the Agency, one shall be selected by                            MICOA, and a third shall be selected by those two                            arbitrators. If the two arbitrators cannot agree on                            the selection of a third, American Arbitration                            Association's regional office closest to Agency's                            main office shall be requested to appoint the third                            arbitrator.\n\n                  b.       The determination of the arbitrators shall be final                            and binding upon the Agency and MICOA.\n\n                  c.       Neither MICOA nor the Agency shall be entitled to                            punitive and/or exemplary damages.\n\n                                      -6-\n\n                  d.       The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with                            the procedures of the above referenced regional                            office of the American Arbitration Association. The                            Agency and MICOA shall pay the cost of their                            arbitrator and share equally in the expense of the                            third arbitrator.\n\n                  e.       Either Party, may where permitted by the law of                            Nevada, enter judgment upon the arbitrators' award.\n\n         10.      Year 2000 Compliance. Agency must at times assure that any of                   its computers, data processing systems, software components,                   and network arrangements use for MICOA business completely and                   accurately, present, produce, store and calculate all dates                   after December 31, 1999; and that they will not produce                   abnormally ending or incorrect results involving such dates as                   used in any forward or regression data based functions. All                   such items must yield date-related functionalities and date                   fields which accurately indicate the century and millennium                   and correctly perform all calculations involving a four digit                   year field.\n\nSigned and effective this 25th day of May, 1999.\n\n                                         AGENCY\n\n                                         By:  /s/ Terrence L.

Hagadorn East Lansing, MI 48823\n\nRE:      NEVADA DEPARTMENT          PROJECT MEMORANDUM\n\nDear Terry:\n\nIn response to MICOA's request to develop a complete insurance distribution system for Nevada, including physicians professional liability and personal and commercial insurance by July 1999, Stratton, Cheeseman & Walsh, Inc. (SC&W) has spent and will continue to spend a substantial amount of time and money. In recognition that these expenditures will directly benefit MICOA, SC&W and MICOA agree to the following:\n\n-    During the first two years of developing the Nevada distribution system, a      portion of the start up costs will be shared. Subject to compliance with a      detailed budget developed by SC&W and MICOA, these reimbursable costs shall      include:\n\n     -    Salaries and benefits for SCW-Nevada, Inc. employees and agents.\n\n     -    20% of your total personal benefits and salary, and 100% of your           personal travel expenses incurred with respect to the Nevada office,           which respective percentages are intended to recognize your personal           support of MICOA's Nevada initiative.\n\n     -    Legal expenses directly attributable to the Nevada initiative.\n\n     -    Nevada office set up.\n\n     -    Consultant's expenses paid by SC&W in direct support of the           initiative.\n\n     -    The above costs are to be designated and itemized in the preapproved           budget and reimbursed by MICOA at 100% for the first full year of           development and 50% for the second year. It is agreed that the first           year began effective October 1, 1997.\n\n-    All other costs attributable to the normal operation of the Nevada      insurance agency site are the sole responsibility of SC&W.\n\n-    After the first two years (i.e. after October 1, 1999) all expenses will      be borne by SC&W and those amounts paid to SC&W during the first two years      shall be repaid. Repayment shall be through reduction of commissions due      SC&W by 0.5% or if\n\n                                      -7-\n\n     SC&W exceeds $10.0 million in premium revenues by offset in the event any      money is owed the Agency by MICOA. Such reduction or offset shall occur for      so long as necessary to repay amounts reimbursed by MICOA during the      two-year period of development; but in no event will repayment be collected      for a period of greater than ten years. Any unpaid amounts at the end of      ten years shall be forgiven by MICOA.\n\n-    Nevada rent expenses will be shared on a 50/50 basis between MICOA and      SC&W.\n\n-    In order to allow SC&W to expand the distribution system in Nevada with      select and controlled subagents, an exclusive agency agreement will be      negotiated which will spell out the terms and conditions of the      relationship. A commission rate of 12% will be paid for both new and      renewal physicians liability business. Other commission rates will be      determined as products become available. This Agency Agreement should be      finalized by April 30, 1999.\n\n-    MICOA may pay future payments advanced pursuant to this letter on a monthly      basis, unless doing so would be impractical, in which case another periodic      form of&bbsp;payment will be arranged. Amounts owed for past time periods will      be paid as follows: one-third by March 25, 1999; one-third by May 1, 1999;      and one-third by June 1, 1999. All other amounts owed under this Project      Memorandum to be paid by October 1, 1999.\n\nSC&W's responsibilities, under this Project Memorandum, will include assisting MICOA with market assessment, distribution, and sales integration into Nevada. SC&W agrees not to serve in a strategic marketing capacity for another insurer\n\n\n\n\n\nin Nevada while it is providing such services for MICOA or for a period of one year thereafter.\n\nTerry, please countersign and return this letter to indicate your acceptance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMUTUAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA\n\n/s/ Thomas C.

The Parties agree that they only intend        for Dangerous Goods to be carried pursuant to this Agreement if the        requirements of the TDGA are met and both Parties are aware that such        goods are being carried. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree        that neither Dynamex nor Purolator shall be under any obligation or duty        whatsoever to open for prior inspection any Freight tendered to Dynamex        pursuant to this Agreement. Neither Party shall be responsible for any        losses or damage whatsoever that may be sustained by the other Party, its        directors, officers, employees and any persons for whom it may become        responsible in law, as a result of any Dangerous Goods contained in        Freight unless such Party had actual prior knowledge of the presence of        Dangerous Goods. In the event a Party had actual prior knowledge of the        presence of Dangerous Goods, then it shall be liable for loss or damage        to the other Party if it would otherwise be liable under this Agreement        or at law.\n\n13.2   Each Party must comply with the placarding and all other regulations        applicable to the handling of Dangerous Goods.

Such        reports shall be made available for review by the other Party and in        connection with same, a Party shall provide copies of all data and        records relating thereto.\n\n11                                      - 11 -\n\n14.2   Each Party shall maintain complete maintenance and operational records.\n\n14.3   Each Party shall keep accurate books, accounts and records covering all         transactions relating to this Agreement, including books of original        entry, and upon request from the other Party, shall allow access to        same.\n\n14.4   Either Party shall have the right to request the other to provide,        through an auditor agreed to by the Parties, validation of the        information and data referred to herein.\n\n15.0   CONTINGENCY PLANS\n\n15.1   In the event a Party is unable to provide the Services as a result of a        strike or other labour disruption caused by its employees, it shall              attempt to subcontract the Services to another operator or operators,        acceptable to the other Party. Such Services shall be provided by such        subcontractor/subcontractors on the same terms and conditions herein set        out and will be continued to be provided during the period of any such        strike or labour disruption, unless this Agreement is otherwise        terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. It is        understood and agreed that, if such Party provides the Services by        subcontracting to another operator/operators, then it shall be deemed        not to be in default pursuant to paragraph 17.1(c). Notwithstanding        same, all other default provisions as set out in paragraph 17, continue        to apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n16.0   SERVICE FAILURE REMEDIES\n\n16.1   In the event that Monthly Performance Failures occur more than three (3)        times in any twelve (12) month period, an Event of Default shall have         occurred.\n\n17.0   DEFAULT PROVISIONS\n\n17.1   For the purposes of this Agreement, the following shall constitute        events of default by a Party (hereinafter referred to as Events of         Default):\n\n    (a)     if a petition is filed against it under any applicable bankruptcy                legislation and is not withdrawn or dismissed within sixty                (60) days thereafter;\n\n    (b)     if a resolution is passed by it respecting the sale of all or                substantially all of its assets, or an order for the winding                 up of its business is made, or it otherwise agrees to make a                 bulk sale of it's assets;\n\n    (c)     if it ceases or threatens to cease to carry on its business;\n\n12                                      - 12 -\n\n     (d)     if it commits or threatens to commit an act of bankruptcy, or                 if it becomes insolvent or bankrupt or makes an assignment or if                 a receiver or receiver manager is appointed in respect of its                 business and affairs of either by way of private instrument or                 through court proceedings;\n\n     (e)     if a judgment or order is entered with respect to it under the                 Company Creditors Arrangement Act R.S.C. 1985, Chapter C-36, as                 amended, or similar legislation, or it takes advantage of the                 provisions of any bankruptcy or insolvency legislation;\n\n     (f)     if any execution, or any other process of any court becomes                 enforceable against all or substantially all of it's property or                 if a distress or analogous process is levied against all or                 substantially all of its property;\n\n     (g)     if it is in default as per paragraph 16.1 hereof; or\n\n     (h)     if it otherwise neglects or fails to perform or observe any of                 its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure the                 breach or default within thirty (30) days of written notice to                 the other Party.\n\n17.2    Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and in addition to any         rights or remedies available to it under this Agreement or at law or in         equity, the Party not in default may exercise any or all of the         following remedies:\n\n     (a)     terminate this Agreement, upon giving one hundred and twenty                 (120) days written notice, otherwise upon written notice with                 respect to 17.1 (g) and (h);\n\n     (b)     recover from the defaulting Party any and all monies then due                 and to become due; and\n\n     (c)     take possession, immediately, without demand or notice, without                 any court order or other process of law, any and all of its                 property (including bags and containers) and Freight received by                 the defaulting Party under this Agreement.\n\n17.3    Termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to any other         rights of the Party not in default, including the right to claim         damages, and to the rights of the Parties that have accrued prior to         termination.\n\n17.4    In the event the Defaulting Party fails to pay any amount due pursuant         to paragraph 17.2, then the other Party shall have the right to deduct         same from any amount due or to become due to the defaulting Party.    13                                      - 13 -\n\n18.0    PERFORMANCE PENALTIES\n\n18.1    In the event a Party has, in any twelve (12) month period, more than         three (3) Monthly Performance Failures, then the defaulting Party shall         pay a penalty to the Party not in default, which the Parties acknowledge         is a pre-estimation of damages suffered by the non-defaulting Party due         to the current month's Monthly Performance Failure (Default Month).\n\n     For each Default Month, the Party in default shall pay a penalty equal         to five (5) times the Party not in default's corporate average yield         during the Default Month for each shipment below the performance\n\n\n\n\n\n     commitment.\n\n     For example, if the defaulting Party, in a Default Month, provided         services at an eighty five percent (85%) level and the average yield for         the Default Month of the Party not in default is ten dollars ($10.00)         and the total number of shipments handled by the defaulting Party         pursuant to this Agreement is one hundred (100), then the penalty would         be equal to 5 x[(Performance Commitment - Actual Performance Level) x #         of shipments] x average yield or 5 x [(90-85) x 100] x 10 = $250.00.                                       100 19.0    TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE\n\n19.1    Either Party may terminate this Agreement, without cause, by giving two         (2) years written notice.\n\n19.2    In the event of a change in control of a Party, the other Party shall         have the right, upon written prior notice, to terminate this          Agreement.\n\n20.0    NOTICE\n\n20.1    Any notice or other communication with respect to this Agreement shall         be in writing and shall be effectively given if delivered, or sent         (postage or other charges prepaid) by letter, facsimile or electronic         means addressed:\n\n     (a)     in the case of Purolator to:                                  Purolator Courier Ltd.                 5995 Avebury Road, Suite 500                 Mississauga, Ontario                 L5R 3T8                 Attention:\n\n     (b)     in the case of Dynamex:\n\n             Dynamex Inc.                 2630 Skymark Avenue                 Suite 610                 Mississauga, Ontario                 L4W 5A4    14                                      - 14 -\n\n     or to any other address of which the Party in question advises to the         other Party in writing.

Wildform understands that the Payment Shares             will be restricted securities under applicable federal securities             laws and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission             promulgated thereunder. Wildform acknowledges that it may dispose of             the Payment Shares only pursuant to an effective registration             statement under the Act or an exception from registration if             available. Wildform further understands that, except as provided in             the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below), Buyer has no             obligation to register the sale of the Payment Shares or take any             other action so as to permit sales pursuant to the Act.

Bioamber and Cargill shall be referred to individually as Party and collectively as Parties, as required by text.\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nCargill and Bioamber mutually agree as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 1 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n  A. Cargill has developed a yeast strain designated CB1 (CB1) for fermenting dextrose and/or mixed sugar streams and related research  tools for modifying CB1,which are protected by Licensed Patents (as defined in Section 2.5 below).\n\n  B. Bioamber desires to engage Cargill to further develop or modify CB1 with the goal of fermenting dextrose and/or mixed sugar streams to  produce succinic acid and salts thereof.\n\n  C. The Parties desire to grant each other certain rights to use the further developed or modified CB1 as well as other technology that is  developed in the course of the work as provided in this Development Agreement for research purposes only.\n\n1. Scope of Work Plan  1.1 Cargill agrees to perform the services to develop or modify CB1 to produce succinic acid and salts thereof using dextrose (defined as  glucose) and/or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock (Work Plan). The Work Plan is more fully described in Exhibit A, which is hereby  incorporated by reference into this Development Agreement. CB1 that has been further developed or modified (or the like) under the Work  Plan shall be referred to as Modified CB1. Any changes to the Work Plan must be in writing and signed by both Cargill and Bioamber and  may be subject to incremental fees depending on resource requirements.\n\n1.2 In agreeing to perform the Work Plan, Cargill represents and warrants that:\n\n  1.2.1 Cargill has the capability, experience, and means necessary to perform the Work Plan, and the Work Plan will be performed using  personnel, equipment, and material qualified and suitable to perform the Work Plan requested;\n\nth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 2 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n  1.2.2 Cargill will provide properly trained and informed personnel, and Cargill will be solely responsible for the negligent acts, errors and  omissions of its employees, subcontractors, and agents and for any other person performing services under this Development  Agreement at the direct request of Cargill;\n\n  1.2.3 Cargill will perform the Work Plan in a workmanlike manner with reasonable skill and care ordinarily exercised by members of the  profession practicing under similar conditions and in accordance with accepted industry practices and professional guidelines;\n\n  1.2.4 Subject to Section 13.1, Cargill has in effect and will maintain in effect all permits, licenses and other authorizations necessary to  perform the Work Plan; and\n\n\n\n1.2.5 No other party has rights to its services as described in the Work Plan, and that a work assignment from any third party shall not be  accepted, or work by Cargill aloneshall not be conducted, to develop CB1 or other microorganisms that will be used to (a) directly  produce succinic acid and salts thereof, or (b) indirectly produce succinic acid and salts thereof (for example, Cargill may develop  microorganisms to produce precursors of succinic acid, such as fumaric acid and malic acid, so long as such precursors are not  converted to succinic acid, such as by chemical modification), for the Term (as defined in Section 10.1) of this Development  Agreement. For purposes of clarity, and as examples, Cargill may sell dextrose as fermentation feedstock to third parties, who may  use such dextrose to produce succinic acid; also, Cargill may modify starches to make succinic acid starch derivatives.\n\n2. Fees and Milestones   2.1 Bioamber shall pay Cargill Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000.00) within thirty (30) days of the execution of this  Development Agreement.\n\n2.2 In addition to the payment in Section 2.1, Bioamber shall pay Cargill a total of [***] U.S. Dollars ($[***] per year per full-time equivalent  (FTE) person to perform the Work Plan, and Cargill will make available up to [***] FTE persons per year to perform the work as outlined in  the Work Plan. Such total is subject to change based on an annual review of the needs and requirements of the Work Plan. The actual  number of FTEs assigned at any given time will be a function of the Work Plan and will be subject to agreement amongst the Parties. In  addition, Bioamber will pay for reasonable expenses incurred by Cargill, including travel. Cargill shall cover ordinary and customary [***].  Cargill shall submit to Bioamber a monthly invoice for costs owed by Bioamber, accompanied by a report summarizing Cargill's activities in  relation to actual hours worked and expenses incurred. Bioamber will pay Cargill's costs within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice and  supporting documentation. Bioamber shall have the right to audit Cargill time sheets from time to time. Such audit shall occur once per year  during reasonable business hours by an independent third party agreed to by both parties, who shall be under obligations of  confidentiality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 3 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n2.3 Bioamber shall also pay Cargill within thirty (30) days of achieving each of the milestones summarized below and more fully described in the  Work Plan found in Exhibit A. For purposes of clarity, payment is triggered [***]. Further, each of the Milestones and Target Dates may be  changed according to the needs of the Work Plan and upon written agreement by the parties.\n\nMilestone   Target Date   Payment  Milestone 1: Proof of Concept   12 months after Effective Date   US $250,000.00 Milestone 2: CB1 Strain Development   30 months after Effective Date   US $300,000.00 Milestone 3: CB1 Strain Optimization   42 months after Effective Date   US $500,000.00\n\n2.4 Missed Milestones.\n\n\n\n2.4.1 In the event Cargill does not achieve a given Milestone provided in Section 2.3 by the Target Date listed in Section 2.3 or modified  Milestone and modified Target Date as agreed to by the Parties, and subsequently achieves such milestone as per the criteria  described in Exhibit A, the payment for such missed milestone shall be due [***] and the amount due shall be [***] for every [***]  beyond the Target Date. The Target Date for subsequent Milestones will be adjusted to reflect the date on which the Milestone was  actually achieved. If a subsequent Milestone is achieved by the original Target Date listed in Section 2.3, Bioamber will pay Cargill  the amount [***]. For purposes of clarity and as examples, if Milestones 1 and 2 were not delivered by the Target Dates, but  Milestone 3 is delivered by or before the Target Date, then the total payments due to Cargill at that time would be [***] (a total  payment of $[***]). Another example is if [***], the payment due at that time would be a total of $[***].\n\n\n\n2.4.2 In the event Cargill does not achieve a given Milestone provided in Section 2.3 by the Target Date listed in Section 2.3 or modified  Milestone and modified Target Date as agreed to by the Parties, and Bioamber decides to commercialize Modified CB1, any  outstanding milestone payments shall immediately become due such that the total payment due Cargill under this Development  Agreement equals One Million Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $1,050,000.00).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 4 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n  2.4.3 Provided that Cargill has respected its undertakings set out in Section 1.2 of this Development Agreement, no other damages shall  accrue to Cargill for not achieving a given Milestone other than provided in Sections 2.4.1, 2.4.2, and 2.5.\n\n2.5 Option to Research License. In the event Cargill (i) is unable to achieve a given milestone described in Section 2.3 by the Target Date, or (ii)  terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2, Bioamber shall have the option to obtain a license during the term of this Development  Agreement to the patent applications and patents listed in Exhibit B (including any continuations, continued prosecutions, continuations- in-part, reissues, reexaminations, divisions or substitutions thereof) (collectively Licensed Patents), the tool kit listed in Exhibit C  (Licensed Tool Kit), and Cargill Improvements if any (as defined in Section 5.2 below), for research use only and for additional monetary  consideration (Research License). Except for financial terms paid by third parties for [***], the Research License shall be offered to  Bioamber at [***]. Such research use shall be for the development and optimization of CB1 for the production of succinic acid and salts  thereof using dextrose or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock. The Research License shall be provided to Bioamber only, with no rights  to sublicense and with no have made rights. Notwithstanding the preceding, Bioamber will be permitted to outsource development work  as outlined in the Work Plan and according to the Research License to third parties that have been approved by Cargill, and such approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld. In considering whether or not to outsource such development work to third parties, the Parties  recognize that it is in their mutual interest to protect CB1, Modified CB1, Cargill Confidential Information (as defined in Section 4.1), and  Know-How and Licensed Patents (as those terms are defined under the Commercial License Agreement) and, therefore, the Parties shall  undertake joint evaluations of third parties who have been identified by Bioamber to perform such development work, including, for  example and not by limitation, a risk assessment of the geography in which such development work will occur, and whether or not such  third parties have similar guiding principles as Cargill (a copy of Cargill's Guiding Principles and Compliance Policy on Intellectual Property  is attached as Exhibit F). Such development work shall not be conducted by such third parties in circumstances where Cargill's intellectual  property is at an unacceptable risk as determined by Cargill based on the joint evaluations of such third parties. The terms and conditions  of such Research License shall be negotiated between the Parties and shall include the terms described in this Section 2.5 and terms  addressing ownership and rights to use of any intellectual property developed. Further, this Development Agreement shall serve as the  framework for the Research License.\n\n2.6 Technology Transfer. In the event Milestone 3 is achieved, Cargill will provide up to [***] to assist in a successful transfer of the Modified  CB1 technology to Bioamber in order to allow subsequent scale-up at the same FTE rate set forth in Section 2.2. For clarity, [***] per FTE  per year equals US$[***] for this technology transfer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 5 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n2.7 Scale-Up.

Confidentiality. To carry out the Work Plan, Cargill may receive from, and provide to, Bioamber certain Confidential Information, as defined  below. Such Confidential Information will be disclosed by one Party (the Disclosing Party) to the other Party (the Receiving Party) on  the following terms and conditions:\n\n4.1 Confidential Information means all business, technical, and financial information related to the Work Plan, the terms and discussions  relating to the Term Sheet executed by the parties on December 3, 2009 and December 4, 2009, and to any aspect of the business of each  Party that is material to the Work Plan, including, without limitation, Licensed Tool Kit, products, product compositions, raw materials,  specifications, formulae, equipment, business plans and strategies, customer lists, supplier lists, know-how, samples, drawings, pricing  informationand other financial information, inventions, ideas, research information, packaging, manufacturing processes, and other  information, or its potential use, that is owned by or in possession of either Party. For purposes of clarity, the parties shall not disclose to  each other any Confidential Information that is not material to the Work Plan, such as, by way of example and without limitation, processes  and other information relating to post-fermentation activities. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (a) is in the public  domain prior to disclosure by Disclosing Party; (b) becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no  unauthorized act or omission by the Receiving Party; (c) is lawfully in the Receiving Party's possession prior to disclosure by the  Disclosing Party; or (d) is independently developed by an employee(s) of the Receiving Party with no access to the disclosed Confidential  Information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 6 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n4.2 The Receiving Party agrees to take and maintain proper and appropriate steps to protect Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.  The Receiving Party agrees to disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to employees or agents of the Receiving  Party who are directly involved with the Work Plan contemplated by this Development Agreement, and even then only to such extent as is  necessary and essential to perform the Work Plan. The Receiving Party agrees to inform such employees and agents of the confidential  nature of the information disclosed hereunder and to cause all such employees and agents to abide by the terms of this Development  Agreement.\n\n4.3 The Receiving Party shall not disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to any unauthorized party without the Disclosing  Party's prior express written consent or unless required by court order or order of a similar governmental entity. If a Party is required by  court order or order of a similar governmental entity to disclose the other's Confidential Information, they shall give the other Party prompt  notice of such requirement so that an appropriate protective order or other relief may be sought.\n\n4.4 The Receiving Party will use Confidential Information only in connection with the Work Plan. Both Parties have reserved all rights to their  respective Confidential Information not expressly granted herein. All documents and/or tangible materials containing or comprising  Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party will remain the property of the Disclosing Party. Upon the request of the Disclosing Party,  the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and any documents prepared by the Receiving Party  using Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party agrees to provide confirmation of such destruction in  writing. The Receiving Party may, however, keep one copy of any such document in the files of its legal department or outside counsel for  record purposes only.\n\n4.5 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Development Agreement, each Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach of confidentiality  and use as provided in this Section may result in irreparable harm and damages to the Disclosing Party in an amount difficult to ascertain  and that cannot be adequately compensated by a monetary award. Accordingly, in addition to any other relief to which the Disclosing  Party may be entitled at law or in equity, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek a temporary and/or permanent injunctive relief from  any breach or threatened breach by the Receiving Party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 7 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n4.6 The obligations imposed by this section, including but not limited to non-disclosure and non-use, however, will endure so long as the  Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party does not become part of the public domain.\n\n4.7 The existence of and the terms of this Development Agreement, including its Exhibits, are confidential and are not to be disclosed without  the prior written approval of Cargill.\n\n4.8 Neither Party may make any public announcement concerning this Development Agreement, its subject matter, and the activities and  actions it contemplates without the other Party's express written consent.  4.9 This Section 4 supercedes and replaces the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties, which was effective July 17, 2009. All  Confidential Information that was subject to that Mutual Confidentiality Agreement is hereby made subject to the terms and conditions of  this Section 4.\n\n5. Intellectual Property  5.1 Each party shall retain ownership of all intellectual property that it owned prior to the Effective Date.\n\n5.2 Improvements. Any invention or discovery relating to the Work Plan, in whole or in part, that is conceived during the term of this  Development Agreement shall be an Improvement. The scope for Improvements will be limited to the CB1 strain itself and the [***] (the  Field), but shall exclude [***]. Bioamber will own any Improvement in the field of succinic acid and salts thereof and such Improvement  shall be designated Bioamber Improvements. Cargill will own any Improvement in all fields other than the field of succinic acid and salts  thereof, subject to the rights provided in Section 5.2.1 below, and such Improvement shall be designated Cargill Improvements. In the  event it is not clear as to ownership of any Improvement as described in this Section 5.2, in other words, if it is not clear whether an  invention or discovery is either a Bioamber Improvement or a Cargill Improvement, such Improvement shall be [***] and such Improvement  shall be designated Joint Improvements. For purposes of clarity, as examples, Cargill Improvements are those inventions relating to  fumaric acid and malic acid. Additionally, where an Improvement has applications both in the Field and outside the Field, then such  Improvement, as it applies to the Field, shall be a Bioamber Improvement and, as it applies outside the Field, such Improvement shall be a  Cargill Improvement.\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Cargill hereby grants Bioamber, and Bioamber hereby accepts, an exclusive, royalty-free license to Cargill Improvements and Joint  Improvements for use in the Field during the term of this Development Agreement with a reservation of right for Cargill to practice  such Cargill Improvements and Joint Improvements for use in the field of succinic acid and salts thereof during the term of this  Development Agreement.

Cargill shall bear all costs  incurred in connection with such preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of U.S. and foreign application(s) and  issued/granted patents directed to Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements. Cargill shall provide Bioamber a copy of any  proposed patent application covering Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements in advance of the submission of the  proposed patent application to any patent office. However, Cargill shall be entitled to file provisional patent applications without  seeking Bioamber's approval. If Cargill waives its option, Bioamber shall have the option to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain  patent applications and issued patents on Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements. Cargill shall provide, when requested  by Bioamber, all information in its possession, or true copies thereof, pertaining to Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements  which may be necessary or useful in the preparation, filing, and prosecution of patent applications covering the Bioamber  Improvements and Joint Improvements. Such information shall be treated as Confidential Information.\n\n\n\n5.2.4 If Cargill waives its option to prepare and prosecute a patent application in accordance with Section 5.2.3 and elects not to file such  a patent application or elects to allow any such patent application or issued/granted patent to become abandoned or lapse, Cargill  shall give Bioamber notice of such election promptly and at least two (2) months prior to the first date that action must be taken to  avoid such abandonment or lapse. Bioamber shall have the right to take over at its sole expense the filing, prosecution or  maintenance of any such patent application and Bioamber shall keep Cargill informed of Bioamber's filing, prosecution, and  maintenance activities. All out-of-pocket expenses of Cargill shall be reimbursed by Bioamber. Bioamber shall have no liability to  Cargill for Bioamber's acts or failure to act with respect to such patent application or issued/granted patent.\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Cargill shall have the sole power to bring and/or settle suits for infringement of any and all patent applications and/or patents on  Improvements, regardless of ownership; provided, however, if required by law, Cargill shall join Bioamber, and Bioamber shall be  joined, in such suits. Cargill shall control any such suits and shall bear all expenses related to any such suits. Bioamber shall  provide any assistance reasonably requested in prosecuting and enforcing any and all patent applications and/or patents on  Improvements. In the event Cargill elects not to initiate and prosecute suits for infringement of any patent application/and or patent  onImprovement within the Field, then with sixty (60) days prior written notice to Cargill, Bioamber shall be entitled to initiate and  prosecute such suits. For purposes of clarity, within such sixty (60) day period, Cargill shall be entitled to initiate and prosecute  such suits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 9 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n  5.2.6 Cargill shall have the sole power to settle suits for infringement of the Licensed Patents. Cargill will in good faith consider  enforcement requests from Bioamber.\n\n\n\n5.2.7 Improvements are to be considered Confidential Information of the owning Party subject to the terms and conditions of Section 4,  provided that the Party authorized hereunder to file and prosecute patent applications for an Improvement may make disclosure of  that Improvement to outside patent counsel and to relevant patent offices as reasonably necessary for filing and prosecution of a  patent application.\n\n5.3 In consideration of the ownership rights granted to Bioamber under this Section 5, and the licenses granted to Bioamber under this Section  5 and the Commercial License attached as Exhibit D, Bioamber agrees to the payment terms and its other obligations contained in the  attached Commercial License.\n\n6. WRF Patents. Washington Research Foundation (WRF) is the owner of several patents relating to the expression of polypeptides in yeast  (WRF Patents). Prior to transferring CB1 or any other yeast strain to Bioamber, Bioamber shall provide to Cargill a letter from WRF  stating that Bioamber has a license to the WRF Patents (Bioamber-WRF License). Upon receipt of such letter, Cargill will transfer CB1 to  Bioamber for Bioamber's use of the strain commensurate with and in accordance with the Bioamber-WRF License. Cargill shall have no  liability to Bioamber for Bioamber's acts or failure to act with respect to the WRF Patents.  7. Warranties.

Neither Party shall assign this Development Agreement or the obligations contained herein without the express written  consent of the other Party.\n\n13.4 Waiver. The failure of either Party to insist in any one or more instances upon performance of any terms or conditions of this Development  Agreement, is not to be construed as a waiver of future performance of any such term, covenant, or condition, but the obligations of either  Party with respect thereto will continue in full force and effect. No waiver will be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving  Party.\n\n13.5 Amendment. No amendment, modification, or waiver of the terms of this Development Agreement shall be binding unless placed in writing  and duly executed by the Parties' authorized representatives.  13.6 Severability. All provisions contained herein are severable, and in the event any of them is held to be invalid by any competent court or  arbitrator, this Development Agreement is to be interpreted as if such invalid provision were not contained herein.\n\n13.7 Survivability. Sections 4 (Confidentiality), 5 (Intellectual Property), 6 (WRF Patents), 7 (Warranties), 8 (Indemnification), 13.2 (Governing  Law), and 13.7 (Survivability) will survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Development Agreement.\n\n13.8 Entire Agreement. This Development Agreement supersedes all previous understandings between Cargill and Bioamber concerning the  subject matter of this Development Agreement, including but not limited to the Term Sheet executed by the Parties on December 3, 2009  and December 4, 2009, and the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties which was effective July 17, 2009, and, together with  its attachments, including the Commercial License Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit D executed concurrently with this Development  Agreement, contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be amended, modified,  or supplemented except in writing and signed by both Parties specifically referring to this Development Agreement and the Commercial  License Agreement.\n\n13.9 Bioamber Non-Compete Commitment.

The Parties agree to conduct the R&D Program pursuant to the R&D Work Plan and to perform   their respective obligations therein. To the extent Conformis' performance under the R&D Program is delayed due to Stryker's   delay in performing any of its obligations in accordance with the timelines in the R&D Work Plan, the applicable timelines shall be   deemed extended by a period of time corresponding to the length of such portion of the delay attributable to Stryker, on a day-by-   day basis. The R&D Work Plan may be amended by mutual written agreement of the Parties from time to time.   2.2 Agents or Third Parties. To the extent working with Agents or other Third Parties is permitted under the R&D Work   Plan, should a Party wish to engage an Agent or any other Third Party in connection with the R&D Work Plan or any other work   under this Agreement, such Party must obtain in advance a written agreement by such Agent or other Third Party (i) to assign to   the Party all Inventions conceived, created or generated by the Agent or other Third Party, and (ii) to maintain all Confidential   Information in confidence as set forth in Section 5.2.   ARTICLE III DELIVERABLES AND COMPLETION   3.1 Deliverables. Subject to the remedies set forth in Section 3.4, Conformis shall furnish Stryker with the Deliverables   as defined in the R&D Work Plan, and Stryker shall have the opportunity to analyze and test each Deliverable for the purposes of   determining Acceptance as set forth in the R&D Work Plan. Each Deliverable shall be deemed to be completed once such   Deliverable has been Accepted (as defined below).   3.2 Free from Infringement. Without the consent of Stryker, Conformis shall not introduce any structure or   methodology in the Deliverables (including a Deliverable within a Product or a Stryker Product) that (1) raise a colorable   argument of patent infringement in the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of the Deliverable as such Deliverable   8   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nis intended to be exploited under the Other Agreements, (2) misappropriate any Confidential Information of any Third Party, or   (3) otherwise violate any Intellectual Property rights of any Third Party. For clarity, disclosure of a matter on the Disclosure   Schedules to the Asset Purchase Agreement shall not be deemed consent by Stryker under this Section 3.2.   3.3 Completion. After a Deliverable has been furnished to Stryker, Stryker (or its Agent designee) will be entitled to   analyze and test the Deliverable to determine if it operates in accordance with and otherwise conforms to the applicable   Acceptance Criteria set forth in R&D Work Plan. Conformis shall provide such assistance as Stryker may reasonably request in   such determination. Stryker shall have [**] (Acceptance Notification Period) following the date the Deliverable is received by   Stryker to Accept or reject the Deliverable as described in Section 3.4.   3.4 Acceptance or Rejection. Respecting any Deliverable for Milestone #1 or Milestone #2, as set forth below, if   Stryker determines that a Deliverable operates in accordance with and otherwise conforms to the applicable Acceptance Criteria   pursuant to the R&D Work Plan, then Stryker will notify Conformis in writing that Stryker Accepts such Deliverable. If Stryker   reasonably determines that a Deliverable does not operate in accordance with or otherwise conform to the applicable Acceptance   Criteria, then Stryker will provide Conformis with a written notice of rejection within the Acceptance Notification Period   describing the defect in view of the relevant Acceptance Criteria and including sufficient detail with respect to such Stryker testing   and testing results as Conformis reasonably requests (Failure Notice). Conformis shall have [**] (or such longer period of time   as may be agreed between the parties in good faith should the scope and complexity of the applicable Deliverable warrant some   longer period of time) (Redelivery Period) following the date it receives the Failure Notice to correct and redeliver the   Deliverable. If Conformis timely delivers a corrected version of the Deliverable within the Redelivery Period, then Stryker will be   9   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nentitled to repeat its acceptance analysis and testing process for the purposes of determining Acceptance as set forth in the R&D   Work Plan until such Deliverable operates in accordance with or otherwise conforms to the applicable Acceptance Criteria;   provided, however, that if Stryker properly rejects a particular Deliverable three (3) or more times in accordance with this Article   III, or if Conformis fails to deliver a version or corrected version, as the case may be, of the Deliverable within any respective [**]   period, Stryker may, terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.2(c) (in the event of such three (3) rejections, Stryker   Finally Rejects the Deliverable). Such termination, together with the provisions of Section 5.2 of the License Agreement,   constitutes as Stryker's sole remedy and Conformis' exclusive liability in the event of any such rejection or failure by Conformis to   deliver materially conforming Deliverables hereunder so long as such rejection or failure does not arise from Conformis' fraud,   willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. Stryker shall be deemed to have accepted a Deliverable timely furnished to it   unless (a) the Deliverable fails to operate in accordance with and otherwise conform the applicable Acceptance Criteria, and (b)   Stryker provides Conformis a written Failure Notice within the Acceptance Notification Period in accordance with this Section   3.4 (any acceptance or deemed acceptance, described in this Section 3.4, Acceptance or Accept). Acceptance of a   Deliverable shall not constitute a waiver of any rights Stryker may have based on Conformis' warranties set forth in this   Agreement.   3.5 Payment for Milestones. Stryker shall pay to Conformis the following milestone payments for the development   work to be conducted hereunder if and when the following milestones are met, as follows:   (a) Milestone #1 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which Stryker receives the first prototype of the Patient-   Specific Instrumentation delivered to it by Conformis in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a   total of two million U.S. dollars ($2,000,000); and   10   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\n(b) Milestone #2 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which there is a design freeze of the Patient-Specific   Instrumentation for the KIB Product in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a total of three   million U.S dollars ($3,000,000).   3.6 Payment. Stryker shall make all payments to Conformis required herein by wire transfer in accordance with the Wire   Instructions.

Except as specifically provided in the Distribution Agreement, Conformis shall be prohibited from   developing or assisting another in developing, or causing another to develop, Patient-Specific Instrumentation for Off-The-Shelf   Knee Implants for any Third Party in the field of orthopedics until January 1, 2032 (or earlier, to the extent set forth in Section   2.3.3.4 or Section 2.3.5 of the Distribution Agreement), with the exception that Conformis (including any entity involved in a   Change of Control of Conformis, any such entity an Acquirer), may develop Patient-Specific Instrumentation for any Off-The-   Shelf Implants of Conformis, an Acquirer or any of their Affiliates. For purposes of clarity, the foregoing does not prevent   Conformis from granting any license, release, covenant not to sue or other immunity to any third party under any Patents, including   any such immunity that would authorize manufacture, use or sale of Patient-Specific Instrumentation for Off-The-Shelf Knee   Implants outside the Buyer Field.   ARTICLE V   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   5.1 Inventions.   (a) Inventorship of all Inventions developed by either Party, or both Parties, in the performance of the R&D Program, shall   be determined in accordance with the inventorship laws of the United States, even to the extent such Invention is not pursued in   patent applications.

(c) All right, title and interest in and to the Improved Conformis Background IP and KIB Product IP (Joint IP) shall be   owned jointly by the Parties. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Joint IP may be used freely by either Party or   its Affiliates and licensed to Third Parties by Conformis and its Affiliates, on the one hand, outside of the Buyer Field or by Stryker   and its Affiliates, on the other hand, within the Buyer Field, in each case, without the consent of, or duty to account to or notify, the   other Party, but, except with respect to external licenses of the Improved Conformis Background IP by Conformis or its Affiliates   to Third Parties, any external Third Party license shall be governed in accordance with the last sentence of Section 4.3(c) of the   APA. Each Party to whom ownership is to vest in Joint IP by operation of law or by assignment by its employees or Agents agrees   to assign and hereby assigns to the other Party an undivided one-half right, title and interest in and to all Joint IP; and to facilitate   such assignment, the Party possessing such ownership agrees (i) to regularly ensure that its employees and consultants timely make   any appropriate assignments to it; and (ii) at the other Party's reasonable request, to execute and have its employees and   consultants execute, as necessary, all assignments and any other documentation to perfect the undivided one-half right, title and   interest in and to the other Party of such Joint IP.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the foregoing does not constitute either (1) the grant by Conformis to Stryker   of any license or immunity of any kind with respect to the Conformis Background IP or Conformis Foreground IP, regardless of   the extent to which the Joint IP constitutes improvements to the Conformis Background IP or Conformis Foreground IP, (2) the   grant by Stryker to Conformis of any license or immunity of any kind with respect to the Stryker Background IP, or (3) the grant   by either Party of any license or immunity of any kind under any Intellectual Property rights owned by such Party, regardless of   whether the exploitation of the Joint IP would infringe such Intellectual Property rights. Neither Party shall assign a partial interest in   12   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nthe Joint IP or Joint IP Rights to any Affiliate or Third Party (i.e., neither Party shall create any additional joint owners of the Joint   IP), but each Party may assign all of its right, title and interest in and to the Joint IP and Joint IP Rights to an Affiliate or Third Party   pursuant to and in accordance with Section 10.2.   (e) Conformis shall promptly disclose to Stryker all (i) Improved Stryker Background IP, and (ii) Joint IP. Stryker shall   promptly disclose to Conformis all Joint IP.   (f) To the extent required and for the avoidance of doubt, Stryker hereby grants Conformis, and Conformis hereby   accepts, a non-exclusive license to the Stryker Background IP and Improved Stryker Background IP solely for purposes of   performing any obligations under this Agreement and the Distribution Agreement.   5.2 Confidential Information.

For new Products or Services added to the Global or Value Added Distributor Price List, including products or services which become available to Cisco as a result of an acquisition by Cisco of another entity, Cisco may impose certification, installation, or training requirements on Distributor prior to allowing Distributor to purchase, resell, or provide support for such Products or Services.\n\n3.4 Distributor agrees not to solicit orders for Products or Services, or to engage salespeople or establish warehouses or other distribution centers for the redistribution of Products or Services, outside the Territory, except to the extent advertising is placed in a particular advertising medium (except catalogs) which is distributed both inside and outside of the Territory.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\n3.5 Unauthorized Cisco Products. Distributor acknowledges that the purchase and Resale of Non-Genuine or Unauthorized Cisco Products are not within the scope of this Agreement and Integrator is not entitled to the rights granted herein with respect to the resale of such Non-Genuine or Unauthorized Cisco Products. For all Unauthorized Cisco Products, Cisco reserves the right to withhold any warranty or Cisco Support on such products, unless such products pass a Cisco equipment inspection and Cisco receives payment for the applicable equipment inspection and/or software license fees, as required in the then\u200b current Software Transfer and Licensing Policy. A printed copy of the Software Transfe and Licensing Policy, in effect on the Effective Date of this Agreement and available at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/csc/refurb_equipment/swpolicy.html, shall accompany this agreement. This policy is subject to change without notice. If Cisco determines that Reseller has Resold and/or redistributed Unauthorized Cisco Products purchased from Unauthorized Sources, then Cisco may, at Cisco's sole discretion: (a) audit Reseller's purchase and resale records of Cisco Product and relevant records pursuant to Section 17.0 (Reports and Records) and/or (b) invoice Reseller for all reasonable costs incurred by Cisco in its performance of the Audit and/or (c) suspend all Product shipments to Reseller.\n\n4.0 ORDERS. 4.1 Upon and subject to credit approval by Cisco at the time of Cisco's receipt of any Purchase Order, Distributor shall purchase or license Products or Services by issuing a Purchase Order, signed, if requested by Cisco, or (in the case of electronic transmission) sent by its authorized representative, indicating specific Products and Services, Cisco Product numbers, quantity, unit price, total purchase price, shipping instructions, requested shipping dates, bill-to and ship-to addresses, tax exempt certifications, if applicable and contract reference, if any. No contingency contained on any Purchase Order shall be binding upon Cisco. The terms of this Agreement shall apply, regardless of any additional or conflicting terms on any Purchase Order or other correspondence or documentation submitted by Distributor to Cisco, and any such additional or conflicting terms are deemed rejected by Cisco.\n\n4.2 Cisco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide order acknowledgement information within [*****] business days for all Purchase Orders placed on Cisco.com or within [*****] business days of Purchase Orders faxed or hand delivered to Cisco. Cisco Customer Service will review and accept or decline all Purchase Orders for the Cisco entity that will supply the Products or Services, and no other person is authorized to accept Purchase Orders on behalf of Cisco. Cisco Customer Service may accept a Purchase Order even if some of the information required by Section 4.1 above is missing or incomplete. In relation to Services, Cisco will confirm acceptance of a Purchase Order for Services by issuing a list of Products covered by such Services (the Equipment List).\n\n4.3 Distributor may defer Product shipment for up to [*****] from the original shipping date scheduled by Cisco, provided written or electronic notice (issued, in either case, by an authorized representative of Distributor) is received by Cisco at least [*****] days before the originally scheduled shipping date. Cancelled Purchase Orders, rescheduled shipments or Product configuration changes requested by Distributor less than [*****] days before the original scheduled shipping date shall be subject to (a) acceptance by Cisco, and (b) a charge of [*****] of the total invoice amount relating to the affected Products. Cisco reserves the right to reschedule shipment in cases of configuration changes requested by Distributor within [*****] days of scheduled shipment. No cancellation shall be accepted by Cisco where Products are purchased with implementation Services, including design, customization or installation Services, except as may be set forth in the agreement or Statement of Work under which the Services are to be rendered.\n\n5.0 SHIPPING AND DELIVERY 5.1 Scheduled shipping dates will be assigned by Cisco as close as practicable to the Distributor's requested date based on Cisco's then-current lead times for the Products. Cisco will communicate scheduled shipping dates in the order acknowledgement or on Cisco.com. Cisco will ship Product in compliance with Distributor Freight Policy set forth in Exhibit D. If no guidance is contained on Exhibit D for any particular shipment, Cisco shall select the carrier.\n\n5.2 For shipments to the United States, shipping terms are [*****], which shall appear on Cisco's order acknowledgement or be accessible via Cisco.com. Title and risk of loss shall pass from Cisco to Distributor [*****]. For orders placed and/or shipments to destinations outside of the United States but within the Territory (International Orders), Distributor may need to contract with, and/or order from, a Cisco affiliate. Different shipping terms may apply to International Orders, as Cisco shall specify at the time and as shall be recorded in Distributor's agreement with such Cisco affiliate or otherwise set out on Cisco.com.\n\n5.3 CISCO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR PENALTY FOR DELAY IN DELIVERY OR FOR FAILURE TO GIVE NOTICE OF ANY DELAY. EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE DELIVERY TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, CISCO SHALL NOT HAVE ANY\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nLIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH SHIPMENT, NOR SHALL THE CARRIER BE DEEMED TO BE AN AGENT OF CISCO.\n\n6.0 PAYMENT. 6.1 Prices for Products shall be those specified in Cisco's then-current Global or Value Added Distributor Price List. [*****] As provided in sub- section 3.2, in its discretion, Cisco may choose to make products or services which are on the Global Price List but not on the Value Added Distributor Price List available to Distributor. The prices for such products or services will be provided by Cisco to Distributor at the time Cisco makes such products available.\n\n6.2 Upon and subject to credit approval by Cisco, payment terms shall be [*****] days from shipping date. All payments shall be made in the currency in which the Price List is quoted for the applicable Purchase Order [*****].\n\n6.3 The purchase price does not include any federal, state or local taxes, or sales, use, excise, ad valorem, value-add, withholding or other taxes or duties that may be applicable to the purchase of Products. When Cisco has the legal obligation to collect such taxes, the appropriate amount shall be added to Distributor's invoice and paid by Distributor, unless Distributor provides Cisco with a valid tax exemption certificate prior to issuance of a purchase order. Such certificate must be in a form authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.\n\n6.4 Distributor is free to determine its minimum resale prices unilaterally. Distributor understands that neither Cisco nor any employee or representative of Cisco may give any special treatment (favorable or unfavorable) to Distributor as a result of Distributor's selection of minimum resale prices. No employee or representative of Cisco or anyone else has any authority to determine what Distributor's minimum resale prices for the Products must be, or to limit Distributor's pricing discretion with respect to the Products and Services.\n\n6.5 In the event any provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement between Distributor and Cisco require that Cisco grant credits to Distributor's account, Cisco will grant such credit to Distributor's account. [*****]. Cisco will only consider debit memos initially received from Distributor during the time period associated with such request, as set forth herein.\n\nAll debit memos Distributor submits to Cisco will be submitted using any method identified in 25.8, or as otherwise agreed between the parties.\n\n6.6 Except as stated in Sections 7 (Price Protection), 12 (Inventory Balance), 13 (Return of Obsolete Product), 18 (Term and Termination) or as otherwise stated herein, for all price adjustment related credits requested by the Distributor to be granted by Cisco, the\n\n6.7 Distributor must make the initial credit request to Cisco, in writing, within [*****] of the underlying point of sale transaction. Any initial credit requests submitted by the Distributor to Cisco greater than [*****] after the underlying point of sale transaction will not be honored by Cisco and Cisco will not grant such credit to Distributor.\n\n7.0 PRICE PROTECTION. 7.1 Definition: For purposes of this Section 7.0, Products In-Transit shall be defined as all Products with a particular Cisco part number shipped by Cisco to Distributor in the [*****] day period prior to the date on which Cisco announces a general price decrease for Products with such part number, excluding those Products which Distributor has received into its inventory during such [*****] day period.\n\n7.2 In the event Cisco puts into effect a general price decrease for any Product from the Value Added Distributor Price List, Cisco will provide to Distributor a price credit on any such Product on order, In Transit or in Distributor's inventory as of the effective date of the price decrease, provided that the price credit for such Product in inventory or In Transit shall not exceed the dollar value of shipments of that Product (measured by the appropriate Cisco product number) to Distributor over the preceding [*****]. Cisco will credit Distributor's account with an amount equal to the number of units of such Product in Distributor's inventory and In Transit on the effective date of a price decrease multiplied by the difference between the net price paid and the new net price. Distributor will have [*****] from the effective date of the price change to exercise protection under this program by issuing a request for credit memo with supporting documentation to Cisco. Claims for price protection submitted more than [*****] from the effective date of a price decrease will be rejected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Product on order will receive an automatic retroactive price credit. The only inventoried Product covered under this price protection clause is Product which has been identified by Distributor to Cisco in the daily inventory reports required in sub-sub-section 17.2.2, excluding any Third-Party\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nSourced Product. Cisco will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Distributor within [*****] of all such pricing changes.\n\n8.0 RESERVED\n\n9.0 PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND SOFTWARE LICENSING. 9.1 Distributor's use of Software is governed by the terms contained in Exhibit C (End User License Agreement (EULA)). For purposes of this Agreement, all references to Customer or You therein shall refer to Distributor.\n\n9.2 Distributor shall notify Cisco promptly of any breach or suspected breach of the EULA and further agrees that it will, at Cisco's request, assist Cisco in efforts to preserve Cisco's intellectual property rights including pursuing an action against any breaching third parties.\n\n10.

A transfer occurs when: (1) the original or authorized subsequent licensee tries to convey or reassign its right to use the Software to another entity, or (2) the original lessor of Cisco used hardware (including bundled Software) (Hardware) tries to reassign the original lessee's right to use the Software to another lessee, or the lessor tries to convey or reassign its right to lease the Hardware and Software bundle to another lessor. A rental would be treated the same as the lease situation as described in item 2 above.\n\nThis policy applies to all Software whether Standalone or Embedded. Standalone Software is Software which is not required to operate the Hardware upon which it resides (i.e., ICSG software such as call center, unified messaging, network management software). Embedded Software is Software which is incorporated into the Hardware and is required for its operation (i.e., operating system software, certain features of IOS).\n\nPolicy:\n\nCisco's policy is that Software, whether Standalone or Embedded, is not transferable, except where a listed exception below applies, and except, of course, where Cisco's contract expressly allows it. Any other transfers will require the payment of a new license fee (see Global Price List). For products where there is no separate line item for the Software (i.e. the prices for both the Hardware and Software are bundled), and therefore, a fee cannot be determined, an exception will be made to allow for the transfer without the customer being required to obtain a new license (the customer may be required to pay an inspection fee), if (A) Software to be transferred (i) will be under a support contract provided by either Cisco or a Cisco\u200b\u2010 authorized support partner or (ii) is still supported by Cisco; or (B) approval from the theatre Sales Controller has been obtained.\n\nUse of the Software will be governed by either the original license terms and conditions in place between Cisco and the original Software licensee or by the new license between Cisco and the new user. Cisco may withhold its consent to any transfer not conforming to this policy.\n\nLicense Fee:\n\nThe License Fee is generally the same amount as the fee charged for a new license or a portion of the fee of a new license, unless otherwise noted on the Global Price List.\n\nIt is the obligation of the transferor to obtain Cisco's consent and/or a new license before the transfer occurs.\n\nExceptions:\n\nProvided the conditions of transfer are met as set forth below, the follow exceptions apply to the prohibition against transfer without written approval and payment of the applicable fee. These exceptions may be overridden by express terms in an applicable licensing agreement governing the transferability of Special License Software (Special License Software is the term now used in our templates to refer to ICSG Product)\n\nAffiliate: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of Software to its Affiliate. An Affiliate is another entity where at least 50.1% of its voting power is owned or controlled by the transferring entity or where as least 50.1% of the transferring entity's voting power is owned or controlled by the transferee.\n\nMerger or Acquisition: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of Software to the purchaser of all or substantially all of the capital stock of the transferor or all or substantially all of the assets of that portion of the transferor's business to which those licenses pertain. Lease: In a leasing situation where the original lessee/customer would like to buy out the equipment from the leasing company during or at the end of the lease term, the original lessee/customer may retain the license without paying a new License Fee, provided leasing company gives Cisco prior written notice. Also, if the original lessee/customer defaults under the lease and the leasing company takes the equipment back before the end of the lease term, the leasing company may transfer the license to the another lessee for the remainder of the original lease term, without paying Cisco a License Fee, upon 30 days' prior written notice to Cisco, or as soon as practicable if the equipment is re-leased before such 30- day period. If the new lease term is in\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nexcess of the original lease term, the leasing company is expected to pay Cisco a new License Fee on or before the expiration date of the original lease term. [NOTE: In the situation where a leasing company leases Cisco equipment to Customer A for a specified term and at the end of the lease term, the leasing company desires to lease the same equipment to Customer B, leasing company may not transfer the license without obtaining a new license from Cisco.)].\n\nOutsource: Customer desires to outsource the operation, support and maintenance of its network to a third party (e.g. EDS) (Third-Party Service Provider), for the benefit of that customer.

These reasons may be due to market demands, technology innovation and development driving changes in the product, or the products simply mature over time and are replaced by functionally richer technology. While this is an established part of the overall product life cycle, Cisco Systems recognizes that end-of-life milestones often prompt companies to review the way in which such end-of-sale and end-of-life milestones impact the Cisco products in their networks. With that in mind, we have set out below Cisco's end-of-life policy to help customers better manage their end-of-life transition and to understand the role that Cisco can play in helping to migrate to alternative Cisco platforms and technology.\n\nThe End of Life Policy only applies to End of Life and End of Sale announcements made in all Theaters on or after November 30, 2002 for all Cisco product lines. The Policy does not apply to product that is already subject to an End of Life and/or End of Sale announcement. The general policy guidelines are:\n\n1. As a general rule, Cisco will provide 6 months' notice of the affected product's end-of-sale date and/or the last day when the affected product can be ordered. This notice will appear on Cisco.com site (http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_end_of_life.html) and we encourage you to visit this site regularly as it contains useful information regarding Cisco's end-of-life program. Sign up to receive notification here: http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Support/FieldNoticeTool/field-notice\n\n2. Access to Cisco's Technical Assistance Center (TAC) will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for a period of 5 years from the end-of-sale date for hardware and operating system software issues and for a period of 3 years from the end-of-sale date for application software issues.\n\n3. Spares or replacement parts for hardware will be available for a period of 5 years from the end-of\u200b sale date. We will provide spares and replacement parts in accordance with our Return Materials Authorization (RMA) process.\n\n4. Software support will be as follows\n\na. For the first year following the end-of-sale date, we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds, or patches for critical bugs reported via the TAC or Cisco.com Web site.\n\nb. After the first year and for Operating System SW -where available- we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds or patches for a period of 4 years for operating system software. Bear in mind that it may be necessary to use software upgrade release to correct a reported problem.\n\nc. After the first year and for Application SW -where available - we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds or patches for a period of 2 years for application software. Bear in mind that it may be necessary to use software upgrade release to correct a reported problem.\n\n5. You will need to ensure that you have a current and fully paid support contract with Cisco. Please contact your Support Account Manager regarding fees payable during the end-of-life period so that we can support you right through the end-of-life transition period.\n\n6. Below are guidelines that should be followed to ensure that you receive effective support for the affected products within your network:\n\na. For hardware or software that is not covered under a service contract, customers may add the product(s) to a current contract or purchase a new contract until 12 months after the end-of-sale date.\n\nb. Service contracts that have not been renewed or have lapsed after 12 months of end-of\u200b sale date are not re-newable.\n\nc. Renewal of your service contract will generally be available until the last year of support, but will not extend\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nbeyond the last date of support.\n\nThe end-of-life milestones and Cisco commitments are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

The end-of-life process consists of a series of technical and business milestones and activities that, once completed, make a product obsolete. Once obsolete, the product is not sold, manufactured, improved, repaired, maintained, or supported.\n\nEnd-of-sale date: The last date to order the product through Cisco point-of-sale mechanisms. The product is no longer for sale.\n\nHardware: The physical product and its physical components.\n\nOperating System Software: Cisco operating system software that runs on Cisco hardware Application software: Cisco software that requires the presence of some non-Cisco operating system software.\n\nSoftware Maintenance support: The time period that Cisco may release any software maintenance releases or bug fixes to the software product. After this date, Cisco Engineering will no longer develop, repair, maintain, or test the product software.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019", "output": "Highlight the parts (if any) of this contract related to Insurance that should be reviewed by a lawyer.

(the Agent), as follows:\n\n         Section 1. The  Offering.  In accordance  with the Stock  Issuance Plan adopted by its Board of Directors (the Plan),  the Company will offer and sell up to  1,101,643  shares of its common  stock,  par  value,  $.01 per share (the Shares or Common  Stock),  in a  subscription  offering  (the  Subscription Offering) to (1) depositors of the Bank with account balances of $50.00 or more as of September 30, 1998 (Eligible  Account  Holders),  (2) the Employee Stock Ownership Plan of the Bank (the ESOP), (3) depositors of the Bank with account balances  of $50.00 or more as of  December  31,  1999  (Supplemental  Eligible Account Holders), and (4) employees, officers and directors of the Bank. To the extent  Shares  remain  unsold in the  Subscription  Offering,  the  Company  is offering for sale in a community  offering  (the  Community  Offering and when referred to together  with the  Subscription  Offering,  the  Subscription  and Community  Offering)  the  Shares  not  so  subscribed  for or  ordered  in the Subscription Offering to members of the general public, with preference given to natural persons residing in the New Mexico counties of Otero and Lincoln\n\n(Other Subscribers),  (all such offerees being referred to in the aggregate as Eligible  Offerees).  It is anticipated  that shares not subscribed for in the Subscription  and Community  Offering will be offered to certain  members of the general  public on a best efforts basis through a selected  dealers  arrangement (the Syndicated  Community  Offering) (the  Subscription  Offering,  Community Offering and Syndicated  Community Offering are collectively  referred to as the Offering).  It is acknowledged  that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the Company and the Bank may  reject,  in whole or in part,  any orders received in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering.

All fees or  expenses  due to the Agent but  unpaid  will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing  Date (as  hereinafter  defined) or the End Date.

The release of Shares against payment therefor shall be made on a date and at a place  acceptable  to the  Company,  the MHC,  the Bank and the  Agent. Certificates  for  shares  shall be  delivered  directly  to the  purchasers  in accordance with their directions.  The date upon which the Company shall release or deliver the Shares sold in the Offering, in accordance with the terms herein, is called the Closing Date.\n\n         The Agent shall  receive the  following  compensation  for its services hereunder:\n\n                                        3\n\n          (a)  A  management  fee of $25,000,  payable in four  installments  of                $6,250 on  November 29 and  December  29, 1999 and January 29 and                February 29,  2000.

Fees with respect to purchases                affected with the  assistance of a  broker/dealer  other than the                Agent shall be  transmitted  by the Agent to such  broker/dealer.                The decision to utilize selected  broker-dealers  will be made by                the Bank upon  consultation  with the Agent.  In the event,  with                respect to any  purchases  of Shares,  fees are paid  pursuant to                this subparagraph 2(c), such fees shall be in lieu of, and not in                addition to, payment pursuant to subparagraph 2(a) and 2(b).\n\n          (d)  The Company  will bear those  expenses of the  proposed  offering                customarily  borne by  issuers,  including,  without  limitation,                regulatory   filing  fees,   Blue  Sky,  and  NASD  filing  and                registration  fees;  the  fees  of  the  Company's   accountants,                attorneys,  appraiser,  transfer agent and  registrar,  printing,                mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses  associated with the                Offering;  the fees set  forth in  Section  2; and fees for Blue                Sky legal work.  If the Agent  incurs  expenses on behalf of the                Company, the Company will reimburse the Agent for such expenses.\n\n               The  Agent  shall  be  reimbursed  for  reasonable  out-of-pocket                expenses,   including   costs  of  travel,   meals  and  lodging,                photocopying,  telephone, facsimile and couriers. The Agent shall                also  be  reimbursed  for  its  fees  of  underwriter's   counsel                (including  counsel's   out-of-pocket  expenses)  not  to  exceed                $35,000.

The discussion                of  statutes  or  regulations  described  or  referred  to in the                Prospectus   are  accurate   summaries  and  fairly  present  the                information   required  to  be  shown.  The  information  in  the                Prospectus relating to the tax consequences of the stock offering                has been  reviewed  by such  counsel  and  fairly  describes  the                opinions  rendered  by Luse Lehman  Gorman  Pomerenk & Schick and                _____________________  to the Company,  the MHC and the Bank with                respect to such matters.\n\n                    (xxiii) The  Company  and the MHC have been duly  registered                and are in good  standing as savings and loan  holding  companies                under the HOLA.\n\n                    (xxiv) In addition, such counsel shall state that during the                preparation of the MHC Application,  the  Registration  Statement                and the Prospectus, they participated in conferences with certain                officers of, the independent public and internal accountants for,                and other  representatives of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank,                at which  conferences  the contents of the MHC  Application,  the                Registration  Statement and the  Prospectus  and related  matters                were  discussed  and,  while such counsel have not  confirmed the                accuracy or completeness of or otherwise verified the information                contained in the MHC Application,  the Registration  Statement or                the  Prospectus,  and do not assume any  responsibility  for such                information,   based  upon  such  conferences  and  a  review  of                documents deemed relevant for the purpose of rendering their view                (relying as to materiality as to factual  matters on certificates                of officers and other factual representations by the Company, the                MHC and the Bank), nothing has come to their attention that would                lead them to believe that the MHC  Application,  the Registration                Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto                (other than the  financial  statements,  the notes  thereto,  and                other tabular, financial, statistical and appraisal data included                therein as to which no view need be rendered) contained an untrue                statement of a material  fact or omitted to state a material fact                required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements                therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under  which  they were                made, not misleading.\n\n         In giving such opinion, such counsel may rely as to all matters of fact on  certificates  of officers or directors of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank and certificates of public officials. The opinion of Luse Lehman Gorman Pomerenk & Schick  shall be  governed  by the  Legal  Opinion  Accord  (Accord)  of the American  Bar  Association  Section of  Business  Law (1991).  The term  Actual Knowledge  as used herein  shall have the meaning set forth in the Accord.  For purposes of such opinion, no proceedings shall be deemed to be pending, no order or stop order shall be deemed to be issued,  and no action shall be deemed to be instituted unless, in each case, a director or executive officer of the Company, the MHC or the Bank shall have received a copy of such\n\n                                       27\n\nproceedings,  order,  stop order or action.  In  addition,  such  opinion may be limited to present  statutes,  regulations and judicial  interpretations  and to\n\n\n\n\n\nfacts as they  presently  exist;  in rendering  such opinion,  such counsel need assume no  obligation  to revise or  supplement  it should the  present  laws be changed by legislative or regulatory action, judicial decision or otherwise; and such counsel need express no view, opinion or belief with respect to whether any proposed  or  pending  legislation,  if  enacted,  or any  proposed  or  pending regulations or policy statements issued by any regulatory agency, whether or not promulgated  pursuant to any such legislation,  would affect the validity of the Offering or any aspect  thereof.  Such counsel may assume that any  agreement is the valid and binding obligation of any parties to such agreement other than the Company, the MHC or the Bank.\n\n         The  favorable  opinion,  dated as of the Closing Date and addressed to the  Agent and for their  benefit,  of the  Bank's  local  counsel,  in form and substance to the effect that, to the best of such counsel's  knowledge,  (i) the Company,  the MHC and the Bank have good and marketable  title to all properties and assets which are  material to the  business of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank and to those properties and assets described in the Registration  Statement and  Prospectus,  as owned  by them,  free  and  clear  of all  liens,  charges, encumbrances or  restrictions,  except such as are described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, or are not material in relation to the business of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank  considered  as one  enterprise;  (ii) all of the leases and  subleases  material to the business of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank under which the Company, the MHC and the Bank hold properties, as described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus,  are in full force and effect; and (iii) the Bank is duly qualified as a foreign  corporation to transact  business and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or  leasing  of  property  or  the  conduct  of  its  business   requires   such qualification,  unless  the  failure to be so  qualified  in one or more of such jurisdictions  would  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the  condition, financial or otherwise, or the business, operations or income of the Bank.\n\n          (d)  At the Closing Date,  the Agent shall have received the favorable                opinion,  dated as of the  Closing  Date,  of Silver,  Freedman &                Taff, L.L.P.,  the Agent's counsel,  with respect to such matters                as the Agent may reasonably  require.  Such opinion may rely upon                the opinions of counsel to the Company, the MHC and the Bank, and                as  to  matters  of  fact,  upon  certificates  of  officers  and                directors of the Company, the MHC and the Bank delivered pursuant                hereto or as such counsel shall reasonably request.\n\n          (e)  At the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive a certificate of the                Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Principal  Financial  and/or                Accounting  Officer of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank in form                and substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to the Agent's  Counsel,                dated as of such Closing Date, to the effect that:  (i) they have                carefully  reviewed the Prospectus and, in their opinion,  at the                time  the  Prospectus   became  authorized  for  final  use,  the                Prospectus  did not  contain any untrue  statement  of a material                fact or omit to state a material fact  necessary in order to make                the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which                they were made, not misleading;

 (iv) the  representations  and warranties in Section 4                are true and  correct  with the same  force and  effect as though                expressly  made at and as of the Closing  Date;

An  indemnifying  party  may  participate  at its own                expense in the  defense of such  action.  In  addition,  if it so                elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice,  an                indemnifying party,  jointly with any other indemnifying  parties                receiving  such  notice,  may assume  defense of such action with                counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties that                are defendants in such action,  unless such  indemnified  parties                reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may                be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in                addition to those  available to such  indemnifying  party.  If an                indemnifying  party  assumes  the  defense  of such  action,  the                indemnifying  parties  shall  not be  liable  for  any  fees  and                expenses  of  counsel  for  the  indemnified   parties   incurred                thereafter in connection  with such action,  proceeding or claim,                other than reasonable costs\n\n                                       35\n\n               of investigation.  In no event shall the indemnifying  parties be                liable for the fees and expenses of more than one  separate  firm                of attorneys (and any special  counsel that said firm may retain)                for each  indemnified  party in  connection  with any one action,                proceeding  or claim or separate but similar or related  actions,                proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the                same general allegations or circumstances.\n\n          (d)  The  agreements  contained  in this  Section  8 and in  Section 9                hereof and the representations and warranties of the Company, the                MHC  and the  Bank  set  forth  in this  Agreement  shall  remain                operative  and in full  force and effect  regardless  of: (i) any                investigation  made by or on behalf  of agent or their  officers,                directors or controlling persons,  agent or employees or by or on                behalf  of the  Company,  the MHC or the  Bank  or any  officers,                directors  or  controlling  persons,  agent or  employees  of the                Company,  the  MHC or the  Bank;  (ii)  delivery  of and  payment                hereunder  for the  Shares;  or  (iii)  any  termination  of this\n\n\n\n\n\n               Agreement.\n\n         Section 9.  Contribution.  In order to provide  for just and  equitable contribution  in  circumstances  in which the  indemnification  provided  for in Section 8 is due in  accordance  with its terms but is for any reason  held by a court to be unavailable  from the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC,  the Bank and the Agent  shall  contribute  to the  aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation,  legal and other  expenses  incurred in connection  with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action,  suit or proceeding of any claims asserted,  but after deducting any  contribution  received by the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or the Agent from persons  other  than  the  other  party  thereto,  who may  also be  liable  for contribution)  in such  proportion  so that the  Agent is  responsible  for that portion  represented by the percentage  that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to  Section 2 of this  Agreement  (not  including  expenses)  bears to the gross proceeds  received by the Company  from the sale of the Shares in the  Offering, and the Company,  the MHC and the Bank shall be responsible for the balance. If, however,  the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified  party failed to give the notice required under Section 8 above, then each indemnifying  party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified  party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Company, the MHC and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,  claims,  damages or  liabilities  (or actions,  proceedings  or claims in respect  thereto),  but also the  relative  benefits  received  by the Company,  the MHC and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the  other  from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by  reference  to,  among other  things,  whether  the untrue or alleged  untrue statement  of a material  fact or the  omission  or alleged  omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the MHC and/or the Bank on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith,  knowledge,  access to  information  and  opportunity  to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if  contribution  pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other\n\n                                       36\n\nmethod  of   allocation   which  does  not  take  into  account  the   equitable considerations  referred to above in this  Section 9. The amount paid or payable by  an  indemnified  party  as a  result  of  the  losses,  claims,  damages  or liabilities (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereof)  referred to above in this  Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other  expenses reasonably  incurred by such indemnified party in connection with  investigating or defending any such action,  proceeding or claim. It is expressly  agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability,  claim, damage or expense or be required  to  contribute  any amount  which in the  aggregate  exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood  that the above stated  limitation on the Agent's  liability is essential  to the  Agent and that the Agent  would  not have  entered  into this Agreement  if such  limitation  had not been  agreed to by the  parties  to this Agreement.  No person found guilty of any fraudulent  misrepresentation  (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to  contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such  fraudulent  misrepresentation. The  obligations  of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank under this Section 9 and under Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability  which the Company and the Bank may  otherwise  have.  For purposes of this Section 9, each of the Agent's, the Company's,  the MHC or the Bank's officers and directors and each person, if any,  who  controls  the Agent or the  Company or the MHC or the Bank within the meaning  of the  1933  Act and the  1934 Act  shall  have  the  same  rights  to contribution as the Agent, the Company,  the MHC or the Bank. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit,  claim or  proceeding  against  such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this Section 9, will notify such party from whom  contribution may be sought,  but the omission to so notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other  obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 9.\n\n         Section 10. Survival of Agreements,  Representations  and  Indemnities. The respective  indemnities of the Company,  the MHC, the Bank and the Agent and the representations and warranties and other statements of the Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent set forth in or made  pursuant  to this  Agreement  shall remain in full force and effect,  regardless of any  termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any  investigation  made by or on behalf of the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or any  controlling  person referred to in Section 8 hereof,  and shall  survive the  issuance of the Shares,  and any  successor  or assign of the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC, the Bank, and any such  controlling person  shall  be  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  respective   agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.\n\n         Section 11.  Termination.  The Agent may  terminate  this  Agreement by giving  the  notice  indicated  below in this  Section 11 at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n          (a)  In the  event  the  Company  fails to sell the  required  minimum                number of the Shares by _________,  2000, and in accordance  with                the provisions of the Plan or as required by the MHC Regulations,                and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by                the Company to each person who has  subscribed for or ordered any                of the Shares the full amount which it may\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       37\n\n               have  received  from  such  person,  together  with  interest  as                provided in the Prospectus,  and no party to this Agreement shall                have any obligation to the other hereunder, except for payment by                the  Company,  the MHC and/or  the Bank as set forth in  Sections                2(a), 6, 8 and 9 hereof.\n\n          (b)  If any of the  conditions  specified  in Section 7 shall not have                been  fulfilled  when and as  required by this  Agreement  unless                waived in writing, or by the Closing Date, this Agreement and all                of the Agent's  obligations  hereunder  may be  cancelled  by the                Agent  by  notifying  the  Company,  the MHC and the Bank of such                cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to                the  Closing  Date,  and any such  cancellation  shall be without                liability  of any party to any other  party  except as  otherwise                provided in Sections 2(a), 6, 8 and 9 hereof.\n\n          (c)  If the Agent  elects to terminate  this  Agreement as provided in                this Section, the Company, the MHC and the Bank shall be notified                promptly by telephone or telegram, confirmed by letter.\n\n         The Company,  the MHC and the Bank may terminate  this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the  representations  and warranties or covenants  contained  in Section 5 and such  breach has not been cured after the Company,  the MHC and the Bank  have  provided  the  Agent  with  notice of such breach.\n\n         This Agreement may also be terminated by mutual written  consent of the parties hereto.\n\n         Section 12.

Detto shall contractually require its Third Parties to report any claim of damage or shortages for Qwik-Fix Pro shipped to them within thirty (30) days of the Third Parties receipt of such package (or the time required by applicable law, if longer).

Any such amended Quote request from Distributor shall again be subject to the  Accuray approval process set forth in this Section 2.3.2.     3\n\n\n\n\n\n     2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order,  which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the Purchase Order). Accuray shall either  accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of  such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall  be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized  representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the  terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be  bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.  The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address:     Accuray Incorporated  ATTN: Contracts Administration  1310 Chesapeake Terrace  Sunnyvale, CA 94089  Main: (408) 716-4600  Fax: (408) 789-4205  Email: Orders@accuray.com     2.3.4.

Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor  and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a  Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both  the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that  the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.     2.4.

For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months  prior to the expected shipment date.     3.7. Customer Complaints.

United States Laws. Distributor understands that, because it is distributing the Products and Services of Accuray, a  corporation subject to the laws of the United States of America, Distributor must, when carrying out its duties pursuant to  this Agreement, avoid violations of certain of such laws.

A party will not be held responsible for any activities of the other party or the other party's Sub-Distributors that may be  considered to be illegal. For example, neither party supports the practice of bribes or under-the-table payments. Each party  will ensure a like clause is included in each agreement it has with its Sub-Distributors, and monitor activities of its Sub- Distributors closely. In the event a party deems that its good-will has been or may potentially be affected by any such  illegal activity of the other party or the other party's Sub-Distributors, then such party reserves the right to terminate this  Agreement or any portion thereof that relates to or is materially affected by such illegal activity with no further liability to  the other party or the other party's Sub-Distributors. Such party assumes no liability for such illegal activity and the other  party hereby indemnifies and holds such party, its officers and assigns, harmless from any loss, damage and liability  arising from or in connection with such illegal activity.     3.12. Sales Targets. Distributor shall not be subject to any minimum purchase requirements, but shall agree to the annual sales targets set  forth in Schedule 2.5(d)(i)(2) of the Strategic Alliance Agreement and to using its customary standard sales processes, including,  without limitation, the MTA process, with respect to sales of Systems.     6\n\n\n\n\n\n     3.13. Affiliates; Distributors. Siemens shall cause any of its Affiliates or distributors purchasing Systems or Services pursuant to the terms  of this Agreement to agree to be bound by and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of the  Strategic Alliance Agreement related to or applicable to such purchase, unless such Affiliate or distributor is already party to a  distribution agreement for Products with Accuray.     4. DUTIES OF ACCURAY     4.1. Fulfillment and Shipment.     4.1.1. Fulfillment of Executed Purchase Orders. Accuray is responsible for ensuring that the Products supplied are of good quality as  further described below. Accuray will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Distributor or Customer, as  applicable, in a timely manner those Products and Services required to fill confirmed Purchase Orders received from  Distributor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.     4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor  shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor  may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's  reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray  shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra  insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the  need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray,  if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if  a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses  required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was  October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.     4.2. Product and Service Pricing. Accuray will provide its then current U.S. list pricing for its Products and Services to Siemens once per  year during the Term of this Agreement and any extension thereof, or upon request from Siemens. All prices will be stated in US  Dollars, unless another currency is agreed upon in writing by Accuray.     4.3. Product Specifications and Promotional Literature. Accuray will provide product specifications and promotional literature to Distributor  from time to time during the Term of this Agreement and any extension thereof. Distributor may use product specifications and  promotional literature in Distributor's dealings with Customers. Accuray may introduce changes and upgrades to the Products.  Accuray will use commercially reasonable efforts to give Distributor as much advance notice of upgrades as is feasible.     4.4. Regulatory Clearance. Accuray will be responsible for and will bear all expenses related to obtaining and maintaining any approvals,  permits and licenses required under any applicable law in order to sell, market and distribute the Products and Services to a  Customer in      7\n\n\n\n\n\n     connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, including any upgrades to or expanded usage of the Products;  provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor for the sales of  Systems specifically for the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to  such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with  Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will be  responsible for obtaining all such approvals, permits, and licenses for sales to such Customer. Distributor will provide any  assistance or documentation reasonably requested by Accuray and at Accuray's expenses to assist Accuray with its obligations  under this Section 4.4. Accuray will be registered as the sole owner of any rights, title and interest to any of the Products or Spare  Parts, as the case may be; provided, however, that should any applicable law or regulation require that Distributor alone be entitled  to such ownership rights, Distributor shall hold this approval as trustee for Accuray and hereby consents to transfer or sublicense  such approval to Accuray free of charge or to support Accuray in its efforts to re-obtain the approval for the benefit of Accuray or a  third party named by Accuray upon expiration or termination of this Agreement. Lists indicating, as of the Effective Date, (i) the  countries in which Accuray has obtained regulatory approvals for the Products and Services and (ii) the countries in which Accuray  has a direct presence or has a distributor for the sales of Systems specifically for such country are being delivered to Siemens  concurrently with the execution of this Agreement. Accuray shall provide to Siemens updates of such lists on a quarterly basis.     4.5. Import License. Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for  all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement;  provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the  sales of Systems in the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such  Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with  Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will obtain and  maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the Products and Services ordered by such Customer.     4.6. Warranty.     4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and  perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory  clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not  to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (Warranty Period). Installation of  the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's  acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray  does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation  (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall  Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation  thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor      8\n\n\n\n\n\n     shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any  software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or  representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE  FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND  REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES  ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.     4.6.2. Hardware and Software. If a Customer notifies Accuray in writing during the Warranty Period of a defect in a Product that  causes the Product to fail to conform to the foregoing warranty, Accuray shall at its option either repair or replace the non- conforming Product or, if in Accuray's opinion such repair or replacement is not commercially reasonable, Accuray shall  refund a pro-rated portion of the price paid by the Customer for such Product calculated based on a straight-line  depreciation over a 5-year period beginning on the date of delivery. This will be Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation  and such Customer's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective Products and parts.     4.6.3. Software and Bug Fixes. Notwithstanding Section 4.6.2, for a period of 10 years following Installation of a System, Accuray will  provide to Customer, without charge, Bug Fixes with respect to any software included in the System. This is Accuray's  sole and exclusive obligation and Customer's and Distributor's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective software.  By way of clarification, Accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such Bug Fixes available to Customer, and Accuray  shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the Customer and Accuray) for installation or implementation of such  Bug Fixes at the Customer's site. Bug Fix means an error correction or minor change in the existing software and/or  hardware configuration that is required in order to enable the existing software and/or hardware configuration to perform to  the existing functional specification(s).     4.6.4. Safety Updates. Notwithstanding Section 4.6.2 and any obligations according to law, for a period of 10 years following  Installation of a System, Accuray will provide to Customer, without charge, Safety Updates with respect to any hardware or  software included in the System. This is Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and Customer's and Distributor's sole  and exclusive remedy in relation to any Safety Update required to be provided by applicable law in the Customer's  jurisdiction. By way of clarification, Accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such Safety Update available to Customer,  and Accuray shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the Customer and Accuray) for installation or  implementation of such Safety Update at the Customer's site. Safety Update means an error correction or change in the  existing software and/or hardware configuration that is required for safety in order to enable the existing software and/or  hardware configuration to perform to the existing functional specification(s) in accordance with applicable law in the  Customer's jurisdiction.     4.6.5. Warranty Exclusions. All warranty replacement of Products and parts shall be limited to malfunctions which are due and  traceable to defects in original material or workmanship of Products. The warranties set forth in this Section 4.6 shall be  void      9\n\n\n\n\n\n     and of no further effect in the event of abuse, accident, alteration, misuse or neglect of Products, including but not limited  to user modification of the operating environment specified by Accuray and user modification of any software.     4.6.6. Warranty Basis. Any limitation of liability under any warranty contained herein shall be an integral part of such warranty,  which limits its scope (Section 444, second alternative German Civil Code shall not apply). Any limitation of liability for any  defects contained herein shall be void insofar as Accuray has intentionally failed to disclose such defect.     4.7. Installation. Unless otherwise agreed by Accuray and Distributor (including, without limitation, pursuant to the terms of any  distribution agreement entered into pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement), Accuray shall be responsible for  installation of Accuray Products at Customer sites.     4.8. Service Agreements. Accuray will provide its then current Service Agreements to Distributor from time to time during the Term of this  Agreement and any extension thereof, or upon request from Distributor. All prices will be stated in US Dollars, unless another  currency is agreed upon in writing by Accuray. Such Service Agreements are to be offered to the Customer on the terms as set forth  in those agreements, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of Accuray. Accuray shall execute a  Service Agreement with the Customer upon receipt of (i) a copy of such Service Agreement executed by the Customer, and (ii) any  payments then due under such Service Agreement; provided, however, that Accuray shall have no obligation to enter into such  Service Agreement if it materially deviates from the form Service Agreement provided to Distributor; provided, further, that if  Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor for the sales of Systems specifically for the  country in which the Customer requests Services, as a condition to any sale of Services to such Customer, Accuray may require  Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the  Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor may (at its sole discretion) enter into such Service  Agreement with such Customer and will provide directly to such Customer the Services required to be performed under such Service  Agreement. If Accuray enters into such Service Agreement with such Customer, Accuray will be responsible for and will provide to  such Customer (either directly or through one or more of its distributors) the services required to be performed under such Service  Agreement.     4.9. Customer Training. If training of Customer's personnel is included in a Purchase Order confirmed by Accuray, Accuray will provide  such training in accordance with Accuray's then current training offerings and will coordinate with the Customer in order to provide  such training at Accuray's facility in Sunnyvale, California (or such other facility as may be agreed upon by Customer and  Accuray). For the purposes of such training, Accuray will be responsible for the travel and accommodation expenses of its  personnel, while Customer shall be responsible for the travel and accommodation expenses of its personnel. All Customer training  provided by Accuray will be conducted in English and, to the extent a Customer or its personnel do not have adequate English  language reading and comprehension skills, Accuray will provide an interpreter and translation services sufficient to enable the  Customer and its personnel to meaningfully and effectively participate in Accuray training courses.     10\n\n      4.10. Customer Support. Unless otherwise agreed by Accuray and Distributor (including, without limitation, pursuant to the terms of any  distributorship agreement entered into pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement), Accuray will provide guidance  to billing and reimbursement personnel of each Customer regarding regulatory and billing requirements and reimbursement for  treatment provided with Products under radiosurgery reimbursement codes. Accuray will coordinate and assist the Customer with  room evaluation, architecture support and quality assurance issues in relation to Customer installation sites.     4.11. Additional Support and Training. Accuray will provide additional service, support, or training in relation to Products or Services at  Customer's request, to be ordered separately and directly from Accuray, and priced on a time and materials basis according to  Accuray's then current price lists.     4.12. Distributor Personnel Sales Training. Accuray shall provide training of Distributor's sales personnel responsible for sales of Products  and Services to Distributor free of charge. Such training shall be at the times, in such locations, and in the scope agreed upon by  Distributor and Accuray in good faith; provided, however, that such training shall be provided to such Distributor personnel in  each Accuray Region at least once per year. Each party shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including travel and lodging,  incurred by it or its personnel to attend or provide such training. Accuray will provide additional training to Distributor's personnel  as may be reasonably requested by Distributor on a time and materials basis according to Accuray's then current price lists.     4.13. Support of Distributor's Efforts. Accuray shall, at its own expense:     4.13.1. assign a dedicated marketing point of contact for Distributor's marketing and sales personnel, which employee may be based  at any of Distributor's facilities as requested by the Steering Committee; and     4.13.2. provide global sales and marketing support, including support for individual sales opportunities, to Distributor; provided,  however, that the scope, duration, location, availability, and timing of such support shall be subject to commercially  reasonable limits and shall be determined pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(iii) of the Strategic Alliance Agreement.     4.14. Compliance with Laws. Accuray will be responsible for complying with (i) applicable U.S. laws, (ii) where Products are being shipped  to Distributor and unless otherwise agreed by Accuray and Distributor, applicable laws, codes, registrations, regulations, and  ordinances related to the export of the Products to Distributor, and (iii) any other applicable laws as they pertain to the Products, the  regulatory clearance, and safety in accordance with Accuray's written Specifications for the intended use. In addition, Accuray  shall be responsible for compliance with any applicable law, code, registration, regulation, and ordinance related to the export of the  Products or Services to Customer and/or Distributor, if any (the Export Regulations), and Accuray shall be liable for any expenses  and/or damages incurred by Distributor due to any non-compliance with such Export Regulations by Accuray (unless Accuray is  not responsible for such non-compliance). Accuray shall advise Distributor in writing within two weeks of the confirmation of the  Purchase Order of any information or data required by Accuray to comply with an Export Regulation, including without limitation:\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) All applicable export list numbers, including the Export Control      11\n\n\n\n\n\n     Classification Number according to the U.S. Commerce Control List (ECCN);     (b) The statistical commodity code according to the current commodity classification for foreign trade statistics and the  HS (Harmonized System) coding;     (c) The country of origin (non-preferential origin); and     (d) Accuray's declaration of preferential origin (in case of European suppliers) or preferential certificates (in case of  non-European suppliers).     4.15.

Distributor shall pay the prices listed in the applicable Purchase Order (unless prior written approval by Accuray for  application of an earlier price list is obtained) for the Products, including any Spare Parts, less any applicable discounts as  specified in Exhibit A hereto. Distributor shall receive a commission in the amount specified in Exhibit A hereto for any  Service Agreement entered into by Accuray with Customer pursuant to Section 4.8.     5.2.2. All costs of delivering the Products to the Distributor or Customer (including, but not limited to, costs for land, air and/or  ocean freight, insurance, port, customs and forwarding fees, if any), as well as any rigging and unloading of the Products,  shall be paid as provided in the F.C.A. terms. Unless advised otherwise, all prices quoted by Accuray include the cost of  packing and crating for delivery.     5.2.3. Taxes. By way of clarification, all Accuray prices referenced in this Agreement, and all other amounts payable by Distributor to Accuray pursuant to this Agreement are net of any value added tax or federal, state, county or municipal sales or use tax,  excise or similar charge, withholding tax, or other tax assessment (except for any taxes that are assessed against income)  (collectively, the Taxes). The parties agree that it is their intention that Accuray will not bear any economic burden  relating to the Taxes. Subject to the foregoing and to compliance with applicable laws, Accuray and Distributor agree to  cooperate with each other as reasonably requested to establish the responsibilities of the parties relating to the payment  and withholding of Taxes, filing of documents, and other matters in order to achieve an efficient tax result.     5.3. Compensation. Except as otherwise provided herein, Distributor's only compensation for its efforts on Accuray's behalf shall be the  margins it earns on the resale of Products and      12\n\n\n\n\n\n     commissions on sales of Services, and Distributor shall bear all of the expenses which it incurs in making those efforts.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Accuray does not approve the issuance of a Quote to a potential Customer and  later contracts directly (or through one of its distributors) with such potential Customer, of which Accuray shall inform Distributor  without undue delay, Distributor shall receive credit for any sales of Systems to such potential Customer pursuant to and subject to  the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Section 3.4 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement.     5.4.

Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed  by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably  undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by  applicable law. If Distributor is a business person (as defined in \u00a7 14 of the German Civil Code, BGB), the payment shall  be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes  due.     5.4.1.1. Letter of Credit. An irrevocable trade finance letter of credit issued by Distributor's bank, confirmed by a bank  designated by Accuray in all respects and delivered to Accuray upon the acceptance of the Purchase Order  by Accuray.

US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied  to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase  Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment  date; and     5.4.1.1.2. Balance upon presentation of documents by Accuray evidencing shipment of the Products to  Distributor or Customer as designated in the Purchase Order.     5.4.1.2. Wire Transfer. A wire transfer made in advance of the date payment is due, made in U.S. dollars, to a bank selected  by Accuray, according to the following schedule:     5.4.1.2.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied  to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase  Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment  date; and     13\n\n\n\n\n\n     5.4.1.2.2. The remaining balance is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location  pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice.     5.4.1.3. Tax Exempt Status. In the event that Customer claims tax exempt status in the country where the Accuray System is  to be installed, Customer must provide Accuray with sufficient evidence of such tax exempt status prior to  delivery of the Accuray System.     5.4.2. Products, Spare Parts and Upgrade Payments.

Should Customers make such payments to Accuray and  such payment include the Distributor's margin, then Accuray will pay such margin to Distributor once payment is received  from the Customer and cleared by Accuray's designated bank.     5.5. Collections. Notwithstanding Section 5.4.3 above, Distributor shall be solely responsible for determining the creditworthiness of and  collecting payment from its Customers. The risk of non-collection from the Customer will be borne entirely by Distributor, which  shall be responsible for making timely payment to Accuray for Products whether or not Distributor is successful in collecting from  its Customer. In the event that full payment is not received by Accuray, Accuray shall not be liable to Distributor for any margin or  commission unless and until it has received payment of amounts sufficient to cover the costs incurred by Accuray to provide the  applicable Products to Distributor and the applicable Services to Customer (Accuray Cost). Distributor acknowledges and agrees  that it shall not be entitled to receive payment of any margin or commission until Accuray has received payment of the Accuray  Cost amount in relation to the applicable Products and Services.     6.

Accuray and Distributor agree that all Confidential Information furnished to a party or its Affiliates, employees,  consultants, and advisors in connection with this Agreement will      15\n\n\n\n\n\n     be subject to and the parties' rights and obligations with respect to such Confidential Information shall be governed by the Confidentiality  Agreement.     9. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.     9.1. Notice of Infringement. Distributor undertakes to inform Accuray without undue delay if it first becomes aware of any possible  infringement by third parties of Accuray's proprietary rights, including, without limitation, a duplication of the Products or any other  patent, trademark or copyright or other infringement of Accuray's intellectual property rights in connection with the Products, and  to cooperate with Accuray at Accuray's sole expense regarding any legal action in relation to such infringement, which in  Accuray's judgment, is necessary or desirable.     9.2. Third Party Claims. If Distributor promptly notifies Accuray of a claim it has received or of which it becomes aware that the Products or  any part thereof purchased by Distributor hereunder infringes a third party's proprietary rights, then Accuray agrees, at its  discretion, either to (i) defend the claim at its expense, with the cooperation of Distributor, provided, that Accuray shall reimburse  Distributor for any reasonable costs or expenses actually incurred by Distributor in connection with providing such cooperation, or  (ii) make changes in the Product or part thereof so that they are at least functionally equivalent and non-infringing or replace the  Products with alternatives that are at least functionally equivalent to avoid the claim, or (iii) purchase the right to use such  proprietary right or (iv) refund to the purchaser the net book value of the Product less a reasonable deduction for use, wear and tear,  and depreciation upon Accuray taking possession of such Product. Notwithstanding Section 10.1, the foregoing states the entire  liability of Accuray with respect to infringement of patents or other proprietary rights by the Products or part thereof, or by their  operation.

This document  lists the minimum requirements for suppliers of Siemens Medical Solutions describing  \u00b7 how parts, components and systems are identified with their attributes and  \u00b7 how attributes are labeled both as plain text as well as barcode on products and its packaging. Detailed specifications with regards to the labeling  of products are defined for the individual product concerned.     2 Definitions and abbreviations      2.1 Material No.     The Siemens Medical Solutions Material No. is used to uniquely identify products (parts, components and systems). It consists of an 8-digit  identification no. assigned by Siemens Medical Solutions.     Previously, the term Part no. was also used; it is replaced by the term Material No..      2.2 Revision     The Revision (abbreviated Rev.) serves to distinguish between different update statuses of hardware. It is assigned by Siemens Medical  Solutions.     The English term Revision replaces the German term Erzeugnisstand (abbreviated ES) and Ausf\u00fchrungsstand (abbreviated AS).     2.3 Serial No.     The Serial No. is an identifying attribute used to uniquely identify hardware or software with the same Material No. .     For suppliers the Serial No. can consist of up to 15 alphanumeric digits; it is however recommended to use only a 6 digit numerical Serial No. where  possible.     The Serial No. may contain a dash (-) or a slash (/), but no other special characters (e.g. # + * ?). Spaces, lower-case letters or language-specific  characters (e.g. \u00c4, \u00d6, \u00dc) are not allowed within the Serial No. .     The characters L, SxxL or Sxx at the end or the beginning of the Serial No. should be avoided (xx = any alphanumerical character).     For any Serial No. that is numeric only (i.e. has no letters) it is allowed to omit printing of leading zeros (\u201e0).     It is recommended to use the Serial No. of the supplier if it complies with the principles described above.     2.4 Data Identifier     Data Identifiers are used in the barcode to indicate that the information following the Data Identifier is data of a certain attribute. The Data  Identifier enables the barcode reading program to recognize that the following information represents a certain type of attribute.     Data Identifiers to be used:\n\n   3\n\n1P    Material No.   2P   Revision (for packaging only)  S    Serial No.   Q   Quantity (for packaging only)  14D    Expiration date (for packaging only)   T   Batch (for packaging only)\n\n\n\n\n\n     2.5 Expiration date     The format of the expiration date shall be definite and specified as follows: YYYYMMDD     2.6 Batch     The batch is an alphanumeric ident number with 10 digits, used to identify parts manufactured or shipped together. Is no batch provided on the  packing but required, a batch is initiated in the stock.     2.7 Shelf life     If a shelf life is defined for parts the shelf life has to be filed in calendar days. (365 days per year)     3 Reference documents     n.a.     4 Requirements     4.1 Identification of parts, components and systems     Non-serialized parts (including spare parts) and components are identified using a Material No. . If necessary, different statuses of a part,  component or system can be distinguished via the Revision.     Serialized parts, components and systems are identified using the combination of Material No. and Serial No. . In addition, the Revision may be  used to distinguish between different statuses of hardware.     4.2 Labeling of parts, components, systems and its packaging     In general, requirements with respect to labeling have to be defined for the product concerned. However, minimum requirements are specified in  order to allow proper identification throughout all processes involved. This chapter lists those minimum requirements.     For all material numbers specified by Siemens the parts and its packaging have to be labeled according to the requirements listed below.

Effective Date and Term\n\n2.1 This Agreement is effective June 11, 2015 (the Effective Date). The Agreement shall continue through the project's in-service date and for a period of fifteen (15) years after the project's in-service date (Initial Term). MPL shall provide written notice to Shipper\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nconfirming the project's in-service date. Shipper acknowledges that the overall Project will be completed in several phases. New infrastructure will be completed first, with additional build-out projects and expansions completed in succession. MPL will provide a thirty (30) day notice to Shipper, notifying it of the actual in-service date for the included projects.\n\n2.2 This Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties under the same conditions and provisions for a time period commencing on the Effective Date and shall continue through the Initial Term. This Agreement will automatically renew for up to two (2) renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, an Extension Period) unless either Party provides the other Party with written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement at least six (6) months prior to the end of the Initial Term or the then current Extension Period. The Initial Term and Extension Period, if any, shall be referred to in this Agreement as the Term.\n\n2.3 In the event Shipper does not wish to renew after the Initial Term or Extension Period or chooses to terminate the Agreement by written notice pursuant to Section 2.2, MPL reserves the option and right to hold a subsequent open season in which interested shippers can have opportunity to contract for resulting available volume, rate, and terms.\n\n3. Volume Commitment and Quarterly Deficiency Charges\n\n3.1 Shipper guarantees that during each Contract Year, Shipper will meet its Quarterly Volume Commitment or, in the event it fails to do so, shall remit to MPL the Quarterly Deficiency Payment pursuant to Section 3.5. All volumes moved by Shipper on the Pipeline will be subject to the applicable Tariff Rates and proration policies, as may be amended from time to time in accordance with FERC methodologies and as provided herein.\n\n3.2 Shipper will have the opportunity to fulfill its Quarterly Volume Commitment on a calendar quarter basis for condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent service. These three Products are interchangeable from a volume commitment standpoint and shipping a total volume of any one or combination of these Products will be applied towards the Quarterly Volume Commitment. Should MPL proceed with butane service, Shipper will also have the opportunity to fulfill its Quarterly Volume Commitment on a calendar quarter basis for butane service, separate from condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent service.\n\n3.3 Shipper shall be deemed to have shipped its Quarterly Volume Commitment on the Pipeline if the quantity of Product that Shipper ships on the Pipeline in any Quarter equals at least the Quarterly Volume Commitment for such Quarter.\n\n3.4 Shipper agrees to pay MPL monthly: (a) the Tariff Rates in effect for all Shipper Deliveries transported by MPL on the Pipeline during such month; and (b) any loading, handling, transfer and other charges incurred with respect to such Shipper Deliveries for such month in accordance with the provisions as set forth in the Tariffs (or any other tariffs that may be applicable to such Shipper Deliveries). If the amount owed by Shipper is the subject of a good faith dispute, Shipper shall be obligated to pay only the undisputed portion of such amount pending the resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Agreement. Late payments of undisputed amounts shall accrue interest at a rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum, until paid. Such payments will be paid by Shipper to MPL within fifteen (15) Days of the invoice date or resolution of any dispute, if applicable.\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Subject to the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement, if the volume of each Product shipped by Shipper on the Pipeline during the Quarter is less than the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment for that Product then, in addition to paying any amounts incurred by Shipper pursuant to Section 3.4 with respect to Shipper Deliveries for such Quarter, Shipper shall also pay MPL a deficiency payment (the Quarterly Deficiency Payment); equal to the product of:\n\n(a) the difference between the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment for that Product for such Quarter and the volume of Shipper Deliveries of that Product on the Pipeline for such Quarter (the Deficiency Volume); and\n\n(b) the applicable Tariff Rate for that Product for such Quarter.\n\nEach Product to which the Shipper is obligated to move as part of its committed volumes will be added together for one total Quarterly Deficiency Payment.\n\nShipper's transportation of commodities outside this Agreement's definition of Product will not satisfy the obligation to move committed Product volume. All Product barrels moved by Shipper in excess of its Quarterly Volume Commitment will be attributed to Shipper's movements on the Pipeline as a Regular Shipper, subject to the applicable Rules & Regulations of the Tariff.\n\n3.6 The dollar amount of any Quarterly Deficiency Payment paid by Shipper shall constitute prepayment for transportation of Product by Shipper on the Pipeline and will posted as a credit (Prepaid Transportation Credits) to Shipper's account for that type of Product. If, during any Quarter of the Contract Year, Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline exceed the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment requirements, Shipper shall be permitted to apply Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amount due from Shipper and payable to MPL with respect to the transportation of volumes on the Pipeline for such Quarter. Any Prepaid Transportation Credits that are not used by Shipper during the four (4) Quarters immediately following the Quarter for which said Prepaid Transportation Credits were posted to Shipper's account (the Credit Period) will expire. Those Prepaid Transportation Credits that are in payment dispute in accordance with Section 3.4, shall be posted as a credit on the date the payment dispute is resolved. If during any such four (4) Quarter period the nominated volume on the Pipeline for any month equals or exceeds the applicable portion in the Quarterly Volume Commitment for the Pipeline for such month (the Monthly Commitment), but Shipper is prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the Monthly Commitment because of lack of available capacity, either because (a) the Pipeline is in allocation and Shipper is specifically subject to allocation per Exhibit C, (b) the Pipeline is undergoing testing, maintenance or repair, or (c) a Force Majeure has occurred that prevents MPL from transporting Shipper volumes on the Pipeline in excess of the Monthly Commitment, then the Credit Period shall be extended by an equivalent time period for which Shipper has been prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the Monthly Commitment. For the purposes of this Section 3.6, during the Term, if the Pipeline is in allocation for any portion of the month, the Pipeline will be considered to be in allocation for the entirety of such month.\n\n3.7 Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.5 to the contrary, upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason to the extent that Shipper, at the time of such expiration or termination, holds any unused Prepaid Transportation Credits, Shipper shall be permitted to apply such Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amounts incurred by Shipper and\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\npayable to MPL with respect to any Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline until the expiration of the applicable Credit Period with respect to such Prepaid Transportation Credits. This Section 3.7 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n3.8 Shipper may not apply Prepaid Transportation Credits on differing types of Products; i.e, a Shipper may not use Prepaid Transportation Credits received for butane service on condensate, natural gasoline, or diluent service, or vice versa. Condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent are interchangeable from a volume commitment standpoint and shipping a total volume of any one or combination of these Products will be applied towards the Quarterly Volume Commitment. Should MPL proceed with butane service, Shipper will also have the opportunity to fulfill its Quarterly Volume Commitment on a calendar quarter basis for butane service, separate from condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent service.\n\n3.9 If, following the binding open season and prior to the in-service date of the Tariff, MPL determines that it has available capacity not subscribed to during the binding open season, not to exceed 90% of Project Capacity (Unsubscribed Capacity), to the extent permitted by Governmental Authority; MPL will provide Shipper the right to increase its Quarterly Volume Commitment as submitted on its Capacity Request Form on Exhibit C. MPL will provide at least sixty (60) days' advance written notice, simultaneously, to all shippers (including Shipper) who have executed a transportation service agreement during the binding open season of the availability and volume of Unsubscribed Capacity for additional volume commitments (the Additional Volume Commitments). No later than thirty (30) days following the date of MPL's written notice, Shipper must provide MPL with a written binding commitment identifying the additional volumes to be added to its Quarterly Volume Commitment (Pre-Service Increase Request). In the event MPL receives Pre-Service Increase Requests that are, in aggregate, less than or equal to the Unsubscribed Capacity, each shipper's volume commitment shall be increased by the volume of its Pre-Service Increase Request. In the event MPL receives Pre-Service Increase Requests that would, in aggregate, exceed the Unsubscribed Capacity, all Shippers will be allocated their Pre-Service Increases pro rata based on their then- current volume commitments. If Shipper makes a Pre-Service Increase Request, MPL shall notify Shipper of its new Quarterly Volume Commitment within thirty (30) days following receipt of Shipper's Pre-Service Increase Request, and Exhibit C shall be deemed revised to reflect Shipper's new volume commitment, which shall equal the sum of its original Capacity Request Form volume commitment and its Pre-Service Increase Request or its allocated portion thereof pursuant to this Section 3.9. If there is still Unsubscribed Capacity after shippers (including Shipper) exercise Additional Volume Commitments as set forth above, MPL may conduct a second open season to obtain additional volume commitments for any remaining Unsubscribed Capacity.\n\n4. Transportation Charges\n\n4.1 Shipper shall pay MPL a transportation charge for each Barrel of Product shipped under the terms of this Agreement and Exhibit C, at the rates provided for in Exhibit B, which shall be the Tariff Rates for the volume commitment on the Day of delivery of Product.\n\n4.2 The rates in Exhibit B will be adjusted annually in accordance with the standard FERC annual oil pipeline indexing methodology in effect at the time of the escalation. There shall be no downward adjustment of the Rates in the event the annual FERC oil pipeline index rate is negative. Rates will typically be indexed during July of each year and would be first indexed in July of the year following project completion.\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 If during the term of this Agreement, MPL becomes obligated as a result of a Change in Law Event to bear Compliance Costs, MPL shall have the right to increase the Tariff Rates on the Pipeline, including Shipper's committed rate as originally executed on Exhibit B in this Agreement or to impose a surcharge on its shippers (including Shipper) to recover such Compliance Costs. If MPL determines to recover any Compliance Costs from its shippers, it will do so in a manner that is reasonable and equitable to all shippers on the Pipeline.\n\n4.4 A Committed Priority Shipper will receive transportation service exempt from prorationing provisions under normal operating conditions for its contractually committed volumes, in exchange for a commitment to transport (or pay for) those volumes, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement executed during the open season process. The rates vary depending upon project options, but in all instances will be $0.01 per barrel above the rates for uncommitted service for the same origin and destination points. A Committed Priority Shipper will have the same rates as the Committed Non-Priority Shipper (as defined below), unless the system in under prorationing. When under prorationing, the Committed Priority Shipper's rate will be charged the premium rate of $0.01 above the posted uncommitted rate. Shipper shall not be a Committed Priority Shipper solely through this Agreement. Shipper must submit a Capacity Request Form during MPL's binding open season (Exhibit C) which confirms the Shipper has elected Committed Priority Shipper Status.\n\n4.5 A Committed Non-Priority Shipper will receive transportation service subject to prorationing provisions for its contractually committed volumes, in exchange for a commitment to transport (or pay for) those volumes, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement executed during the open season process. Those who elect to become a Committed Non-Priority Shipper will receive the benefit of discounted rates that will not be available to the Committed Priority Shippers or the uncommitted shippers. The rates will vary depending upon project options and commitment duration. MPL will not presume Shipper to be a Committed Non-Priority Shipper solely through this Agreement, unless the Capacity Request Form submitted by Shipper during MPL's binding open season (Exhibit C) shows the Shipper has elected Committed Non-Priority Shipper Status.\n\n5. Force Majeure\n\n5.1 As soon as possible upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure event, the affected Party shall provide the other Party written notice of the occurrence of such Force Majeure event (a Force Majeure Notice). A Party shall identify the full particulars and the approximate length of time that the Party reasonably believes in good faith such Force Majeure event shall continue (the Force Majeure Period). If a Party advises in any Force Majeure Notice that it reasonably believes in good faith that the Force Majeure Period shall continue for more than twelve (12) consecutive months, then, subject to Section 10 below, at any time after a Party delivers such Force Majeure Notice, either Party may terminate this Agreement, but only upon delivery to the other Party of a notice (a Termination Notice) at least twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the Force Majeure Period; provided, however, that such Termination Notice shall be deemed canceled and of no effect if the Force Majeure Period ends prior to the expiration of such twelve (12) months period. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Party may exercise its right under this Section 5.1 to terminate this Agreement as a result of a Force Majeure event with respect to any machinery, storage, tanks, lines of pipe or other equipment that has been unaffected by, or has been restored to working order since, the applicable Force Majeure event.\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Shipper delivers a Termination Notice to MPL and, within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice, MPL notifies Shipper that MPL reasonably believes in good faith that it shall be capable of fully performing under its obligations under this Agreement within a reasonable period of time, then the Shipper Termination Notice shall be deemed revoked and the applicable portion of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such Shipper Termination Notice had never been given.\n\n5.3 Subject to Section 6 of this Agreement, MPL's obligation to transport on the Pipeline may be temporarily suspended during occurrences of, and for the entire duration of, a Force Majeure event that prevents MPL from transporting on the Pipeline. If MPL is unable to transport due to a Force Majeure event or otherwise, then Shipper's obligation to ship the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment and pay the applicable Quarterly Deficiency Payment shall be reduced to the extent that MPL is prevented from shipping the full applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment. At such time as MPL is capable of transporting volumes equal to the full applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment on the Pipeline, Shipper's obligation to ship the full Quarterly Volume Commitment shall be restored.\n\n6. Capabilities of the Pipeline System\n\n6.1 MPL shall use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize the disruption of service on the Pipeline and any portion thereof. MPL shall promptly inform Shipper of any anticipated partial or complete disruption of service on the Pipeline, including relevant information about the nature, extent, cause and expected duration of the disruption and the actions MPL is taking to resume full operations, provided that MPL shall not have any liability for any failure to notify, or delay in notifying, Shipper of any such matters except to the extent Shipper has been materially prejudiced or damaged by such failure or delay.\n\n6.2 Subject to Force Majeure, disruptions for routine repair and maintenance consistent with pipeline industry standards and any requirements of Applicable Law, MPL shall accept for shipment on the Pipeline in accordance with pipeline industry standard Product. Further, MPL shall maintain and repair all portions of the Pipeline in accordance with pipeline industry standards and in a manner which allows the Pipeline to be capable, subject to Force Majeure or temporary shutdown for pipeline testing and maintenance, of shipping, storing and delivering volumes of Product.\n\n6.3 If the Shipper has agreed to pay, pursuant to Exhibit B and Exhibit C, a premium rate for transportation of Product on the Pipeline, the Shipper Deliveries shall not be reduced under normal operating conditions if the capacity for Product shipments is otherwise subject to prorationing in accordance with the prorationing provisions in MPL's Rules and Regulations Tariff.\n\n6.4 If, for any reason, including without limitation a Force Majeure event, the capacity of the Pipeline is reduced, then (a) during such period of reduced capacity, Shipper's obligation shall be reduced as described above in this Section 6; and (b) within a reasonable period of time after commencement of such reduction, MPL shall make repairs to and/or replace the affected portion of the Pipeline to restore capacity. MPL shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide transportation of Product tendered by Shipper under the Tariffs while restoration is being completed. Any work performed by MPL pursuant to this Section 6.4\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nshall be performed and completed in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable pipeline industry standards and in accordance with all applicable laws.\n\n6.5 Expansion of Pipeline. MPL reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to expand the capacity of the Pipeline at any time or from time to time.\n\n6.6 Right of Shipper to Secure Expansion Capacity. In the event that MPL decides in its sole discretion to expand the capacity of the Pipeline, then:\n\n(a) MPL will provide each Shipper with notice of such proposed expansion not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the expected in-service date of such proposed expansion (Expansion Notice) and such Expansion Notice shall include:\n\n(i) the amount of the proposed expansion capacity;\n\n(ii) the expected rates and rules and regulations that will apply to such expansion capacity;\n\n(iii) the expected in-service date of such expansion/extension.\n\nThe costs of any expansion shall not be rolled into the rates associated with any Pipeline capacity existing prior to such expansion.\n\n(b) To the extent permitted by Governmental Authorities, MPL will provide to each Shipper a first right, on terms and conditions specified by MPL that is consistent with this first right, to submit a binding nomination to ship, or otherwise pay for, a committed volume of Product on the expansion capacity (Requested Expansion Volume Commitment). The amount of expansion capacity available for volume commitments pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not exceed ninety percent (90%) of the total expansion capacity. No later than sixty (60) days following the date of MPL's Expansion Notice, Shipper must commit to, in a form acceptable to MPL in MPL's sole discretion, its Requested Expansion Volume Commitment (Election Deadline). In the event that, pursuant to this first right, MPL receives binding commitments for volumes that exceed the expansion capacity available for committed volumes, each Shipper that submitted a binding commitment pursuant to this first right procedure shall be allocated the lesser of: (i) its Requested Expansion Volume Commitment, or (ii) the Shipper's pro-rata share of the expansion capacity available for committed volumes, which shall be calculated by multiplying (1) the Shipper's Proportionate Share, times (2) the expansion capacity available for committed volumes (Expansion Volume Commitment). MPL shall notify Shipper of its Expansion Volume Commitment within thirty (30) days following the Election Deadline, and the Parties shall promptly execute a new and separate transportation service agreement reflecting Shipper's Expansion Volume Commitment. Any calculation of an Expansion Volume Commitment shall be without regard to and shall not affect any Volume Commitment on pre-existing capacity.\n\n(c) In the event that any expansion capacity available for committed volumes remains after the procedure set forth in Section 6.6 is completed, MPL has the right, in its sole discretion, to offer such committed capacity pursuant to an open season in which all interested shippers will be given an opportunity to commit to transport a specified volume of Product on such remaining expansion capacity, subject to the terms and conditions specified by MPL pursuant to or in connection with such open season.\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Confidentiality\n\n7.1 From and after the Effective Date, each Party shall hold, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors, contractors, and other representatives (collectively, Representatives) to hold all Confidential Information of the other Party in strict confidence, with at least the same degree of care that applies to such Party's confidential and proprietary information and shall not use such Confidential Information except in connection with its performance or acceptance of services hereunder and shall not release or disclose such Confidential Information to any other Person, except its Representatives. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7 by any of its Representatives.\n\n7.2 If a Party receives a subpoena or other demand for disclosure of Confidential Information received from any other Party or must disclose to a Governmental Authority any Confidential Information received from such other Party in order to obtain or maintain any required governmental approval, the receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide notice to the providing Party before disclosing such Confidential Information. Upon receipt of such notice, the providing Party shall promptly either seek an appropriate protective order, waive the receiving Party's confidentiality obligations hereunder to the extent necessary to permit the receiving Party to respond to the demand, or otherwise fully satisfy the subpoena or demand or the requirements of the applicable Governmental Authority. If the receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information or if the providing Party does not promptly respond as contemplated by this Section 7, the receiving Party may disclose that portion of Confidential Information covered by the notice or demand.\n\n7.3 Each Party acknowledges that the disclosing Party would not have an adequate remedy at law for the breach by the receiving Party of any one or more of the covenants contained in this Section 7 and agrees that, in the event of such breach, the disclosing Party may, in addition to the other remedies that may be available to it, apply to a court for an injunction to prevent breaches of this Section 7 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Section 7. Notwithstanding any other section hereof, the provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n8. Assignment\n\n8.1 Neither Party may assign its rights under this Agreement without prior written consent from the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that either Party may assign its rights under this Agreement to a successor in interest resulting from any merger, reorganization, consolidation or as part of a sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Parties hereto.\n\n9. Representations and Warranties\n\n9.1 Each Party to this Agreement represents and warrants to the other that it is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its organization and has all requisite corporate power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out the terms and provisions hereof.\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2 MPL shall take reasonable steps to obtain all necessary approvals, and authorizations of all Governmental Authorities to modify and operate the Pipeline, including approval by FERC of the rate structure and any premium service, and all other approvals and authorizations necessary, in MPL's sole opinion, desirable in connection with the provision of Product transportation, in each case, in form and substance acceptable to MPL in its sole discretion.\n\n9.3 Shipper hereby agrees (a) to take all such actions and do all such things as MPL reasonably requests in connections with its application for, and the processing of necessary approvals and authorizations of the FERC and other governmental authorities, (b) at all times to support the rate and (c) to not, directly or indirectly, take any action that is designed to or may delay review or approval of the applications to FERC or any other Governmental Authority or indicate a lack of support for the modifications of the Pipeline or the rate.\n\n10. Termination and Amendment\n\n10.1 This Agreement may not be terminated, except as expressly provided herein, nor may any of its provisions be amended or waived without prior written consent of both Parties hereto.\n\n10.2 Neither failure nor delay by MPL or Shipper to exercise any right or remedy provided herein shall operate as a waiver with respect to a future exercise thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.\n\n10.3 Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.5, in the event of any breach of a term or condition of this Agreement by either Party, the other Party's remedy shall be limited to the direct damages caused thereby and in no event shall a Party be liable to the other Party for any consequential, indirect, pecuniary, punitive, or economic damages, howsoever caused.\n\n10.4 Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a default by Shipper, pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement or any other termination of this Agreement initiated by Shipper pursuant to Section 5, Shipper shall have the right to require MPL to enter into a new transportation service agreement with Shipper that (a) is consistent with the terms and objectives set forth in this Agreement and (b) has commercial terms that are, in the aggregate, equal to or more favorable to Shipper than fair market value terms as would be agreed by similarly-situated parties negotiating at arm's length provided.\n\n10.5 Shipper acknowledges that MPL will incur certain building, expansion and improvement costs associated with its performance under this Agreement prior to the commencement of transportation service on the Pipeline. Shipper also acknowledges that MPL relied on the volume commitments received from Shipper on its Capacity Request Form in Exhibit C as part of an aggregate volume commitment received from all committed shippers during the binding open season to finalize the Project's ultimate scope, including but not limited to, pipe size, routing and destinations. If MPL is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Shipper decides to terminate this Agreement after the Effective Date but prior to the commencement of transportation service on the Pipeline, Shipper shall notify MPL of its decision to terminate within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project's in-service date to allow MPL the opportunity to provide Shipper's unwanted capacity to other interested shippers as Unsubscribed Capacity as set forth in Section 3.8. If Shipper fails to notify MPL within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project's in-service date or if MPL is unsuccessful in obtaining additional volume commitments as provided for in Section 3.8 to\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nfully replace Shipper's original volume commitment as submitted in its Capacity Request Form in Exhibit C, Shipper will reimburse MPL for Shipper's pro rata portion of actual and committed Construction Costs, plus, an administrative fee of ten (10) percent of said costs (such reimbursement is hereinafter referred to as the Construction Cost Reimbursement). The Parties agree that the Construction Cost Reimbursement shall be deemed liquidated damages and that such amount shall not be deemed a penalty, but rather represents a reasonable amount of liquidated damages in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by Shipper's termination of this Agreement as stated, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non- feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and that the payment of such amount shall be MPL's sole and exclusive remedy for such termination by Shipper.\n\n10.6 The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement may be contingent on the Shipper executing a reasonably acceptable commodity supply agreement. Shipper must notify MPL if it is unable to execute a reasonably acceptable commodity supply agreement within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project in-service date. Furthermore, Shipper must make commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a commodity supply agreement within the one hundred and eighty (180) days. Provided, however, that Shipper acknowledges and agrees that Shipper remains responsible for the Construction Cost Reimbursement provided for in Section 10.5 of this Agreement if it is unable to reach and execute a commodity supply agreement within the required timeframe. 11. Conditions Precedent\n\nNotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement is subject to the receipt by MPL of:\n\n11.1 All certificates, approvals and authorizations of any Governmental Authority deemed necessary or desirable by MPL in connection with this Agreement and, in each case, in form and substance acceptable to MPL in its sole discretion.\n\n11.2 Executed Transportation Service Agreements, in form and substance acceptable to MPL in its sole discretion, as MPL shall deem sufficient in its sole discretion to support the economic viability of the costs associated with the Project.\n\n11.3 Executed Transportation Service Agreements, in form and substance acceptable to both MPL and Shipper.\n\nIf any terms of this Agreement are required to be modified in accordance with a decision, approval or authorization from FERC or any other governmental authority, the Parties agree to reasonably cooperate with one another in amending this Agreement to align with those decisions, approvals and authorizations from FERC or any other governmental agencies. If these conditions precedent are not satisfied for MPL after exercising commercially reasonable efforts to meet such condition precedent, MPL shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Shipper. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 11, MPL and Shipper shall be released from any and all obligations under this Agreement.\n\n12. Offer\n\n12.1 The submission of an unexecuted copy of this Agreement by MPL to Shipper shall not constitute an offer.\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2 Shipper acknowledges that, upon closing of the open season described in the notice of open season, MPL will undertake significant alterations and improvements and will incur significant expense in connection with the Project. In consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by Shipper, Shipper agrees that the submission of an executed Agreement to MPL shall constitute an offer by Shipper. Shipper further agrees that its offer shall remain irrevocable; provided, however, that if Shipper has not received an executed copy of this Agreement from MPL within sixty (60) days after the close of the Binding Open Season, Shipper may revoke its offer thereafter by written notice to MPL, and upon such revocation, this Agreement will become null and void.\n\n13. Notices\n\n13.1 Any notice, statement, or invoice provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be considered as having been given if hand carried, facsimiled, emailed, or if mailed by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the following address, respectively:\n\nShipper : Name: Marathon Petroleum Company LP Address: 539 South Main Street Findlay, OH 45840 Attention: Optimization LP Manager Fax: (419) 421-4232\n\nMPL : Name: Craig O.

Severability\n\nIn the event any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, or by an empowered government agency, such findings shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which are not found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, unless such construction would be unreasonable.\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n16. Default\n\n16.1 Either Party hereunder shall be in default if such Party: (a) materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and such breach is not cured within fifteen (15) Days after notice thereof (which notice shall describe such breach in reasonable detail) is received by such Party; (b) becomes insolvent, enters voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (c) fails to pay any undisputed sums due hereunder; or (d) fails to provide satisfactory financial assurance as provided for in Section 17.\n\n16.2 If either Party is in default as described above, then the non-defaulting Party may: (a) terminate this Agreement upon notice to the defaulting Party; (b) withhold any payments due to the defaulting Party under this Agreement; and/or (c) pursue any other remedy at law or in equity if such breach is not remedied as provided for in Section 14.1.\n\n17. Credit Requirements and Financial Assurances\n\n17.1 Financial Information. Shipper shall provide to MPL, at any time: (i) upon MPL's request, information (Financial Information) that will allow MPL to assess (or reassess) and establish creditworthiness and Shipper's capacity to perform any financial obligations that could arise from the transportation of Shipper's Crude Petroleum on the Pipeline; and (ii) upon MPL's good faith determination (which shall be no less than industry standards) of non-creditworthiness, MPL may request, financial assurance in respect of transportation or other services (Financial Assurances). Financial Assurances shall be limited to a guarantee from the parent company of Shipper in a form and substance acceptable to MPL and sufficient in amount to cover 6-months of Shipper's obligations to MPL so long as the guarantor has sufficient creditworthiness as set forth in this Section; and if not, MPL may then request an irrevocable standby letter of credit in a form and from an issuer acceptable to MPL, and in an amount no greater than 6-months of tolls based on the Quarterly Volume Commitment, plus all applicable taxes.\n\n17.2 As of the Project's in-service date, Shipper shall comply with the credit requirements and provide the financial assurances required in the Tariff so long as the Tariff is consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 17.3 Any failure of Shipper to comply with the provisions of this Section 17 will constitute an Event of Default under Section 16 of this Agreement.\n\n18. Miscellaneous\n\n18.1 Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision or provisions shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.\n\n18.2 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that the rights and obligations of any Party under this Agreement shall not be assignable by such Party without the prior written consent of the\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nother Party pursuant to Section 8.1. A Party's successors and permitted assigns shall include any permitted assignee as well as the successors in interest to such permitted assignee whether by merger, liquidation (including successive mergers or liquidations) or otherwise.\n\n18.3 No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any third party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement or other right in excess of those existing without reference to this Agreement.\n\n18.4 Neither Party shall, without the approval of the other Party, make any press release or other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that either Party shall be so obligated by Applicable Law or the rules of any regulatory body, stock exchange or quotation system.\n\n18.5 EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PERFORMANCE OR FAILURE TO PERFORM OF ANY OBLIGATION HEREUNDER.\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, MPL and Shipper have caused this Agreement to be duly executed, all as of the date set forth above.\n\nMARATHON PIPE LINE LLC By: /s/ Craig Pierson 6/11/15 Name: Craig Pierson Title: President\n\nMARATHON PETROLEUM COMPANY LP By: MPC Investment LLC, its General Partner By: /s/ C.

Transporter will pay Customer an amount that is the product of the Positive Imbalance each Month, if any, and the Cash-out Price. Customer will pay Transporter an amount that is the product of the Negative Imbalance each Month, if any, and the Cash-out Price. If the actual monthly volume varies by more than five percent (5%) from the delivered volumes for the Month, then the Cash-out Price will be adjusted as follows:\n\n\n\n1. For Negative Imbalances, the Cash-out Price will be increased by the percentage variance, rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point, between the Point(s) of Delivery volumes and the adjusted Point(s) of Receipt volumes. (i.e., if the adjusted receipt volume from Customer is 7% less than the Point(s) of Delivery volume, then the Index Price will be increased by 7%), however in no event shall the Cash-Out Price be increased more than 10%; and\n\n\n\n2. For Positive Imbalances, the Cash-out Price will be decreased by the percentage variance, rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point, between the Point(s) of Delivery volumes and the adjusted Point(s) of Receipt volumes. (i.e., if the adjusted receipt volume from Customer is 7% greater than the Point(s) of Delivery volume, then the Index Price will be increased by 7%), however in no event shall the Cash-Out Price be increased more than 10%.\n\nArticle V. Curtailment\n\nIf the quantity of Customer Gas and all other Gas available for delivery into the Transportation System exceeds the capacity of the Transportation System at any point, then Transporter shall interrupt or curtail receipts of Customer Gas with respect to the affected point(s) only in accordance with the following:\n\n(a) First, Transporter shall curtail all Interruptible Service Gas prior to curtailing Firm Service Gas. In the event Transporter curtails some, but not all, Interruptible Service Gas on a particular Day, Transporter shall allocate the capacity of the Transportation System available for Interruptible Service Gas at the affected points on a pro rata basis based upon Customer's last confirmed nomination of Interruptible Service Gas hereunder and the last confirmed nominations of Interruptible Service Gas from all other shippers on the Transportation System prior to the event causing the curtailment.\n\n(b) Second, if additional curtailments are required beyond those described in the immediately preceding clause (a), Transporter shall curtail Firm Service Gas. In the event Transporter curtails some, but not all, Firm Service Gas on a particular Day, Transporter shall allocate the capacity of the Transportation System at the affected point(s) on a pro rata basis based upon Customer's last confirmed nomination of Firm Service Gas hereunder and the last confirmed nominations of Firm Service Gas from all other shippers on the Transportation System prior to the event causing the curtailment.\n\nTransporter shall provide Customer notice of any interruption or curtailment of the receipt of Customer Gas into the Transportation System as is reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nArticle VI. Measurement & Testing\n\nThe construction, ownership, installation, operation and maintenance of each Measurement Facility that is owned by a Person other than Transporter shall be governed by an interconnect agreement between Transporter and such Person. Each other Measurement Facility shall be constructed, installed, owned, operated and maintained by Transporter.   9\n\nSource: PENNTEX MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP, S-1/A, 4/16/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle VII.

Transporter acknowledges and agrees that Memorial Resource Development Corp. is a satisfactory guarantor.\n\nShould Customer or its guarantor fail to provide Performance Assurance within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written demand for such assurance, then Transporter shall have the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Customer furnishes Performance Assurance. For the avoidance of doubt, such suspension of performance by Transporter shall not relieve Customer of its obligation to make payments of amounts due hereunder, including, without limitation, payment of fees due hereunder.   14\n\nSource: PENNTEX MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP, S-1/A, 4/16/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nIf during the Term, if Transporter has failed to pay any amount when due under this Agreement and if such non-payment is not being disputed in good faith by Transporter, Customer shall have the right to request and receive from Transporter adequate Performance Assurance under similar terms and conditions as described above, including the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Transporter furnishes Performance Assurance.\n\nArticle XV.
