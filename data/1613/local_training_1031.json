West Midlands Police said the suspect handed himself into a police station in the early hours and remains in custody. The attack reportedly took place near a McDonald's and a group of bus stops. Police said there had been disorder in the area at the time and several people were seen fleeing. The ambulance service said despite its \"tremendous efforts\", Ozell was confirmed dead at the scene. Police said he has has not yet been formally identified and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course. But a tribute to Ozell was released by his former school earlier. \"We were deeply saddened to hear about the tragic death of one of our former pupils and our thoughts and prayers are with his family,\" a spokesperson for Greenwood Academy, Castle Vale, said. \"For our part, we are providing counselling and support to our pupils and staff to help them through this difficult time.\" Staff said he last attended the school in November 2015. Councillor David Pears, who represents the Sutton Trinity ward, described the violence as \"appalling\". He added: \"My sympathies go out to this person's family and their friends. \"I think people want to feel safe; it's really important that police take action very quickly.\" Analysis by Sima Kotecha, BBC Midlands correspondent Unfortunately fatal stabbings in Birmingham are nothing new. This crime happened in the affluent area of Sutton Coldfield and in the middle of the afternoon. The age of the victim is also unnerving; just 16 and killed as a result of what officers call \"disorder\" involving several people. At a time when police resources are stretched in the region and crime rates are soaring, there is a palpable fear among some residents who are repeatedly saying that they just don't feel safe anymore. That fear is particularly prevalent among the older generation, but the victims in many of these violent cases are young men and boys. @sima_kotecha Part of Lower Parade remains sealed off for investigations to be carried out. West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Murray, said: \"This is a tragic set of circumstances and our thoughts, and I'm sure the thoughts of everyone in the community, are with the boy's family at this truly devastating time. \"A dedicated team of homicide detectives has worked non-stop on the investigation since yesterday and has made good progress.\" Mr Murray added: \"We need parents, community leaders, schools and young people themselves to pass the message that it is never OK to carry or use a knife.\" David Jamieson, the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, said \"much more needs to be done\". \"This is another stark reminder of the importance and responsibility we all have in ending violence in our communities,\" he said. Mr Jamieson said he was spending an extra \u00a32m \"tackling violence\" over the next two years.

That is two years ahead of regulator Ofcom's requirement of 98% coverage by 2017.

He told a conference of northern business leaders mayors were now part of the \"national conversation\". But Mr Burnham has said England has \"devolution in name but not in reality\". The Labour former cabinet minister has been at war with Prime Minister Boris Johnson over financial support for his region, which culminated in the PM imposing tier three coronavirus restrictions. Later, in an interview with the BBC's Newscast, Mr Osborne warned Mr Johnson against being \"at war\" with the Treasury, following the latest round of financial support being announced. He told the prime minister to \"embrace\" his position as \"First Lord of the Treasury\" - the additional role held by the PM - adding: \"You know the prime minister who makes use of the Treasury, where you really do have a lot of policy-making capacity, is a prime minister who is going to be more powerful.\" Mr Osborne, who among other roles now leads the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, called for more devolution during the Covid recovery. Speaking to the Great Northern Conference, he said he could see \"real representation in the North\". \"We now have a national political conversation where representatives of the north of England are heard on our national news. \"And that is a fantastic success story,\" he added, referring to coverage of Mr Burnham's clash with the government over financial support for Manchester. \"We need to be more courageous in giving many more powers to these local elected leaders,\" Mr Osborne said, as \"we're beginning to see a much more balanced, healthy British society and state where not every decision is taken at Westminster and other voices are heard.\" \"But we've got much more to do.\" But speaking at a parliamentary select committee meeting on Thursday, Mr Burnham said England had \"devolution in name but not in reality\". Mr Burnham rejected accusations he had been \"posturing\" during the failed negotiations with the government. He accused ministers of operating a \"divide and rule\" strategy, which he said was \"not the way to get a through a pandemic\" which has had a \"severe\" impact on his region. Mr Burnham was supported at the Commons business committee by Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool City Region, who said that \"for far too long too many decisions have been taken with London centricity - not just the area of London, but the overall London culture that exists in Parliament\". Mr Rotheram was the first regional mayor to make an agreement with the government for his area to adopt tier three restrictions. Since 2017, eight English regions have appointed directly elected mayors. This means 12m people in England, over 20% of the population, now live in mayoral authority areas. Mayors have some powers over policy areas such as adult education and transport, but these vary from region to region. The eight new regional mayors operate under a different system to London, which elected its first mayor in 2000. The Conservative Party's 2019 election manifesto committed to \"full devolution across England... so that every part of our country has the power to shape its own destiny,\" which is set include more metro mayors. The government was due to publish a white paper on the subject in 2020, but the Financial Times reported it had been delayed until next year. In a speech via video link to the Great Northern Conference, Mr Johnson reiterated the government's commitment to \"level up\" the North of England. \"Even now, as we are still up to our thighs in the mud of the trenches, grappling with this virus, my message to you is that it cannot be enough simply to get through the crisis. We must build back better, build back stronger, build back faster,\" he said. He added: \"That means our work to level up and unleash the talent and potential of the North - by investing in education, skills and infrastructure - is now more urgent than ever. \"We will move departments of state, ministers, private offices and all, to great Northern cities and regions that represent the future of this country.\"", "output": "Andy Burnham's profile shows success of new mayors, says George Osborne", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

He has denied claims he groped a girl of 14 while in a room with Savile. Meanwhile, an independent review into BBC Newsnight's dropping of a programme about the allegations against Savile will report later this month. Operation Yewtree is a Scotland Yard criminal inquiry into sexual abuse claims. The Metropolitan Police said officers arrested a man in his 60s, from Warwickshire, at 17:45 GMT in connection with the investigation. Police said the individual fell under the strand of the investigation termed \"Savile and others\". Mr Starr was released on bail between 01:00 and 01:30 GMT on Friday. Scotland Yard has not said when he was bailed until. On Sunday, ex-pop star Gary Glitter was arrested and bailed after being questioned as part of the inquiry. Glitter, 68, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was arrested at home and questioned at a London police station before being released on bail until mid-December. Editorial decision The independent review by ex-Sky News boss Nick Pollard will seek to establish whether there were any \"failings\" in the decision to drop the Newsnight investigation. The Pollard Review, which will also look at the BBC's handling of material which might have been of interest to the police, will report to the BBC Executive Board. There has been speculation that the programme was dropped because the BBC was already planning to run more favourable programmes in tribute to the former BBC presenter, who died in October 2011. The BBC has repeatedly denied such claims. BBC director general George Entwistle said he was launching the inquiry to shake off the \"clouds of suspicion\". Outlining terms of reference on Thursday, a statement on behalf of the review said: \"It will establish whether there were any failings in the BBC management of the Newsnight investigation relating to allegations of sexual abuse of children by Jimmy Savile, including the broadcast of tribute programmes on the BBC. \"This will encompass the BBC's handling of material derived from the investigation that could have been of interest to the police or relevant authorities and whether any inappropriate managerial pressure or consideration may have influenced the decision of the editor of Newsnight.\" It said the review will examine the editorial decision on the Newsnight investigation and a blog dated 2 October posted by the programme's editor which was changed by the BBC on 22 October 2012. In the original blog, Newsnight editor Peter Rippon explained the editorial reasons behind his decision to axe the report. He said it was \"totally untrue\" he had been ordered to do it by bosses as part of a BBC cover-up. In a correction to the blog, the BBC called it \"inaccurate or incomplete in some respects\". Mr Rippon has stepped aside from his role for the duration of the inquiry. The review's statement said interviews with relevant people will be conducted with support of a barrister, and interviewees are allowed a lawyer. The review has asked BBC staff for documents and was electronically searching archived documents from relevant people. Participation in the review, which has already begun, is voluntary.

It has to be said that at least on this second question, things are looking very good indeed. Everywhere you go in this sprawling international village built in the gritty suburb of Le Bourget, you find smiles on granite-faced security guards, cheery \"bonjours!\" and, get this, they even ask if you want milk in your tea when you order a cup! At the Le Bourget station, you find some of the hundreds of underprivileged teenagers recruited from the local neighbourhoods to meet and greet the thousands who come to COP21 via the train every day. They have been specially trained with lessons in English and attitude. They are doing a great job. But the key to the success of this COP will not be found in the sparkling toilets (they really do!) or in the friendly smiles. The vital ingredient in the Paris deal lies in the personality of the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who is the president of the Conference of the Parties, the man tasked with steering this meeting to a successful outcome. Velvet and steel This imperious diplomat has been a serious global player for decades. He glides through rooms with the confident air of a man well used to power. Like a stern but respected headmaster, Fab is patient and listens to all. But you sense there is real steel underneath, if required. The COP seems a little bit scared of him. Most of the deadlines he has insisted upon have so far been met. Very unlike the UN! And unlike Copenhagen, when Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen seemed at sea with the details and the conventions of this process, Fabius exudes knowledge and respect. Addressing the plenary session on Saturday, he took a moment to speak \"personally\". \"As all of you know I have fairly broad experience in public life, but this is something special, this agreement is something we just cannot postpone,\" he told the negotiators. \"What we are discussing is not only the climate, not only the environment - we are talking about life itself. \"I intend to muster the experience of my entire life at the service of success for next Friday. It is not the question of the presidency on one side and you on the other; we all have to be moving in the same direction.\" His comments were greeted with sustained applause. French charm There is no doubt that Fabius and his boss, President Francois Hollande, will try their utmost to deliver a deal. French diplomats have traversed the world, in huge numbers in the past 12 months, meeting national leaders to try to understand their key issues. In his speech of welcome to world leaders last Monday, Hollande showed the benefits of this diplomatic outreach. He used some \"magic phrases\" that have huge significance, especially for developing nations. He was, he said, speaking in the name of \"climate justice\", and \"in the name of climate justice we must act!\" An agreement must be universal, differentiated, and binding, he said. There needs to be \"a credible path to limit global warming below 2C, or 1.5C if possible,\" he said. \"Developed countries must take their historic responsibilities; they are the ones who for years emitted the largest amounts of greenhouse gases. Emerging countries must accelerate their energy transition, and developing countries must be supported in adapting to the impacts of climate change.\" Approaching deadline Hollande has gone further than any leader of a developed country in reassuring the developing world that they will not be tricked into an unfair deal that will restrict their growth and saddle them with huge loans masquerading as climate finance. And in Fabius he has the ideal man to drive the Paris agreement over the finish line. The COP president will be able to look ministers in the eye this week, as a vastly experienced equal, and nudge, charm or chastise them to a deal. It could all fall apart, undoubtedly. This is the UN after all. However, Fabius keeps insisting that everything will be wrapped up by Thursday to allow time for translations and revisions. The whole deal is to be signed, sealed and delivered by 6pm on Friday! Who knows, President Fabius may save the world and still be home in time for his tea! UN climate conference 30 Nov - 11 Dec 2015 COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.

He added that \"the real prize for the country is to complete the second phase\", linking Birmingham with Manchester and Leeds. Last week, a House of Lords committee called for a rethink of HS2, arguing that it did not offer value for money. It also said the project, which has a budget of \u00a356bn, risked \"short-changing\" the north of England - a verdict that the government said it \"fundamentally disagreed\" with. Organisers say HS2 will deliver a \u00a392bn boost to the UK economy, and that for every \u00a31 spent, the country will receive \u00a32.30 in benefits. In an interview with 5 live's Wake Up to Money programme, Mark Thurston stood by such assessments. \"Connecting the three major cities of the Midlands and the North, a metropolitan area of about 10 million people, and being able to get between those cities in about 45-50 minutes will transform the economy,\" he said. The former engineer cited Japan and China as examples of countries where an investment in high-speed trains had boosted economic growth. \"The key for us now is not to lose sight of the benefits of this programme,\" Mr Thurston said of HS2. On Tuesday, it emerged that thousands of trees planted along the HS2 route would have to be replaced, after saplings were not watered in last summer's drought. The project's land and property acquisitions have also faced criticism. Campaigners claim some homeowners are being treated badly, and that properties are being routinely undervalued by HS2. HS2 claims it works to achieve a fair price for both homeowners and taxpayers. Mr Thurston admitted that his organisation had \"some difficult choices\" to make to ensure it stayed within budget, particularly with regard to conservation. \"A large part of this railway is underground or buried in deep cuttings to make sure that we are sensitive to the environment and local communities, and that is putting huge cost into the programme,\" he said.", "output": "HS2 boss: Business case for Northern extension is 'clear'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Elizabeth was given the first place rosette after beating the six other dogs left in the final stage of the four-day competition. Lhasa Apsos originate in Tibet and were used by Buddhist monks to alert them to any intruders. Ms Anderson said she was in shock. \"I'm, sure somebody's going to pinch me in a minute and I'll wake up and it'll all be a dream. It hasn't sunk at all.

Another 37 who experienced or witnessed inappropriate behaviour said they did not report it. Among the reasons given for not pursing a case, some said it involved a more senior official or AM who they thought the assembly would side with. The Assembly Commission - the body which runs the assembly - undertook an anonymous and confidential survey between April and May, which was open to commission staff, AMs and their support staff. In total, 128 responses were received with a participation rate of 16.8% - around one in six. Thirty two people said they had experienced inappropriate behaviour on multiple occasions either in their work as a member of staff for the commission or for an AM or assembly party group. A further five said they had experienced inappropriate behaviour on one occasion. The number of respondents who said they had never experienced inappropriate behaviour was 69. A total of 29 respondents said they had observed inappropriate behaviour on \"multiple occasions\" while 13 said they had seen it once. Ms Jones told BBC Wales the findings were \"pretty sobering\". \"Yes, there's a problem and it is serious,\" she said. \"I take the results of this survey very seriously as the presiding officer of this place. \"There are far too many individuals who have said to us that they have experienced inappropriate behaviour.\" While she had not witnessed it herself, the presiding officer said she was \"aware of inappropriate behaviour\". \"I'm aware, of course, of women who have spoken publicly about inappropriate behaviour against them,\" she said, \"and I am aware of others who have experienced sexually inappropriate behaviour against them who may have raised this with their political parties. It may have been dealt with in some form.\" Asked whether the survey results surprised her, Ms Jones said: \"Probably not. It upsets me that it has happened.\" She referred to bullying, intimidation or sexual harassment as examples of inappropriate behaviour covered by the survey. She said that the culture in Cardiff Bay had allowed too many people to experience inappropriate behaviour - and it had to change. The assembly has trained AMs and managers, showed staff how to seek support and had appointed contact officers so victims had \"somebody they can go to\". Ms Jones said she was not aware of complaints against any AMs, but she would not necessarily know about cases anyway as it was handled separately by the assembly's standards commissioner. In May, the assembly passed a new dignity and respect policy that tries to regulate AMs' private and public conduct.

The government's furlough programme will end on 31 October. A Treasury spokesperson said the government had \"not hesitated to act in creative and effective ways to support jobs and we will continue to do so\". Wednesday marks 45 days before the end of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which is the same amount of time employers must give for notice of redundancy. The call comes amid growing evidence that the winding down of the scheme is leading to more plans for job cuts. The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June, 1,778 firms said they were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In total, nine million people have been furloughed for at least one three-week period since March, However, about 695,000 UK workers have gone from the payrolls of UK companies since then and it is feared that more will follow if the government stops paying to safeguard jobs. Unite said that without \"a clear and urgent sign\" from the government that it was responding to calls to extend the scheme, it feared that \"employers facing short-term struggles will issue redundancy notices\". The government has been urged by MPs, business groups, unions and political opponents to continue the furlough programme, in which workers placed on leave receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month. The scheme, which has cost more than \u00a335bn, was initially funded by the government, but firms started to contribute to wages in September after the scheme began to wind down. Last week, the Treasury Select Committee said the government should consider a targeted extension of the scheme. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said a signal from the government would \"put a floor under struggling employers who are working hard to stabilise in the face of immense challenges\". \"With our competitor nations announcing the extension or modification of their jobs retention schemes, we ask that your government recognises the need for UK businesses and workers to receive similar support,\" Mr McCluskey wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A spokeswoman said Unite wanted to see support for sectors including manufacturing, aviation infrastructure, aerospace and hospitality. The government has repeatedly rebuffed the calls for an extension to the scheme, saying that it has served its purpose in cushioning the economy during the coronavirus crisis. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said his priority is to find new ways to protect jobs. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The furlough scheme has done what it was designed to do - save jobs and help people back into employment.\" The spokesperson said the government had made \"unprecedented interventions\", including firms being given \u00a31,000 for every furloughed worker still employed in January, business rates holidays, VAT cuts and the Kickstart scheme, which gives young people jobs experience.", "output": "'Redundancy floodgates' will open without support, warns union", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

But this utopian model is becoming the exception. High house prices mean we are borrowing more for longer. And more significantly, the UK is slowly ceasing to become a nation of homeowners. Over the next 15 years the number of people renting their home from a private landlord is expected to double to more than nine million. So how feasible is it to rent when you are no longer earning a salary? 'Black hole' At the age of 52, Simon Marley - who lives in York - is still some way off retirement. But having sold his house to boost his pension fund, he accepts that he will have no choice but to continue renting when he does retire. As a chartered accountant, he's calculated that out of \u00a31,000 a month he expects to get from his pension, up to \u00a3700 might have to go on rent. \"It will be an incredibly big burden,\" he says. \"On current figures the rent will be roughly 70% of my monthly income, which is an incredibly large volume.\" To cover the rent he will either have to wait until he gets a state pension at the age of 68, or else do part-time work. He advises other people to plan for retirement earlier than he did. \"People are not addressing their pension provision early enough, or proactively enough. I can't stress how important it is to tackle it earlier rather than later,\" he says. \"Don't leave it till your 50s before you realise that you've got a huge black hole that you can't fill.\" 'Not Eastbourne' Simon's case is not untypical. Within 15 years in the UK, retirees who don't own their own homes will be paying an average of 42% of their income in rent, according to research by Development Economics for Scottish Widows. But pensioners will face very different pressures in different parts of the country, with some areas proving much cheaper than others. (See chart below) The projections suggest that renting in London may become untenable for all but the rich. While retirees in the capital currently spend 66% of their income on rent, they could be spending as much as 80% by 2032. The next most expensive area for retired renters will be the East of England, where the figure could be 45%. Just behind that is the South East, where retirees can expect to spend 39% of their pension income on rent. On the other hand, those in Wales will spend just 24% of their pensions on accommodation, while those in the North East will spend 25%. So feasibility depends very much on the cost of local rents, and whether you may be prepared to move to a cheaper area. If you are going to move, think Newcastle, Swansea or Glasgow, says the report, not Eastbourne or Norfolk. Savings The proportion of pensioners' income taken up by rent is likely to accelerate over the next 15 years, according to the research. At the moment 32% of the average pensioner household's monthly income of \u00a32,374 is spent on rent. By 2032 the average income will have risen to \u00a33,706 - but rents will have risen faster, accounting for 42% of income. (See chart below) All of which suggests that those planning to rent in retirement should consider saving more while they are working. Or else work longer. So while pension firms and insurance companies are fond of telling us to save more - to boost their own profits - they probably have a point. Scottish Widows believes the average renter planning to retire in 15 years' time needs to save \u00a3525 a month more than they are saving at the moment. Or else work for an extra five years. Either option is a big ask. \"The number of people renting in retirement is set to treble over the next 15 years,\" says Robert Cochran, retirement expert at Scottish Widows. \"But alarmingly few people are thinking about how they would cover the growing cost of a property lease when they stop working.\" Retirement calculators State pension age calculator DWP How much will I get from a state pension? DWP Combined state, workplace and DC calculator, from Standard Life How much can I earn from a DC pot? Money Advice Service Tenant security If the country builds more houses - and the government's latest target is 300,000 a year - it may be that these projections prove inaccurate. In theory increasing the housing supply should lower rents. However many people are perfectly happy to rent after retirement - perhaps because they want to pass on housing equity to their children. But others - including Simon Marley - worry about the security of renting as they get older. \"Landlords have the upper hand a lot of the time. If someone wants you out with a month's notice, you're done. So there is that sword of Damocles hanging over you all the time,\" he says. Yet since Friday 1 December, those taking out tenancies in Scotland have been given extra protection. Under the Private Housing Act (Scotland), tenants will be able to choose to stay in a home as long as they like - unless they are eligible for eviction on one of 18 grounds. In last month's budget the government announced that a consultation is to take place about similar rules for England. There may be changes in Wales too. While that may provide some comfort for those planning to rent after they stop work, many retirees may need to take a very hard look at how they will afford it.", "output": "Renting in retirement: How feasible is it?", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Carl Beech, 51, from Gloucester, denies 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud. Ms Beech said he denied being on TV when she challenged him about it. Known by the name \"Nick\" when his claims were first reported in the media, Mr Beech is on trial accused of lying about being sexually abused by a group of well-known figures from politics, the media and intelligence in the 1970s and 1980s. He also told police he claimed to have witnessed three boys being murdered. His claims led to the Metropolitan Police's Operation Midland, which cost \u00a32m and ended without any charges. Among the people he accused were former prime minister Sir Edward Heath and former home secretary Lord Brittan. Giving evidence behind a screen at Newcastle Crown Court, Ms Beech recalled watching an episode of the BBC's Panorama programme in October 2015 about an alleged VIP paedophile ring. She told the court she recognised a silhouetted figure who appeared on the programme making allegations of abuse by powerful people. Asked in court who the person was, she said: \"It was my ex-husband Carl Beech.\" Ms Beech, who separated from her husband in 2009 and was divorced in 2012, said she later spoke to Mr Beech after the TV programme, asking him: \"Were you on Panorama the other week?\" \"Me on Panorama? Why would I be doing that?\" was his response, she told jurors. She said he was smiling and laughing as he answered. 'Spoke of stepfather abuse' Ms Beech, 49, told the court her ex-husband had never mentioned anything during their marriage about seeing children being killed, being taken away to be abused or about famous people abusing him. He had never mentioned childhood abuse by anyone except his stepfather, she said. Before they became a couple and in Relate counselling sessions during their marriage, he told her Major Ray Beech had sexually abused him, the court heard. She said Mr Beech told her his stepfather would come up to his bedroom and abuse him as his mother watched television downstairs. The couple had married in 1992, after meeting four years earlier at nursing school, jurors heard. Ms Beech said that her ex-husband's experience of abuse had created problems with intimacy in a relationship. She also said he had personal hygiene issues, which had developed as a \"defence mechanism\" against abuse, to make himself \"unattractive\". Ray Tully, Mr Beech's defence barrister, told the court that some time after the Panorama broadcast, his client had apologised to his ex-wife if she was being dragged into the press reporting of the case. Mr Beech also apologised for issues in their marriage, including his struggles with intimacy, the barrister said. The court also heard that Mr Beech had shown his wife a \"good memory box\" early in their marriage, which contained items including a penknife. Ms Beech said she thought her ex-husband had been given it by his grandmother. Jurors heard earlier that Mr Beech handed the penknife to police, claiming it had been given to him by former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor during his alleged abuse.

She added: \"Developing toll roads in isolation has proved to be expensive and unpopular. Any road pricing should be part of a comprehensive scheme such as moving to a distance-based HGV levy. \"Instead of pricy new roads, we need a fresh approach that prioritises public transport and gets more freight onto rail.\" Analysis: BBC Midlands Today Transport Correspondent Peter Plisner With calls for more lorries to use the road, instead of the congested M6, the price freeze for HGVs is a move that will please both haulage firms and the West Midlands Combined Authority. It's been calling for subsidies to persuade more HGVs on to M6 Toll. Last month it emerged that after years of losses the M6 Toll has finally made a profit. And coffers will no-doubt be further boosted in the months to come with an increase in traffic levels as more road works begin on the M6 and M5. The 27-mile route between Cannock and Coleshill in the West Midlands opened in 2003 at a cost of \u00a3900m to build. It carries more than 53,000 vehicles on weekdays. Andy Pearson, chief executive of MEL, said the pricing structure had been approached with \"very careful consideration to economic sensitivities and the impact on our customers and their businesses\". \"The new prices are effectively a partial catch\u2010up with inflation and are increasing by less than RPI over the same period,\" he added. Despite the freeze to HGV drivers, Ed Neely, of Birmingham hauliers Neely Transport Ltd, said it \"makes no difference\" and would not be an incentive for his firm, which has 23 HGVs, to use the motorway. \"We don't use it at all because it's extortionate, it's \u00a311 to drive six miles.

This dissatisfaction also saw Law and Justice win parliamentary elections in October with the first single-party overall majority in Poland's history as a democracy. Born in 1972 and a law lecturer by profession, Mr Duda has been active in conservative politics since the early 2000s, rising to work in the Presidential Chancellery under Lech Kaczynski in 2008-2010.

Cuadrilla is among a small number of companies exploring the UK's shale gas potential. The company estimates that there may be as much as 200 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in its licensed areas. The BBC understands a deal between Centrica and Cuadrilla is expected to be concluded in the coming weeks. Centrica is not planning to take a stake in Cuadrilla itself, but rather buy the exploration rights to a part of the shale gas fields. Through British Gas, Centrica is the largest domestic energy supplier in the UK. The BBC's industry correspondent, John Moylan, says Centrica's investment would be a major boost for the UK's fledgling shale gas industry. Fracking controversy Fracking has revolutionised the energy industry in the US in recent years, driving down gas prices and boosting oil production. Drilling companies suggest they may be sitting on vast resources of shale gas in the UK. Earlier this week another drilling firm, IGas, said its licensed areas of Cheshire could hold up to 170 trillion cubic feet of gas. Some industry figures suggest that may be enough to end the need for expensive gas imports. The UK's annual gas consumption is currently about 3 trillion cubic feet. However analysts suggest that only a small fraction of the total shale gas resources in the UK may be recoverable. In a report published earlier this year, the Energy and Climate Change Committee also cast doubt on the value of shale gas extraction. Although it said shale gas in the UK could help secure domestic energy supplies, it also warned that it may not bring down prices. The gas is extracted from the shale rock through a controversial process known as \"fracking\" - forcing water, chemicals and sand underground to release the trapped gas. But it has been blamed for causing earth tremors and there are environmental concerns about water contamination and the large volumes of water required.", "output": "Centrica in shale gas stake talks with Cuadrilla", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

You have to really not run away from that stuff.\" Martin and Paltrow separated last month after a decade of marriage. The singer says the issues the pair were having influenced the writing on Ghost Stories, which is due out in May. \"Up to a certain point in my life I wasn't completely vulnerable and it caused some problems,\" he said. \"If you don't let love in then you can't really give it back. \"So what Ghost Stories means to me is like, you've got to open yourself up to love and if you really do, of course it will be painful at times, but then it will be great at some point.\" Paltrow, 41, and 37-year-old Martin announced their break-up in March on her blog in a post titled Conscious Uncoupling. \"It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate,\" the couple wrote. The band's lead single, Magic, was released in March and was one of the tracks played on their Radio 1 Live Lounge set last week. Describing the song, Martin said: \"It's not a question of you either really love someone or you really hate someone, it's more nuanced than that - especially with the modern world's complications - like travelling and all the stuff that comes to life, and illness and addiction and all that sort of thing. \"It's just saying - ultimately - there is magic between two people no matter what anyone else thinks.\" The pair, who married in December 2003, have two children - Apple, nine, and Moses, seven. In the message on Paltrow's Goop.com website, the couple said they had \"come to the conclusion that while we love each other very much, we will remain separate\". Speaking about the break-up, he said: \"I wouldn't use the word breakdown, this was more a realisation about trying to grow up. \"If you can't open yourself up, you can't appreciate the wonder inside. \"You can be with someone wonderful, but because of your issues you can't let that be celebrated in the right way.\" The musician also explained his decision to go on Zane Lowe's radio show. \"The reason I wanted to do this was because I love your Kanye interview,\" said Martin. \"That guy is amazing and I think he is misunderstood by people who only look on the surface.

Supporters say the barrage, from the Vale of Glamorgan to Somerset, would provide 5% of the UK's electricity. The Welsh government said it had not yet considered the report. Swansea-born Lord Heseltine, a former Conservative minister, has challenged the UK government to take bolder action to stimulate the economy. His report, No Stone Unturned, makes 89 recommendations to help industry. In a section on energy, he says: \"It goes without saying that a secure and affordable supply of energy is essential to everything we do,\" adding that \"the Severn Barrage offers the possibility of both a long term source of energy and extraordinary economic regeneration\". The report says: \"It is widely accepted that over the next 10 to 15 years up to \u00a3200bn of investment may be needed to meet both levels of demand for energy and our carbon targets. \"For the country's energy needs to be met, the government needs a clear and consistent long term energy policy that indicates what our projected needs will be and how they will be met, by when and by whom.\" The UK government has previously rejected barrage plans after a two-year feasibility study found the cost could be up to \u00a334bn, double the initial estimate.

Labour says it shows the Conservatives have run out of ideas. But First Secretary of State Damian Green said it was a \"grown-up way of doing politics\". Ministers loyal to Mrs May have dismissed reports of plots to remove her as drink-fuelled \"gossip\", but Labour remains on an election footing, with leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he hopes for a fresh poll in September. Mrs May will return to the message from her first day in Downing Street last July, when she succeeded David Cameron, and vow to lead what she called a \"one nation\" government that works for all and not just the \"privileged few\". The speech is being seen by some as a \"re-launch\" or \"fightback\" after Mrs May lost her majority - and much of her authority - in the snap election last month. Analysis By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason Theresa May's speech is a pitch for cross-party consensus. \"Come forward with your own views and ideas about how we can tackle\" the challenges the country faces, Mrs May will say, adding: \"We may not agree on everything, but ideas can be clarified and improved and a better way forward found.\" Bluntly, it is an explicit acknowledgement of her fragility; her authority and majority shrivelled. Government sources say it is a mature approach that maintains a commitment to taking on big, difficult and complex challenges; not just Brexit but reform of social care, too, for instance. Labour says Mrs May's speech proves the Conservatives have \"completely run out of ideas\" and were reduced to \"begging\" for policy proposals from them. In her speech, the PM will say that although the result of June's election was not what she wanted, \"those defining beliefs remain, my commitment to change in Britain is undimmed\". Her \"belief in the potential of the British people and what we can achieve together as a nation remains steadfast, and the determination I have to get to grips with the challenges posed by a changing world never more sure\", she will say. She will unveil a review - of casual and low-paid work - by Matthew Taylor, a former top adviser to Tony Blair, which she commissioned when she became prime minister. It is thought Mr Taylor, who has been examining the use of zero-hours contracts and the rise in app-based firms such as Uber and Deliveroo, will stop short of calling for a compulsory minimum wage for those employed in the so-called gig economy, who do not have guaranteed hours or pay rates. But he is expected to propose a series of extra rights for those in insecure jobs and could also recommend shaking up the tax system to reduce the gap between employees and the self-employed. He is also likely to call for measures to improve job satisfaction for people working in minimum wage jobs, according to The Guardian. 'Battle of ideas' In her speech, Mrs May will say: \"When I commissioned this report I led a majority government in the House of Commons. The reality I now face as prime minister is rather different. \"In this new context, it will be even more important to make the case for our policies and our values, and to win the battle of ideas both in Parliament as well as in the country. \"So I say to the other parties in the House of Commons... come forward with your own views and ideas about how we can tackle these challenges as a country. \"We may not agree on everything, but through debate and discussion - the hallmarks of our parliamentary democracy - ideas can be clarified and improved and a better way forward found.\" She will acknowledge the fragile nature of her position in the Commons but insist it will not stop her taking \"the bold action necessary to secure a better future\". Speaking at a press conference with Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull on Monday, Mrs May said she had sought input from other parties in the past on issues like counter-terrorism and modern slavery. She also said she was happy to work with Labour's Yvette Cooper and others in a cross-party approach to tackling intimidation and online abuse of MPs and others involved in the political process. Asked if her desire for co-operation extended to Brexit, including on the government's Repeal Bill when it is published later this week, the prime minister said she was seeking the \"broadest possible consensus\" surrounding the terms of the UK's exit. But former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said people would take the calls for cross-party working with \"a lorry load of salt\" - and he questioned why Mrs May had not raised the issue a year ago when she entered Number 10. \"The reason she wasn't asking for it then was she didn't need to,\" he said. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: \"A call for Labour to contribute is superfluous. On the single biggest issue of our generation, Brexit, Corbyn isn't contributing, he is cheerleading.\" Scottish Government Brexit minister Michael Russell said: \"If the prime minister is genuinely interested in creating a consensus then Scotland should have a seat at the negotiations to leave the EU.\" But Mr Green, who has known Mrs May since university and is effectively her deputy prime minister, said the public would welcome a move away from politics in which parties \"just sit in the trenches and shell each other\". \"Politicians of all parties are invited to contribute their ideas - that's a grown up way of doing politics,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Parties 'poles apart' He said Mrs May was motivated by \"her duty\" to carry on, adding: \"She still has the same ambitions for this country as she had a year ago and she's determined to put them into practice for the good of this country - that's what drives her.\" Asked if the PM could be tempted to step down after her summer holiday, he said: \"No. She thinks not just that it's her duty, but she has a programme for Britain that encompasses not just a good Brexit deal, but also a domestic agenda that will spread prosperity around this country, make this a fairer society, tackle some of the injustices that we still have in our society - and that fire burns within her as strongly as ever.\" The BBC's assistant political editor, Norman Smith, said that the Conservatives and Labour were \"poles apart\" on many significant policy areas. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: \"More brutally, Jeremy Corbyn is not minded to help Theresa May. He smells blood in the water. \"He wants to do everything he can to stampede Mrs May into another election, so the idea he might somehow seek to cooperate with her, I think, is bordering on the fanciful.\" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning", "output": "Theresa May urges rival parties to 'contribute and not just criticise'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

In many obituaries, it was claimed that she \"mastered\" American Sign Language, using over 1,000 signs, but some experts said the headlines praising her sign language skills were rather inaccurate. When she was about 12 months old, animal psychologist Francine \"Penny\" Patterson started to train her to use a version of American Sign Language. Her instructors said Koko used it to convey thoughts and feelings. Ms Patterson and her researchers documented that the gorilla understood some 2,000 words of spoken English. The abilities of the gorilla apparently to understand spoken English were documented by Ms Patterson and her researchers. However, sceptical linguists and scientists questioned Patterson's methods. They also debated how much of Koko's communication actually came from herself or how much we projected ourselves onto her. When Koko's death was announced, many news organisations, including the BBC, wrote headlines such as \"Koko: Gorilla who mastered sign language\" and \"Koko, famed gorilla that learned sign language\". Many social media users complimented her on her supposed language skills, but not all were convinced that she was actually using sign language. However, many people were impressed by her communication prowess. University of Birmingham's Dr Adam Schembri said the headlines need \"to be worded with care to avoid crating a misleading impression.\" He said Koko \"did not learn sign language\", but she mastered a number of modified American Sign Language signs, which is not the same as American Sign Language. Marcus Perlman, a linguist, who studied Koko as part of his research into ape communication, weighed in. Gerardo Ortega, a sign language researcher, said Koko never mastered sign language. He tweeted: \"At most she ritualised the use of some signs about the here and now and used them only after trainer promoted her.\" However, some sign language users see things differently, especially some people who said she inspired them to learn sign language. Speaking to BBC News, Prof Graham Turner of Heriot Watt University, said: \"Serious efforts to teach apes some signing began in the 1960s with researchers attempting to teach individual signs derived from American Sign Language (ASL). And the apes did learn to use some hand gestures in this way. \"But it is a distortion to imply that Koko or any ape has ever learned to use a natural signed language like a human being.\" Prof Turner said: \"These languages use the face, body and hands in an integrated way, exploiting their multidimensional, spatial medium through the layering of simultaneous and extremely precise visual elements. So communication in ASL or any such signed language entails acquiring command of a far more complex system of linguistic expression. \"That system must also permit the creation of new patterns and sequences - formed within the constraints of the system - for any context that may arise. With this kind of appreciation of sign language structure it is plain that 'signing' apes have never proven capable of displaying grammatical competence comparable to human fluency. \"Although the apes can use two or three signs in a sequence, close inspection of filmed data has repeatedly shown trainers prompting them, and then questionably interpreting separate responses as signed sentences.\" Whether she used sign language or not, her command of gestures was extraordinary for a gorilla. She connected not only with some humans but also with animals, especially kittens.", "output": "Koko: Gorilla death coverage rekindles language debate", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

HLF chairman Sir Peter Luff said the painting was \"a compelling historic icon, illustrating as it does a decisive conflict, inspiring female leadership, maritime power and the emergence of the Elizabethan 'Golden Age'\". \"This image has shaped our understanding of the Virgin Queen for over 400 years and I am delighted that it will now have such an appropriate permanent home in Greenwich,\" he added. The painting will be the centrepiece for the reopening of the Queen's House on 11 October. It will then undergo a conservation process to \"restore its fragile painted surfaces\" before becoming part of an exhibition and outreach programme, an Art Fund spokeswoman said. Among those who donated to the appeal were a seven-year-old Wakefield girl, who sold Elizabeth I cupcakes whilst dressed in a costume inspired by the painting, and pupils at St Paul's Girl School in London, who held a bake sale to raise funds. St Paul's history teacher Blanche Girouard said the girls \"study the portrait when we teach Elizabeth I and the Armada, so [they were] very keen to help save it for the nation\".

The singer was talking after a video about her personal experiences of racism went viral over the weekend. \"Some people that have posted [similar videos] have lost a lot of fans,\" she said. \"I think it's disgusting - but it just proves what we're saying.\" The star's Instagram video went up on Saturday as people around the US and the UK protested against the death of George Floyd. Pinnock, whose parents are mixed race, said she had \"the biggest awakening of my life\" when filming the video for Little Mix's 2012 single Wings. On the set, black director and choreographer Frank Gatson told her: \"You're the black girl. You have to work 10 times harder.\" She said: \"Never in my life had someone told me I would need to work harder because of my race.\" Later, the words rang true. \"My reality was feeling lonely while touring to predominately white countries where I sing to fans who don't see me, don't hear me, don't cheer me on,\" Pinnock said, holding back tears. \"My reality is constantly feeling like I have to work 10 times harder and longer to make my case in the group, because my talent alone isn't enough.\" She concluded the video by encouraging others to discuss their experiences of racism, in the hope of raising awareness and change. Speaking on This Morning on Tuesday, the star said her experiences had often been downplayed by the predominantly white team who work with Little Mix. \"People would say to me, 'It's in your head. Of course people love you, what do you mean?'\" That led to a sense of \"misplacement\" and \"feeling not like I really belonged\". However, she said she had been encouraged by the global response to Mr Floyd's death, and how that had opened up the conversation about race. \"I don't care if I lose fans,\" she said. \"Now the whole world is speaking about it and hopefully there is going to be a change. I feel hopeful.\" Her comments were echoed by fellow pop star Jamelia, who told BBC Breakfast that the \"ignorance and indifference of white people\" had allowed racism to flourish in the UK. \"You contribute by not being aware,\" she said, saying there were biases at play in the education system, the judicial system and in securing loans for homes and businesses. Once those issues were exposed, \"it's not enough to just say 'I'm not racist' because you're not a purveyor of overt racism,\" the Birmingham-born singer added. \"If you benefit from the system, knowing that people are being oppressed and affected by it, then you are racist. \"To be anti-racist you have to be actively a part of dismantling the systems that surround you and the systems that you benefit from.\" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

She said the government wants \"the benefits of this national asset to be spread far and wide, not just in London\". Channel 4 said a \"substantial relocation would be highly damaging\". The government carried out an 18-month review of the publicly-owned channel, which has more than 800 staff but fewer than 30 based outside central London. Ms Bradley will outline the consultation plans at the Nations and Regions Media Conference in Salford on Wednesday. Channel 4 is \"precious public asset\", she will say, but it must \"provide a platform for unheard voices and untold stories from right across the United Kingdom\". The consultation will look at whether the company should relocate all or some of its staff outside London, including the possibility of moving its headquarters. It will also review whether the amount of money spent on productions outside the M25, which is set at 35% of original British commissions, should increase to 50%. \"I am unsympathetic towards those who recoil in horror at the very idea of media jobs being based outside the capital,\" Ms Bradley will say. \"Or for those who insist that people with ideas in the West Midlands, west country or west Wales must travel to Westminster to get their programmes made.\" Too much talent outside London was being overlooked, she will add.

PM Julia Gillard has not confirmed this but a PNG minister said a request to house a centre had been made. The Manus Island centre was part of the so-called \"Pacific solution\" adopted by the John Howard government. Processing centres were set up there and on the tiny island of Nauru, the governments of the two nations receiving millions of dollars in aid in exchange. The Australian navy was deployed to divert all boats carrying asylum seekers to those camps, where many were detained for months under high security. Some went on hunger strike to protest against their living conditions and continued detention. Many Australians did support the policy but rights groups condemned it and accused Australia of failing to meet its obligations under refugee conventions. The policy was reversed in 2008 by Ms Gillard's predecessor, Kevin Rudd, after he defeated Mr Howard in a general election. But Australia has seen an increase in the number of people arriving by boat in recent months, prompting public calls for a tougher line. 'Failed policy' PNG Foreign Minister Don Polye said his country had been asked by Australia to house a centre. \"Australia is open to putting the centre anywhere, but Manus would be an ideal situation,\" ABC news quoted him as saying. He said a plan had been discussed at a special cabinet meeting on Friday. ABC reported that senior immigration department officials had visited Manus Island earlier this week. Ms Gillard - who had previously talked of putting a centre in East Timor - would not be drawn on the issue. \"What I would say is when the government's in the position to make an announcement about what has arisen, then we'll announce it and then people will have a full opportunity to analyse it,\" she said. Opposition leader Tony Abbott said that the move was vindication of the Howard government's policy. \"On its own Manus Island won't stop the boats and it won't end the protests,\" he said. \"And I think it is incumbent on the government to explain how something that was supposed to be an affront to human rights when John Howard did it is now necessary to protect our borders.\" But refugee advocate David Manne said the move would mean \"vulnerable people seeking our help are essentially cast into indefinite exile\". Amnesty International called it a retrograde step. \"This was a failed policy that was internationally condemned for breaching the human rights of some of the world's most vulnerable people,\" said the group's refugee spokesman Dr Graham Thom. \"It would appear that this is a clear attempt by the government to remove people from the oversight of the Australian courts, with the serious consequence that people in genuine need of protection may be rejected and sent back to where their lives may be at risk.\" Australia's immigration detention system has come under increased pressure in recent months, with growing numbers of asylum seekers from Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Iraq arriving by boat. Detainees unhappy with their treatment have rioted at both the Christmas Island and Villawood detention centres.

More than a quarter of all adults are now purchasing downloads or using legal streaming services, and in the third quarter of 2012, 51% of UK record label revenue came from digital sales. Bad news of course for the High Street (no wonder HMV has struggled) but evidence that British consumers have finally got the legal digital habit. Is pirated music going out of fashion? No, the survey shows that 345 million tracks were downloaded using BitTorrent in six months, and that's just one source. But in the same period, 239 million tracks were legally downloaded and, given that the industry used to reckon the ratio of illegal to legal downloads was 10:1, that looks like progress. There is certainly a new mood of optimism amongst the record labels and the report looks to an even brighter future where we all keep our legally obtained music in the cloud and stream it to our cars, our phones or our TVs, wherever we go. \"We're actually looking to a future where revenues could grow!\" an insider told me with some excitement. After years in which the industry has been slow to see the way through the digital jungle, it's at last got to grips with the idea that content plus convenience is the answer. Sure, consumers like the something for nothing that illegal file-sharing offers - but if you make it simple and attractive to get good music legally, they are increasingly happy to pay for it. Television has had a rather different experience with digital disruption. Fifteen years ago we assumed that the internet was about to cause major upheaval in the industry, with the channel, the schedule and live broadcasting all doomed to extinction as savvy consumers compiled their own menu of on-demand viewing. But in the UK that hasn't happened anything like as rapidly as predicted. The vast majority of TV viewing still involves turning on the main set, sitting back and watching what's on the main channels. In this industry, content and convenience have worked so far in the favour of the incumbents who can offer viewers plenty of compelling programmes and a simpler way of getting them than fiddling about on the internet. So television executives have become a little more relaxed about the threat to the status quo. This week, though, I think I saw a threat to that complacency. Sitting in bed, I started watching on a tablet computer the excellent Kevin Spacey in the American remake of that great 1990s political thriller, House of Cards. The series has been made not by a major broadcast network but by Netflix, the movie- and TV-streaming business which arrived in the UK from the US a couple of years ago. So far, it has made little impact here, struggling to match BskyB when it comes to hot new movies. In fact, I'd been about to end my subscription when I saw the publicity around the House of Cards launch. It looks as though Netflix has also learned that \"content plus convenience\" lesson. You can have the smartest technology platform around, but nobody will be that interested if you haven't got something to watch which can't be found elsewhere. And if the big content providers won't give you want you want, then make your own compelling programmes. It has cost Netflix a tidy sum - $100m apparently - to make House of Cards, but if that helps to build a global customer base it could be worth it. So, for a modest monthly fee you can now watch a whole top notch drama series without waiting a week for the next episode, and without having to turn on the TV or remembering to record it. If that catches on and is imitated by other new suppliers of video content, then maybe those predictions of the death of traditional telly won't look so far-fetched.", "output": "Music, TV and digital disruption", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

It was a similar picture at other universities which traditionally attract students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Edinburgh said applications increased by 24% - to 15,077. With 2,665 applications, demand at Aberdeen was up by 26%. St Andrews University reported an 11% rise. It is believed demand was also up at Glasgow School of Art and at Strathclyde University. The complete figures on applications for places at all UK institutions are due to be released by the admissions body UCAS later. The upturn is all the more remarkable at Edinburgh and St Andrews which charge \u00a39,000 each year - a total of \u00a336,000 for the four year degree. In England, where degrees are generally over three years, graduates usually pay no more than \u00a327,000 and also have one year less of living expenses such as rent and food. Prof Ian Diamond, Principal of Aberdeen University, which charges a total of \u00a327,000, said demand has gone up, not down, partly because of a strong marketing drive. He confessed that when fees were launched this year he was not sure that demand would hold up. He said: \"I think we have all worried because we were taking a step into the unknown with no data on which to make predictions. \"We simply had to remain confident that the offer that we had at the University of Aberdeen was at least the equal of that of anywhere else.\" Healthy demand Alexander McNab, from Suffolk, who is now a first year student at Aberdeen University suggested fees were not necessarily a barrier. He said: \"In many ways it is bargain because school fees are \u00a316,000 - \u00a326,000 in day and boarding schools. \u00a39,000 for university education seems like a lot of money but comparatively is quite cheap.\" The enviable international reputation of Scottish universities is another reason given for the healthy demand. It is believed the provision of new bursaries to compensate for fees is also a factor - but there remains concern that students from less well-off homes may still be deterred from applying. Early figures also seem to indicate more Scots are applying for university places. At Edinburgh demand was up 4.3%, at St Andrews it has risen by 4.5% and Glasgow saw a 10.2% increase.

The hackers created a counterfeit version of Apple's software for building iOS apps, which they persuaded developers to download. Apps compiled using the tool allow the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they control. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks - which has analysed the malware dubbed XcodeGhost - said the perpetrators would also be able to send fake alerts to infected devices to trick their owners into revealing information. It added they could also read and alter information in compromised devices' clipboards, which would potentially allow them to see logins copied to and from password management tools. Infected applications includes Tencent's hugely popular WeChat app, NetEase's music downloading app and Didi Kuaidi's Uber-like car hailing app. Some of the affected apps - including the business card scanner CamCard - are also available outside China. \"We've removed the apps from the App Store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software,\" said Apple spokeswoman Christine Monaghan. \"We are working with the developers to make sure they're using the proper version of Xcode to rebuild their apps,\" said Christine Monaghan. On its official WeChat blog, Tencent said the security issue affected an older version of its app - WeChat 6.2.5 - and that newer versions were not affected. It added that an initial investigation showed that no data theft or leakage of user information had occurred. Analysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter In Apple's walled garden App Store, this sort of thing shouldn't happen. The company goes to great lengths, and great expense, to sift through each and every submission to the store. Staff check for quality, usability and, above all else, security. The Apple App Store is generally considered a safe haven as the barrier to entry is high - there's only been a handful of instances of malware found on iOS apps, compared to Google's Play store which for a while was regarded as something of a \"Wild West\" for apps (until they introduced their own malware-scanning system too). It makes this attack all the more surprising, as it looks like two groups of supposedly informed people have been caught out. Firstly developers, who security researchers say were duped into using counterfeit software to build their apps, creating the right conditions for the malware to be applied. And secondly, Apple's quality testers, who generally do a very good job in keeping out nasties, but in this case couldn't detect the threat. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Developers targeted The malware was initially flagged by researchers at the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba. It discovered that the hackers had uploaded several altered versions of Xcode - a tool used to build iOS apps - to a Chinese cloud storage service. Then, about six months ago, the attackers posted links to the software on several forums commonly visited by Chinese developers. \"In China - and in other places around the world - sometimes network speeds are very slow when downloading large files from Apple's servers,\" explained Palo Alto Networks in a follow-up blog. \"As the standard Xcode installer is nearly three gigabytes, some Chinese developers choose to download the package from other sources.\" It added that potentially hundreds of millions of users might have been affected. Apple does have a security tool - called Gatekeeper - that is designed to alert users to unauthorised Mac programs and stop them from being run. However, it appears the developers must disabled the facility, allowing them to create iOS apps with XcodeGhost. Sense of security Despite the many news headlines about the breach, one expert said he did not forecast a major impact on the sale of Apple products. \"It is definitely embarrassing for Apple but the reality is that malware is a persistent problem since the days of PCs and the problem will multiply as the number of mobile devices explodes from 1.4 billion units in 2015 to 1.8 billion in 2020,\" Wee Teck Loo, head of consumer electronics at market research firm Euromonitor International, told the BBC. In fact, consumers are less cautious on mobile devices than on PCs, he added. \"In emerging markets like China or Vietnam, mobile devices are their first connected product and security is taken for granted,\" he said. \"Consumers in emerging markets are also less protective of privacy and security issues.\" Earlier this month, login names and passwords for more than 225,000 Apple accounts were stolen by cyber-thieves in China. It was uncovered by security firm Palo Alto Networks while investigating suspicious activity on many Apple devices. It found a malicious software family that targets jailbroken iPhones.

The party hammered out a minimum national wage, an hourly rate of 8.50 euros (\u00a37.11; $11.55) that will come into force for the first time in 2015. The new government will be slightly to the left of the previous one, in which the Christian Democrats/Christian Social Union were in coalition with the market-oriented Free Democrats (FDP), the BBC's Steve Evans reports from Berlin. But the SPD will form a minority part of the government and no-one doubts that Chancellor Merkel will be in charge, our correspondent says. As the EU's most industrialised and populous state, with its biggest economy, Germany dominates decision-making for the eurozone. New faces \"I accept the election result and thank you for your trust,\" said Mrs Merkel after the confirmation vote in the Bundestag. Smiling, she received a bouquet of flowers and shook hands with other MPs. She was due to visit President Joachim Gauck at his palace before returning to parliament to be sworn in. For Tuesday's vote, 621 members of parliament were present, of whom 150 voted against Mrs Merkel. Between them, the Left Party and the Greens have 127 seats, so at least 23 of those who rejected her nomination were from the parties making up the new coalition. The coalition talks had been the longest for any German government since since World War 2. The CDU/CSU and SPD finally signed the deal, a 185-page agreement entitled \"Shaping Germany's Future\", late last month. Mrs Merkel was obliged to turn to the SPD after the FDP failed to win any seats in the 22 September election, falling short of the 5% hurdle to enter the Bundestag. Trusted Merkel ally Wolfgang Schaeuble will remain finance minister in the new government, one of 10 CDU/CSU politicians in the 16-strong cabinet. \"His name stands for euro stability and I'm glad that he's continuing,\" Mrs Merkel said after news of the new line-up emerged. Other CDU/CSU picks include Ursula von der Leyen as defence minister and Thomas de Maiziere as interior minister. For the SPD, party chairman Sigmar Gabriel will become economy minister and deputy chancellor, while Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be foreign minister.", "output": "German parliament confirms Angel Merkel for new term", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The heart of the expanded campus will be the refurbished Mackintosh building, which was damaged by fire in 2014. A \u00a320m fundraising drive to restore the Mackintosh has raised \u00a317m. That target will now be increased to \u00a332m to cover the restoration and campus expansion. GSA director Prof Tom Inns said: \"Over the last 10 years the GSA has undertaken phased developments of the campus in Garnethill, refurbishing some buildings, replacing others that were no longer fit for purpose and constructing the Reid Building. \"The Mackintosh building fire required the school to pause and reconsider, but we are now moving forward to create a newly extended campus with the restored Mackintosh building at its heart.\" 'Support collaboration' Prof Inns said the aimed for acquisition of the former Stow College site was \"a fundamental element of our new estate development strategy\". \"It will mean that the GSA can bring together all pathways in the School of Fine Art in one specially-adapted building for first time in over 50 years,\" he said. \"It will also mean we can create the space to support collaboration across our disciplines as well as with other academic, third-sector and industry partners.\" Prof Inns added: \"This next phase of our campus development will help us achieve our academic aspiration to become a global leader in studio-based learning and research, provide the space to accommodate a 25% increase in our student numbers by 2018, and importantly provide the GSA with space for future growth.\" GSA hopes to complete the purchase of the former Stow College site in the next few weeks. If this goes ahead, refurbishment works will begin in the summer, with the School of Fine Art moving into the building from autumn 2017.

This follows multi-party discussions at Stormont Castle. It was also proposed that the cross-community vote which elects David Ford as justice minister should be extended. His appointment runs out at the end of April. Alliance Party leader David Ford criticised the plans to abolish the Department for Employment and Learning without looking at other areas of government. The post is currently held by Alliance's Stephen Farry. Mr Ford said his party was not against a reduction in the number of assembly departments but said there was a need for a single strong department of the economy. \"We see what is apparently a carve-up, a fix to transfer some DEL functions to a Sinn Fein-controlled department in education and some to a DUP-controlled department in department of trade and investment,\" he said. \"That looks to me, not just as potentially seen as malicious towards the Alliance Party but is actually extremely bad government, not to keep the economy departments together but to further fragment them when we should be moving towards move streamlined government,\" he said. \"It's hardly because Stephen Farry hasn't been a good minister because in terms of tackling difficult issues like tuition fees or the future of teacher training, Stephen has shown that he's prepared to be a good hardworking minister so it's not because he's been a failure. There has to be some other reason.\" The scrapping of the Department for Employment and Learning was raised with Mr Ford by First Minister Peter Robinson. Mr Robinson said there was not one proposition that all the parties were prepared to sign up to. \"There are elements of the proposal that we have put forward which will be less difficult for some parties than the original proposition and of course for one party it will not be as sweet as the existing proposition,\" he said. \"However we believe it is our best attempt at trying to get the highest level of consensus and to move forward on a robust basis, so I think we have got a very workable proposal.\" Mr McGuinness said the office of the first and deputy first minister was committed to tackling \"the size of the assembly and the number of departments\". \"The whole issue of d'Hondt will be considered in the course of our deliberations through 2012 and we've committed to getting a resolution to that,\" he said. \"This decision is a very decisive decision, it's about leadership in the absence of consensus and it's about moving forward in a way that gives confidence to people, that the work of policing and justice is not in any way going to be damaged or interrupted.\" SDLP Environment Minister Alex Attwood said the proposal was a \"missed opportunity\". \"The SDLP argued that d'Hondt and only d'Hondt should be the standard for distribution of ministerial office,\" he said. \"The DUP and Sinn Fein have also decided, with the stroke of a pen, to do away with a government department. As with d'Hondt, both again demonstrate a fast and loose approach to government, deciding in a blink of an eye which departments stay or go. \"This decision, taken without proper interrogation and consideration, looks arbitrary and political.\" Under the proposals, responsibility for universities would be given to the education minister, with job centres and other powers going to the enterprise department.

The last time the cicadas emerged in many of those regions was in 2003 and 2004, though some areas saw an emergence in 2013. As many as 1.5 million of the insects can emerge per acre of land. While they are some of the longest-lived insects in the world, periodical cicadas spend almost their entire lives underground as what entomologists call \"nymphs\". They live in the soil and feed on tree roots for periods of either 13 or 17 years depending on the species, according to Virginia Tech university. The species make up 15 separate \"broods\", with Brood IX (nine) emerging this year as part of their 17-year cycle. When the nymphs are ready, they build mud tubes - called a cicada hut - in the soil and crawl out to find a place to moult into their winged adult form and to mate. They are not harmful to humans and can be a food source for animals and birds. They only live for two to four weeks as adults but during that time can cause significant damage to young trees - including apple, dogwood, peach, hickory, cherry, and pear - as well as to vines and saplings where females lay their eggs. The male cicadas are also very loud, \"singing\" by vibrating membranes on their abdomen to court females. The sound is described by Virginia Tech as like a \"field of out-of-tune car radios\". Why the insects emerge on those specific intervals remains unclear, though some researchers think it could help them avoid predators.

Dyfed-Powys Police said the force was in discussions with the auditors. Carmarthenshire council said it was pleased the auditor did not rule its pension policy as unlawful. The public spending watchdog report said that both authorities had acted unlawfully in allowing the chief executives to opt out of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) to avoid potential tax payments. Mr James was also unlawfully given an indemnity against potential libel costs. Assistant auditor general Anthony Barrett said: \"Carmarthenshire council has acted unlawfully on two fundamental issues, both of which the public need to be fully aware of. \"The authority has taken decisions and used taxpayers' money in areas that they do not have the legal powers to do so.\" In a separate report on Pembrokeshire council, Mr Barrett concluded similar pension arrangements for some senior officers were also contrary to law. It is expected that by the end of March 2014, \u00a351,011 will have been paid to chief executive Mr Jones and one other senior officer. The auditor said the decisions to allow certain officers to receive payments, and then for payments to be made, were unlawful on several grounds. \"The public should be able to expect the highest standards of decision making at local authorities and the council must now address the procedural weaknesses I have identified in my report,\" he said. \"It needs to demonstrate to its electorate that it is operating in accordance with the law and in line with good governance principles.\" Mr Barrett said neither council had the lawful power to give cash supplements in lieu of pension contributions to avoid tax liabilities, but said it was up to the local authorities whether they tried to claw back any money. 'Contrary to law' Mr Barrett conducted two reports into Carmarthenshire council - the first into pension payments, and another into the decision to grant an indemnity to the chief executive to bring a libel counterclaim. He said the council acted \"contrary to law\" by allowing senior officers to opt out of the LGPS. More than \u00a327,000 was paid to Mr James under the scheme since 2012. Mr Barrett said the council had since \"rescinded its decision to offer a pay supplement in lieu of pension contributions and announced that no further payments will be made to the chief executive from January 2014\". The original decision taken in November 2011 was considered by the council's executive board without appearing on the agenda and without being open to inspection by members of the public. In his report on the libel indemnity, the auditor said the council \"does not have the legal powers to make such payments and there were inadequacies in the processes adopted by the council when making the decision\". It concerned Mr James's libel action against Jacqui Thompson, a blogger who was arrested after filming a council meeting on her mobile phone. He won the case and Ms Thompson was ordered to pay costs of \u00a323,217. Her own attempt to sue Mr James for libel during the course of the dispute was rejected. Carmarthenshire has paid out more than \u00a326,000 in external legal costs since 2012 under the decision to indemnify its chief executive. The auditor added: \"The libel counterclaim is still on-going and it is unclear what the final external legal costs to the council will be.\" Carmarthenshire council said is was pleased the report did not think its pensions policy was unlawful but that its procedural process was flawed. It said steps had been taken to sure ensure such matters are considered as separate items on an agenda. The council said it remained convinced that indemnifying Mr James in the libel action was correct, and claimed the audit office had not objected to the policy when first consulted on it. The local authority noted that the audit office had changed its mind on the issue some months later, and claimed it was \"too late for us to turn back the clock\". Pembrokeshire council also insisted its pension payment policy was lawful. Reacting to the report, deputy leader Rob Lewis said: \"While I note the auditor's views in relation to the decision taken, I am pleased he has concluded the council could take a lawful decision once a number of procedural matters have been addressed.\" 'Consequences' Janet Finch-Saunders, the Welsh Conservatives' shadow minister for local government, said: \"These reports are further evidence of the need for a Wales-wide review of senior pay in Welsh local authorities, which is out of control and failing to deliver value for money for hardworking families.\" She told BBC Good Morning Wales: \"We do have some excellent local authorities, but this has cast a shadow now over... our chief executives, who do work within their remit in an honest and transparent manner. \"As to the consequences, it's time now for the chief executive Mark James to resign or, certainly, be instantly dismissed.\" Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru called for councillors who approved Carmarthenshire's pension and libel case payments to resign. Rhodri Glyn Thomas, the party's AM for Carmarthenshire East and Dinefwr, has also called for Mr James to quit. He added: \"This is a very dark day for Carmarthenshire, a dark day for democracy in Carmarthenshire, and is an example of what happens when you have a very weak executive and a council controlled by powerful unelected officers.\" The chair of the public accounts committee, Darren Millar, said the reports showed both councils had fallen well below expected standards. The committee will now consider these findings as part of a wider inquiry into senior managers' pay in the Welsh public sector. Dyfed-Powys Police said it was \"aware of the reports\" and \"whilst the matter hasn't been referred to us, we are in discussions with the auditor and will be making an assessment in relation to any appropriate action by the police\".", "output": "Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire made unlawful payments says watchdog", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

However, entries in the Domesday Book shows records of vineyards in 42 locations, and wine making continued after the Dark Ages, championed by the nobility and the Royal Family. Today, the Queen continues to endorse British wines. She chose a Ridgeview Estate wine, a sparkling wine grown using classic Champagne vines in Sussex, for her 80th birthday celebrations in 2006. Michael Roberts, chairman of English Wine Producers, said the Royal Family's interest was a coup for the country's vineyard owners.

Her death was a \"wake-up call\" for Southern Health although no single action had caused it, coroner Grahame Short told the inquest in Winchester.

The hearing was told Mrs Munns behaved erratically in the weeks before her death, obsessively drinking water and shouting out numbers. On 12 November, she became agitated and aggressive at her Southampton home. Her daughter, Kim Vella, 57, said she phoned her mother's Southern Health carer but was told the office was closing and she should dial 999. In her evidence earlier, the carer Emma Bulbrooke said she tried to phone several doctors and two mental health units, but no one was immediately available. The inquest heard there was no dedicated out-of-hours service for older mental health patients because the NHS would not fund one. While the family waited for help, Mrs Munns fled through an upstairs window. Her body was later found on the motorway at Rownhams, two miles away. In a narrative verdict, Mr Short said Mrs Munns' failure to take her anti-psychotic medication led to her death.

Survivors say the migrants had refused to transfer to a smaller ship, fearing it was less sea-worthy. Traffickers ended the argument by sinking their vessel. For the Bakr family - who are Palestinians - this was the second catastrophe in recent years. Hamas drove them from Gaza in 2007 and seized their business interests. They settled in Egypt but faced many problems so - for the first time - some turned to the traffickers. \"I was completely against it but they kept saying there was no future here, or back home in Gaza,\" said Atef Bakr, a family elder who stayed behind. \"They had this dream to get to Europe and to have a decent life for themselves and their children.\" Mr Bakr, a former colonel in the Palestinian security forces, has the slow speech and reddened eyes of a man crushed by grief. These days he spends his time searching for updates about the disaster and mourning almost two dozen relatives, including his brother, his son and his grandson. His mother, Amina, sat alongside in a white headscarf, recalling better days in Gaza. \"We used to eat together, drink together, do everything together. We hope to God to be reunited one day. We hope to hear that they are all right,\" she said, before giving way to tears. In a bitter irony, most of the dead were strong swimmers as the family were fishermen. \"They used to swim in the sea in all seasons,\" said Mr Bakr. \"They could deal with rough seas and cold water. They were still young. How could they drown?\" The Bakrs set sail from Damietta in northern Egypt where people smuggling is a growth industry. There are said to be about 20 departure points along the coast. \"Last year trafficking wasn't organised but now the gangs are getting connected with each other and the business is getting bigger,\" said Muhammed Al Kashef, a researcher for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR). \"The traffickers now have more money and more power,\" he said. \"By next year it will be hard to tackle them.\" Mr Al Kashef, who advocates on behalf of migrants and monitors traffickers, says Palestinians, Egyptians, Libyans and Syrians are now involved in the trade. The key traffickers and brokers are shadowy figures known only by nicknames like Abu Hamada (also called the Doctor and the Captain), and the General. Migrants pay at least $2,000 (\u00a31,200) and sometimes up to $4,000 per person, depending on the condition of the boat. The traffickers operate from public places - including harbours alongside tourist beaches - when the coast is clear. Mr Al Kashef says they work between dawn and 5pm to avoid coastguard patrols at night. When migrants arrive at the departure point they are put on fishing boats that ferry them out to larger vessels in international waters. They spend two to three days there waiting for the boat to be filled with hundreds of migrants. When the ship is packed they begin the voyage to Italy. They are transferred en-route to another vessel that brings them to Italian territorial waters. The traffickers then phone an SOS to the coastguard and dump the migrants in the sea. More than 3,000 have drowned in the Mediterranean this year, according to the International Organisation for Migration. But the European Border Agency, Frontex, says a record number - 182,156 - have made it to Europe by sea. That is three times the total for 2013. The dramatic increase in arrivals has prompted European nations to plan their biggest ever exercise to detect migrants. Operation Triton, which will involve more than 20 European countries, is due to begin on 1 November. But the focus will be on border control, not search and rescue. Aid agencies fear that more migrants will now die at sea. 'Panic and exhaustion' Abu Baraa, a father of five, knows the perils of the voyage to Europe only too well. The Syrian refugee, who asked us not to use his full name, has already tried the journey 10 times. In April he was stranded at sea for a week with his wife and children. \"There were 160 Syrians on the boat and 64 Egyptians,\" he said. \"On the third day they told us there was no more water, so we started drinking sea water. It was hot during the day and cold at night. My children became terrified of the sea. Words can't describe the panic and exhaustion and hunger. Those seven days were like seven years.\" They wound up back in Egypt after the traffickers had a row between themselves over money. \"Another boat was chasing us and trying to drown us,\" Abu Baraa said. \"The captain on our boat was very courageous and sailed back to the shore very quickly.\" His wife and children finally made it to Europe in July but he couldn't afford to go with them. He proudly shows me a photograph of his four-year-old daughter Farah, clutching yellow balloons, on her first day at school in Germany. \"I can't say I'm not afraid of the crossing but if I get the money, I'm going to try again,\" he said. \"They are in one place and I am in another. I am like a body without a soul.\" Single conviction If Abu Baraa makes another attempt, drowning is not the only risk he will face. He could be detained by Egyptian police as he tries to board the boat. More than 4,300 migrants have been arrested so far this year trying to leave the country, according to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal rights. This includes eight members of the Bakr family - four of them children - who were due to join their relatives on the ill-fated boat from Damietta. They spent six weeks in custody before being released. Campaigners here say the police are more focused on targeting migrants than those who prey on them. The authorities deny any collusion with bosses of the lucrative people smuggling trade.

They had slid down a natural water slide into a pool where they were meant to climb out. But the coroner ruled the local guide had not adequately explained this. The families said the deaths were \"wholly preventable\". The coroner, Chris Dorries, heard how the three friends had worn life jackets and helmets as they slid head first down the water slide before ending up in a 6ft deep pool. But, instead of getting out, the trio continued into the next tier of the river complex and died when they went over the waterfall. The inquest heard how their guide, Dang Van Si, said he warned them about how to get out of the pool safely. However, a range of witnesses, who were found through a Facebook appeal by Mr Sloan's family, contradicted this. You may also be interested in: On Tuesday, Mr Dorries said he did not accept the guide's account and ruled that he had either not given a warning at all or not ensured it was properly understood. Speaking after the inquest the father of Ms Squire and Ms Anderson, David Squire, said he did not know how the criminal investigation into the deaths was progressing in Vietnam. Mr Squire said: \"To be clear, the events and circumstances that led to their deaths were wholly preventable.\" Giving a narrative conclusion, Mr Dorries said: \"They were not adequately warned of the risks to be found at the bottom of the slide and, in particular, that there was a potentially lethal hazard of a further waterfall which they could be swept in from only 14 metres further on.\" Mr Dorries said that, contrary to reports at the time, the three travellers had done nothing to compromise their own safety.", "output": "Vietnam waterfall death tourists 'were not warned of danger'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The homeless man fled into the forest near Oppenau, in south-west Germany, on Sunday after threatening four police officers and taking their pistols. He is reported to have his own pistol too, plus a knife and bow and arrows. A police wanted notice names him as Yves Rausch, 31, and the photo shows a bald man with a goatee beard and glasses. It warns the public not to approach him. He has spent time in jail previously for firearms offences. The gunman's mother told the Baden online website she had not been in contact with him since he went on the run. \"They should withdraw all their forces. After one or two days he'll come out of the forest by himself,\" she said. What is known about 'Rambo'? Police say he has lived in the Oppenau area a long time and he is believed to know the forest well. His mother says he was evicted from his rented flat last year. It is unclear if it is the same one which Germany's Bild daily says he had rented above a local inn last year, where he had set up a shooting range in his attic. He had gone to stay at an aunt's home before finally making a home for himself in the forest, his mother added. She described him as a \"woodsman\", saying \"he wanted to escape into nature, to be free\". Police found him on Sunday in a hut on the edge of the forest, and said he had first appeared co-operative before suddenly pulling out a pistol and disarming the four officers. He was wearing camouflage gear. According to his mother, he grew his own vegetables, used the hut as his home, and carved wooden gnomes which he hoped to sell. Media reports have nicknamed him \"Rambo\" after the fictional, violent Vietnam war veteran who goes on the run from US police. His mother said she had had a coffee with him at a local market on 8 July and he had appeared \"perfectly normal\". But she said she saw him rarely, he was a loner and his father had died in 2018. A state prosecutor involved in the case, Herwig Sch\u00e4fer, said the fugitive had \"a passion for guns\". How is the manhunt going? Police are examining an anonymous so-called \"manifesto\" left in a local bar, which may have been written by Yves Rausch. It is titled \"The Call of the Wild\" and argues that people who live close to nature are superior to modern, urban society. About 200 police are involved in the arduous search and police say it is difficult terrain - there are few tracks in the forest, it is very hilly and they have found no trace of Yves Rausch so far. They have checked some derelict buildings and old ruined bunkers as possible hideouts. A newspaper in the region, Badische Zeitung, quotes police as saying the area cannot be cordoned off and each officer is carrying a backpack of up to 30kg (66 pounds).

Newcastle University academics said 6.1% of adverts seen by children were about junk food before the ban - the figure was 7% after the ban. They said young people do not just watch children's programmes, to which the rules apply. Sugared drinks The researchers measured the amount unhealthy food advertising six months before the restrictions were introduced in 2007, and again six months after they were fully implemented in 2009. They linked this data to how many people saw the adverts, and found there was a rise in the promotion of less healthy items such as crisps, sugared breakfast cereals and drinks containing large amounts of sugar. The overall proportion of unhealthy items in food adverts increased from 38.6% to 60.4% over this period, and from 5.7% to 8.7% among all adverts. There was a slight decrease in the amount of food advertising as a part of all advertising, from 14.8% to 14.5%. The team noted that although most of the adverts stuck to the rules, children were still being exposed to junk food ads during other programming not particularly aimed at them. Their exposure to junk food adverts went from 6.1% to 7%, which is not a big enough change to be considered a \"statistical increase\". 'Advertising works' Dr Jean Adams, lecturer in public health at Newcastle University, said: \"While adverts stay within the letter of the law, I think we can say we're still not getting the spirit of the law. \"These regulations were brought in to help young people make better lifestyle choices and encourage a healthier diet. \"However, what they are seeing is exactly the same amount of advertising for food which is high in salt or high in sugar and fat as before the regulations came in.\" \"We know advertising works - otherwise food companies wouldn't use it - so we have a duty to further tighten up the restrictions particularly if we're going to help our young people grow up to make good choices about the food they eat.\" The restrictions were phased in by the watchdog Ofcom from 2007 amid concerns about the level of child obesity. They apply to children's programmes, children's channels and programmes that are expected to attract a lot of young viewers. Ofcom said its own studies indicated the contrary, that there had been a decrease in how much young people viewed adverts for unhealthy food. An Ofcom spokeswoman said: \"We note the research from the University of Newcastle. Our final review of the rules, which included a full year of data from 2009, showed a significant reduction (37%) in children's exposure to adverts for products that were high in fat, salt and sugar since 2005.\" A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"Being overweight and not eating well is bad for our health. Controlling the advertising of food to children is important, but it is only part of the picture. \"We are taking action, including through Change4Life and the Responsibility Deal. We want to make sure that children get the best start possible in life and to make it easier for families to make good choices about food. \"Ofcom introduced significantly tougher restrictions on advertising foods high in fat, salt and sugar to children in 2007.\" 'Protect children' The British Heart Foundation (BHF) said the research highlighted a \"loophole\" in the regulations. BHF policy manager Mubeen Bhutta said: \"To protect children all junk food adverts should be screened after the 9pm watershed and we want to see consistent advertising regulations across all forms of media, including online, to protect our children. \"It's time for the government to put the health of our children above the health of the advertising industry.\" The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) said the research demonstrated that the current rules did not go far enough. Dr Kate Allen, director of science and communications at WCRF, said: \"Children watch programmes other than kids' TV shows and regulation should be extended to any programme where children make up a significant share of the audience. \"We would also like regulators to tackle the growth of online advertising and marketing aimed at children as well as areas like sports sponsorship.\" The research, funded by the Medical Research Council's National Prevention Research Initiative, is published in Plos One.", "output": "Children 'watch same level' of junk food ads despite TV rules", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Ministers also want to see the broadcast of TV adverts for unhealthy food banned before the 21:00 watershed.

He said: \"This is an amazing step towards making sure the healthiest choice is the easiest choice - for everyone. \"Today, Scotland has set an example to the rest of the world. It has picked up the baton that Westminster dropped last year. So, now the ball is back in the UK government's court. \"We need to ensure everyone in Britain has a chance to raise their children in a healthy environment.\" Public health minister Aileen Campbell said obesity \"significantly increases\" the risk of developing conditions like diabetes, heart disease and depression. Ms Campbell launched a consultation on the plans at Tynecastle Stadium in Edinburgh, where she met participants in the Football Fans in Training programme. She later told MSPs that the government was putting forward \"bold\" measures which would \"make a real, lasting difference to the country's health\". These include plans to restrict price promotions on food and drink high in fat, sugar and salt in areas around visitor attractions and on routes to schools, and \u00a340m of investment to deliver almost 100,000 \"supported weight management interventions\" for people with or at risk of type two diabetes. Ms Campbell also said that if the UK government did not commit to banning TV adverts for unhealthy food before the 21:00 watershed, the Scottish government would ask for powers to be devolved so it could do so itself. The SNP MSP said: \"Simply put, it's harming the people of Scotland. It also puts pressure on the NHS, other public services and our economy. \"That is why we need commitment and action from everyone across all sectors and at all levels including government, citizens, the public sector and businesses right across the country.\" Health and retail organisations broadly welcomed the consultation, alongside opposition parties. Cancer Research UK said it was \"great to see a range of bold proposals\" in the strategy, saying that Scotland has been \"in the grip of an obesity epidemic for far too long\". The British Medical Association Scotland said \"ambitious\" action was needed \"across every part of society in Scotland if we are to successfully reduce levels of obesity in future years\".

Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said efforts to tackle obesity \"could not come soon enough\", stressing the need to work across parties and portfolios to do so.

She added: \"The Welsh first minister should make it clear to her that Wales has specific interests which need to be represented during any negotiations over leaving the EU.\" Mrs May succeeded David Cameron as prime minister last Wednesday and vowed to lead a \"one nation\" government. Mr Jones previously admitted he knew \"very little\" about Mrs May - who he had never met before - but hoped she would be able to deliver an improved devolution settlement. Analysis by BBC Wales political editor Nick Servini Theresa May and Carwyn Jones may be well apart politically but they have one thing in common: neither wanted the UK to leave the EU but they have to deal with the consequences. This brief meeting at the assembly was above all a \"get to know you\" session, and an opportunity for the new prime minister to go to all corners of the UK before a summer filled with meeting global leaders. There wasn't much to unpick from her brief interview afterwards, but I thought her call for the Welsh Government to be \"involved and engaged\" went further than expected. I asked whether the UK government would be prepared to make up any financial shortfall facing Wales after a Brexit. There was no definitive response, other than she recognised the concerns. It will take much longer for developments to take shape although there is a growing sense of the potential timings for the start of official negotiations. Welsh Government officials say Mrs May reiterated her view that triggering article 50 (to officially launch the two-year Brexit process) would be difficult this side of January. Mr Jones has now altered his view that the process should begin sooner rather than later. He now believes it should start in the first six months of 2017.", "output": "Brexit: Theresa May wants Welsh Government 'engaged' in talks", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The 48-year-old denies the charges and told a court on Friday that he had been subjected to threats and abuse by a security service investigator. The comments came as his pre-trial custody was extended until 29 August. Mr Whelan told the court that there was \"absolutely no legitimacy\" to the case against him, describing it as retaliation for US sanctions. If found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in prison. He said he had not showered in two weeks, was unable to access medical or dental treatment and had been denied access to books and letters sent to him months ago. \"I've been threatened. My personal safety has been threatened. There are abuses and harassment that I am constantly subjected to,\" he said. The court hearing on Friday was held behind closed doors but visitors were permitted to attend the opening and the reading of the ruling. An official at the US embassy in Moscow said Washington was extremely concerned by Mr Whelan's claims. The comments marked a shift in tone from previous statements by the former marine, who told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in February that he was \"holding up well\" after two months in custody but could not talk publicly about the charge against him for fear of making his situation worse. In the courtroom Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow Paul Whelan is angry and he's no longer hiding it. Standing inside a metal cage in court the former US marine declared that his detention in Moscow and the charge of espionage was a political kidnap, with nothing legitimate about it. Moments later he told the judge he wanted to complain about his interrogator from Russia's FSB security service, saying \"his actions, abuse, harassment and the threats on my life are unprofessional and should not be tolerated\". The judge ignored him. These are by far the strongest comments Mr Whelan has ever made in his case. He's been held now for five months in an FSB prison, accused of receiving Russian state secrets on a flash drive from a friend. He denies the charge, saying he thought the drive contained photographs from a tourist trip. Earlier he had said he wanted to make a statement to Donald Trump and to the US Congress, but his masked FSB guards told him he was forbidden to speak. The US ambassador in Moscow has said no evidence has been presented in this case in five months and called on Russia to 'quit playing games' The hearing itself is closed - as an espionage case - and labelled top secret. Why was he arrested? Mr Whelan arrived in Russia on 22 December to attend a wedding and had planned to visit St Petersburg in addition to Moscow before flying home on 6 January, his brother told the BBC. He was arrested in Moscow on 28 December after taking a group of wedding guests on a tour of the Kremlin museums. Russia's FSB state security agency said he was detained \"during an act of espionage\". Mr Whelan's Russian lawyer has said the arrest was made after he was unwittingly handed a memory stick containing state secrets. Who is he? Mr Whelan was born in Canada to British parents but moved to the US as a child. He is currently director of global security for Michigan-based automotive components supplier BorgWarner. His brother has said Mr Whelan had been visiting Russia for business and pleasure since 2007. Mr Whelan joined the Marine Reserves in 1994 and rose to the rank of staff sergeant in 2004. He served in Iraq for several months in 2004 and 2006. He was convicted in a 2008 court martial on charges related to larceny and received a bad-conduct discharge.

It was Margaret Thatcher. She told BBC Radio Four's Women's Hour: \"Thatcher was prime minister, the economy wasn't in great shape, lots of people around me were looking at a life or an immediate future of unemployment and I think that certainly gave me a strong sense of social justice and, at that stage, a strong feeling that it was wrong for Scotland to be governed by a Tory government that we hadn't elected.\" But, unlike the many who chose to support Labour - then the dominant force in Scottish politics - she was persuaded by the argument that that nation would only truly prosper with independence. After studying law at Glasgow University and working as a solicitor at the city's Drumchapel Law Centre, Ms Sturgeon's entry into full-time politics came at the age of 29, when she was elected to the new Holyrood parliament in 1999, as a Glasgow regional MSP. As a frontbench opposition spokeswoman, she sought to hold the Labour-Lib Dem coalition government to account on education, justice and health. In the parliament's early days, Ms Sturgeon had a reputation for being too serious, which partly earned her the title \"nippy sweetie\" - but friends and rivals alike are at pains to point out her lighter side. Fiona Hyslop, another long-serving SNP activist who is now Scotland's culture secretary, attested to Ms Sturgeon's strong sense of humour. Recalling Ms Sturgeon in her 20s, Ms Hyslop, said: \"She was always quite guarded, to make sure that she didn't do or say anything that perhaps would cause difficulty later. \"So she was always, in that sense, very sensible - but good fun.\" One of her biggest political opponents, Michael Moore, who often found himself working with Ms Sturgeon during his time as Scottish secretary, jovially recalls her rehearsing Mandarin on the Edinburgh Airport runway while awaiting the arrival of the pandas from China. Back in 2004, times were certainly serious for the SNP. Beset by in-fighting and the negative publicity of a leadership challenge, the party's troubles were being exposed to voters in full view. When John Swinney quit as leader, Ms Sturgeon saw her chance - knowing that although the situation had given her the opportunity to lead the party, the pressure was also on to unite the SNP as an election-winning force. But then came the unexpected news that Alex Salmond would stand as leader - for a second time. When he offered her the chance to run with him on a joint ticket as his deputy, Ms Sturgeon, who had always done her own thing when it came to politics, had to think it over. After reaching what she called an \"instinctive\" position, her leadership manifesto was withdrawn little more than a week after its launch, and the rest was history. The Salmond-Sturgeon leadership was a success for the party. Immediately after the leadership contest - and with her new boss still an MP at Westminster - Ms Sturgeon boosted her profile as the SNP's \"Holyrood leader\", grilling Labour's Jack McConnell at first minister's questions every week. Nicola Sturgeon - a private life The work paid off with the SNP's 2007 election win, with Ms Sturgeon becoming Scotland's deputy first minister and health secretary. She also won the Labour-held Glasgow Govan seat - the scene of past historic victories by SNP veterans Margo MacDonald and Jim Sillars. At the same time, commentators noted Ms Sturgeon had undergone something of an image revamp and, it seemed, had adopted more of a common touch, which she later put down to having greater confidence in her abilities. She began as health secretary by seeing through popular SNP pledges, like reversing A&E closures and scrapping prescription charges. And she was later thrust into the international public eye during the global swine flu crisis, giving regular and incisive press briefings and updates after the first UK cases were confirmed in Scotland, becoming a fixture on 24-hour news channels. Her time at the top end of Scottish politics quickly became characterised by electoral success, with Ms Sturgeon spearheading the SNP campaign as the party won an unprecedented majority at Holyrood in 2011. She later described the result - and the dismantling of Labour strongholds across the country - as having broken the mould of Scottish politics, and put the SNP's success down to being \"in touch with the country it served\". Some five years after taking on the health brief, Ms Sturgeon accepted one of the Scottish government's biggest roles, as the \"Yes Minister\" overseeing the independence referendum. Westminster's negotiator, the then Scottish Secretary Michael Moore, saw Ms Sturgeon's appointment as a sign things were about to get serious. He later said she was straightforward to work with \"once you understand where she's coming from\". The dream shall never die The referendum itself, on 18 September 2014, was a massive disappointment for everyone on the side of independence. They were beaten by 55% to 45%. It was a severe blow for Ms Sturgeon - she told reporters she was \"deeply disappointed\" as the result became clear, albeit \"exhilarated\" by the campaign - but it was ultimately one which would propel her to the top of Scottish politics. Within hours of the final result being confirmed, Alex Salmond announced he would step down as first minister and leader of the SNP. Ms Sturgeon was immediately tipped as the natural successor; she said she could \"think of no greater privilege than to seek to lead the party I joined when I was just 16\". Ultimately, there was no competition. More of a coronation, at the party's conference that November - although the new SNP leader said she would have \"relished\" a contest. She opened her premiership more like a rock star than a politician, embarking on a sold-out stadium tour amid a blaze of popular support. Party conferences and speech events followed suit, employing slick presentation to build Ms Sturgeon into an almost presidential figure. And in the meantime, despite the disappointment of the referendum defeat the SNP's membership surged, with tens of thousands of new members signing up - and Ms Sturgeon was to ride this wave of support to new highs. Ballot-box behemoth The party had already been the biggest kid on the block in Scottish politics; it had won a Holyrood majority in 2011 and the most council seats in 2012. But with Ms Sturgeon at the helm the party truly became an electoral juggernaut, starting with the 2015 general election. The results were unprecedented. They were stunning. Ms Sturgeon's troops came close to sweeping the board entirely, taking 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland. The swingometer went off the charts; huge Labour majorities were wiped out, with heavyweights including Douglas Alexander and Margaret Curran defenestrated - the former by a 20-year-old named Mhairi Black. The trend continued in the 2016 Holyrood elections, with the SNP romping to victory while campaigning heavily on Ms Sturgeon's personal popularity. The cover of their manifesto simply bore a picture of the leader, and the single word \"re-elect\". It was another big victory. Not only did the SNP win more than a million votes and a record 59 of the 73 constituency seats, with a handful more from the top-up lists, the result gave Ms Sturgeon a \"clear and unequivocal\" personal mandate as first minister. There was no repeat of the 2011 majority, but that had been almost a freak result; the SNP had broken the system by sweeping up both constituency and list seats. Because the party gained constituency seats in 2016, it was denied list seats in areas like Glasgow, where they won every first-past-the-post contest. Just a few years earlier it had been unthinkable. From Shettleston to Springburn, Glasgow, once Labour's great Scottish stronghold, had turned yellow. The SNP later completed the electoral sweep of the city in the 2017 council elections. Five questions to Nicola Sturgeon Five more questions - in a lift After her first Holyrood victory as first minister, Ms Sturgeon outlined education as the number one priority of her government. She stressed that she wanted to be first minister for the whole country, not just the SNP and Yes side - in effect, to build a political legacy away from the binary question. But for all the debate about the length of a political \"generation\", the issue of independence never really came off the agenda. It was still the hot topic of debate and had become a decisive factor at the ballot-box, with Ruth Davidson building a Conservative revival by pitching her party as the defenders of the union. In truth, Ms Sturgeon would probably have preferred to wait a few years before going back down the referendum road, to move on from the 2014 campaign and maximise her chances of victory. But then Brexit changed everything. The UK's exit from the EU presented the SNP with an opportunity, as well as a challenge. A new layer of complexity in the political picture, a new binary issue to factor in, but perhaps a chance to resurrect the dream of independence. The SNP's 2016 manifesto (which had her face on the front) had raised the possibility of Scotland taking a fresh look at going its own way if voters north of the border backed Remain, while the UK as a whole voted to Leave the EU. That is, of course, exactly what happened. Ms Sturgeon is normally characterised as a canny, relatively cautious politician; a thinker, far from the mould of her comparatively gung-ho predecessor at Bute House. But when it came to Brexit and the chance of what quickly became known as \"indyref2\", Ms Sturgeon threw caution to the wind. Months of debate and megaphone diplomacy followed. Ms Sturgeon put forward a paper of proposals, which was roundly rejected. But it felt like it was all leading up to one thing. Just as Theresa May was preparing to trigger the formal Brexit process, Ms Sturgeon dropped her bombshell: a bid for a second independence referendum. From there, the two women traded constitutional blows at a dizzying pace. Mrs May said (repeatedly) that \"now is not the time\" for indyref2. Ms Sturgeon sought and won the backing of Holyrood, and fired off a formal demand for a referendum. And then Mrs May called a shock general election. In Edinburgh and London, it's possible the stakes have never been higher for either leader. In terms of her private life, the first minister is married to Peter Murrell - who is also chief executive of the SNP, making them perhaps the ultimate power couple of Scottish politics. The pair exchanged vows in 2010, after meeting 15 years previously at an SNP youth weekend in Aberdeenshire. That said, Ms Sturgeon still finds time to retreat from politics by pursuing her great love of reading, and watching X-Factor. Her mum Joan - herself an SNP politician, serving at one stage as the Provost of North Ayrshire - joked: \"She can relax - there's always one eye on the phone, but I think she's fairly relaxed. \"The phone is never switched off - many of my family can vouch for that.\" Expectations for the SNP under Ms Sturgeon are sky-high. Having swept Westminster, Holyrood and local council elections all within her first three years in the job, they are generally expected to win more or less every contest they enter. And the leader's personal brand is at the heart of this; most of the merchandise at SNP conferences bears some form of the \"I'm with Nicola\" slogan. Indeed, the first minister has transcended the need for a surname even among opposition circles. Say \"Nicola\" to more or less anyone in Scotland, and they will know exactly who you mean. All of which only makes her job harder. Hers is now after all a third-term government, with 10 years in power under its belt. In no democracy could such an established power be universally popular. And she is now leading the SNP into a snap general election campaign where they must defend nearly every seat in the country; a taller order can hardly be imagined. But if her history is any guide, Nicola Sturgeon will relish the challenge.", "output": "Who is Nicola Sturgeon?

David Cameron promised Wales would be at the \"centre\" of discussions of the future of the union. Mr Morgan backed his successor Carwyn Jones, who said Wales should be funded more fairly by the UK Treasury. The former first minister told BBC Wales that Northern Ireland and Scotland were both better treated than Wales by the so-called Barnett formula, which he said should be reformed as part of a reshaping of the union. \"We have to think about how Wales should not be penalised for not having had a referendum on independence, not having North Sea Oil and gas, and not having the troubles and strife that Northern Ireland has had,\" Mr Morgan said. \"We didn't put the UK through the mincer, so we should be rewarded for that, not penalised for it,\" he added. 'New union' Earlier, Mr Jones, the current first minister, said Wales would not play \"second fiddle\" when the future of devolution was discussed following the rejection of independence by Scottish voters. Prime Minister David Cameron said Wales must have more say in its own affairs. Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said he had been talking to Mr Cameron about the need for Wales to be \"front and centre\" of any talks and said he was \"totally reassured\" it would be. However, speaking at a press conference, Mr Jones said he had yet to talk to Mr Cameron about how that would happen. \"He needs to get us all around the table,\" said Mr Jones. \"It's time for our constitution to be put on a coherent footing, no more tinkering at the edges year after year. \"The UK has suffered a serious injury and a sticking plaster will not do. \"Sudden declarations of English votes for English laws is an example of that sticking plaster. The old union is dead. It's time for a new union.\" He added: \"We need to start these talks now. The establishment nearly lost the union The people of these nations must now rebuild it\". The first minister was keen to speak about the estimated \u00a3300m shortfall in funding that Wales receives. It is currently given \u00a31.5bn a year from Westminster. \"It's important that we're able to get the fair share of funding that we need in order to ensure that we have the NHS that we all want,\" he added. \"Wales cannot and will not play second fiddle.\" While saying he was pleased with the Scotland referendum result, Mr Jones warned: \"The prime minister almost sleepwalked to disaster last night. \"The promises from the three UK party leaders now have to be delivered.\" Speech makes \"powerful claim\" Prof Laura McAllister, professor of governance at Liverpool University, said Mr Jones made a very strong case in his speech for Wales to be treated equally in future devolution discussions. \"The first minister is making a powerful claim - that Wales must be treated as an equal when it comes to the consideration of constitutional realignment,\" she said. \"There is a certain language... the four of us, equal partners around the table. I think this is entirely appropriate and entirely strategic. \"There was always a danger Wales would be viewed as a junior partner. \"Carwyn Jones makes a very strong case and quite rightly. He is the leading Labour politician in the UK at this point in time.\" Stephen Crabb told BBC Wales: \"What's really important is that the aspirations of the people of Wales are satisfied and I can well see that aspiration and ambition increasing for Wales, and we're a government who wants to see that aspiration met. \"I'm open minded about tax powers in Wales... Scotland makes the case for looking at the issue again.\" At a press conference, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said the status quo was \"not an option\". \"The prime minister has reaffirmed to rebalancing power - action must now follow words,\" she said. \"We know Scotland will be offered new powers. It would be unthinkable and unacceptable for powers for Scotland but a second rate bill for Wales. \"We cannot continue to play catch up.\" Kirsty Williams, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, agreed that the current situation could not continue. \"I was always very, very clear that whatever the results, the status quo was not an option and there was an opportunity for profound constitutional change, and rebalancing here within the United Kingdom,\" she said. \"What's crucial for me is that Wales plays a central part in that, that we're not forgotten and that we can move forward to see the creation of a proper Welsh parliament and the long-cherished liberal goal of home rule for Wales.\" ANALYSIS by BBC Wales parliamentary correspondent David Cornock Welsh politicians in Westminster and Cardiff Bay are worried Wales will end up playing second fiddle and that the fall-out from the Scottish referendum becomes an Anglo-Scottish question. A lot of work went into David Cameron's statement to make sure he talked about the \"family of nations\" across the UK but there wasn't an awful lot of detail. There was talk about putting Wales at the heart of the debate. But what we do know is that Scotland now has a cast-iron guarantee that its generous funding settlement will be protected. But that is a formula which the political consensus in Wales says short-changes Wales. We're waiting for commitments from any UK party to deliver on that. Mr Cameron has set a very tight timetable. He wants draft new laws for Scotland early next year as well as a timetable for giving English MPs more of a say over English issues.

However, Dutch culture minister Jet Bussemaker said their real value would be in the eyes of those who can now see them again. Thieves seized the canvases from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam - which contains the world's largest collection of Van Gogh works with more than 200 paintings and 500 drawings - after breaking in through the roof. One of the men convicted over the theft, Octave Durham, has revealed that he was actually after the artist's better known works, but they were harder to steal. He told a documentary to be aired later that he found it \"trivially easy\" to break in to the museum. \"The heist took about three minutes and 40 seconds,\" Durham says in the film, the New York Times reported. \"When I was done, the police were there, and I was passing by with my getaway car. Took my ski mask off, window down, and I was looking at them.\" He said he and his accomplice had wanted to steal Sunflowers but the artwork was too well guarded, Trouw newspaper reported. They then turned their attention to The Potato Eaters, considered the painter's first masterpiece, but decided it was too big to fit through the hole they had entered through. Durham told the filmmakers he had selected the seascape because the thick paint convinced him it would be valuable. He was arrested a year later in the Spanish resort of Marbella and convicted in 2005, but had until now maintained he was innocent. The theft was a case of \"art-napping\" by an opportunist burglar, art investigator Arthur Brand told the BBC. \"No art collector will pay for stolen art they can't display,\" he said. But stolen art could be used as leverage by criminals who offer its return in exchange for reduced sentences for their crimes. Dutch criminal Cor van Hout - who became notorious for kidnapping the beer tycoon Freddy Heineken for an estimated $10m (\u00a38m) ransom in 1983 - wanted to buy them but he was gunned down in a gangland hit before the deal could be done. Another potential buyer met the same fate and the paintings were eventually sold to Raffaele Imperiale, a low-ranking mafioso who was at the time running an Amsterdam coffee shop. Imperiale paid about \u20ac350,000 ($380,000; \u00a3305,000) for the paintings and his lawyers told the New York Times he had bought them because he was \"fond of art\" and they were a \"bargain\". Imperiale was among several suspected dealers arrested by Italian police last January. Another suspected dealer arrested at the same time reportedly told investigators the paintings were at Imperiale's house. The BBC's James Reynolds in Rome says mafia members are not known for their understated good taste and raids have often revealed a preference for ostentatious, kitsch decoration, so Imperiale was unlikely to have bought the paintings for display purposes. They were found wrapped in cloth in a safe in a house in the picturesque seaside town of Castellammare di Stabia, near Pompeii, last September. Van Gogh Museum Director Axel Ruger said it was wonderful to have the works back on display. \"I think it's one of the most joyous days in my career really,\" he said. The museum has not made any comment on the upcoming documentary, Trouw said. Why are the paintings significant? Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) is widely considered the greatest Dutch artist after Rembrandt. Seascape at Scheveningen was one of only two seascapes he painted while he lived in the Netherlands. It shows a foaming, stormy sea and thundery sky, and was painted in 1882 while he was staying in The Hague. Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church at Nuenen (1884) was painted for Van Gogh's mother, but also partly for his father, who had become a pastor at the church in 1882. When his father died in 1884, Van Gogh added churchgoers, including a few women wearing shawls used for mourning. Van Gogh committed suicide in France in 1890. Recovering stolen masterpieces The 2002 Van Gogh museum raid was one of a series of thefts that shocked the art world. In 2004, two Edvard Munch masterpieces, The Scream and Madonna, were seized by armed men who raided the Munch museum in Oslo. Several men were jailed and the paintings later recovered after painstaking detective work in 2006.

It feels a world apart. Forgotten. Pro-IRA graffiti marks many walls. Some has been painted over, but the most prominent remain. \"The police will forget about you, we won't\". Next to the local shops, outside a school are makeshift signs. \"Informants will be shot\". Anywhere else, you may imagine such threats would immediately be taken down. But not in Derry. Fear creates a culture of silence. \"That is saying to people, 'just you keep quiet and we'll do what we like here'.\" Fr Joe Gormley knows the cost when paramilitaries attempt to assert control. The priest anointed journalist Lyra McKee the night she was shot dead by the New IRA while observing rioting in April. The 29-year-old writer and campaigner was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle when a masked gunman fired towards officers and onlookers. \"These people claim to be fighting for some kind of human rights but they treat people like animals if they don't agree with them,\" Fr Gormley explained. \"They don't speak for the people of Creggan, but people here would be afraid, having signs like that outside a school like that is tantamount to abuse of our children.\" Paramilitaries do not live in the shadows. In a small community, they are people's neighbours, family members, friends. Many do not agree with their extremist views, but still have to live with them. Police say Thomas Ashe Mellon and Fergal Melaugh are prominent members of the New IRA. But in Derry you'll just as easily run into them shopping at a supermarket. A new placard reads: \"Salute the men and women of violence\". What is Saoradh? Founded in 2016, Saoradh has the support of prisoners from the dissident group referred to as the New IRA in Maghaberry and Portlaoise prisons. Several high-profile dissidents, including Colin Duffy and Nuala Perry, have also been linked to the party. It is chaired by Brian Kenna. According to its constitution, Saoradh's objective is to \"effect an end to Britain's illegal occupation of the six counties\" and establish a 32-county Irish socialist republic. The party has been highly critical of Sinn F\u00e9in in the past, with its chairman describing members as \"false prophets who have been defeated and consumed by the very system they claim to oppose\". Saoradh, which has offices in Belfast and Derry, campaigns for the release of all republican prisoners. Since Lyra McKee's death, what police say are the New IRA's political wing, have launched a fresh drive to rally support. The anti-British, anti-police messages, are stark. Saoradh also recruit young people into their youth wing, Eistigi. Neighbourhood police officers in Derry are trying to build trust with the community in the face of anti-police campaigns. \"We're basically trying to get people to understand that we're doing a job, we're there to help them,\" said police constable Chris White. \"We do our best to get out and speak to people, letting them see that we're willing to engage with them and we're there to help them.\" Police usually patrol the Creggan in armoured land rovers. But they have promised the community they will be on the beat more, and face-to-face in future. The New IRA claims to be continuing a long-standing armed struggle to end the British governance of Northern Ireland. Who was Lyra McKee? Lyra McKee was a 29-year-old journalist, writer and campaigner. She was shot dead while observing a riot in Derry's Creggan estate in April 2019. Ms McKee was considered a \"rising star\" in the world of journalism and had written for publications including Buzzfeed, Private Eye and The Atlantic. She was named Sky News young journalist of the year in 2006 and Forbes Magazine named her as one of their 30 under 30 in media in Europe in 2016. She had also signed a two-book deal with publisher Faber and Faber. Ms McKee was known for her writing and advocacy on issues such as mental health and LGBT rights. Originally from north Belfast, the journalist had moved to Derry to live with her partner, Sara Canning, who she described in a newspaper article in February as \"the love of my life\". This year, the group has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks. The group said it was behind a bomb which exploded outside Derry's court house, explosives in letters to train stations and airports across the UK, and a bomb found under a police officer's car in Belfast. Last week, dissidents tried to murder police officers in Craigavon, County Armagh, luring them towards a deadly booby-trap device. During the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles, Derry saw some of the worst of the violence between paramilitaries, the Army and police. The walls of the city are etched with murals depicting Bloody Sunday, the day in January 1972 that 13 people were killed and 15 people were wounded after members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in the Bogside. Those tensions still live on today. \"The Troubles began here in the city in '68, and they have never really gone away,\" explained one man, who passes by as we are filming the anti-police placards. \"Feelings do run high here. \"I'm not saying I support that message, but I certainly understand it.\" 'Community have the answers' So, how do police overcome it then? \"I think it's going to take another generation\" replied Constable White. Police believe the IRA gunman who shot Lyra McKee in April is a local teenager. Officers have said they know that people within the community have the answers. But no one has yet been charged. Community workers have told the BBC they are negotiating with the dissidents to try to get the IRA threats removed. The council, police, and other authorities will not intervene. Many believe it is something only the community of Creggan can resolve within itself.", "output": "New IRA: The Derry estate in the shadow of paramilitaries", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Its latest traffic figures are in sharp contrast to the performance of Glasgow and Edinburgh airports, both of which reported their busiest March on record. The March figures covered the Easter period, unlike last year when the festive period fell in April. Aberdeen's passenger numbers have been falling steadily since 2014, when 3.8 million people travelled through its doors over the year. In 2015, 3.5 million passengers used the airport. It has been hit hard by the downturn in the oil and gas industry, following a sustained fall in the oil price. 'Challenging start' Reacting to the March figures, Aberdeen Airport managing director Carol Benzie said: \"Given the performance of the wider economy we fully expected a challenging start to the year, however, we have continued to work hard on providing passengers with more choice by securing new routes and I remain encouraged by our international traffic. \"There is a real opportunity for leisure capacity in Aberdeen and airlines such as Icelandair and Wizz Air have already demonstrated their confidence in the market with launch of important new routes. \"Both Thomson and Flybe will follow suit in the coming months during which time we will make real progress on our \u00a320m investment programme.

He said that there were still safety concerns about six former patients. The government's full response to the abuse at Winterbourne View will be published in November, he told MPs, in response to an urgent question tabled by shadow health minister Liz Kendall. She said that \"serious concerns\" remained over whether the government took \"all necessary steps\" to ensure former Winterbourne View patients were now receiving effective care. 'Robust and clear' On Monday Panorama revealed new safety alerts had been raised about 19 of the 51 patients who were abused at Winterbourne View but who now live at other care homes. While not all of the safeguarding alerts meant that the patient had been harmed, at least one has been assaulted and one criminal inquiry is under way. Mr Lamb said: \"Years and years of public money being spent on putting people into inappropriate settings, often putting them at risk of abuse - this is a national scandal and it has to end.\" He went on to say he was \"absolutely determined\" that the government's final response would be \"robust and clear\". Mr Lamb also offered to meet the families of the 19 patients concerned to discuss their cases. The health minister added that he wanted to see an end to local authorities sending adults with learning disabilities to live in care homes far away from their relatives and friends. He said: \"The fact is that for someone who is sent away 200 miles from home, you create the conditions where abuse is more likely than if they are in their own community. \"I want this to end.\" 'Forgotten about' Mr Lamb added that he had been working since his appointment \"to ensure we set the right policy to protect very vulnerable individuals\". Responding to a question from former health minister Paul Burstow, Mr Lamb said changes in the way healthcare was purchased and implemented by local authorities could result in better, cheaper care. He said: \"We were spending public money - \u00a33,500 on average per patient in Winterbourne View - to put people at risk of abuse. \"Often an appropriate care package will cost less than that to give individual the care that they need. \"There is a serious issue about the quality of commissioning, the quality of work done by primary care trusts and in some cases local authorities.\" He went on: \"The sense is that too often people are placed in these settings and to all intents and purposes forgotten about. That is not acceptable.\" The abuse at Winterbourne View was exposed by Panorama in spring 2011, when an undercover reporter secretly filmed support workers slapping patients, pinning them under chairs and giving them cold punishment showers.

According to the latest figures, the British economy actually shrank in the last three months of 2010, although it is expected to grow by 2% in 2011. In the UK, unemployment is rising. In Germany, it is falling. The British unemployment rate is higher than Germany's, and so too is the rate of inflation. In Britain, trade is in deficit. In Germany, it is in sizzling surplus. Drilling for growth Trade is the key to the German recovery. The country makes things that others want to buy - particularly in growing economies, and particularly in China. The German economy currently meshes nicely with China's needs, such as machinery to industrialise. It is also good at providing China's wants, including BMWs for the new rich. As Germany's Economy Minister, Rainer Br\u00fcderle, told the BBC: \"We give the equipment to the world, to the virgin markets that need it and want it\". German industrialists make much of the strength of their manufacturing. Dieter Burmester created and owns Burmester Audio Systems which makes very high-end amplifiers and speakers - the price tags say hundreds of thousands of pounds, euros or dollars, for the top of his range. \"I don't understand politicians who don't know the value of production\", he says. You can see German technology all over the world, very often from small companies. The disaster in Chile with the mining workers? The drilling machinery was from Germany. Drilling a tunnel in Switzerland? The machinery comes from here. \"Many years ago, when some countries saw their future in service industries like I believe the British did, I wondered about it. \"The strongest economy you will have is when you have to deal with something concrete, and it's not just a number written on paper,\" said Mr Burmester. Dependable products He is a classic German engineer and entrepreneur. His company is a typical example of the \"mittelstand\", that swathe of medium-sized, often family-owned firms which produce things, often of high quality, with much investment in research and design. His product is handmade in Germany. The words are written on the back of every item in English, but there is much research and development behind it. He is an unflashy engineer. Solid, but with carefully planned change, might be his motto. \"Solid\" is the word that keeps recurring with the German economy. For consumers, it translates as \"save then spend\". In these times of austerity, that may be a virtue - though borrowing to expand is a virtue when times are less constrained. Debt culture But those are not the current times. British households are more indebted than their German counterparts. In the UK, debt is about 80% of income left after tax. In Germany, it is about 60%. On top of that, Britons borrow to buy property - the weight is around their necks for life. Mortgages make up about 90% of people's debt. In Germany, it is about 70%. Artur Fisher is a good person to compare and contrast. He is the joint-chief executive of the Berlin stock exchange. He has worked and lived in London and he's married to a British woman. His mother-in-law lives in East Anglia so he goes there often. He makes much of the British belief that owning one's own home is one of the prime aims in life while Germans rent. \"In Germany only 50-60% of the population own their own house. The rest rent. Renting is quite normal\". Contrast that with the UK where he says that 90% of households own their own home. \"The most important thing in their life is to own their own house. So you tie down capital.\" He notes, too, a difference in attitude between him and his wife when it comes to mortgages. The British, he says, are used to variable rates of interest - they go up and down over the lifetime of the mortgage. In Germany, you agree the rate and it stays fixed. \"My wife is English and when we agreed a ten year mortgage at 3.5%, she asked me why we didn't get a variable rate because it might go lower. \"This shows you the difference of attitude whereby the English see an opportunity in change whereas the Germans hate change - we don't want change. We want to plan things.\" Artur Fischer, though, does not gloat. He does not feel the German way is always better. And he can remember the 1970s when Britain reeled from crisis to crisis. \"The British economy was seen as the 'Sick Man of Europe'. This has turned around completely with all the measures that have been taken in the UK. \"So we know that the British are able to get out of this trouble and become very strong. They were able to live a prosperous life without having all those manufacturing companies. \"If the framework is correct, you will come out winning - probably, in three years time, when Germany might just go back into recession.\"", "output": "Why do the German and UK economies differ sharply?", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

But the committee's chairwoman said it was \"operating in a parallel universe where urgency is an abstract concept\". The department said it was focused on \"ensuring a smooth transition\" for businesses, workers and consumers. It said that since the MPs' report was written it had been given an extra \u00a3185m to boost its Brexit-related workforce. The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019, at which point a temporary \"transition\" period is expected to kick in until December 2020. The Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises the value for money of public spending, said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy had a \"significant and complex task\" related to Brexit, with responsibility for 68 of more than 300 \"work streams\" that need to be completed. Given this task, and the \"significant domestic policy agenda\" it is also responsible for, the committee said it was \"alarmed that the department has made virtually no attempt to re-order its priorities\". It said it doubted the department's ability to deliver \"numerous IT systems\" that would be required when the UK leaves the EU. The committee said that in January, when it took evidence for its report, \"extraordinarily, the department had not yet started to procure any of these systems despite them being required by March 2019 in the event of a no-deal scenario\". As of December, the department had recruited 305 of the 350 staff it needed for 2017-18, the report said. 'In the dark' But the MPs said they were \"not convinced it has yet got the right mix of skills and experience in place to implement its Brexit work effectively\". They were not reassured the department had taken on people with \"sufficient negotiating expertise\" and forecast difficulties in recruiting in-demand digital staff in the face of competition from the private sector. The report also criticised a lack of transparency which it said undermined scrutiny of the department's work, saying it should not use \"sensitivities around the negotiations\" to keep people \"in the dark\". Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, said the business department had \"an extremely important, challenging and time-sensitive workload\". \"Yet the department told us it had not reprioritised its overall programme of work, had not begun procurement for around a dozen essential digital systems and could not provide vital information about its workforce. \"We have grave concerns about this apparent complacency, compounded by the lack of transparency on the department's progress with what in some cases will be critical projects.\" A spokesman for the department (BEIS) said: \"Since this report was written, BEIS has received \u00a3185m of extra funding to help deliver a successful Brexit by employing an increased number of staff on our Europe work, identifying the most pressing legislative challenges and remaining ahead of schedule by recruiting high-calibre staff to ensure we prepare thoroughly and effectively.\"", "output": "Business department's Brexit planning criticised by MPs", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Criminals persuade phone providers to divert mobile phone numbers in what is sometimes called \"SIM swap fraud\". Some banks text security details when customers forget their details. The activation codes sent by text to mobile phones also allow payments to be made from an account. The scam works by blocking the genuine phone. The owner is unaware of why the phone has been blocked and allows the criminal - who now has control of their phone - to syphon money from their bank account. You and Yours has been contacted by dozens of people affected by the scam. All say they have never revealed their security details to anyone, and the that first they knew something was wrong was their mobile phone going dead. Locked out We decided to investigate. You and Yours producer Natalie Ms Donovan is a NatWest customer, so I used her bank account as an experiment. I was able to break to her account without knowing her banking customer number, PIN or any passwords. I did not know her mother's maiden name, her pet's name or her first school, and yet I was still able to change her PIN and password to lock her out of her own account. That allowed me to transfer \u00a31.50 to my own bank account, all because I had control of Natalie's mobile phone. NatWest, owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, said that its systems for both banks would be changed as a direct result of the You and Yours investigation.

President Obama called his death a \"remarkable loss\", and revealed he listened to Purple Rain to \"just to get warmed up\" in the morning. The star was famously private, rarely giving interviews, and even serving non-disclosure agreements on former bandmates and collaborators. Since his death, however, fans have been afforded the occasional glimpse into his life - some funny, some enlightening, all of them elevating his status as a visionary, and a musical genius. Here are 12 things we've learned in the last 12 months. There was a swear box at Paisley Park With songs like Erotic City and Sexy Dancer, Prince became known as a rampant sex machine - but he was also a devoutly religious vegan, who became a Jehovah's Witness in 2003. After that, he excised swear words from his music (Sexy MF was never played live again) and kept a \"cuss bucket\" in his recording studio. \"He didn't want to dishonour the faith,\" said his friend James Lundstrom. \"He wasn't joking. You had to pay in cash in the bucket. He would charge you between three and 10 dollars per swear word. \"Once I bumped my knee and I said, 'damn'. He said, 'What did you say?'\" On one occasion, Lundstrom recalled, a foul-mouthed musician stuffed a handful of hundred dollar bills in the swear jar as a down-payment for the rest of the day. An obscure song called Comeback was played at his funeral Prince was cremated at a private ceremony for family and close friends on Saturday, 23 April. Among the songs played at the service was Comeback, an acoustic lament the star originally recorded in 1996 for his son, Ahmir, who was born with a rare genetic disorder and died seven days later. Released on the fanclub-only album The Truth, the song's lyrics were equally apt for Prince's funeral. \"If you ever lose someone dear to you / Never say the words 'they're gone' / They'll come back.\" Prince is wearing a wig in Purple Rain Prince's former art director Steve Parke recently published a book featuring the intimate, behind-the-scenes photographs he took of the star during his time at Paisley Park. He also recounts the time Prince invited him to watch a montage of old performances he was preparing for the American Music Awards. When a scene from Purple Rain appeared, the star bellowed, \"Look at that wig!\" and burst out laughing. Parke later asked Prince's hair stylist Earl Jones about the comment. He explained the star had had to reshoot a few scenes after the filming wrapped - but he had already cut his hair and bleached it blond - necessitating the bouffant hairpiece. Jones added that Prince had reacted so badly to the bleach that his hair started breaking off, so he had to let it grow out, and dye it back to black. \"The hairstyle in Raspberry Beret was literally all I could do with it.\" He had a vicious mean streak It's no secret that Prince was a perfectionist - but some of the stories that emerged after his death highlighted the star's ruthless attitude towards his bandmates. \"He did like to push the band with fear,\" said Michael B Nelson, who played trombone for the New Power Generation. One night, months into 1993's Act I tour, Nelson missed a high B during his solo on a song called The Flow. \"The next day, [Prince] came by and said, 'You're gonna play that solo right tonight?'\" he told Rolling Stone. \"I said, 'I'll do my best.' And he says, 'Uh, you did your best last night.' And he walks away.\" That night, when it came to the solo, Prince walked up to him with his \"golden gun\" microphone (pictured above) and held it to his head. \"I was like, 'Oh, my God.' And he kept doing it. And it was like a week of him doing this, and I'm freaking out. It wasn't showbiz at that point. It was, 'Don't you ever do that again'.\" His final shopping spree included CDs by Stevie Wonder, and a cup of coffee Five days before his death, Prince celebrated Record Store Day by cycling to his local record store and snapping up a few bargains. According to Bob Fuchs, the manager of Electric Fetus, the star bought six CDs: Prince then set off on his bike, waving to fans at a nearby hair salon before visiting a local coffee store. According to barista, Alya Al-Hilwani, he preferred a mocha, with no whipped cream. He secretly bought the Purple Rain house In summer 2015, the Minneapolis house that featured as Prince's childhood home in the film Purple Rain went up for sale. It turns out that Prince bought it himself. Minnesota Public Radio checked property records and discovered the owner of the 1913 house, at 3420 Snelling Avenue, Minneapolis, was NPG Music Publishing - one of Prince's companies. The initial asking price was just $110,000, but Prince paid $117,000 in cash to secure the property. After his death, Prince's estate put it up for sale, saying \"the costs of repair and ongoing maintenance\" were such that keeping hold of the house was \"not in the Estate's best interest\". Prince outsold Adele and Drake last year Incredibly, Prince was the biggest-selling artist in the US last year, in terms of album sales. He shifted more than 2.2 million albums in the months after his death, partly because his music was unavailable on the major streaming platrforms. He was the only artist to sell more than one million digital and physical albums in 2016; and sold a total of 5.4 million digital songs, putting him ahead of Drake and Adele. When his music finally became available on Spotify, Apple, Amazon and Google Play this February, it was streamed 17 million times in one week - with Purple Rain alone racking up 1 million plays. He travelled under the name Peter Bravestrong Prince had many aliases as a songwriter - Alexander Nevermind, Joey Coco and Jamie Starr, to name but a few. But unsealed court documents show, released earlier this week, show that the star, an intensely private person, travelled under the name Peter Bravestrong to help conceal his identity. That name was on a luggage tag he used while travelling to Atlanta for what proved to be his final concert. The suitcase was found at Paisley Park after his death, and contained several prescription bottles in the name of Kirk Johnson, a personal friend and employee since the 1980s. (It also contained handwritten lyrics for U Got the Look, according to investigators.) US authorities are still investigating how Prince obtained the prescription medications which killed him. He cooked a lot of eggs As bandmates and friends lined up to pay tribute to Prince, they all seemed to have one memory in common: Eggs. \"Prince did the cooking. Scrambled eggs,\" singer Jill Jones told GQ magazine. \"He put curry and a little bit of cheddar cheese in them. It was really good, actually. \"You know, he barely ate. I was always starving around him. I was always freaking hungry.\" \"Prince was never an eater,\" agreed Cat Glover, who joined him on the Sign O The Times and Lovesexy tours. \"He would usually smell his food. Literally. I never really seen Prince eat. I've seen him make pancakes - he made me pancakes, he made me eggs. But he's not the type of person that eats a lot. \"Yeah, he has made me scrambled eggs,\" said dancer Misty Copeland. \"Breakfast was his forte. He liked to use a lot of seasoning. They were delicious.\" It's worth noting that Prince himself did not carry an eggy whiff. \"Ever since I've known Prince, I've attached a smell to him, which is lavender,\" Madonna once said. \"He reeks of it.\" He destroyed a windmill One of the other properties put up for sale by Prince's estate was a huge, 160-acre estate near Lake Ann in Chanhassen, which was valued at almost $14 million. It once contained a yellow three-story mansion-style house, complete with a home studio, where portions of Sign O' the Times and The Black Album were recorded. \"There were a couple of summer nights where we could hear music coming through the woods,\" Juli Gempler, who lived next door, told ABC News after his death. \"Nice and loud. It was good. It was really cool.\" The property even had its own windmill - also bright yellow - where Prince presumably spent many a happy hour milling organic flour before baking a nice batch loaf. Sadly, though, he had the house and the windmill torn down in the 1990s. Satellite images now show the property as a vast expanse of green fields and woodland, except for a lone tennis court. We'll be hearing new Prince music for the rest of our lives Shortly after Prince's death, the legendary \"vault\" that contained his archive of concert recordings, unreleased songs and rehearsal tapes was drilled open. According to the singer's former recording engineer Susan Rodgers, who started the vault for Prince during the 1980s, the facility was almost full when she left in 1987, with songs in there that pre-date his legendary Purple Rain album. \"We used to do two songs a day, and he just put them away,\" added his friend and engineer David Z. In fact, there's so much music waiting to be released, \"it probably won't be tapped out in our lifetime,\" said former Paisley Park employee Scott LeGere. The first release came last year, when the 1999-era track Moonbeam Levels was unearthed for the compilation Prince 4Ever. This June, an expanded version of Purple Rain is due, containing \"two incredible albums of previously unreleased Prince music and two complete concert films,\" according to Warner Bros Records. A leaked tracklist suggests fans will finally get to hear studio versions of the much-bootlegged songs Electric Intercourse and Possessed, amongst others. Prince's estate has also signed a $30m deal with Universal Music to release non-Warner Bros material - which will hopefully include fan favourites like Extraloveable, Wonderful Ass, Lisa, Train, Rebirth of the Flesh and Big Tall Wall. There is some speculation that the star didn't maintain his vault to archival standards, and that some of the tapes may have deteriorated. Furthermore, the process of cataloguing the material hadn't even begun by the start of this year. He never rehearsed that solo on While My Guitar Gently Weeps One of the most widely-circulated links after Prince's death was a video of his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. It sees Prince joining an all-star version of the Beatles' While My Guitar Gently Weeps, backed by Tom Petty, Steve Winwood and George Harrison's son, Dhani. He keeps to the sidelines until the final two minutes, when he steps forward to deliver one of the most breathtaking guitar solos you've ever seen, full of fluttering high notes and ringing harmonics. Amazingly, Prince never rehearsed this moment with the band. At a run-through the night before it was Jeff Lynne's guitarist, Marc Mann, who took the solo. \"Prince doesn't say anything, just starts strumming, plays a few leads here and there, but for the most part, nothing memorable,\" recalled Joel Gallen, who directed the ceremony. But when the big moment came, Prince stole the show. At one point, he turned to face Petty and Harrison, then fell backwards into the audience - while still playing - before strutting off stage, throwing his guitar into the air before the song ended. \"You see me nodding at him, to say, 'Go on, go on,'\" Petty told the New York Times. \"I remember I leaned out at him at one point and gave him a 'This is going great!' kind of look. \"He just burned it up. You could feel the electricity of 'something really big's going down here.'\" Prince later claimed he had never even heard the song before it was sent to him to learn for the performance.

Faye (not her real name) says the message at her school was simply: \"Under no circumstances must you do drugs.\" Meanwhile, however, pupils were given much more specific information about the dangers of alcoholism and smoking tobacco. \"We were just taught to say, 'No.' But young people are going to come into contact with drugs at some point in their lives,\" Faye says. She believes the education system is struggling to keep up with drug trends and that a message of: \"Just say no,\" does not prepare for youngsters for the realities of a society where drugs are widely available. \"You're told your whole life, 'These drugs are bad for you and they could kill you,' and then when you do these drugs and you're fine and having fun, you reflect on your education and think that maybe everything you've been told is wrong,\" Faye says. Negative effects of taking cannabis Source: NHS Choices In some cases cannabis can increase anxiety and paranoia, lead to confusion and even hallucinations, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists. There is also \"compelling evidence\" that regular cannabis use increases the risk of developing psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia, particularly in adolescents, according to Dr Marta Di Forti, from King's College London. Writing in the Telegraph newspaper, Lord Hague says that as far as cannabis is concerned \"any war has been comprehensively and irreversibly lost\". \"The idea that the drug can be driven off the streets and out of people's lives by the state is nothing short of deluded,\" he writes. \"Surveys of young people attest that they find it easier to purchase cannabis than virtually anything else, including fast food, cigarettes and alcohol.\" Statistics from NHS Digital have recently found secondary school children in England are more likely to have tried drugs than cigarettes. The research, published in November, interviewed 12,051 pupils in 177 schools in the autumn term of 2016. Analysis of the results showed 24% of the 11- to 15-year-olds interviewed said they had tried recreational drugs at least once in their lives - a nine percentage point rise on the last survey conducted in 2014. 'I love the way it makes me feel' Darren (not his real name), now 24, has been smoking cannabis since he was 13. \"After a busy day at work, you go home and light up and it just relaxes the mind, the body. And, all of a sudden, everything's OK,\" he says. \"I love the way it makes me feel relaxed.\" Darren agrees with Faye that many young people see cannabis as the safer option to drinking alcohol. \"You hear how alcohol can kill, cause liver damage, affect your speech,\" he says. \"People lose limbs and life by doing silly things. \"But you don't hear that so much about weed. So, it sounds like a softer option - 'I'm getting a buzz, but I'm not going to die.'\" Darren admits that smoking cannabis may have had a detrimental affect on his exam grades and general achievement. \"I've done great. But maybe I could have done better? That's the conflict I have daily with smoking weed,\" he says. \"It's lovely in the moment. But then the guilt kicks in an hour later. \"And it's costly. And it makes me lazy, sometimes.\" 'More normalised now' But Darren says that, whatever the positives or negatives of cannabis, the idea of its use being confined to seedy pubs and clubs is far from reality. \"You walk out of work or the shopping centre and there are people who sell weed and they'll have no issue approaching you,\" he says. \"It's much more normalised now. People think of it as teenagers on the street corner - but it goes far beyond that, I know. \"There are mothers out there smoking it. There are grandparents, police officers, teachers.\" Faye adds: \"It's not just school kids - it stretches far beyond the people you think would do drugs.\" She believes the taboo around the use of cannabis for private recreational use should be challenged. \"I did some ecstasy because they're cheap - but now I do cannabis,\" Faye says. \"It's a treat. It's not something I do regularly. \"I just think we need to stop judging people, at the end of the day.\"", "output": "Young people 'see cannabis as safer than alcohol'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Mr Williams, who denies murder, told officers at the scene \"I am sorry, I just snapped\", the jury heard. He admits manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. The court heard he told detectives: \"I did mean to kill her but to kill myself after as well.\" The trial was told the attack began in the bedroom of their home in Brynglas area of the town and continued downstairs. Mrs Williams was found slumped in the porch with a pair of keys in her hand. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead. In a series of police interviews read to the jury, Mr Williams agreed with detectives he was responsible killing his wife. He said he had been getting about two hours' sleep a night and had \"felt depressed lately\" because he was worried about having to stay at home during the lockdown, and was concerned about accessing his bank accounts. Mr Williams, who is retired, was asked to explain what happened on the morning of his wife's death.

There were also clashes in the stadium following England's 1-1 Euro 2016 draw with Russia, after Russia fans appeared to rush at England supporters. French police said one Briton had been seriously hurt in the earlier clashes. Witnesses said trouble began in the stadium after flares were let off by Russian fans near the end of the game. Some fans then climbed across barriers designed to keep rival fans apart. Russia's Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said on Sunday: \"We will have a fine from Uefa, so I understand. We behaved incorrectly,\" R-Sport news agency reported. But he added there were \"many nuances\" to what happened, and Russian officials would investigate. Ned Ozkasim, from London, who was in the stadium, told the BBC: \"There was a large explosion, and after the Russian goal they started invading the area where some England fans were. \"I didn't see any retaliation from the England fans - they were just trying to get away. There were no riot police at the grounds as we expected. There were just stewards in hi-vis, and they just let it happen.\" Euro 2016: 'England fans are not idiots' Analysis By Phil McNulty, BBC chief football writer in Marseille From the moment England and Russia fans started flooding into Marseille on Thursday and Friday, there was an undercurrent of tension and violence that was transformed into scenes that were a throwback to some of football's worst hooligan excesses of the past. In the steamy, humid environment of this port city in the south of France, with alcohol flowing freely in searing temperatures and demonstrations of aggression from both sets of fans, all the ingredients were in place for events that unfolded in the Vieux-Port de Marseille. As a long, hot Saturday wore on towards a late kick-off at 21:00 local time, the scenery shifted to the magnificent, sweeping curves of the Stade Velodrome, culminating in the disgraceful incidents that took place just seconds after full-time. It was particularly disturbing given the high levels of security and policing that were in evidence around the stadium as the authorities remain on high alert after November's Paris attacks. Security, here at least, seemed in very short supply. It was the sort of hooliganism the game's rulers hoped had been stamped out but has reared its head in sinister fashion less than 48 hours into Euro 2016. It demands a strong reaction, not just from European football's governing body Uefa, but also those who saw the shortcomings of security exposed after the final whistle here. Read more 'Torrid day' BBC sports editor Dan Roan said England fans began jumping over the perimeter fence in panic. \"Big questions for Uefa here,\" he tweeted. \"Stampede appears to have been triggered by explosion. How did such a device make it inside and where was segregation?\" A senior FA security official said he had not witnessed anything like it in nine major tournaments he had attended. Kevin Miles, of the Football Supporters' Federation, said the incident came at the end of \"a very torrid day for many England fans\". Some fans had been attacked \"brutally and violently\" by Russian hooligans and locals youths, and it was \"clearly premeditated\", he claimed. Police had \"failed entirely\" to protect fans, he said. The British ambassador to France, Julian King, tweeted: \"Number of Brits in hospital overnight. Consular following closely with French authorities.\" He added that the embassy was \"reviewing the situation\" with the French authorities. Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said the safety measures and security inside the stadium needed to be urgently looked at, and called for more stewarding. Bloodied fans Earlier on Saturday French police said one Briton had to be resuscitated by officers and was left in a critical condition. Police in riot gear clashed with England fans, and used tear gas for a third day and a water cannon to try and stop outbursts of violence. There were also clashes in the city of Nice between police and fans from Northern Ireland and Poland, who are due to play their opening match later. Six people were reportedly injured, before order was restored. Before the game fans walked past ranks of police officers in riot gear on their way to the Stade Velodrome venue. The great majority of fans appeared to be peaceful, but there were some reports of trouble between English, Russian and local fans. BBC News correspondent Nick Eardley said he witnessed bloodied England fans being \"dragged away by police\", to the sound of sirens blaring out across the city's main square. Police told the BBC six people had been arrested and at least five injured during the scuffles. 'Very disappointed' Some British journalists in the area pointed the finger at a gang of black-clad Russians, who they said had entered the port city's main square from a side street apparently seeking violence. The FA condemned the violence saying it was \"very disappointed by the terrible scenes of disorder\", while European football's governing body Uefa said it \"firmly condemns the incidents in Marseille\". England fans are now moving on from Marseilles as the team's next match is against Wales in Lens on Thursday afternoon. Russia play their next fixture against Slovakia the previous afternoon.

But the Philippine boat, ferrying food to troops stationed on the Second Thomas Shoal, managed to slip past. The shoal is one of many flashpoints in the area, where several countries have overlapping territorial claims. Multiple claims China claims a U-shaped swathe of the sea - creating multiple overlaps with areas claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Saturday's incident, which took place at Second Thomas Shoal (known as Ayungin in Manila and Ren'ai Reef in Beijing), is a rare glimpse into the tensions that routinely play out in the disputed waters. Journalists say they saw two Chinese coast guard ships attempt to block the path of the Philippine boat, sending a radio message, in English, warning that it was entering Chinese territory: \"We order you to stop immediately, stop all illegal activities and leave.\" But instead of leaving, the Philippine boat managed to manoeuvre away and enter waters that were too shallow for the Chinese ships to follow. The captain of the Philippine vessel, Ferdinand Gato, later told Reuters news agency that if they had not changed direction, they would have collided with one of the Chinese vessels. Air-drop Philippine troops are stationed on a beached, rusting military ship on the shoal that analysts say has become a symbol of the country marking its territory. Two weeks ago, Manila made a formal complaint to Beijing after a similar incident when Chinese vessels succeeded in blocking a resupply mission to the shoal. Philippine planes resorted to air-dropping food and water supplies for the soldiers stationed on board the marooned ship. The latest confrontation was witnessed by more than a dozen journalists. They had been invited by the Philippine military to board the government vessel to show alleged bullying by Chinese vessels in the area. The Chinese foreign ministry condemned the Philippines for trying to \"hype up\" the issue, according to a statement quoted by Xinhua news agency. The ministry accused Manila of trying to \"illegally seize\" the shoal.

He was one of about 100 passengers that night, last June, and one of thousands of men who have have fled Afghanistan every month this year in search of a more secure life in Europe. Shafiullah was already inside Turkey, but the people smugglers he had paid to ferry him to Istanbul were heading across Lake Van to avoid police roadblocks. The lake's waters are dangerous, and the smugglers were setting out at night. Somewhere across the water, the vessel they had chosen to carry their human cargo - including at least 32 Afghans, seven Pakistanis and one Iranian - sank. Sixty-one bodies were recovered, but the rest, including Shafiullah, are missing. Some bodies could be deep below the surface, Turkish authorities told the BBC, making recovery unlikely. At least four of those thought to have perished, including Shafiullah, were sent by a smuggler in Kabul. The BBC approached the smuggler and he agreed to talk on the condition that his identity was disguised. 'Everything is arranged by phone' Elham Noor (not his real name) has well-established links with other criminals and claims a high success rate in sending people to Italy, France, and the UK. \"Smuggling is not an individual business, it's a huge network,\" he said. \"We have connections with one another.\" Noor doesn't travel with the migrants though. \"Everything is arranged over the phone,\" he said. Noor has no shortage of clients. Many Afghans are desperate to leave their country. Afghanistan is among the poorest in the world, it has been ravaged by decades of war. According to the United Nations, 2.7 million Afghans are currently living abroad as refugees - putting Afghanistan behind only Syria and Venezuela in the list of countries which produce the most migrants and refugees. So Noor has no need to advertise. His clients call him. Young Afghans looking to make the journey will typically seek out a trafficker who has already sent somebody else from their region. But only a small percentage of those who try to reach Europe succeed at their first attempt, and some never return. Shafiullah's uncle Sher Afzal said the family knew the journey would be dangerous. \"But we didn't anticipate this,\" said. Afzal is in mourning, but it's a strange, hollow kind of grieving that lacks certainty. Shafiullah is still listed as missing. The family, who live in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, would like to hold a memorial service for Shafiullah, but they have no remains. There has already been a ceremony for the two migrants whose bodies were recovered. \"Now we want to see his dead body. We don't expect him to be alive,\" Afzal said. Shafiullah saw no prospect of a future in Jalalabad. He contacted Noor to get passage to Italy, paying the trafficker $1,000 (\u00a3741) as a first instalment. He was bundled together with other migrants and moved from one place to another in cars, trucks, and sometimes on foot. Shafiullah crossed Iran and entered Turkey, but his journey came to an end on Lake Van, moments after he called his family. Noor told the BBC he paid the money back to Shafiullah's family and to others whose journey's were cut short. Shafiullah's family confirmed that they had received the money. $8,500 to get to Italy Noor said the tragedy had added to his misgivings about people smuggling. He recognises the human cost when things go wrong, he said. But it is a lucrative trade, and a hard one to leave after so many years. \"We charge $1,000 for Afghanistan to Turkey,\" Noor said. \"From Turkey to Serbia, it is $4,000. From there to Italy, we charge another $3,500. It is $8,500 altogether.\" These are huge sums of money in a country where the average per capita annual income is just over $500. Noor pockets between $3,000 and $3,500 for every migrant who successfully reaches Italy. And all Noor has to do to is pick up the phone, arrange some money transfers and pay the occasional bribe to the Afghan authorities. He never meets anyone in person who is not known to him or a close relative or friend. He relies on his reputation to bring in clients and is wary of speaking to strangers. It's a comfortable life, particularly by Afghan standards, and the trappings of wealth are obvious - the cars, the clothes, the houses. Noor knows that migrants face a risky journey without travel documents. They are kept hidden during the day and moved at night, using the network's safe houses along the way, in cities like Tehran, Van and Istanbul, he said. The migrants are advised not to carry any valuables like expensive jewellery or watches which could attract thieves. Noor usually tells the migrants not to carry more than $100 in cash. The journey to Turkey, a major hub for Afghans heading to Europe, can take from a week to a couple of months, depending on what happens on the way. One migrant who made it to Istanbul, passing through on his way to the West, was Hazrat Shah, a former soldier in the Afghan army. After his village came under the control of the Taliban, the 25-year-old feared reprisal attacks on his family, so he deserted from his unit and decided to leave the country. He set off from Nangarhar in eastern Afghanistan earlier this year, attempting to make it to Italy. \"After reaching the border [between Turkey and Iran], it took almost a month to arrive in Istanbul. I stayed there for a few months and worked in hotels to earn money to pay for the smugglers,\" Shah told the BBC. The eastern Mediterranean route, which involves crossing the sea between Turkey and Greece, is particularly favoured by migrants. The European border agency estimates that in the first 10 months of this year, more than 17,000 people crossed over to Europe through this route, and almost a quarter of these are thought to be Afghan. It was difficult to get from Greece to Bosnia - Shah was deported several times before he made it - but his attempts to move further met with repeated failure. \"It was horrible. In the last attempt I was injured as well. The police beat me a lot,\" he said. \"They took our shoes and jumpers. We were forced to return in the dark. It is so hard to get through.\" 'The smugglers can't help' Shah is not sure if he will ever get to Italy, but he is in no mood to call the people smugglers back in Afghanistan for help. They disappear at the first sign of trouble, he said, and many who undertake the journey regret trusting them. \"There is a possibility that you can die or be injured or abducted at every stage of the journey - and nobody can help you,\" he said. \"It is not possible for them [the people smugglers] to help as they are afraid of the police. It is a dirty game.\" Shah said he had lived in horrific conditions for many months and has seen many die on the way. \"You will receive very little food and water to keep you alive. I saw people dying of thirst without water. Other migrants can't help them because if you give your water to them, you face the same situation,\" he said. According to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), more than 1,000 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean this year. This is mainly because they are forced to travel on overcrowded boats, often during rough weather. Many others, like Shafiullah, die before reaching the Mediterranean and are not even included in this statistic. But there is no shortage of Afghans wanting to migrate. After an explosion near the German embassy in Kabul in 2017, which killed at least 150 people, most European countries closed their visa application centres in Afghanistan, which has made travelling legally to Europe even harder and only increased the flow of clients seeking the services of smugglers like Noor. From migrant to trafficker Noor himself was once in a similar situation. Like so many others, he too once dreamed of living a comfortable life in the UK. He undertook the same journey when he was just 14. His dad paid $5,000 to smugglers. \"I still remember the difficulties of my journey, particularly in Bulgaria where we were kept hidden in trains - I was even forced to jump from a moving train,\" Noor said. In Calais, Noor was offered a commission of 100 euros (\u00a390) for every migrant he introduced to a smuggler. This is how he got his start in the business of people smuggling. Noor reached the UK illegally and continued to work with smugglers. But he returned to Afghanistan at the age of 21 when he realised the police were looking for him, he said. Some of the migrants who managed to reach Europe through Noor's network passed on his details to others, and his network and reputation grew. \"Despite the uncertainty, people still trust me to take them out of the country,\" he said. Noor said about 100 people who paid him to deliver them to a better life were currently on their way to Europe. But he insisted they would be the last. He was getting out of the business, he claimed. He said the disaster with Shafiullah's boat had hurt him, but the migrants knew the risks. \"I apologised many times to the families. I told them clearly in the beginning, anything can happen on the way,\" he said. \"They have accepted this. God will decide whether to forgive me or not.\" Another trafficker who knew Noor said he would find it difficult to stop. \"People will continue to call him for years to come, and the chance to make money won't simply go away the moment he calls it quits,\" the trafficker said. Whether Noor gets out or not, the people smuggling will continue. Many thousands Afghans will still be desperate for a safer and better life. In Autumn, not long after Shafiullah's boat sank, two of his relatives made it as far as Turkey. They have just been deported back home. When the weather gets warmer next summer, they may try again.

It also revealed there were 33 times as many people over 90 as there were a century ago. Here's a round up of what the first England and Wales data reveals. UK-wide census-based population estimates, including Scotland, will be released in December 2012. More people The population of England and Wales has risen by 3.7 million in a decade, up to 56.1 million, the census shows. It is the largest growth shown by any census since they began in 1801. The growth was fuelled by increased life expectancy, a rise in fertility rates and migration, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Ageing population The figures also indicate the population is ageing, with the median age rising to 39 in 2011 from 35 in 2001. The percentage of the population aged 65 and over was the highest seen in any census at 16.4% - or one in six people. The number of people over the age of 90 also went up. There were 430,000 residents within their 10th decade in 2011, compared with 340,000 in 2001 and 13,000 in 1911. The census showed that higher percentages of people aged 65 and over lived along the coast of England, in the south west, south east and east. Eastern European emigration European population growth between 2001 and 2011 differed greatly between countries. While some, such as Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg, Spain and England, saw big increases, others, mainly in eastern Europe, experienced population losses. Latvia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Romania, Hungary, Estonia, Germany and Poland all saw their populations decrease. Regional differences Although all of the wider regions of England and Wales saw population growth in the last decade, within those regions some local authorities saw theirs decline. The biggest population growth was seen in London's Tower Hamlets (up 26.4%) and Newham (up 23.5%), while Manchester showed the third highest growth - up 19%. Overall, 10 of the 20 authorities with the highest percentage growth were in London. The 19 most densely populated authorities were also in London. In contrast, almost half of the local authorities with a declining population were in north-west England, and a further four were in north-east England. The ONS suggested this could be, in part, down to the decline in traditional manufacturing industries in these areas.", "output": "England and Wales population up", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

However, for the July-to-September quarter, the trade deficit in goods and services widened to \u00a38.5bn, from a gap of \u00a35.1bn in the previous quarter. Comeback signs? Last month, the ONS said the UK's economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, in its first growth estimate for the quarter. The latest ONS figures show that industrial production rose by 0.2% in the July-to-September period, slightly below initial estimates of 0.3%, while manufacturing output fell by 0.4%. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said: \"While manufacturing contracted in the last quarter, there are signs that some parts of industry at least were mounting a comeback after a summer lull.\" She added, though, that there were risks from the economic slowdown happening elsewhere around the world: \"Another disappointing set of trade figures for manufacturing show that these effects are already being felt, with a significant fall in goods exports to China over the past three months.\"", "output": "UK manufacturing output strengthens in September", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

On the Internal Market Bill, the government seems to have defused the backbench Tory rebellion in the Commons, with an offer of a further vote before powers to override international law come into effect. But in the Lords, which takes its committees seriously, the bill may be a harder sell for ministers. The Lords EU Environment Sub-Committee has accused Environment Secretary George Eustice of failing to acknowledge concerns over possible checks and controls on goods moving from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if the UK and EU fail to strike a trade deal. The committee has also warned about the possible impact on all-Ireland supply chains, as well as what it called the \"challenging timetable\" to implement the Northern Ireland Protocol part of the UK's withdrawal agreement. Fireproof bill? That's just one committee - the verdict of others, like the Constitution Committee and the Delegated Powers Committee, could stoke up pressure for a hostile amendment of some kind, when the bill comes before their Lordships. The Constitution Committee is organising panels of experts to give evidence on the legal and devolution implications next week. The Lords could yet make changes and bounce the bill back to MPs. There's been much talk of the 1945 Salisbury Convention making the bill fireproof. But that agreement, reached after the Attlee landslide, was a guarantee that peers (there was then a Conservative majority in the Lords) would not seek to block a bill promised in an election manifesto, at second or third reading stage; it does not preclude amendments the government does not like in between. Meanwhile, the Lords could see the first serious attempt to challenge a pandemic regulation. The Lib Dem Baroness Grender has a \"Prayer to Annul\" down against the latest regulations intended, in line with a government promise, to prevent people who've fallen into rent arrears during the pandemic facing court proceedings for eviction. She's concerned that a major loophole would potentially allow tens of thousands of eviction cases to go ahead, where they were started between March and August. The exact number of people affected is not clear, and she put down a number of, so far unanswered, parliamentary questions to find out. But with claims that 200 extra district judges and tribunal judges were being hired to hear extra eviction cases, she believes the number is substantial. Some cases may deal with anti-social behaviour, or result from rent arrears built up before the pandemic hit, but there are fears that the regulations could also trigger a wave of no-fault evictions. Labour, in the shape of justice spokesperson Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede, have a Regret Motion down against the regulations, but Baroness Grender's Prayer to Annul is a rarely-used device which would actually strike them down, something that hasn't happened since the 1970s. It may be that the government offers assurances, over the next few days, which persuade her not to push it to a vote, but otherwise this would mark the first attempt to strike down a pandemic regulation. Here's my rundown of the coming week: Monday 21 September The Commons week begins at 14:30 BST with an hour of Defence Questions - with the inevitable one or two urgent questions or ministerial statements to follow. Then comes the key section of the committee stage consideration of the Internal Market Bill, when MPs deal with the Northern Ireland provisions. There will be debate on the controversial sections, including amendments to delete them, but not the vote on the government's compromise amendment, tabled last week in response to a promised amendment from senior Tory MP Sir Bob Neill. This is because that amendment deals with the commencement of the power to override the Northern Ireland Protocol, so, while it will be debated, it does not get voted on until Tuesday, when MPs consider the final clause, the commencement clause, which says when the new law comes into effect. There's an interesting adjournment debate with Cambridge MP Daniel Zeichner raising the implications of the foreign acquisition of Cambridge-based technology company Arm Holdings for \u00a331bn. The company is a global leader in designing chips for smartphones, computers and tablets, and he will be will be pressing ministers to explain the government's thinking on whether to refer the takeover to the Competition and Markets Authority. He will also press for government guarantees about jobs in Cambridge, maintaining the HQ and research base there, and securing an exemption from US rules which give the US government extraordinary powers over businesses using ARM-designed chips. On the Committee Corridor, no fewer than four delegated legislation committees will be processing a vast list of regulations, mostly concerned with the pandemic. These include restrictions on gatherings and requirements to wear facemasks, plus the rules for local lockdowns in Leicester and elsewhere, although one is the new regulation to cap public sector redundancy payments at \u00a395,000. The Public Accounts Committee (14:30) takes evidence on selecting towns for the Towns Fund, which aims to provide a selection of struggling towns across England with funding to address issues such as ageing populations, limited regional economic opportunities and lack of investment. There had been concern about the transparency of the process. In the Lords, (12.00) crossbencher Baroness Cox will question ministers on a recent parliamentary report about violence against Christians in Nigeria. Other questions cover financial support to retailers unable to access the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme because of the EU's state aid rules, government guidance to health care providers about appropriate treatment to different patient age groups, and the number of probation staff needed to implement the Probation Workforce Strategy. The day's legislating is the second reading of the Counter-Terrorism and Sentencing Bill - which is designed to ensure that the sentences served by terrorists reflect the severity of offending, and strengthen the tools for monitoring them in the community. Tuesday 22 September The Commons opens (11:30) with Justice Questions - where the subject of the day's main event may come up in some pointed questions to Justice Secretary Robert Buckland. Conservative Jonathan Gullis will introduce the day's ten-minute rule bill, which would change the Town and Country Planning Act to allow unlimited fines against rogue private land owners who allow their property to fall into ruin. At the moment, he argues the \u00a31,000 fine available to the courts is so low that it puts local authorities off court action against them. And then MPs move on to the final day of committee stage scrutiny of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill, although there will be two days set aside for report stage consideration and third reading, where some of these battles may be re-fought. There's a lot of action on the Committee Corridor: Environment Secretary George Eustice and his permanent secretary, Tamara Finkelstein, are before the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee (14:30). The Treasury Committee (09:30) takes evidence on UK customs policy, with witnesses from the Institute of Directors, Logistics UK and the Port of Dover. Foreign Affairs (14:30) talks to Koji Tsuruoka, former Japanese ambassador to the UK, and Singaporean Ambassador-at-Large Chan Heng Chee about an ongoing review of UK foreign policy. Justice (14:30) has a session on the future of the probation service, with evidence from the Chief Inspector of Probation, Justin Russell, and others working in rehabilitation. International Development (14:30) discusses the next steps in addressing sexual exploitation and abuse in the aid sector. In the Lords (12:00), questions to ministers cover the recovery and diversification of the UK oil and gas industry supply chain, diversity in the creative industries during the pandemic and further devolution in England. Then peers move on to the third day of report stage consideration of the Agriculture Bill, which will see key votes on a series of amendments intended to prevent imported foodstuffs undercutting the animal welfare and hygiene requirements on UK farms. There are rather similar-looking amendments from Labour's Lord Grantchester, a rare beast in the Labour world as an actual farmer, with dairy herds (insert jokes about \"Moo Labour\" here) and the former NFU stalwart Lord Clark, which would give the Trade and Agriculture Commission set up by the government a veto over trade deals which did not protect UK standards. And there's also an amendment from Labour's Baroness Jones, requiring the government to set targets for reducing the climate change emissions created by agriculture. The government has already suffered one defeat on the bill - a 50-vote loss on an earlier amendment from Baroness Jones on linking financial assistance to agriculture to environmental targets. Wednesday 23 September Commons business opens (11:30) with half an hour of Women and Equalities Questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time. The day's ten-minute rule bill, from the Conservative MP James Daly, is about ensuring that healthy or curable animals are not put down, or their bodies disposed of, without having their microchips checked; it reflects two local campaigns in his constituency. The first \"Gizmo's Law\" followed the case of a cat named Gizmo which was killed by a car. The body was destroyed by the local council without checking the microchip, which would have allowed Gizmo's owner to handle to burial. The bill aims to ensure that no deceased cat can be cremated without all attempts being made to reunite it with its owner. The second, Tuk's law, is named after a rescue dog named Tuk who was taken to a vet and euthanised without his back-up rescue being contacted. The bill aims to make it a legal requirement that vets are required to scan for rescue backup contact details (i.e. a former owner or the breeder) and contact them to enquire as to whether they would like to take ownership of the pet and also to confirm the person presenting the animal is registered as the owner, before putting down a healthy or treatable animal. Then MPs turn to the second reading of the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Bill, which would provide greater legal protections to armed forces personnel and veterans who have served or are serving on military operations overseas. It will create a new 'triple lock' to ensure that the pressures placed on them during overseas operations will be taken into account when prosecution decisions are made about alleged historical offences. First, there will have to be \"exceptional\" circumstances to justify prosecutions for alleged offences more than five years ago, plus a requirement for prosecutors to give particular weight to certain matters in reaching decisions in such cases, and a requirement for the permission of the attorney general or, in the case of Northern Ireland, the advocate general, before a prosecution can proceed. There will also be a six-year limit on civil actions relating to historical allegations. Critics like the pressure group Redress say the bill risks creating impunity for serious offences including torture, and will put the UK in breach of international treaty obligations. Committee sessions There's plenty of committee activity: Northern Ireland Affairs (09:30) takes evidence from a series of academic experts on the Northern Ireland Protocol; Committee on the Future Relationship with the European Union (09:30) hears from more experts on the post-Brexit trade talks, and Home Affairs takes evidence on counter-extremism and counter-terrorism . The Treasury Committee (14:30) hears evidence on infrastructure from Sir John Armitt, the chair of the National Infrastructure Commission and others. And Science and Technology (14:00) looks at a new UK research funding agency. In the Lords (12:00), ministers field questions on the conditions in Uighur internment camps in Xinjiang in China, government plans to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the algorithm to determine this year's A-level results. Then come the Civil Procedure (Amendment No. 4) (Coronavirus) Rules and the prayer to annul from Baroness Grender, (see above). Lord Keen of Elie was due to reply to this debate - but given he has quit his government post, a locum will have to be found. Peers will also be asked to approve the Immigration (Health Charge) (Amendment) Order 2020, which increases the fees towards the NHS paid by non-EEA nationals from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624. The fee is not paid by certain groups covered by exemptions. Thursday 24 September The Commons opens (09:30) with forty minutes of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Questions, followed by questions to the Attorney General, Suella Braverman. Normally this is quite a low-key affair, but given the controversy over the UK Internal Market Bill, it may well be rather more lively than usual. Then comes the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg. That is followed by three debates selected by the Backbench Business Committee. These cover the situation in Yemen, the settlement of the occupied Palestinian Territories, and the Rohingya humanitarian crisis and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. On the Committee Corridor, Environmental Audit (09:00) has a session on tackling climate change as part of the post-Covid recovery. In the Lords (12:00), former chair of the Metropolitan Police, Lord Harris of Haringey, will ask about the impact on the delivery of the new Emergency Services Network of the decision to ban Huawei equipment from the UK's 5G network. Other questions cover a Troubles-related victims payment scheme in Northern Ireland, and mental health services for young people during the pandemic. Peers should then polish off the report stage of the Agriculture Bill, before moving on to debate the regulations underpinning various local lockdowns across England, covering Leicester, Blackburn with Darwen, and Bradford. Friday 25 September The Commons meets at 09:30 to debate private members' bills. First up is a bill from Labour MP Darren Jones, with the second reading of his Forensic Science Regulator and Biometrics Strategy Bill. Forensics services are provided to the police by private sector companies (the Coalition fully privatised the service), but the Forensics Regulator doesn't have the legal powers to require them to meet standards, or to impose fines if they don't. The Regulator has warned that the poor quality of forensic services in the UK is having a direct effect on successful prosecutions - so the bill has government support. Next, the SNP's Dr Philippa Whitford has the second reading of her Public Interest Disclosure (Protection) Bill - a whistle-blower protection measure she has previously proposed as a ten-minute rule bill. It would establish an independent body that would set, monitor and enforce standards on how whistleblower cases are handled, and replace the Public Interest Disclosure Act, which, she argues, is no longer fit for purpose. After that come a series of bills proposed by Private Members Bill frequent flyer, Sir Christopher Chope. He's one of the group of Conservative backbenchers who sleep over in the Public Bill Office every year, to be first in the queue to get their proposed measures onto the order paper, with the chance of getting some debating time in the chamber, behind the bills that win places in the annual private members' bill ballot. Magistrates' retirement age His proposals include the Illegal Immigration (Offences) Bill, the Border Control Bill and the Foreign Nationals (Criminal Offender and Prisoner Removal) Bill, among others. Its possible they might get a short debate at the fag-end of the day. Behind that on the list are a series of measures floated as ten-minute rule bills or presentation bills which have no real prospect of getting discussed, still less voted on. But keep half an eye on the Magistrates (Retirement Age) Bill, from the Conservative Edward Timpson. It is whispered that the Ministry of Justice would like to get the increase in the retirement age it proposes into law - but that would require it to be given a formal second reading without objection, when the title of the bill is read out at the close of business at 14:30. That in turn would require Conservative awkward squaddies like Chris Chope to be persuaded not to object - might a deal be done?

Now, listeners to BBC Radio 2's Sounds of the 80s have chosen it as the decade's best record, in a poll marking National Album Day on Saturday. Dire Straits' Brothers In Arms came second, followed by The Stone Roses' eponymous debut. All but one of the top 20 are by male artists, with the exception being Kate Bush's Hounds Of Love - which lands at number 11. The Human League's Dare, which takes sixth place, also features prominent contributions from singers Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley; while albums by Madonna, Janet Jackson, Tracy Chapman and Grace Jones feature further down the list. The Joshua Tree was almost called The Two Americas. Later, Desert Songs was another contender, before the band settled on The Joshua Tree - a title that perfectly captured the sacred/secular tension of U2's landscaped songs and Biblical imagery. Written against the backdrop of the Cold War, the album reflected two sides of the American dream, with the Irish band seduced by its glamour but repelled by what bassist Adam Clayton called \"the bleakness and greed\" of the Reagan era. \"And it feels like we're right back there in a way,\" said guitarist The Edge, after hearing the results of Radio 2 poll. \"Politics are still so polarised.\" He added: \"We've had the privilege of playing The Joshua Tree live all over the world in the last few years and it's almost like the album has come full circle. \"We're just thrilled that people are still connecting with these songs, night after night, year after year.\" Produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, The Joshua Tree won U2 a Grammy for album of the year, and songs like I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and Bullet The Blue Sky - a criticism of US activities in Central America - have remained staples of their live shows ever since. In the UK, it was the ninth best-selling album of the 1980s, beaten by several records - including Michael Jackson's Bad and Phil Collins' No Jacket Required - which came lower down Radio 2's list. Sounds of the 80s presenter Gary Davies reflected that choosing the ultimate 80s album was a near-impossible task. \"Because there were so many brilliant albums in the 80s, having to choose just one is really difficult,\" he said. However, he added: \"I'm very pleased to see that the Radio 2 listeners have impeccable taste by choosing an album from my all-time favourite band.\" A countdown of the audience's top 40 favourite albums will be broadcast on Friday, 9 October from 20:00 BST on Radio 2 and BBC Sounds. National Album Day follows on Saturday, with an 80s theme of its own. Record stores will be stocked with limited editions of classics like ZZ Top's Eliminator, Paul Simon's Graceland, Cyndi Lauper's She's So Unusual, Prefab Sprout's Steve McQueen and Duran Duran's self-titled debut album.

'Ill-advised' A criminal investigation into the leak was launched on Friday by the Met Police Counter Terrorism Command, which takes national responsibility for investigating allegations of criminal breaches of the Official Secrets Act. Mr Basu said he was satisfied the leak had damaged UK international relations and added that there was a \"clear public interest\" in bringing those responsible to justice. He faced criticism, however, after he advised individuals and the media not to publish leaked government documents and to instead hand them over to the police or return them to their rightful owner. Evening Standard editor George Osborne described the Met statement as \"stupid\" and \"ill-advised\". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman branded it \"sinister\" and \"anti-democratic\". \"Do you have any comprehension of a free society? This isn't Russia,\" he tweeted. Mr Basu issued a further statement on Saturday afternoon saying he had received legal advice that led to the Met initiating an investigation into the documents as a potential breach of the Official Secrets Act (OSA). \"We have a duty to prevent as well as detect crime and the previous statement was intended to alert to the risk of breaching the OSA,\" he said. What is the Official Secrets Act? The Official Secrets Acts say a person can be guilty of an offence if they make a \"damaging disclosure of any information or document\" relating to security or intelligence of which they are in possession. A person does not have to officially \"sign\" the Official Secrets Act to be bound by it. The 1989 Act says a person can simply be \"notified\" that it applies to them - for example, in a government employee's contract. The law is strictest for those working for the security and intelligence services, past and present. Any unauthorised disclosure - under any circumstances - is a criminal offence. Prosecutions under the Official Secrets Act aren't very common - about one a year - according to the House of the Commons Library. But over the years, there have been some high-profile cases.

In a new book, Mr Hollande said he never used the term in a derogatory way and called her story \"a betrayal\". In response, Ms Trierweiler posted what appears to be a 2005 text message from the president using the term. The allegation is potentially damaging to the Socialist Party president as he considers whether to stand again in next year's presidential election. Transcript of messages French newspaper Le Parisien published excerpts from a new book (in French), A President Should Not Say That, on Wednesday. Written by two journalists, it documents dozens of private conversations they had with Mr Hollande. In one excerpt, he said Ms Trierweiler's claim that he had referred to the poor as \"sans dents\" (without teeth) was never said in a derogatory way. Instead, he claimed he once said: \"I see people who come up to me during demonstrations, they are poor, they are toothless.\" Ms Trierweiler responded with a transcription of a message she says was from Mr Hollande, with details down to the date and time. \"I am with my friend Bernadette in a large demonstration in her district,\" the tweet says. \"I launched a charm offensive. But you do not have to worry. In her speech, she made a great slip. Everyone laughed, even the toothless.\" Ms Trierweiler dated the message to 31 May 2005, at 12.39pm. However, she has not posted any photographic proof of the original message. The allegation about Mr Hollande's attitude to the poor initially appeared in August 2014 in Ms Trierweiler's book Thank You For This Moment, published months after her split from Mr Hollande.

It normally sees stars like Lady GaGa, Billy Porter and Katy Perry gracing the red carpet in elaborate outfits. All was not lost, however, as celebrities including Julia Roberts and Amanda Seyfried dressed up regardless while in isolation. Roberts wore a tiered black-and-white gown - in her bathroom. Mamma Mia! star Seyfried, meanwhile, posted a photo of herself outdoors in the woods. Both backdrops were very different to the ball's usual imposing setting of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Katy Perry also showcased what she would have worn, a Jean Paul Gaultier Madonna-inspired costume. The pop star is expecting her first baby with partner Orlando Bloom. There was still an official live stream, called A Moment with the Met, hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. And while it could never match the real thing, we did get to see Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine belt out You've Got the Love in front of some marvellous wallpaper. Wintour told viewers at home: \"This is a time of grief and of hardship for millions, and the postponement of a party is nothing in comparison. \"And yet, one thing that we have learned through this difficult time is that we need each other, that community is essential to who we are. \"If we are to come out of this pandemic stronger and more resilient, we must emerge from it connected as never before.\" She also asked for donations to the Met and the Common Thread, an initiative to help those struggling in the fashion industry. Cardi B also popped up to lend support from home, saying: \"I know I had my outfit\u2026 we had something really cooking that I know was going to impact\u2026 I cannot wait so we can come next year stronger than ever.\" She then introduced an \"after party\" DJ set from US fashion designer and DJ Virgil Abloh. Vogue also held a #MetGalaChallenge, with many posting images of outfits modelled on previous Met Ball celebrity looks. Here's someone re-creating Cardi B's 2019 outfit, which was one of last year's stand-out costumes. Several fashionistas channelled Rihanna's 2017 Met look. But actress and writer Mindy Kaling took the plaudits with this recreation of Jared Leto's infamous Met attire from last year.

Researchers now think the injuries were caused during attacks by other seals, who ate their victims. The Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) observed a grey seal killing five young seals, leaving the spiral injuries. Similar behaviour by seals has been recorded in Germany and scientists have suggested such attacks may be more common than previously thought. They believe it could explain the unusual clusters of injured seals found in Scottish waters. Until now it was thought the animals had died after being caught in ships propellers because of the spiral cuts on their skin. The injury has been described as a single, smooth-edged wound starting at the head and spiralling around the body. The SMRU, based at St Andrews University, was commissioned by Marine Scotland to investigate after 86 seal carcasses were found between 2009 and October 2014 with the distinctive markings. A number of grey seals in the Firth of Forth were tagged to examine potential interactions with shipping and discover if any suffered the spiral injuries. In December 2014 the scientists recorded an adult male seal on the Isle of May, in the Firth of Forth. The SMRU said: \"The Isle of May has been a hotspot for corkscrew injuries with multiple strandings recorded in 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014.\" Seal attack The adult male seal was caught on camera attacking, attempting to drown, then killing and eating a weaned grey seal pup. The SMRU described the attack: \"It grabbed the pup by the scruff of the neck and dragged it over 20m to a shallow freshwater pool. \"The adult then climbed on top of the pup, forced its head under water and held it until its struggle subsided.\" Over a period of 10 days the grey seal was observed killing five seal pups, and a further nine pup carcasses were found in locations where the adult had been sighted. The seal was then traced by researchers to Denmark and Germany. Of the 14 pups the researchers believe the adult male killed, 12 had the characteristics wounds that started at the head and spiralled down the body. The report concluded: \"The wound pattern seen on the grey seal pups at the Isle of May clearly resembled those that have been recorded as corkscrew wounds on previous grey and harbour seal cases in Scotland.\" 'Important evidence' Marine Scotland said this new evidence does not completely eliminate ship propellers, but they are less likely to be a key factor. The government agency said it will continue to fund research into this issue to understand what caused these unusual deaths. Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said: \"The clusters of corkscrew seal deaths were unusual and worrying. \"In common with many of the creatures that live in our seas, seals are animals that are loved by the public. \"It is very important that we understand what caused these unusual deaths and we now have important evidence that natural predatory behaviour is likely to be the main cause, rather than ship propeller injuries as we first thought.\" He added: \"Marine Scotland will continue to monitor our seal population for further injuries and any evidence about the causes.\"", "output": "'Corkscrew' seal deaths due to cannibalism not boats", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Opposition leaders accused First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of a \"basic failure\" to anticipate the problem and provide more testing. Ms Sturgeon insisted the country's testing system was working well. And she said the rising number of coronavirus cases underlined why tough new restrictions were introduced on Tuesday to \"get the virus back under control\". A further 465 positive tests were reported across Scotland on Thursday, representing 7.9% of people newly tested. The figures are in part driven by outbreaks at a number of universities, where many students in halls of residences in Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen and Edinburgh have been told to self-isolate. A total of 172 Glasgow University students have so far tested positive, with 600 in isolation, while all 500 residents at the Parker House halls in Dundee have been told to quarantine. And 120 cases of coronavirus have been identified in an outbreak at Edinburgh Napier University. St Andrews University asked students to observe a \"voluntary lockdown\" over the weekend, with concerns about the virus spreading among students arriving for the new term. There has also been confusion about whether students in university accommodation are able to go back to their family home - with the Scottish government initially saying they could not. National clinical director Prof Jason Leitch subsequently said students could go home for the weekend so long as they are not self-isolating and do not have Covid symptoms. But he has since said they cannot return home because they are now in separate households from their family. Ms Sturgeon was repeatedly challenged about the situation during her weekly question session at Holyrood, where she said \"some further measures\" would be introduced later. She said the number of positive cases at universities was likely to increase, but said this underlined that the test and protect system \"is working, and we must continue to have confidence in that\". The first minister also said more walk-in testing centres will opening near some universities in the coming days in addition to the two that are already open in Glasgow and St Andrews. Centres in Aberdeen and Edinburgh are due to open from Friday, with similar facilities also planned for , Dundee, Stirling and a second in Glasgow. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the spread of the virus at universities should have been predicted - and said there had been similar failures to anticipate a spike in demand for testing when schools returned in August. He said the Scottish government had failed since \"day one\" of the pandemic to plan ahead, adding: \"This failure to test is a failure to contain the virus. This will cost people their health, their hopes and possibly their lives.\" Mr Leonard also said action was needed to ensure students would not potentially have to spend Christmas away from their families. Ms Sturgeon replied that rising case numbers proved that students were being tested, adding: \"It's really important we say to people that if you need tested, get tested - the capacity is there. \"The worst thing any of us could do right now would be to unfairly and unjustifiably undermine confidence in test and protect - that confidence, right now, is justified.\" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said there was a \"clear concern\" that the virus could spread from university campuses when students return home, asking if the government would consider routine testing - similar to the system employed in care homes. She said: \"There is still time to get on top of these outbreaks before they spread more widely.\" Ms Sturgeon said she would consider such a move, but said \"routine testing is not some kind of pass out of all the other obligations\" and created a \"real risk of false assurance coming from negative tests\". The point about preparation was also raised by Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who said the situation with students was \"playing a significant role in relighting the fires of the pandemic here in Scotland\". He said: \"The truth is that outbreaks like this should have been expected, and support and testing sites should have been in place before term started.\" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said routine testing would be \"an extra safety measure that would protect us all\", saying there was a risk of asymptomatic carriers \"unknowingly spreading the disease\". Ms Sturgeon replied: \"Testing is vital here, but it is absolutely wrong to say it somehow an absence or shortage of testing available that is an issue with the outbreaks in student accommodation. \"If we weren't testing them, we wouldn't have seen these increases. \"We have to be careful that a negative test doesn't lead a student to say 'I'm fine, I don't need to bother with isolation or social distancing and abiding by all the rules'.\"", "output": "Scottish university outbreaks 'should have been predicted'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Fierce competition In the document, released on Thursday, China gives a downbeat assessment of the regional security situation. \"Profound changes are taking shape in the Asia-Pacific strategic landscape. Relevant major powers are increasing their strategic investment,\" it says. \"International military competition remains fierce.\" The document singles out the United States. According to China, it is reinforcing military alliances and getting more involved in regional affairs. Beijing also says foreigners are now more suspicious of China - and have increased \"interference and countering moves\" against it. Relations between China and the United States, particularly on military matters, have been strained over recent years. That tension eased slightly following Chinese President Hu Jintao's state visit to the United States earlier this year. But the potential for disagreement remains high. \"We admit that our military ties continue to face difficulties and challenges,\" said Col Geng Yansheng, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, at a press conference to launch the white paper. No issue threatens the relationship more than US support for Taiwan, a self-governing island off China's eastern coast that Beijing considers its own. \"The United States continues to sell weapons to Taiwan, severely impeding Sino-US relations,\" says the white paper. Col Geng made it clear that the two countries must respect each other's core interests. For China, that includes Taiwan. \"China is willing to work with the US, based on respect, trust, equality and mutual benefits,\" he said. The United States and some of China's neighbours occasionally express their concerns about the ultimate aim of Beijing's military modernisation.

And he said he would be stepping down with immediate effect. His resignation comes just months ahead of the Scottish Parliament election, which is scheduled to be held in May. Mr Leonard had been leader of the party for three years after succeeding Kezia Dugdale. The former union official had faced open calls to quit from some of his own MSPs last year amid concerns that his leadership style could damage the party in the forthcoming Scottish Parliament election. Polls have suggested that many Scottish Labour supporters struggle to recognise him, and he is closely associated with former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Scottish Labour had dominated politics in Scotland for decades, but is currently the third largest party at Holyrood behind the SNP and Conservatives. And Mr Leonard's critics had questioned whether he was capable of turning the party's fortunes around. In a statement, Mr Leonard said the decision to resign had not been easy - but he felt it was the right one for him and his party. He said: \"I have thought long and hard over the Christmas period about what this crisis means, and the approach Scottish Labour takes to help tackle it. \"I have also considered what the speculation about my leadership does to our ability to get Labour's message across. This has become a distraction. \"I have come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of the party that I step aside as leader of Scottish Labour with immediate effect.\" He also insisted that Scotland now needs a Labour government more than ever, and accused both the Scottish and UK governments of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Leonard added: \"While I step down from the leadership today, the work goes on - and I will play my constructive part as an MSP in winning support for Labour's vision of a better future in a democratic economy and a socialist society.\" Fifth leader His decision leaves Scottish Labour looking for its fifth leader since the independence referendum in 2014 - with Johann Lamont, Jim Murphy and Kezia Dugdale all having held the job since then. A Procedures Committee, to oversee the election of Mr Leonard's successor, has been formed and will have its first meeting on Friday. Meanwhile, Labour's Scottish Executive Committee will also meet in the coming days to agree a timetable for the process. MSP Jackie Baillie, who was Scottish Labour's deputy leader, has taken charge of the party on an interim basis. This sudden resignation four months from the Holyrood elections seems to have taken Scottish Labour by surprise. MSPs I've spoken to said they did not see it coming. There have been times when Richard Leonard has been under severe pressure from some in his party to stand down. When several MSPs publicly called for him to quit because the party had gone backwards at successive elections on his watch, he stood firm. His critics seemed to have accepted that he would lead them and a divided party into the Holyrood election. That has now changed and interim leader Jackie Baillie has to quickly organise a contest to replace him. It's a contest in which Anas Sarwar, if he stands, would be an obvious frontrunner - even although he lost last time to Mr Leonard, who was seen as much closer to the then UK party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Leonard should be \"very proud\" of his achievements as leader of the party in Scotland. Sir Keir added: \"I would like to thank Richard for his service to our party and his unwavering commitment to the values he believes in. \"Richard has led Scottish Labour through one of the most challenging and difficult periods in our country's history, including a general election and the pandemic.\" Mr Leonard had been due to face a confidence vote at the party's ruling Executive Committee last September - but the motion was withdrawn at the last minute. It came after four Scottish Labour MSPs called for him to go, warning that the party faced \"catastrophe\" at the ballot box under his leadership. They pointed to the party's dismal performance in previous elections under Mr Leonard. Scottish Labour finished fifth in the European election in May 2019, and then lost all but one of its MPs in the general election in December of the same year. Mr Leonard insisted at the time that he intended to lead the party into this year's Holyrood election, and accused his opponents of waging \"internal war\" against him. 'A decent guy' First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who faced Mr Leonard in her weekly question session in the Scottish Parliament, tweeted that she had \"always liked Richard Leonard\" despite their political difference. She added: \"He is a decent guy and I wish him well for the future.\" Ruth Davidson, who quit as leader of the Scottish Tories in 2019 before returning to lead the party at Holyrood, said she had always found Mr Leonard to be a \"thoroughly decent man and a committed campaigner.\" Anas Sarwar, who was defeated by Mr Leonard in the leadership contest in 2017 and is seen as one of the favourites to replace him, said he was sure Mr Leonard would \"continue to fight for a fairer, more just and more equal society today, tomorrow and long into the future.\" But Labour MSP Neil Findlay, an outspoken supporter of Mr Leonard, took aim at those who had sought to oust him last year - describing them as \"flinching cowards\" and \"sneering traitors\".", "output": "Richard Leonard quits as Scottish Labour leader", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The charity's Twilight Car, which runs up until 02:00 on weekends in winter months, was operating minutes away from her when she was taken ill in February. Ellie, from Abercarn, was 14 months old when she became very ill following a seemingly normal winter cold. Her father Matt, 25, said he and his wife noticed Ellie was \"deteriorating and showing some particularly concerning symptoms, including seizures\". They called 999 just after 20:00 GMT and a Wales Air Ambulance crew arrived by car. \"It soon became apparent that Ellie was far more poorly than we first envisaged,\" Mr Harris said. Dr Dindi Gill was on duty that evening and said the presence of the Twilight Car \"meant that we were able to rapidly deliver critical care interventions\". After she was stabilised, Ellie was flown to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. She was later diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome, a rare but serious condition that affects the way electrical signals pass through the heart, causing it to beat dangerously fast. These unusually fast heartbeats, known as an arrhythmia, can be life-threatening. She was then flown by the charity to Bristol to receive further treatment. Mr Harris said that almost a year later, Ellie was \"able to do things that any two-year-old can do\". \"There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that without Wales Air Ambulance, Ellie may not be here today,\" he added. In 2019, the charity had its busiest year to date - responding to 3,627 emergency call outs, up 1,200 from 2018. Of those, 400 calls involved patients under the age of 17. The charity currently needs \u00a36.5m a year to keep its \"flying medics\" airborne, but to become 24/7 it needs an extra \u00a31.5m a year, and wants to do this by the end of 2020.

But, he added, \"it is not, nor has it ever been, a series of discrete impact assessments examining the quantitative impact of Brexit on these sectors\". \"Given the above, it will take my department - and other departments, since this work draws on inputs from across government - time to collate and bring together this information in a way that it accessible and informative for the committee,\" he added.

It also helps pave the way for better quality virtual reality gaming at home. The company has also announced the release of the PlayStation 4 Slim, a smaller version of the original console. But it's the Pro and its additional power that has gamers excited as it's due out in November. \"I'm most looking forward to the increased power, to see my favourite games - like Bloodborne - look better than they already do,\" 23-year-old software developer (and keen gamer) Harrison Holt-McHale tells Newsbeat. \"It's one of PlayStation's strengths that they already have really good looking games.\" Gaming is Harrison's main pastime and he is an early adopter of new PlayStation technology, having owned a console since the PS1. He admits, however, that such a major update does feel a little too soon in the PS4's console cycle. \"It has always seemed like it has taken four or five years to get to the really great games, the games that define the console,\" he says. \"It doesn't feel like they've got there with the PS4. Some really good games have come out and there are some really great games on the horizon that look like they are going to open up the PS4 and show us what Sony and other companies are capable of putting on the console.\" \"It seems like yesterday the PS4 came out.\" And not all PS4 users are happy about the updated console. \"I will not be upgrading to the PS4 Pro and I am also not happy about it,\" software engineer and gamer Tom Nulty, 22, tells Newsbeat. He has concerns that studios will build games with the Pro in mind, and the original PS4 as an afterthought. \"I believe that the vastly upgraded hardware for the Pro could lead to developers making games specifically aimed for that console, this will result in bad performance on the original. Although Sony has stated Pro \"exclusives\" are not allowed, the games could potentially be just that, if the low frame rate or textures make it almost unplayable on the original.\" Newsbeat's Gaming Reporter Steffan Powell: The PS4 Pro is offering gamers ultra high definition gaming as expected. The new console isn't easy on the eye but it is cheaper and out sooner than many expected. The ball is now in Microsoft's court who have their updated console coming soon. Theirs is likely to be more powerful but will they match the price? And will gamers be willing to wait? In New York Playstation showed some footage of the new machine in action and announced just how powerful it is. But Sony are not having it all their own way. Earlier this year Microsoft announced their Project Scorpio which will be an updated version of the Xbox One. They made the announcement at E3 in Los Angeles. It promises to be the most powerful console ever built and will challenge the Pro when released next year. Both Microsoft and Sony will now try and persuade gamers that their new system is the one worth investing in. There will also be a new Nintendo console released, currently codenamed the NX, although it wont be as powerful as the other two.

He shoves his hands in his pockets as he stands next to me, outside where we can speak freely about the cruelty of his past, without fear of being overheard. The Abu Ghraib scandal broke on 28 April 2004 when photos taken by him and other soldiers at the prison were revealed on CBS News. The pictures showed naked prisoners heaped into a pyramid, forced to simulate sexual acts and adopt humiliating poses. One showed a US soldier, Lynndie England, holding a prisoner on a strap made to look like a leash. Another, the defining image of the scandal, showed a hooded man standing on a box and holding electrical wires. Sivits was sentenced to a year in prison for dereliction of duty, for counts related to taking a picture and failing to stop the mistreatment of detainees. In the car park, he describes lessons he's learned from the scandal - about humility, compassion and doing the right thing. As cars roar past, we duck inside the restaurant and find a quiet place. He says he believes his own personal lessons have also been absorbed by the nation. Like many of those who worked at Abu Ghraib and became embroiled in the scandal, Sivits comes from a rural part of the country that offered few prospects for young people. Sivits grew up in Hyndman, Pennsylvania. It is located in the \"valley of nowhere\", says one local, Robert Clites. The 69-year-old says there is no mobile phone coverage for a six- to 10-mile radius. The main street smells of diesel and sawdust from logging trucks that careen through town. Sivits' old house, right next to the train tracks, is now charred from a fire and lies vacant with boarded-up windows. His mother, Freda, worked at Dollar General, a discount retailer. Father Daniel, a drywall finisher, completed two tours in Vietnam and received two combat medals. Daniel died last year of lung cancer, and family members said in an obituary that rather than buying flowers, mourners could instead give money to Freda to help pay for the funeral. At Hyndman Senior High School, Sivits was known for his polite manner and his eagerness to help out. \"He was a courteous kid,\" says Clites, sitting in a supermarket delicatessen in Hyndman. \"Someone would ask him to do something, and he'd do it. And whatever consequences there were, well, that's what it is.\" \"A nice young man,\" says Herman Rawlings, 86, a Korean war veteran who was sorting through his mail in the post office. He believes Sivits was following orders in Iraq and the punishment was unfair. \"He got a raw deal. When you're in a position like he was in, you do what you have to do.\" Rawlings gives me a hard stare and says: \"Hell, war is hell.\" Sivits, 38, has sideburns and short, brown hair and speaks with an accent that hints at his Appalachian roots. He says that as a child he dreamed of being a soldier like his father. \"When I was 18, I enlisted and started my adventure,\" he says. He became a member of the 800th military police brigade, and in 2003 he was sent to Iraq. \"I thought: 'Man, I'm going to a big sandbox,'\" he says and smiles. More from Tara: Not long after Sivits arrived in Iraq, he was assigned to work at Abu Ghraib, a prison in Baghdad where he filled in as a mechanic and a driver. At the time about 2,000 Iraqi men, women and children were held at the prison. Many were innocent and knew nothing about the insurgency - they'd been picked up accidentally in raids. By this time, the US had approved the use of harsh interrogation methods at US-run detention facilities. Vice-President Dick Cheney said shortly after the 9/11 attacks that they would work the \"dark side\". With that goal in mind, Washington officials recast laws in order to allow for interrogation methods that had long been defined as torture, and the techniques were used on prisoners at Abu Ghraib. Detainees were beaten - some to death. One photograph shows the corpse of a prisoner, Manadel al-Jamadi, who had been held there by the CIA. His body was wrapped in plastic. Standing in the pizzeria, Sivits describes the events that he witnessed at the prison. One evening in November 2003, he helped a guard he says was known as \"Freddie\" - Ivan Frederick - to escort detainees to Tier 1A, a cellblock for dangerous prisoners. After they got there, they saw naked prisoners lying in a hallway, jumbled together. Charles Graner, Lynndie England and other soldiers were standing around, laughing. Frederick and Sivits placed their men onto the heap. \"Everybody's like: 'Well, why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that?'\" Sivits says. \"It just happens and happens. You lose track of time, and it's like you're in a big warp.\" More on Abu Ghraib In the midst of the cacophony, Sivits noticed that the \"flex cuffs\", as military handcuffs are known, were bound too tightly on one prisoner, causing his hands to swell and turn purple. Sivits turned to Graner and said: \"Dude, this guy's going to lose his hands.\" He pulled out a multi-tool and slid a blade under the prisoner's handcuffs and loosened them. Afterwards, Sivits tells me, the prisoner relaxed: \"His hands - you could see the blood flow started back.\" Graner handed Sivits a camera and crouched next to a hooded man in an orange jumpsuit who was crumpled on the floor. With one hand, Graner held the prisoner's head gently. Graner balled his other hand into a fist. \"He had his head cradled,\" Sivits says, describing the way that Graner held the prisoner and posed for the camera. Sivits took a picture. Then Graner punched him, says Sivits. \"Don't know why.\" He lets out a short laugh. Then he sighs. \"That was the only picture I took,\" says Sivits. \"I was there - kind of.\" He looks into the distance when he talks about what happened at the prison. He has a detached manner, as if someone else - not him - was there that night. When the Abu Ghraib photos appeared on television the following spring, President George W Bush said: \"We will learn all the facts and determine the full extent of these abuses. Those involved will be identified. They will answer for their actions.\" Sivits and 10 other soldiers were convicted for the abuse. Graner was sentenced to 10 years, Frederick to eight, and England to three. The trials laid bare the crimes and the messy, intertwined lives of the soldiers. After being released from prison, England moved back to her hometown, Fort Ashby, West Virginia. She's now living with her parents and taking care of her child, the son of Graner. While Graner was in prison, he married Megan Ambuhl, another one of the convicted soldiers. After the scandal broke, the US lost the moral high ground, according to many of those who fought in the war. Insurgents who attacked US forces after 2004, according to a retired general, Stanley McChrystal, said they were enraged by the Abu Ghraib photos. The prison was handed over to Iraqi authorities in 2006, and eight years later the place was closed down. Several dozen former prisoners sued a private contractor, a company that employed Arabic-language interpreters, for their role in the abuse. A settlement of about $5m (\u00a33.7m) was reached in 2013. One of their lawyers, Shereef Akeel, says the settlement provided \"a huge sense of justice\". After prison in Kuwait, Germany and North Carolina, Sivits went back to Pennsylvania. \"I was a nasty person for a long time because I had so much hatred inside of me - for myself.\" He could not find a job as a mechanic so he began to counsel people who were addicted to drugs and alcohol. \"I decided that I was going to use my experience from Abu Ghraib to talk to them about making choices.\" He spoke to them about mistakes that he'd made during the war, ones he deeply regretted. \"I'm like: 'Yeah. That was me. That isn't who I am today. I'm a different person.'\" \"What happened at the prison was a horrible thing,\" he adds. \"But I think people have learned a little.\" He found a kind of redemption through counselling work and has been able to move forward with his life. Yet his efforts to help people in Pennsylvania and atone for his past offer little solace to those who were subjected to the abuse at the prison. Many of them say they're still feeling the effects of their injuries. Ali al-Qaisi, who became known as the \"hooded man\" (the name refers to the image of a hooded prisoner standing on a box), said in a video posted on Twitter: \"It crushed our psyches.\" Sivits is right that the country did change after Abu Ghraib. Torture was banned in 2009, shortly after President Barack Obama took office. Military interrogations were restricted and \"black site\" prisons, CIA-run facilities where detainees were subjected to harsh interrogations, shut down. A new legal framework was created so that perpetrators, whether they worked for the government or a military contractor, could be more easily held accountable. Yet human-rights advocates say that despite the changes in law and government policy, people are now more accepting of the idea of torture than they were in the past. The Abu Ghraib photos were shocking but over time outrage faded. Despite widespread rejection of those images, a \"disturbing number\" of voters later said yes when asked if torture was ever justified, says Katherine Hawkins, an investigator who works for the Project on Government Oversight. One recent poll suggests two-thirds of Americans think torture can be justified. She and others believe that Abu Ghraib is more than a dark chapter in the nation's past. \"The use of torture wasn't relegated to history,\" says Alberto Mora, who served as the Navy's general counsel during the Bush administration. \"It continues to resonate.\" During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump said that if he were elected president he would bring back waterboarding, an interrogation technique that's banned by federal law, as well as methods that were \"a hell of a lot worse\" than waterboarding. He shifted his position after the election, saying he would defer to Defence Secretary James Mattis, who has said torture was a bad idea. But the new national security adviser, John Bolton, has previously said that Americans should have the full range of interrogation methods available to them - and that he's open to the possibility of waterboarding in order to get information from someone. Trump's nominee for CIA director, Gina Haspel, once oversaw a black site, and human-rights activists say she is not suitable for the role of director because of her role in the harsh interrogation programme under the Bush administration. \"In these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror,\" the president has tweeted. \"Win Gina!\" She said during her confirmation process she would not re-start the harsh interrogation programme and conceded it was wrong. But it will likely not stop her being confirmed later this month. Nearly a decade and a half after the scandal, Mora says he's not sure people in the US have learned lessons in humility, the kind that Sivits describes. Mora reminds me that the president and many political leaders say that they support the use of torture. The laws against torture remain in place. But Mora says he worries that if Americans engage in another full-scale war like the one in Iraq, they'll resort to torture again. \"This is what Abu Ghraib represents,\" he says. \"It represents the possibility of making a mistake and returning to the use of cruelty.\"", "output": "'I hated myself for Abu Ghraib abuse'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

He has since made a complete recovery, says Aaron Machado, who operates the clinic that treated the animal. \"The only thing he has to do now is get used to not having any more room service,\" Mr Machado told the BBC. The koala was nicknamed after Jeremy Sparrow, a fire service volunteer who rescued him earlier this month. Jeremy was treated for burns to the paws at the Australian Marine Wildlife Research and Rescue Organisation (AMWRRO) in Port Melbourne. A photograph of him, lying flat on his front with all four paws soaking in a medical solution, was widely shared on social media. Mr Machado, the president of AMWRRO, said it was important to make sure the koala's wounds did not get infected, given that it has a \"very poor, if not obsolete, immune system\". \"It's one thing having a burn, another thing having an infected burn,\" he said. 'Big grumpy bum' Mr Machado said the koala was initially wary of his rescuers. \"He had a big attitude,\" he said. However, the koala became easier to manage \"once he was over that initial shock and he realised that we weren't going to eat him\". \"We realised he wasn't just big grumpy bum, he actually had a big heart.\" Hundreds of animals are believed to have been killed in the bushfires in South Australia this month.

They include everyone from midwives and radiographers to porters and administrative staff. In total, 1.3 million workers are on that deal, which has been subject to a succession of pay freezes or 1% pay caps since 2010. It has had a devastating effect, unions argue. Average nurse pay has fallen by over 14% in real terms, the Royal College of Nursing says, prompting thousands to leave the profession or have to take on second jobs in supermarkets and bars. But it now looks like the pay rise will come with strings attached. In an interview with the Health Service Journal (HSJ), Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has suggested he wants to change the system of increments. NHS Budget plan not enough, say bosses NHS workers demand 3.9% pay rise 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble These are in-the-job pay rises that staff receive for career progression. Last year, half of staff received rises worth between 3% and 4% on top of the 1% annual pay rise. Mr Hunt told the HSJ it was time to move towards \"more professional pay structures\" rather than simply allowing staff to pick up rises because of \"time served\". This interpretation is strongly rejected by the unions, who argue they are not automatic and require staff to take on certain responsibilities and gain a set amount of experience. Behind the scenes, government officials are suggesting this is not about saving money. Any savings they make from changing the system of increments would go towards adjusting other aspects of the system, they say, such as payments covering anti-social hours, which in theory should benefit those nurses working in high-pressure and difficult environments, such as accident and emergency units. But unions are suspicious - they fear the implication is any offer on an annual pay rise next year will be linked to taking from elsewhere. Now, this is only the very start of the process - formal talks have not even begun. But the problem is there is not much trust. The legacy of the junior doctors' dispute haunts relations between Mr Hunt and the front line.

Ms Burns had her benefits cut after she was assessed by government contractor Atos Healthcare. She had her benefits reinstated just a few weeks ago but died on Monday. 'Disgusted' During her campaign the County Tyrone woman said she was \"disgusted\" after the government cut her sickness benefit and told her she was fit to work. Cecilia Burns had her Employment Support Allowance reduced by \u00a330 a week even though she was still undergoing treatment for breast cancer. Ms Burns had described the medical test as a \"joke\". The government is seeking to reassess all 2.6 million people on incapacity benefit - and its successor employment support allowance (ESA) - by 2014 in an effort to encourage more people back to work and to cut the welfare bill. Stormont Assembly MLA, Michaela Boyle, had helped Ms Burns in her campaign. \"I have known Cecilia since she went for her medical assessment. She received nil points and appealed that assessment.\" Ms Boyle is critical of the assessment process. \"Our office has been dealing with the fall-out of this on a daily basis and that is mainly with the flaws. A lot of MLAs will be facing the wrath of this. \"We have been deeply critical of all aspects of the decision-making process with many claimants being disallowed who have severe disabilities, chronic conditions and life limiting illnesses. \"We have questioned the objectivity of these decisions given that a large number of these decisions are being overturned at appeal stage. \"At 60% of these appeals, the claimant had been awarded nil points in assessment.\" Last week Atos said they would be reviewing their correspondence with claimants after they incorrectly told one woman that assessors were not required to be specifically trained in mental health. Paralympic protest Later on Friday, Disabled People Against Cuts and UK Uncut will protest outside Atos headquarters in London to coincide with the Paralympics. Before her death, Cecilia Burns told the BBC that dealing with the side effects of the treatment were bad enough, but she had been angered by the cut in benefit after she went for a medical. \"I know there's other people out there and they're all scared to come forward,\" she said. \"I was treated badly. I've been working since I was 17, I've paid all my stamps, all my National Insurance.

One of 500 or so people who have been in space, Colonel Hadfield also reminded his audience at the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) about the groundwork that goes into exploring the universe. Life in space is just a small part of the job, he said. \"I was an astronaut for 21 years,\" Mr Hadfield later told BBC News. \"I only flew in space for less than six months. The job of an astronaut is not flying in space - the job of an astronaut is to support space flight and it's immensely different. \"We invent spaceships, we invent space procedures, we push back the edges of the envelope of how we understand space flight. \"I trained for four-and-a-half years for my second space flight and for my third space flight. In between, I supported other astronauts that were flying in space and their families, and I worked to help recover the space programme after the Columbia accident [when all seven astronauts on the shuttle were killed in 2003].\" He also helped change procedures for flying the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that ferries astronauts to the ISS. \"It's not like you sit around and wait, and then you fly in space and then everything else is some limbo or something. It's the job on Earth that matters [\u2026] that's where the meat of it is.\" The former ISS commander retired last year at the age of 53. His last space trip was in 2012-13 when his photos and videos, including a zero-gravity version of Space Oddity, captivated many on planet Earth, reminding its inhabitants of the wonders of both home and the universe. His Manchester stopover was part of a tour to promote his new photography book You Are Here: Around the World in 92 Minutes - the profits of which will go to charity. Mr Hadfield sees it as an \"extremely important\" part of an astronaut's role to \"let people know what you're up to - it's not just purely the technical side but it's also the vanguard, the inspirational side of what we are doing\". MOSI organisers, recently granted a \u00a33m investment by the government, hoped the former astronaut's visit would excite students' interest in science, technology, engineering and maths - often collectively known as STEM. There has long been concern that many young people are shunning these subjects, with one recent survey reporting that some consider them intimidating or boring. In its 2014 Education and Skills Survey, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) highlighted \"an urgent need to improve the supply of STEM-skilled people if economic growth is not to be held back\". \"I think that was a big concern of the ancient Egyptians 3,000 years ago,\" said Mr Hadfield. \"It's always been a concern. The young don't take education serious enough. We're not giving them the grounding in the 3Rs or STEM or whatever our current acronym is - that's normal, we always feel that way. \"Yet somehow we continue to advance civilisation - incredible new discoveries and advances that are going on right now.

Some drugs will be removed and others restricted - a move charities say could leave some without crucial treatments. But a Department of Health spokesman said it will allow \"new and better drugs\" to be offered to patients. Cancer patients currently receiving the treatments will still be allowed to continue using them. The restrictions come into place from 12 March and affect a whole range of treatments for breast, pancreatic and bowel cancer. The most commonly used treatment on the list is Avastin for advanced bowel cancer. The Rarer Cancers Foundation, which is sponsored by drug companies, estimates the step will result in more than 7,700 patients losing out. 'Difficult decisions' But NHS England said \"difficult decisions\" needed to be made and the move would allow some new treatments to be funded. Fund chair Professor Peter Clark said the review - carried out by doctors, pharmacists and patients' representatives - had prioritised the treatments with the \"best clinical benefit\" to get the most out of \"every pound\". The fund will increase to \u00a3340m next year, even though the cuts will save \u00a380m a year. Three treatments have already been added to the list for next year, bringing the total number of drugs that will be available through the fund to 62 from April. \"There were drugs that did not offer sufficient clinical benefit so we simply cannot go on funding those,\" Professor Clark said. \"There were others that offered some benefit but were costly and I am pleased that a number of pharmaceutical firms worked with us to make prices more affordable, saving millions of pounds that can now be reinvested in other treatments. \"These are difficult decisions, but if we don't prioritise the drugs that offer the best value, many people could miss out on promising, more effective treatments that are in the pipeline.\" Patients wanting the drugs will be able to apply as an exceptional case. 'Short-term fix' Owen Sharp, chief executive of Prostate Cancer UK, said the announcement was \"just another symptom of a drug appraisal system in meltdown\". While Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, said the decision was \"bad news for bowel cancer patients\". \"It's likely that 65% of patients with advanced bowel cancer face the probability of an earlier death by being refused innovative treatments that were available before,\" he said. Samia al Qadhi, chief executive at Breast Cancer Care, said the Cancer Drugs Fund was \"falling apart\", while Stephen Whitehead, of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said the move was \"extremely disappointing\". \"These medicines have been proven to be effective through clinical trials and have already provided benefit to thousands of NHS patients,\" he added. But Prof Christopher Twelves, a cancer expert at the University of Leeds, said: \"The CDF was always a short-term fix and ultimately not sustainable or equitable as it was established.\" A Department of Health spokesman said the fund had already helped more than 60,000 people to access drugs. Next year, NHS England will spend \u00a3340m on the fund to allow patients to get \"the drugs they need\", the spokesman added. \"Advances in medical science mean that new medicines are emerging all the time and we want people to have access to the very latest drugs. \"That is why experts have made decisions to stop routinely funding drugs with limited clinical benefit, so we can make way for new and better drugs that offer more to patients.\"", "output": "Cuts to cancer treatments announced", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Residents living on the Wildmill estate said the rest of the county was using their estate as a \"landfill\" site. But the council said most residents had embraced efforts to limit waste and increase recycling. Official statistics show the total number of reported fly-tipping offences in Wales fell to 35,076 last year, the lowest recorded figure since 2014-15. But analysis of the figures showed Conwy, Flintshire, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenau Gwent all recorded record levels of dumping last year. Incidents involving fly-tipping of black bags - rubbish which should go in the household waste bin - also increased in areas where bin collections have been changed. Merthyr Tydfil council said it was having issues with people dumping black bags next to bins in cemeteries and parks. Conwy While recycling rates have improved since controversial bin changes were brought in, the number of black bags being dumped illegally has almost quadrupled. In 2015-16, before a trial of monthly bin collections was brought in, 129 black bin bags were fly-tipped, the following year this had increased to 282. And by the end of March 2019, when the pilot was rolled out across the whole county, the figure stood at 416. The county has been judged one of the cleanest places to live in Wales, and recorded its highest street cleanliness rating in 10 years, last year. But one resident said, since the changes, people had been dumping bags in public litter bins and on industrial estates. Others said charges at tips had let to an increase in fly-tipping. Another resident said she had her locks broken on her bins twice by fly-tippers and had to pay a private contractor to take the waste away. Cabinet member Greg Robbins said there was no excuse for fly-tipping as most households were managing fine with the monthly collections. Bridgend In Bridgend, residents said there has been an increase in fly-tipping since changes to bin rules. The system, introduced in 2017, limited homes with fewer than five occupants to throwing out just two bags of non-recyclable rubbish every fortnight. But figures show there were 1,937 reports of fly-tipping last year - the highest level in more than a decade. The number of black bags filled with household waste being fly-tipped has increased by almost 200% - from 297 the year before the changes were introduced, to 873 last year. On the Wildmill estate, where about 1,000 people live, residents said people were coming from across the county to dump their bags. The estate has communal bins for recycling, and boxes with blue crosses on for bags to be collected - but residents said people were coming from miles away to dump their bags onto the piles, leaving litter strewn everywhere. Rachel Nicholls said she was sick of living in a \"rat-infested hole\" and living in a \"landfill\" site for the rest of Bridgend. \"Everybody else is treated like a person, but here in Wildmill we are treated like second-class citizens,\" she said. \"We have pride in where we live, everyone knows they are fly-tipping but they don't care.\" But the council said its investigations showed the vast majority of fly-tipping in Wildmill originated from residents. \"Bridgend County Borough was recently confirmed as having the second-highest recycling rate in the UK, and the success of this ultimately lies with how the vast majority of local residents have embraced efforts to limit waste and increase recycling,\" a spokesman said. Merthyr Tydfil Merthyr Tydfil council replaced every 240-litre bin with slim-lined 140-litre models, after being judged one of the worst areas for recycling in Wales. Some residents complained they were too small to fit all their rubbish in. Looking at figures, last year the number of illegally-dumped black bin bags hit an all time high, with 1,010 incidents recorded. This has increased year-on-year since the changes were introduced in 2015. The number of incidents of household items, such as fridges, being dumped also reached record levels last year. Gelligaer and Merthyr Common has been a hotspot for people to dump their waste for years. The ranger there said residents had noticed a spike in fly-tipping after changes to the tip - but this had since improved. He said they were hoping to get ditches dug at the side of roads to stop people being able to dump on the common. Merthyr Tydfil council confirmed there had been a spike in black bags being collected by fly-tipping teams, and it was having issues with bags being dumped in cemeteries and parks. Blaenau Gwent In 2015 there were protests when Blaenau Gwent moved to a new bin collection system. It limited black bin collections to once every three weeks and introduced \"Troliblocs\", a stack of three recycling boxes on a wheeled trolley. And in June 2018 it introduced a \"no side waste\" policy, with a black bag sorting system introduced at its household waste recycling centre. According to figures, the number of black bags being fly-tipped went from zero in 2015-16 to 107 in 2016-17, hitting an all time high of 170 last year.

It's the latest in a long running effort by EU officials to increase competition in the single market when it comes to mobile roaming. The committee of MEPs says it wants staged cuts so, by 1 July 2014, operators won't be able to charge roaming customers any more than 15 cents (12p) a minute to make a call; 5 cents (4p) to send a text; and 20 cents a megabyte (16p) for data. EU officials say previous attempts to introduce price measures have failed to spark competition between operators. Currently, the limit on what can be charged for making a call is around 30p and sending a text about 9p. However, there's no cap on what companies can charge per megabyte for data.

People close to the negotiations have told Newsbeat that the Council might want to set prices higher than MEPs have voted, so as to give more wiggle room for operators to compete against each other on price.

The former bishop of Lewes and Gloucester was released from jail on Friday after serving 16 months. Phil Johnson said he had served \"less than a month for each of the victims\". Ball was sentenced to 32 months for misconduct in public office and 15 months for indecent assaults, to run concurrently, after using \"religion as a cloak\" to carry out the abuse between the 1970s and 1990s. Richard Scorer, a lawyer representing a number of Ball's victims, said his early release was \"an affront to justice\" and \"a huge blow to his victims\". \"This was a man whose appalling crimes represented a gross and systematic abuse of trust spanning decades,\" he said. Mr Johnson, from Eastbourne, who was not one of the 18 people Ball admitted abusing, alleges that Ball inappropriately touched him as a 13-year-old boy. He said the sentence handed down to him was \"in no way proportionate to the crimes committed\", and it seemed he had been freed \"at the earliest opportunity\". A Church of England spokeswoman said Ball's offences were \"a matter of deep shame and regret\". In February 2016, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Most Rev Justin Welby, commissioned an independent review of the Ball case. Mr Johnson said its publication was not likely \"for several more months\". \"I think it's utterly ridiculous that it's taken longer to write a report on what happened than it has for Peter Ball to serve his jail sentence,\" he said.

Most committee members backed the removal of the not proven verdict. But they did not support increasing the jury trial conviction requirement.

The committee said it could not therefore back the general principles of the members' bill, which was introduced by Labour MSP Michael McMahon. What is the not proven verdict? The justice committee heard evidence that there was no legal difference between a not guilty and not proven verdict.

The committee also concluded that the verdict is not always well understood and can cause confusion for both jurors and the public.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the move was necessary in anticipation of a rise in indoor gatherings as winter approached. And she said taking action now could prevent stricter lockdown measures. The measures were first announced last week and the new limit was confirmed on Thursday. Under current guidance, no more than eight people from a maximum of three different households should be meeting indoors. The new law takes account of the varying size and composition of families and sets the limit for an indoor party at 15 people if more than one household is present. 'Last resort' During her daily media briefing, Ms Sturgeon said: \"We know from the reports of our test and protect teams - and also from evidence around the world - that these kinds of gatherings pose a significant transmission risk.\" She acknowledged the colder weather would increase the likelihood of larger indoor social gatherings but said the new legislation was \"not a green light\" to ignoring the existing guidance. Ms Sturgeon added: \"In recognition that we intend these new legal powers to be a last resort only and for use in the most blatant breaches of the guidance, we have decided to set a higher threshold for their use. \"Ensuing that police have the powers to disperse large house parties, where that is necessary, is another important tool in trying to keep this virus suppressed.\" She added that it would help to reduce the potential for future clusters and outbreaks and prevent greater lockdown restrictions.

Her father Sebastien told a court he noticed her feet were \"dirty\" but \"didn't seem to be particularly damaged\" when he identified her body. He said he also saw that some of the fences around the resort were broken. N\u00f3ra's family, from Balham, were staying in Sora House in Dusun eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65km) south of Kuala Lumpur. The 15-year-old was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development. She was reported missing the day after they arrived and was eventually found less than two miles from the holiday home. Speaking via video-link, Mr Quoirin said he had spotted her feet as he went to identify her body for the second time to authorise an autopsy. He told Seremban Coroner's Court they \"didn't seem to be particularly damaged, in fact they seemed just dirty\" and questioned how that could be possible since the police had suggested that she had been \"on the move for seven days\". \"How was that compatible with the state of Nora's feet?\" he said. The 48-year-old said the family had been \"super excited\" to be going on a \"big adventure\", although the trip was not a novelty for N\u00f3ra as they had spent time in Singapore and Bali two years earlier. Mr Quoirin told the court he saw some of the perimeter fences of the resort were broken and had fallen to the ground as he went for a walk after they had arrived. The inquest heard that after the family had gone to bed that night, Mr Quoirin was woken by noises from a nearby chalet where they \"seemed to be having a party\". He said he later heard a \"muffled noise\" coming from the chalet but he had been \"half asleep\" and \"couldn't describe what exactly that noise was\". Mr Quoirin said he woke at 07:00 the next day and left the room at 08:00 to check on his daughter. He climbed up a staircase to the mezzanine level where N\u00f3ra was sharing a bed with her sister Innes, but when he looked at the bed N\u00f3ra's side was empty. Innes explained to her father she had noticed N\u00f3ra was not in the bed earlier when she went downstairs to the toilet but she had assumed the 15-year-old was with her parents \"having a cuddle\", the court heard. Mr Quoirin said he \"very quickly... realised something very dramatic was in front of us\" and immediately began searching the area, including out of a back gate which he described as \"porous\" and something that \"anyone could walk through it\". Mr Quoirin said he and his wife realised their daughter's shoes were still there so believed she must not have gone far due to the difficulty of the surrounding terrain. They also noticed the kitchen window was open, the inquest heard. He said the resort's owner went to the local police station to report that N\u00f3ra was missing and he followed two hours later but when he arrived he found officers \"did not realise the seriousness of the problem\". He described how at about 15:00 a police officer with a dog came to the resort but \"the dog wasn't fit for purpose\" and \"after two minutes it was exhausted and couldn't do the job properly\". He added that he felt the police had not done enough to search for Nora during those \"precious hours\". Mr Quoirin told the court his daughter \"had no survival instinct\" and she would have been unable to cope with the \"dense and slippery\" terrain to get to the spot where she was eventually found. He also said it was \"impossible\" that she had opened or climbed out of the kitchen window, adding that it \"would be totally out of character for her to do that\".

We can deal with issues that larger organisations filter out but they have the integrity and professionalism; they are better journalists.\" His blog also received record visits in the snow on Sunday, with 2700 hits. Mr Harte's research took place during a sample period of 11 days in May 2012. He found news items were published at an average rate of 15 per hour and 366 per day on hyperlocal sites across the UK. London was the best-served city, but no single council area had more hyperlocal websites than Birmingham. Also noted in the research as standing out were Stoke-on-Trent with seven hyperlocal websites followed by Walsall and Solihull with four and three sites respectively.

Business rates are devolved to Wales. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it would consider how any extra funding could be best targeted. There are currently 19 confirmed cases of the virus in Wales but it is expected to spread much further. On Tuesday, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to provide Wales with the necessary funding to cope as he warned \"enormous strain\" could be placed on public services. Mr Sunak also announced that firms in England who already had full small business rate relief would be able to access \u00a33,000 grant funding. Ben Francis, FSB Wales policy chair, called on the Welsh Government to \"urgently respond to this funding and confirm that they will implement the same level of support in Wales\". \"Abolishing business rates for hospitality businesses for the rest of the year will create a cushion for those businesses who may be vulnerable early on to the effects of the emergence of coronavirus,\" he said. \"Similarly, a \u00a33,000 cash grant to the smallest businesses, who are already in receipt of 100% business rates relief, will be a welcome measure to help navigate the uncertain times that lie ahead. Mr Francis also welcomed the chancellor's move to refund small and medium-sized businesses for statutory sick pay for employees affected by coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19. CBI Wales Director Ian Price said they would also like to see the Welsh Government consider matching the business rates relief offered to English firms that are significantly impacted by the virus. Gretchen Betts, managing director of Magenta Financial Planning in Bridgend, said she was hopeful the Welsh Government would pledge to follow suit and match the reductions in rates. \"This will be vital for Welsh businesses in retail, hospitality and leisure sectors, where they could be severely affected by coronavirus this year. \"It's pleasing to see the measures around refunding eligible statutory sick pay costs and potential funding for SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) who may find themselves in trouble.\" Also in Bridgend, Mike Mitchell, director of United Worldwide Logistics, said he would like to see business rate relief rolled out to larger businesses. \"All in all I have to say a very positive budget for a very worrying time and with the continued freeze on fuel duties there is not much more we could ask for,\" he added. A Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We await further details from the UK government regarding the schemes announced and will consider how any additional consequential funding can be best targeted to support our communities and businesses as part of our spending priorities.\" What's the overall picture for the Welsh economy and businesses? There were two distinct messages at the same time from the chancellor - the government is acting to protect household incomes from the economic effects of coronavirus and helping to keep the economy moving, and also looking to the future, promising to spend vast amounts of money to try to \"level up \" poorer parts of the UK, like Wales. Significantly for a Conservative chancellor, he said he would increase borrowing to pay for projects, mainly in England. For the many who are self-employed or who work within the more unpredictable gig economy, there is the promise it will be quicker and easier for them to access benefits. Employment support allowance will be available from day one, not after a week as now. Critics will say that this does not make up for years of austerity along with pay and benefits freezes. The budget did not introduce funding for big physical infrastructure projects in Wales. The \u00a312m for full fibre connections in south Wales and \u00a34m for Pembrokeshire will please those areas - but frustrate people elsewhere. Looking ahead, a \u00a322bn pot to fund research and development, along with \u00a3400m of new money for universities, will be welcome. The challenge for organisations in Wales is to successfully bid for that to build a higher-skilled, higher-paid economy. With 20% of the working population expected to be off at any one time during the coronavirus outbreak, Welsh businesses will welcome the UK government's announcement that it will refund the cost of statutory sick pay (SSP) for 14 days. That's for all companies that employ fewer than 250 workers. Wales is particularly dependent on small and medium-sized businesses and this pledge will cover 99.4% of firms here, employing 62% of the private sector workforce. Business rates are devolved so the Welsh Government will come under pressure to provide similar support here especially as the multiplier - the way the tax is worked out - is already higher in Wales than in England. There are loans and tax breaks for businesses to make investments in research and development, buildings and environmental measures. Taxes will likely rise in future for the energy intensive industries including steel unless they move away from the use of gas. The steel industry constantly complains that high energy costs make production in Wales uncompetitive when compared with some other European countries. The potential increase in fuel duty didn't happen as it is frozen for another year, a move likely to be welcomed by businesses, particularly in rural areas.", "output": "Coronavirus: 'Wales must match Budget's small business help'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

At The Disco, alongside hip-hop artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott and Post Malone. Pop music is also on the bill with Dua Lipa set to play on the main stage. When it was released earlier this year the line-up left fans divided, with some calling it the \"worst ever\". While other fans were pleased about its diversity. What do artists think? Felix White, guitarist and songwriter for now broken-up band The Maccabees has played at Reading and Leeds multiple times. He finds the \"music being better in 90s\" conversation \"distracting\" and \"slightly boring\". \"With the romanticism of looking at the past or when you're reliving your youth and thinking 'That was better then'. It's a really misleading rhetoric. \"When you start scratching the surface there are so many great records being made,\" he says. East London UK rap producer Steel Banglez will be playing at Reading and Leeds on the BBC Radio 1Xtra stage. He says its \"normal\" for there to be line-up complaints and that \"people are allowed the freedom of their own choice\". However, festivals book artists by their \"popularity\". \"You can't deny what's popular and what's in the charts,\" he adds. The producer also believes that the line-up is a reflection of a new generation \"embracing music\" and being more \"open minded\". \"I feel like there's so many different styles and sounds. \"I wouldn't just call it urban, there's songs with guitars, with piano ballads.\" Afroswing artist Kojo Funds will also be playing on the 1Xtra stage. The 23-year-old hopes rock fans at the festival will enjoy his performance as it'll be full of \"energy\". \"I think they should give different types of genres a chance. \"If there was a rock band at Wireless then people could adapt to that kind of music and like it.\" What do people attending think? Rory, an 18-year-old student from Cardiff, will be returning to Reading for the second year in a row. He loves all genres of music but is particularly looking forward to hearing hip-hop and pop at the festival. He argues the festivals \"may be losing originality, but I think there's always a time to move on from the way it used to be\". In previous years pop acts have not been well-received at the events, but Rory is looking forward to seeing Dua Lipa perform. \"She's not only been top of the charts in this country, but all around the world. \"For Reading to introduce that to so many people, that's a fantastic thing,\" he says. On the opposite end of the spectrum to Rory, a Reading Festival newbie, Faith will be heading to Leeds Festival for the 15th time. Faith says historically the line-up was fantastic \"as it was a heavier side of music\" with a lot of \"metal, rock and punk\". But she says the changing line-up has allowed her to discover new music. \"For me it's really interesting because it opens me up to music that I might not have otherwise listened to,\" she says. As for fans complaining about the festivals drifting away from rock, Faith says: \"There's still hard rock there. \"They're probably not going to be headlining the main stage like they used to be, but you know, change is good.\" Why are more festivals now extending beyond guitar music? NME music journalist Andrew Trendell has been attending Reading and Leeds for both work and pleasure religiously since 2005. He's watched the line-up evolve over the years but says: \"It's just a matter of the time's changed, the audience has changed, so the line-up needs to change. \"The way that young people discover music has changed, they listen to a far more diverse range, someone who listens to rock music won't exclusively listen to rock music.\" He adds: \"If you're going to be running the biggest festivals in the UK when Glastonbury's not on, you need to address that don't you.\" The boss of the festivals, Melvin Benn, previously told the BBC that festivals should be \"a reflection of what the public are listening to\". \"You can't keep drumming up the same acts and expect people to continue to come and see them.\" And Reading and Leeds aren't the only festivals diversifying the genres of their line-ups. Last year a BBC study analysed major UK festivals and discovered that, in the 1990s, 70% of the headliners were rock acts. By the 2000s this had decreased to 59% and in the 2010s it was down to 33% of headline acts. The study was carried out by BBC England's data unit and analysed more than 600 separate headline performances across 14 UK festivals. They were Download, Reading/Leeds, T in the Park, V Festival, Isle of Wight, Bestival, Latitude, Wireless, Rewind, End of the Road, Cornbury, Boardmasters and Lovebox.

The Guardian says peacemaking was \"often a lonely and perilous path\", but the SDLP leader emerged \"vindicated and triumphant\" to become a revered statesman.

He spoke out after reports that Prime Minister Theresa May favours changing the law so new grammars can open. England's Education Secretary Justine Greening is looking into the issue. Supporters of grammar schools say that children from poor backgrounds are helped to make the most of their potential because entry to such schools is on the basis of raw ability. But many argue that, in fact, the vast majority of those doing well in entrance tests are children whose parents have paid for them to be privately tutored outside school. In a speech to London Councils' education conference, Sir Michael praised the success of schools in the capital saying they had undergone an \"amazing transformation\" and lead the way in \"narrowing the attainment gap between rich and poor\". \"It has maintained its status as the top performing region across all key stages when it comes to the performance of children eligible for free school meals,\" he said. The soaring success of London schools made \"a mockery of the claim that opening up many grammar schools is the key to unlocking the potential of disadvantaged children and to boosting social mobility,\" he said. 'Pretty woeful' \"If grammar schools are the great answer, why aren't there more in London? \"If they are such a good thing for poor children, then why are poor children here in the capital doing so much better than their counterparts in those parts of the country that operate selection?\" He said he appreciated that many grammar schools did a \"fine job\", but added that their record of admitting children from non-middle class backgrounds was \"pretty woeful\". \"The notion that the poor stand to benefit from the return of grammar schools strikes me as quite palpable tosh and nonsense - and is very clearly refuted by the London experience.\" He cited figures showing the under-representation of poor pupils in grammar schools. In Bexley, he said grammar schools had 9% of pupils on free school meals, compared to 28% in non-selective schools. In Sutton, where five out of 14 schools are grammars, the proportion is about 7% in grammar schools and 25% in non-selective schools. In a BBC interview this weekend, Mrs May did not answer directly a question about whether she planned to bring back grammar schools. But she said Ms Greening was looking at the issue of new grammar schools as well as other areas of education policy. Labour banned new grammars in 1998 amid concerns they were dominated by middle-class pupils whose parents gave them a head-start with private tutoring. England's first \"new\" grammar for 50 years in Sevenoaks, Kent, was only approved last year as an \"annexe\" to an existing school using a loophole in the law. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner described Sir Michael's comments as \"an embarrassing rebuke\" for the Conservatives. \"The Tories should be concentrating instead on raising standards in all schools and improving education for all our children, regardless of their backgrounds. \"They are failing to do so. But they want to return to a system in which children were branded as failures at the age of 11 and which only increased division in our society.", "output": "Grammar schools help poor claim is 'tosh', says Ofsted chief Wilshaw", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

They added that police had raided several of Mr Budovsky's properties and seized his computer servers. The site went offline on Thursday. Liberty Reserve had described itself as being the internet's \"oldest, safest and most popular payment processor... serving millions all around a world\". It had allowed users to open accounts and transfer money, only requiring them to provide a name, date of birth and an email address. Cash could be put into the service using a credit card, bank wire, postal money order or other money transfer service. It was then \"converted\" into one of the firm's own currencies - mirroring either the Euro or US dollar - at which point it could be transferred to another account holder who could then extract the funds. The service promised that payment transfers were \"instantaneous\" and it charged a maximum of $2.99 (\u00a31.98) for each transaction. It also offered a private messaging facility which it said was \"much more private and secure than email or instant messenger services\". Security expert Bryan Krebs said Liberty Reserve's features had made it a popular among cybercriminals who wanted to move funds and make payments anonymously. However, others said they had used the service for legitimate means, viewing it as a cheaper alternative to PayPal. They fear they will now lose money still sitting in its accounts. Refused licence Costa Rica state prosecutor Jose Pablo Gonzalez announced news of the raids on Saturday. He said that in addition to Mr Budovsky's arrest, 10 other suspects were being investigated in connection with international money laundering. Mr Gonzalez said that Costa Rica's financial regulator, Sugef, had refused to issue a licence to Liberty Reserve in 2011 after raising concerns about how it was being funded. Although the company Liberty Reserve subsequently closed and dismissed its employees, the prosecutor said Mr Budovsky had continued operating his money exchange service by running it through five other Costa Rican businesses. The same year, he said, New York based officials asked Costa Rica to investigate. Mr Gonzalez said offices and houses linked to Mr Budovsky had been raided last week, and that documents and three vehicles - including a Rolls Royce - were seized. The US Department of Justice's website says that in 2006 Mr Budovsky was found guilty of operating a separate illegal money transmittal business - GoldAge - from a Brooklyn apartment when he used to live in New York. However, when asked about the latest arrest, a spokeswoman said she could \"not provide any guidance\" at this time. The BBC has also asked the Spanish police for more details. Lost money According to Mr Krebs' security blog, the closure of Liberty Reserve has the potential to \"cause a major upheaval in the cybercrime economy\". He said there had been \"anxious discussions\" about the news on several internet forums after fraudsters and malware sellers found themselves unable to access their accounts. But others say they used the service for legitimate reasons, and are concerned about the lack of information. They include Mitver Holdings, the firm behind a facility called ePay Cards. This allows consumers outside the US to buy goods from stores in the country as if they owned a locally-issued Visa or Mastercard credit card. The company - which has offices in London and Texas - used Liberty Reserve as a way for its customers to charge up their \"virtual credit cards\". Co-founder Mitchell Rossetti said he had about $28,000 sitting in his business's Liberty Reserve account at the time the site went offline. \"We used Liberty Reserve because it was quick, efficient and secure,\" he told the BBC. \"Now, we - and thousands of others who were dependent on it - have been left with nothing to look at except a blank webpage, and nothing more to go on than reports from the Costa Rican press. \"We need to know if our assets have been seized and what would be the requirements to get the funds returned.\"", "output": "Liberty Reserve digital money service forced offline", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Leah Feldman, an emergency ward nurse from New York City, is among them. \"I feel as though it's a responsibility,\" she says. \"I have a set of skills that I feel I can offer. I really feel as though this is a region that deserves our attention right now. I think medical care is something we can provide that can actually make a difference in lives where oftentimes there is not adequate medical care.\" Ms Feldman says that, despite the high-profile cases of a few health workers who have been infected with Ebola, she is not worried about risks to her own health. \"That's the first question people ask,\" she says. \"But no. [There are] protocols and rules to minimise the risk, and it's my responsibility to stay as safe as I can.\" Painstaking regime Part of Ms Feldman's responsibility, before ever setting foot in an Ebola-affected country, is to take part in the Red Cross training course. It is a painstaking, uncomfortable and often depersonalising regime, which regularly requires the volunteers to abandon many of the things they learned in their original medical training. Before even entering the anteroom to the Ebola ward, the volunteers have to put on several layers of protective clothing. Watched by an experienced supervisor, each item has to be put on in the correct order and the correct way - no loose sleeves or cuffs. Ebola is spread through contact with body fluids, so the skin, and above all the eyes, nose and mouth must be covered. \"The interaction that is so important for nurses and doctors with the patient is almost completely absent,\" explains Red Cross Emergency Health Officer, Panu Saaristo. \"We are wearing the protective equipment, people look like aliens, you don't recognise their faces.\" Working inside those suits is uncomfortable too, as Leah Feldman discovers. \"It's hot and claustrophobic in the suit,\" she laughs. \"And here I'm in Switzerland, so I can only imagine what it will be like in Monrovia.\" Slow down One of the hardest things the trainees have to learn, says Panu Saaristo, is to take every step slowly. \"People from western health care settings are used to always being in a rush,\" he explains. \"They run from patient to patient. This is probably the only workplace they will experience where you never are in a rush, because everything is focussed on safety and infection prevention.\" That focus means that just taking off the protective clothing takes a minimum of 15 minutes, with frequent pauses to re-disinfect particular items, such as gloves. \"I'm used to moving at a very fast pace,\" admits Leah Feldman. \"I think the hardest part here is going to be moving very slowly, very meticulously, and just paying really close attention to every action that you are making.\" But, once in the field for real, Panu Saaristo knows from his own experience, working with Ebola patients will take a psychological toll as well. \"There are a lot of deaths,\" he explains. \"Sad scenes with a lot of children separated from parents, and parents separated from children.\" \"You won't get a hug from your colleague,\" he continues. \"You don't shake hands, you don't share anything, you don't even share a simple thing like a pen. It is draining, and that is what I mean when I say this is a difficult mission.\" Ebola Stigma Perhaps most difficult of all for the volunteers, the recent cases of Ebola in some of their home countries, such as Spain and the US, means they now fear stigmatisation once their work with Ebola victims is over. The moves by some American states to quarantine returning health workers is causing aid agencies like the Red Cross real concern, because they fear it could deter future volunteers, who are desperately needed in the Ebola affected countries. \"There have been some almost absurd reactions,\" says Mr Saaristo. \"Misconceptions, fear, stigma, explanations that are not based on science.\" \"We have to try to combat that in the home countries of these volunteer healthcare workers.\" Leah Feldman does not know what her reception will be when she returns to her native New York, but diplomatically says she is \"more than willing, if the government makes certain decisions it thinks will protect its own people, that's something I will of course abide by, any protocols and regulations.\" But she adds, \"It's about knowledge, it's about teaching people what Ebola really is, and how it is actually transmitted.\" Training over, Ms Feldman can expect to be treating Ebola patients for real within the next couple of weeks. Undeterred by protection measures which have certainly frightened off some potential volunteers, she says she \"can't wait to go.\" \"If it's not something you feel comfortable with then it's not for you,\" she says. \"But if you feel you want to help people, this is the closest you can come, where there is a need you are filling that void.\"", "output": "Ebola crisis: Volunteers for a hardship mission", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The Scottish government is consulting on the introduction of new mandatory measures to maintain \"healthy stocks\". Under the proposals, fishermen would have to meet certain criteria to obtain a permit for harvesting wrasse. They would need a \"proven track record\" of harvesting and submitting returns showing numbers of fish caught over the past two years. Different species Also, they would need evidence of having an appropriate contract with a salmon farm operator to supply wrasse. Limits would also be placed on the size of the different species of wrasse harvested. Wrasse are released in salmon cages to attack and eat parasitic sea lice - reducing the amount of medicinal treatments used to control lice. Concerns about the impact of their harvesting have been raised in the past. Marine Scotland, a directorate of the Scottish government, has been working with the salmon farming industry on voluntary measures to protect stocks of cleaner fish. In its consultation, Marine Scotland said the \"overall goal\" of the proposed new rules was to \"maintain a healthy wild wrasse stock that is fished sustainably\". Charles Millar, executive director of the Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Trust, which has campaigned for wrasse stocks to be protected, said: \"There were no limits to the amount of wrasse that could be caught last year. There was no closure even for protected environments like rocky reefs and kelp forests. The summer breeding season should be closed. Instead the fishery was closed while wrasse hibernate. \"The weak measures in this consultation change none of that. And, what's worse, the form doesn't even allow anyone to say they think proper controls should be brought in.

Labour's ruling NEC later said it had excluded him after \"further evidence\" had come to light about him. Mr Downing said his views on 9/11 and so-called Islamic State had been quoted out of context. In the Commons on Wednesday, David Cameron quoted a blog by Mr Downing, which said the 9/11 hijackers \"must never be condemned\". Mr Downing insisted he had been explaining the motivation of the 9/11 attackers, \"not agreeing with what they were doing\", adding: \"I don't support the politics of Isis, they are vile barbarians. But I don't support American imperialist bombing either.\" 'Motivation' Mr Downing, a former bus driver and member of the tiny Socialist Fight group, told the Daily Politics: \"The ambition to overthrow capitalism is a very legitimate political ambition.\" He was expelled by the Labour Party last August over views expressed on his Twitter feed and blog but was re-instated in November after an appeal. Mr Downing said he \"had been\" a Labour member until Wednesday night, \"but nobody bothered to inform\" him that he'd been excluded. He told the Daily Politics the party \"should be welcoming\" to people with his views and he planned to seek re-admittance. \"If it allows UKIP councillors who defect and it allows people from the far right, and people of that nature, I cannot see why it should not allow in people like me.\" Asked by presenter Andrew Neil whether he would condemn the 9/11 attackers, Mr Downing said he wouldn't use the word \"condemn\", saying he would seek to \"understand the motivation of the people that did that.\" 'US Imperialism' Mr Downing said his group does not support so-called Islamic State \"militarily or politically\" but he does believe in providing \"tactical\" support, which he explained as being against US bombing. He said he was not a \"personal friend\" of John McDonnell but said the shadow chancellor had \"secured some justice for me\" in a work dispute, after the two men met on the Labour Representation Committee.

The material will be published in the run up to the war's centenary in 2014. The project is being launched at the National Eisteddfod on Monday. One of those present in Denbigh will be Reverend Dr R Alun Evans, whose father joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in October 1914. Robert Evans left the Congregationalist College, Bala-Bangor, to carry wounded men to the dressing stations during WW1. Over 250 items including letters, photos and diaries have been digitised and the material will be made available to the general public on the eve of WW1's centenary. Lecturer Gethin Matthews from Swansea University's history and classics department said: \"The main aim of the project is to gain a better understanding of the soldiers - their ideas, hopes and fears as they faced the war. \"The evidence has enabled us to put flesh on the bones and gain a better insight into the society in which they lived.\" Dr Matthews said he hoped that launching the materials would stimulate people to consider the true effects of the war on Wales and its societies once more. The digitised items will all be published on Swansea University's website shortly. Robert Evans Born in Ganllwyd, Dolgellau in 1895, Robert Evans, known as Bob Ty Cerrig by his family, was accepted as a ministerial candidate by Bala-Bangor Congregationalist college. But one year into his studies World War One broke out and Robert decided to join the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). The Swansea students were loaned letters and photographs relating to his war experience, including a letter to his mother in October 1916: \"In some places the shells were falling like hail, and some men by my side died, while others were wounded.\" Robert's letters are all infused with references to his own faith, which despite all that he witnessed in war, was reinforced. In one of his letters from France, he notes how he and some of his comrades had the privilege of leading a service. In another he writes how he is looking forward to having a Sunday service back home as he finds a Welsh service more fulfilling than any other. After the war Robert Evans returned to his theological studies, graduating in 1924 and taking charges of chapels in Yr Hendy and Llanbrynmair. Edgar Wynn Williams A lorry driver who delivered groceries in the Llanelli and Swansea area before the war, Edgar Wynn Williams was 20 when he made the decision to join the Army Service Corps. He began writing a diary on the day he made the decision - 8 December 1915 - and the next day travelled to Carmarthen to enlist. On 16 December he bought his sweetheart Olga Bevan an engagement ring and the following day he left Llanelli. The Swansea students learnt through material loaned by his grandson Dr Rhys Williams of his war experience in Egypt where he served driving the wounded to a field hospital. It is meeting other Welshmen on the battlefield which gets the most attention in Edgar's diary: \"I met some Welsh Fus [Fusiliers] who are camped near to us we had a good time and it was good to talk a bit of Welsh for once it reminded me of home.\" After the war he returned to Llanelli and married his sweetheart Olga, but died aged 34 in October 1929. His family believe he died from sleeping sickness, a disease which he would have been carrying when he left Egypt in April 1916. James Pugh Richards Born in Duffryn Ardudwy, Meirionnydd in 1895, James Pugh (known as JP) Richards volunteered to serve in the army on 7 October 1914, joining the 13th Battalion of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. Among the items loaned to the students by his daughter Eleri Rogers are a series of postcards sent home by JP while training in Llandudno. One includes an account of a visit by David Lloyd George, who was later to become prime minister, to inspect the troops in March 1915. The soldier wrote: \"Here is a picture for you of the crowd running towards the 'Grand Stand' to see Mr Lloyd George after the march past on Monday.\" But he wrote that the politician had to abandon his speech and flee to the Imperial Hotel for sanctuary from the acclamations of the crowd. On New Year's Day JP wrote a letter home from France where he was stationed near Neuve Chapelle. \"It's a shame to think that we are waging war against a Christian country like our own but there are many signs these days that the end is not far away - this is my prayer 'let the day come soon'\". In October 1917, JP was badly injured in an attack on the German front line, after which his right leg was amputated and his left leg was badly injured. That marked the end of his active service and he was sent back to hospital in Manchester where doctors managed to save his left leg. JP went on to study at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth and later became a teacher at Twyn School, Caerphilly. He died in 1956, aged 61. Hopkin Joseph Thomas Hopkin Joseph Thomas was born in Bryncoch, near Neath and is thought to have enlisted with the Welsh Regiment around February or March 1916. In material loaned by his relatives David and Val Stokes, the students found that he was serving in Egypt in 1917 with the battalion that had served in the Gallipoli campaign from August to December 1915. In his letters home Hopkin forms a conversation with his younger brothers Victor and Richard who are also fighting but in another theatre of war: \"I hope the boys are still alright in France? Has Vic gone back to the line yet. I hope he's quite alright by this time. What about Dicky. Has he been home yet. I'm expecting to hear by every mail from him but he's not very keen on writing letters. I guess he hasn't got time etc.\" In September 1918, just two months before Armistice Day, Hopkin was wounded and died and was later buried in a war ceremony in Palestine.

Discovery, Defender, and Freelander models line the leafy cul-de-sacs that surround the plant on the outskirts of the town centre. Families talk about the difficulty of finding their cars in supermarket car parks because there are now so many of the same cars from the same company.

It's a status vehicle people aspire to have. \"They are here and are - quite properly - endorsed by many people, including the council. I don't see it as a bad thing.\" Mother-of-three Julie Henn, lives in Nerstal Drive in Solihull, just a stone's throw away from the Jaguar Land Rover site. The 55-year-old said she regretted leaving her Land Rover behind so much when she moved to the UK from South Africa about eight years ago that she ended up buying a replacement soon afterwards. Her husband is now hoping to buy a new one as well. \"There was not a day that went by when I did not regret it,\" she said. \"Now I can't believe how many there are. On Saturday I saw four in a row. \"A Range Rover, two Discoveries and a Freelander - one after the other.\" 'Confidence booster' Mrs Henn said she knew people who struggled to find their Land Rovers in supermarket car parks because they were so common. Mother-of two Joanne Rumney, who lives around the corner in Oakslade Drive, owns a Land Rover Discovery from the 1990s. \"People are proud to have JLR here,\" said the 38-year-old. \"It has a status that people like. They are good family cars.\" Jaguar Land Rover, which also has manufacturing bases in Castle Bromwich and Halewood on Merseyside, has said the latest announcement will bring the total number of jobs it has created in the UK over the past three years to almost 11,000. Mr Tildesley said the firm's investment had \"undoubtedly\" boosted Solihull with other firms benefiting from knock-on trade. Rachael Eade, from the Manufacturing Advisory Service, said every job created by vehicle manufacturers leads to two or three in the supply chain. \"It's a huge confidence booster locally and UK-wide,\" she said. \"It's 1,700 jobs and three times that in the supply chain. \"I think the new technology involved will attract a new, younger market and will make a difference to the supply chain. \"Younger people have more of a desire to be involved in that as they probably view car manufacturing to be a bit dusty, dirty and not for them.\" But not everyone is happy. Some shops said the expansion had brought with it increased parking problems. Terry Cosma, manager of Solihull Fish Bar in Hob's Moat Road, said: \"I have not noticed any change in business. We have always had a steady flow of JLR workers. \"The big problem is the lack of parking round here. They are along the pavements, the grass verges, sometimes it's difficult to get into the side roads.\" Julie Jones, who works at Trev's Hairdressers, also in Hob's Moat Road, said: \"The parking is ridiculous - diabolical. \"There is nowhere for us to go because all the Land Rover workers are there.\" In 2005, MG Rover based at Longbridge, less than 10 miles from Solihull, went into administration. About 14,000 people employed by the Rover group were based at the site. But Ms Eade said she did not believe Solihull would suffer a similar fate and collapse if JLR's fortunes changed in the future. \"The automotive industry has learnt lessons from MG Rover,\" she said. \"They are not as heavily reliant on one customer now and if you are a designer you probably work for JLR, Mini, JCB, Ford. \"I don't think the bubble will burst for the foreseeable future.\"", "output": "Is Solihull 'Jaguar Land Rover Land'?", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

And there is no question that Facebook has the ability to build detailed and sophisticated profiles on users' likes, dislikes, lifestyles and political leanings. The bigger question becomes - what does it share with others and what can users do to regain control of their information? Want to see what you look like as a Hollywood star? Click here. We've all seen these quizzes - offering to test your IQ, reveal your inner personality, or show you what you'd look like if you were a glamorous actor. It was information from one such Facebook quiz - This is Your Digital Life - that Cambridge Analytica is alleged to have used to harvest the data of millions of people. Many such quizzes come with reassurances that your data is safe. These games and quizzes are designed to tempt users in but they are often just a shop front for mass data collection - and one that Facebook's terms and conditions allow. Privacy advocates Electronic Frontier Foundation said the way these quizzes collected data reflected \"how Facebook's terms of service and API were structured at the time\". Facebook has changed its terms and conditions to cut down on the information that third parties can collect, specifically stopping them from accessing data about users' friends. It is not yet clear exactly what information the firm got hold of - this is now subject to an investigation by the UK data protection authority, the ICO. What can users do to protect their information? This will mean that you won't be able to use third-party sites on Facebook and if that is is a step too far, there is a way of limiting the personal information accessible by apps while still using them: There are some others pieces of advice too. \"Never click on a 'like' button on a product service page and if you want to play these games and quizzes, don't log in through Facebook but go directly to the site,\" said Paul Bernal, a lecturer in Information Technology, Intellectual Property and Media Law in the University of East Anglia School of Law. \"Using Facebook Login is easy but doing so, grants the app's developer access to a range of information from their Facebook profiles,\" he added. How else can you protect your Facebook data? There really is only one way to make sure data we create on a daily basis remains entirely private, thinks Dr Bernal. \"Leave Facebook.\" \"The incentive Facebook will have to protect people more will only come if people start leaving. Currently it has very little incentive to change,\" he told the BBC. It seems he is not alone in his call - the hashtag #DeleteFacebook is now trending on Twitter in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But Dr Bernal acknowledges that it is unlikely many will quit - especially those who see Facebook as \"part of the infrastructure of their lives\". The less drastic option is deactivation, which stops an account from appearing in search results but gives the user the option to bring it back. It would stop future tracking but means all the information already collected will still be kept. For those that decide deletion is the best option, users can head to the delete my account page, which explains that once gone, information cannot be retrieved. The page is not easy to find on the site and requires quite a few steps: Facebook advises users who delete their account to download a copy of their information before they delete it. They also warn users that the process can take up to 90 days, during which time the information is inaccessible to others using the platform. Can you find out what data on you is stored? Under current data protection rules, users can make a Subject Access Request to individual firms to find out how much information they have on them. When Austrian privacy advocate Max Schrems made such a request to Facebook in 2011, he was given a CD with 1,200 files stored on it. He found that the social network kept records of all the IP addresses of machines he used to access the site, a full history of messages and chats, his location and even items that he thought he had deleted, such as messages, status updates and wall posts. But in a world where Facebook information is shared more widely with third parties, making such a request gets harder. As Dr Bernal says: \"How do you ask for your data when you don't know who to ask?\" That is likely to change this summer with the introduction of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which aims to make it far easier for users to take back control of their data. The threat of big fines for firms that do not comply with such requests could make it more likely that they will share this information, which must be given to consumers \"in a clear and readable form\". How long is data kept? Data protection laws in Europe suggest that firms should only keep user data \"as long as necessary\" but the interpretation of this can be very flexible. In Facebook's case, this means that as long as the person posting something does not delete it, it will remain online indefinitely. Can you delete historic data? Users can delete their accounts, which in theory will \"kill\" all their past posts but Facebook encourages those who wish to take a break from the social network simply to deactivate them, in case they wish to return. And it must be remembered that a lot of information about you will remain on the platform, from the posts of your friends.

Pakistan denied that, saying two of its soldiers died in cross-border shelling. People from a number of villages in Punjab state were leaving amid fears the confrontation might escalate. Disputed Kashmir has been a flashpoint for decades and has sparked two wars. Analysts say India has previously conducted more substantial strikes without any serious escalation of hostilities. India 'launches Kashmir border strikes' Relations between India and Pakistan have sharply deteriorated since earlier this month, when militants carried out the deadliest attack on an Indian army base in Kashmir in years. India blamed the attack on Pakistan, which denied the claim. What is happening now? The war of words is certainly escalating. After India said it launched the strikes, Pakistan reported that it had an Indian soldier in custody. The Indian army said he had inadvertently crossed the Line of Control which divides disputed Kashmir. Meanwhile in neighbouring Punjab state on the Indian side, media reports claimed six border districts and thousands of villagers were being evacuated. Reports said people will be housed in Sikh temples and banquet halls. However, BBC Hindi's Robin Singh, who visited several villages near the border in Punjab, said most people had opted to stay behind and there had been no official order to leave. Read more: What kicked all this off? The 18 September attack on the army base in Uri in Indian-administered Kashmir where 18 soldiers died was the deadliest of its kind for years. Narendra Modi's BJP government, which came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, has been been under tremendous pressure to retaliate for what many in India believe is state-backed terrorism. Many observers say the latest move is aimed at placating an angry domestic constituency and sending out the message that Mr Modi is a strong leader. And many throughout the country hailed the assault as a powerful message to Pakistan. What does Pakistan say? Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif criticised the \"unprovoked and naked aggression of Indian forces\" and said his military was capable of thwarting \"any evil design to undermine the sovereignty of Pakistan\". Islamabad says India's stance is a \"blatant attempt\" to deflect attention from human rights abuses in the region. More than 80 people, nearly all anti-government protesters, have died in more than two months of violence against Indian rule. Why is Kashmir so dangerous? Both India and Pakistan claim Muslim-majority Kashmir in its entirety but control only parts of it. The territorial dispute between the two countries has been running for over six decades, and two out of the three wars fought between the nuclear-armed rivals have been over Kashmir. As with every stand-off in Kashmir, many people fear that this could eventually escalate into a major clash between two nuclear-armed states. But most analysts still believe that is unlikely to happen and that sporadic clashes and diplomatic sabre-rattling are likely to continue.", "output": "Kashmir attack: Villagers evacuate after India 'surgical strikes'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Teams will be working at the house for about two weeks, the force said.

I wouldn't want people to believe that's the case. \"This is just part of the review process.\" He said: \"Most cold case review work considers forensic re-evaluation as techniques advance and this case is no different. \"I am also mindful that, at some point in the future, the house may become re-occupied and these opportunities would otherwise be lost.\" The detective said there was nothing in Miss Lawrence's home that prompted the decision to search it again. \"Originally the house was tidy and didn't appear to have any sign of disturbance,\" he said. \"But that's not to say you can't do something in a house then tidy it up to make it look as if everything was ordinary.

His first term has been beset by poor health, which saw him spend months in the UK last year receiving treatment. Mr Buhari defeated former President Goodluck Jonathan in the 2015 election. He was the first opposition leader to defeat an incumbent in Nigeria. The announcement comes as he is due to travel to the UK on an official visit. He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Theresa May and attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which starts on 16 April. Mr Buhari was on \"medical leave\" in the UK for three months early last year. He revealed after his return to Nigeria that \"I have never been so sick\", but did not disclose what he was suffering from. Mr Buhari will run under the banner of the ruling All Progressives Congress. The main opposition People's Democratic Party is yet to announce its candidate. He has been under fire from former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who in an open letter called on him not to seek re-election because of his age and alleged poor health. Mr Obasanjo added that he was disappointed with Mr Buhari, particularly because of what he called his poor handling of Nigeria's economy, the largest in Africa. Mr Buhari's spokesman said the president accepted the criticism in good faith, but it should be noted that significant progress had been made under his rule in tackling Nigeria's problems. The administration points to its fight against corruption and its military operations against Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which it says has \"degraded\" the group. Analysis: Is Buhari fighting fit? By Mayeni Jones, BBC News, Lagos In recent months, President Buhari has visited many of Nigeria's trouble spots, including the north-eastern town of Dapchi, where 110 schoolgirls were abducted in February by militant Islamist group Boko Haram. He also visited the middle belt states of Taraba, Plateau and Benue, which have been hit by clashes over grazing land between nomadic herdsmen and farmers. These visits can now be seen as an effort to demonstrate a hands-on approach in dealing with some of the main challenges facing Nigeria as he seeks re-election. But doubts remain about Mr Buhari's health after he made three trips to the UK last year to seek treatment.", "output": "Nigeria's Buhari to run in 2019 elections", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The Competition and Market Authority (CMA) is concerned eBay will have influence over both businesses. \"Without this deal, Gumtree and Shpock would have been direct competitors to eBay,\" said Joel Bamford, senior director of mergers at the CMA. \"It is important that people have choice when it comes to selling items they no longer require or searching for a bargain online, and that they can enjoy competitive fees and services,\" he added. The sale was agreed last July when Adevinta beat rival bidders, including Naspers and Prosus, even though they offered eBay more cash as part of their bids. After reviewing eBay's internal documents at the time when the decision was made to sell, the CMA said there would have been a realistic chance that eBay would sell Gumtree to a different purchaser without retaining its influence. That would have resulted in Gumtree becoming an independent competitor to eBay's marketplace. Selling online Adevinta's Shpock and eBay's Gumtree are both UK online classified advertising platforms. Both of them allow people to sell items - used or new goods such as clothing, electronics and furniture - to other local people. Shpock was set up in 2014 as \"the boot-sale app\" and says it has about 12 million monthly active users. Gumtree was launched in 2000 by two City traders who sold it to eBay five years later. It says it is now used by 14 million people every month. Both are free to use, but allow advertisers to pay a fee for more prominent listings. Meanwhile, the biggest marketplace for people to sell used and new goods to each other is eBay, which charges a fee for listings. The CMA is concerned the merger could lead to a loss of competition, with only Facebook Marketplace remaining as a significant competitor. It warns that this could reduce consumer choice, increase fees or lower innovation in the supply of platforms that allow people to buy and sell goods online. Laws needed Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer group Which? welcomed the CMA's move, but said it was time for firmer action against digital firms. \"The case illustrates again that many digital markets have a small number of powerful firms and it is essential that the UK develops an effective competition policy for these markets,\" she said. \"The government needs to swiftly legislate to give the Digital Markets Unit the powers to promote competition for the benefit of consumers, as well as strengthening consumer protection.\" \"This is the latest in a series of merger probes by the CMA involving large digital companies, where we are thoroughly examining deals to ensure that competition is not restricted and consumers' interests are protected,\" said Mr Bamford. The regulator has given the companies a week to offer legally binding solutions to the CMA's competition concerns. If they fail to come up with solutions, the CMA could refer the deal to an in-depth investigation.", "output": "Gumtree Shpock tie-up could raise fees and reduce choice, warns watchdog", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

But their application was turned down, as the school's catchment border runs down the middle of the street. The situation has prompted Mayor of Leicester Sir Peter Soulsby to start a review of city catchment areas. Charlie's mother Louise Cooper said the family had been shocked when they were given the news by Leicester City Council last spring. 'Absurd and perverse' \"We thought we would be fine. We just couldn't believe it when we heard he wasn't allowed to go to Montrose,\" she said. \"It was ridiculous. We would open up the curtains and see everyone taking their children to the school. We felt we had to shelter Charlie from what was going on. \"It all felt a bit embarrassing and awkward. I spoke to so many other parents and neighbours who agreed it was an absurd and perverse decision.\" Charlie's father, Andrew Cooper, decided to teach him at home for a year while he and his wife attended two appeals in a bid to convince Leicester City Council to reverse its decision. But after losing both hearings, the exhausted pair decided to apply for Charlie to attend a different school more than three miles away. Ms Cooper said: \"After losing the second appeal we felt like we had used up all our resources - we felt sapped of energy. \"We found another school we liked the sound of and decided to go ahead with applying for Charlie's sake. He started there last Thursday.\" Sir Peter became aware of the case while in his former role as Labour MP for Leicester South. 'Shocking and disgusting' This week he announced an urgent council review into city school catchment areas to try to tackle about a dozen similar situations. \"Councils are supposed to review their primary school catchment areas on a regular basis - most do it every year or every couple of years,\" he said. \"Astonishingly, Leicester has taken over 10 years since its last review and, as a result of that, a number of anomalies have arisen. \"I've set about having a full review of all of the catchment areas across the city so that by this time next year, not only will things be sorted out for little Charlie they'll also be sorted out for similar children in similar situations across the city.\" Sir Peter said he was hopeful Charlie would be able to join Montrose Primary at the start of the next school year if his family still wanted him to.

The mayor, who is gay, told the BBC he had thought homophobia was a \"non-issue in our city\". A High Court injunction is in place banning protests, which have been going on for months, outside the school. Parents started to gather at the gates over concerns children were \"too young\" to learn about LGBT relationships. They also said the lessons contradicted Islam. In an exclusive interview, Mr Street said the protests do not reflect the \"modern, tolerant, inclusive place that Birmingham is\". He has also said the Department for Education (DfE) needs to strengthen its guidance around equalities teaching. Mr Street said he was \"determined to support the school's right and responsibility\" to teach about equality and condemned some of the leaflets and banners being used by demonstrators. \"If you look at the literature and the banners, the first reaction is disbelief actually... [that] it could be said in this day and age. \"You look at what's being said and it's really upsetting but it is actually ultimately homophobic and it is illegal and it has to stop now.\" 'Not sex education' But he added it was \"too simplistic just to see this as an LGBT issue\". He said suggestions schools were teaching sex education in primary schools had been \"misunderstood entirely\". Mr Street explained the lessons were \"teaching [that] society contains different types of people and mustn't be too obsessed by the LGBT element of this debate because the principle at stake is much broader than that\". Earlier, protesters held their first demonstration since the injunction was granted barring action immediately outside the school. About 40 people gathered outside the exclusion zone on an area of grass about 100m from the school The injunction remains in place until Monday when those against the diversity teachings will be given the chance to make their case in front of a judge. The protest's main organiser, Shakeel Afsar, said a silent protest would be held at the court hearing. Anderton Park head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson previously spoke of receiving threatening emails and phone calls and Mr Street said the government was letting head teachers down by not taking a clearer stand in favour of the teaching. The Conservative mayor has now called on the DfE to \"stand actively behind the guidance it has given\" around teaching about equalities. \"I think it would be a much better situation if there was less about her judgement and much more about guidance that is general and is clearly followed by primary schools,\" Mr Street said. \"It's a very tough situation for this head teacher to have been put into, that's why I say I would like the DfE to be clearer still about what its requirements are.\" The mayor is now seeking a meeting with DfE and also hopes a resolution can be found between the school and parents. \"I hope that there will be discussion between the school and the parents of children in that school,\" he said. \"One of the issues here has of course been that a lot of the demonstrators are not parents in that school. \"Of course I respect the right of parents to be deeply, deeply concerned about what happens in their children's school, but this protest has been somewhat moved away from that. \"I honestly believe if the school and the parents could sit down and look at what genuinely is happening - as has been the case for many years before now remember, this is not new material, this is not a new situation - I genuinely believe accommodation can be found.\" In an interview with The Times on Thursday, schools minister Nick Gibb said the DfE had been \"engaging with the city council almost daily to help navigate a way to a resolution\". He said the protests were \"wrong\" in his view, and said he supported the council's decision to secure an injunction. \"We have worked hard over the last few weeks, patiently, quietly and behind the scenes, to defuse local tensions in Birmingham. \"We will always support head teachers and schools who are doing the right thing and ensuring that children leave school well educated and properly equipped to live and prosper in a modern society and a modern economy. \"And that includes having a full and proper understanding of British values and the way we live our lives today.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.", "output": "Birmingham LGBT row: 'Homophobic protests must stop'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Well, today all bets are off as to how much of the ambitious plan will be delivered. And when. The chief executive of Network Rail, Mark Carne, has told the BBC the challenges of delivering myriad improvement projects - such as the electrification of the Great Western line to South Wales, improved punctuality for millions of passengers and the renewal of hundreds of miles of track - whilst still running a railway seven days a week were simply overwhelming. Some of the projects will be delayed. And costs will rise. \"Over the last year it has become obvious that the challenges of operating, maintaining and enhancing the railway are significant,\" Mr Carne told me. \"I think it's time to level with the public and say that some of these extraordinary projects that we absolutely need are going to take longer and are going to cost more than we originally thought. \"We are going to take the summer to re-evaluate the extension of the programme - we need to do that properly with the Department for Transport and, of course, looking at the impact on trains as well. \"On cost - until we know the exact pattern of the service we will be delivering, we cannot estimate the final cost.\" As part of the announcement today, the chairman of Network Rail, Richard Parry-Jones, will leave after his three-year term. Sir Peter Hendy, the head of Transport for London and the man who \"delivered\" the Olympic transport plan for the capital, will take his place. It's all a long way from the words of Patrick McLoughlin, the Transport Secretary, who said at the launch of the five-year plan: \"A key part of this government's long term economic plan is investing in world class infrastructure. \"That is why we are putting record amounts of government funding into our railways over the next five years. \"That investment will generate growth, create jobs and boost business while delivering faster journeys, greater comfort and better punctuality for passengers across the UK.\" To be clear, much of the investment will still happen. It will just be slower and more expensive. And significant Whitehall sources have also told me that spending \u00a338bn over five years is still the plan. Which means that, according to those officials, the Conservative Party is not about to break its manifesto pledge to spend that amount. What does appear to be the case - according to senior people in the rail industry - is that the Department for Transport was warned last spring that the five-year plan was at risk. But the government has waited until after the election before announcing the change. Mr McLoughlin said that electrification of the Great Western Line was a \"top priority\", but added that electrification work would be \"paused\" on the Midland mainline and on the Transpennine route. Mr Carne, who became chief executive of Network Rail last February when the five-year plan had already been agreed, said that the difficulties of improving Britain's railways had been underestimated. Much of Britain's railway network harks from the Victorian era, and on the Great Western Railway, for example, many of the bridges and tunnels that need to be upgraded to allow for electrification are listed. Wholesale shutdowns of routes are not much welcomed by passengers and so engineers have to cram in the work overnight. That can lead to over-runs. And when that happens, as it did at King's Cross at Christmas (and you can read about that shambles here), Network Rail gets it in the neck. Quite rightly, say Network Rail's critics who point out that the organisation is already miles behind on delivering targets such as improving signalling and track renewal. Mr Carne insists he wants a new approach, working with the regulator and the government to deliver a realistic plan. \"The railway as a whole is not meeting the demands that customers put on it,\" he said. \"I'm working relentlessly with my team to improve the infrastructure. \"It's important to note that the railway itself is the most reliable it has ever been but because we have so many more passengers using the railway we are at a choke point in some parts of the railway, which is affecting performance. \"There are going to be some projects that we will identify during the summer where there will be some delay - and that's partly because of cost and partly because of industry capacity \"It was a very ambitious plan. \"I think people went into it in the right frame of mind, but over the last year experience has shown that a lot of those targets aren't achievable. \"And rather than beating ourselves up over some rather arbitrary target I think we should level with people and reset expectations around what we can deliver \"Our railway is a great success story, passenger numbers have doubled in the last 20 years - but it's a huge challenge to transform the performance of our railway while still providing a great service to the four and half million people that use our railway every day.\"", "output": "All bets off for \u00a338bn rail plan", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

But in the most challenging group - who claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) - only 10% have found work. Work Programme providers say the needs of these jobseekers are too great. The Employment Related Services Association (ERSA), representing the providers, says those receiving ESA have complex health and skills requirements and the Work Programme can not \"fix all these problems alone\". \"The costs of helping jobseekers on ESA back into work are significant and cannot all be met by the Work Programme,\" says the Association's chief executive, Kirsty McHugh. \"In order for there to be a significant step change in performance in helping these jobseekers into employment, we need greater use of skills and health budgets.\" The call for spending from other parts of the public sector to be channelled in to support the Work Programme is an embarrassment for this flagship government scheme. The Department for Work and Pensions says the payment-by-results contracts agreed with Work Programme providers already give them \"a clear financial incentive to support the hardest to help into work\". ERSA figures suggest around a quarter of ESA jobseekers have been unemployed for at least 11 years. The DWP says it recognises the \"particular barriers facing many of the hardest to help\".

Its enterprise and employment manager James Walsh says the organisation cannot make the numbers add up when trying to help ESA claimants into work. \"We need more money to make it stick, to make it sustainable,\" he argues. \"I think everyone would probably say that the forecasts that they made have not proven to be accurate and the issues have proved somewhat more engrained. \"It is a tough job. You don't cure long-term unemployment in two years.\" There are success stories.

The man who escaped the shooting said he and the victims had been trying to reach the US illegally when they were kidnapped by a criminal gang, an unidentified federal official told Mexico's Universal newspaper. The gang offered them work but opened fire when they refused. The unnamed man said he was from Ecuador while the victims were from various countries, including Brazil. There has been no official comment on the media reports. Tamaulipas is one of the states worst affected by the violence, and has been the scene of fierce fighting between the Zetas and Gulf cartels.

Sanders said the president had encouraged his staff to attend, and that she thought it was \"important for us to be here\". After enduring biting mockery from comedian Michelle Wolf, she looked as though she might be regretting the choice. Many administration officials, including the president himself, became the butt of the joke. (Trump tweeted the following day that he thought the event was \"boring\" and that Wolf \"bombed\".) But the onslaught against Sanders, sitting on the head table, left onlookers arguing about whether Wolf had gone too far, or whether her comments were justified. 'Aunt Lydia' In a 'roast' that drew both laughs and gasps, Wolf started by saying: \"We are graced with Sarah's presence tonight. I have to say I'm a little star struck.\" The former Daily Show contributor then compared the press secretary to the matronly but terrifying disciplinarian in the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood's most famous dystopian novel. \"I love you as Aunt Lydia in 'The Handmaid's Tale',\" Wolf told Sanders. The comedian caused more controversy with a quip referring to her make-up: \"I actually really like Sarah. I think she's very resourceful. But she burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye. \"Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's lies. It's probably lies.\" Maggie Haberman, White House correspondent for the New York Times (which stopped attending the event in 2008), questioned Wolf's attack on the press secretary's appearance. Another Twitter user wrote: \"Shame on her! How dare she go after her looks and character. What happened to women power and women stick together? \"I guess that only happens when you are on the same side of the isle. I hope she never works again!\" 'Solid, cutting jokes' After her routine, Wolf said she was commenting on Sanders' \"despicable behaviour\" rather than her looks. But others watching said it showed Mr Trump, who has called the media \"the enemy of the American people\", was right not to attend the event. \"This is disgusting, unfunny, and exactly why most of America dislikes the media,\" wrote one critic on social media. Comedian Tim Young suggested media mockery of Mr Trump was fuelling support for him. But other correspondents and comedians watching, such as New York Times commentator Wajahat Ali, said the press secretary was fair game. Kumail Nanjani, actor and co-writer of the film The Big Sick, said Sanders did not deserve any pity. The White House has caused controversy with attacks on immigrants and been accused of fuelling racism. You may also like: Sanders has been accused of dodging questions and even lying for the president in connection with the investigation into alleged Russian interference in his 2016 campaign. Columnist Mehdi Hasan also pointed to allegations against the president - including multiple claims of sexual harassment, which he denies. The row also ignited a debate about freedom of speech. New York Times correspondent Peter Baker suggested comedy was not suitable for a journalism event. But comedian Kathy Griffin said journalism was \"all about the 1st amendment\" and that Wolf's commentary was vital. 'A disgrace' Sanders is certainly not the first Trump press secretary to be mocked in front of the world's media. Her beleaguered predecessor Sean Spicer was roundly ridiculed on many occasions, including on the comedy show Saturday Night Live. His explanation of the word \"covfefe\" in a tweet by Mr Trump sparked incredulity. \"The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant,\" Spicer said.

Chief executive Jo Dipple said: \"I don't think YouTube pays enough for our brilliant music that they have on their platform.\" YouTube says it's paid out over \u00a32.3bn to the music industry so far. UK Music has criticised YouTube as part of its annual Measuring Music report, which looks at what British music is worth to the UK economy. It said the site is \"yet to deliver fair financial returns for rights owners and creators, artists, composers, songwriters and publishers.\" Artist views Jack Garratt: \"When you put your music into these places where it gains so much mass reach, you don't get paid to do your job fairly.\" Two Door Cinema Club: \"I don't think things at the minute are fair. YouTube don't pay a fair royalty.\" Craig David: \"The industry will shift correctly at the right time. YouTube will line up with everything. I don't know how fast that will be but it will inevitably have to.\" The report argues that the money YouTube pays out is not proportionate to how much music is viewed on its platform, when compared to other services such as Apple Music or Spotify. The report says the per-stream rates on the site fell in 2015 from $0.0020 to $0.0010. However, YouTube says it does not pay on a \"per-stream\" basis. As it makes its money through advertising, it says it's pointless to compare it to subscription music services like Apple or Spotify. \"The way that we pay to all creators is the same,\" says Thea O'Hear, a communications manager at YouTube. \"You get over half of the advertising revenues from the advertising against your video. That's the way that we pay and we're seeing that business grow hugely and dynamically. \"Of course we're totally committed to working with the music business so that more advertising dollars flow to artists.\" YouTube also argues that artists will gain income indirectly from YouTube because of its promotional value. UK Music's Jo Dipple said: \"I'm not sure YouTube - or Google (which owns YouTube) - has ever seen music as being that important. \"I think YouTube should start valuing music like Apple Music does with its services. Music is an intrinsic reason why people go to the platform and they should see music as an intrinsic part of their business.\" The issue of royalty payments from YouTube has been flagged up already this year.

They say nuclear power is so expensive that it should be scrapped in favour of much cheaper renewable energy. Others argue that nuclear still plays a key role in keeping on the lights, so the military aspect is not significant. But in evidence to MPs on the Business Select Committee, researchers from the University of Sussex said the government should be frank about the inter-dependence of the civilian nuclear programme and the nuclear defence industry. Supply chain Prof Andy Stirling from Sussex argues that one reason the government is willing to burden householders with the expense of nuclear energy is because it underpins the supply chain and skills base for firms such as Rolls Royce and Babcock that work on nuclear submarines. He said: \u201cIt is clear that the costs of maintaining nuclear submarine capabilities are insupportable without parallel consumer-funded civil nuclear infrastructures. \u201cThe accelerating competitiveness of renewable energy and declining viability of nuclear power are making this continuing dependency increasingly difficult to conceal.\u201d Rolls Royce, which makes reactors for nuclear submarines, has been pressing the government to agree a fleet of small modular reactors for power generation in the UK. This civilian technology would be transferable to submarines. 'Persuasive' evidence A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: \"We believe having a diverse energy mix is the best way of ensuing energy security while allowing us to meet our climate commitments. \"Nuclear has an important role to play as we transition to a low-carbon economy, but as with any technology, it must represent good value for money for the taxpayer and consumer.\" A committee source told BBC News the researchers' evidence appeared persuasive and well-researched. The committee is expected to release the evidence in coming days as it prepares to discuss whether the UK really needs nuclear power for energy security. The debate has taken on greater significance as the true costs of nuclear power have been revealed. It was once forecast that nuclear energy would be too cheap to meter. But it's clear now that bill-payers will give price support to the Hinkley Point C nuclear station at a cost of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour, compared with the cheapest agreed future subsidy of \u00a357.50 for offshore wind. Ministers expect that, before long, wind energy will operate without support. Prof Stirling says the issue of nuclear inter-dependence is addressed openly in the US. In 2017, the former US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (a nuclear scientist) said: \u201cA strong domestic (nuclear) supply chain is needed to provide for Navy requirements. This has a very strong overlap with commercial nuclear energy.\u201d Prof Stirling told BBC News: \"We need this sort of transparency in the UK.\" Catch-22 But the government faces a Catch-22 situation on this issue. If it continues to decline to admit the inter-dependence of civil and military nuclear, it will stand accused of hiding a self-evident truth. But if it accepts that decisions on nuclear power are influenced with half an eye on manufacturing jobs and nuclear deterrent, it will face resistance from consumer groups unwilling to cross-subsidise submarines. The MPs\u2019 hearing is timely, as the government will shortly publish an energy white paper outlining how the UK will supply electricity in a zero carbon economy.

The question of university value has been under scrutiny, with fees increasing to \u00a39,250 in England. In a speech to university leaders on Thursday, Mr Johnson will call for universities to set out much clearer contracts for students on what they can expect. He will promise better \"consumer protection\" for students. Interest charges An annual study has shown a decreasing sense of value for money among students - with concerns about getting fewer teaching hours than they expected. Mr Johnson will highlight concerns over increases in vice-chancellors' pay - with dozens of university heads now receiving over \u00a3300,000 and some being paid more than \u00a3400,000. \"When students and taxpayers invest so heavily in our higher education system, value for money should be guaranteed. Yet, I am still hearing students say that their course is poor quality. \"This is not good enough, especially when some vice-chancellors take home a wage that in some cases exceeds that of the prime minister.\" There have been concerns about the rising costs of university in England - with tuition fees increasing to \u00a39,250 and interest rates on loans rising to 6.1%. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that average debts for graduates will now be over \u00a350,000 - and that interest charges will have reached \u00a35,800 before students have even graduated. Former education minister Lord Adonis says such high levels of interest are \"indefensible\" and predicts that they will be changed. And the head of the Russell Group of leading universities has described such interest charges as \"out of touch\" and called for them to be reviewed.

He set out his response to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which had warned the government against pressing ahead with air strikes. MPs rejected air strikes against Syrian government targets in 2013. This time around, the PM said there would not be a Commons vote unless there was a clear majority for action, saying a government defeat would \"hand a publicity coup\" to the IS group. Following the Paris attacks in November, some MPs' minds are said to have changed and Mr Cameron has called a debate and vote for Wednesday - so where do the parties stand? The Conservative Party The majority of Conservative MPs would vote to back extending UK air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria. Thirty Conservative MPs rebelled against David Cameron in August 2013, when the Commons rejected his first attempt to launch bombing raids on Syria - albeit against the Assad regime rather than IS militants. A number of MPs who defied their party then - including Charles Walker and Andrew Bridgen - now say they will support the government, Mr Walker suggesting there was \"no room for delay\" in taking the fight to the extremists. One of the 2013 rebels told the BBC they predicted about 15 Conservatives would still oppose any kind of intervention, arguing that bombing could be open-ended and will not help achieve a political solution to the civil war in Syria. Tory MP Julian Lewis - who chairs the Commons Defence Select Committee - told the BBC the IS group could not be defeated militarily unless Western powers worked with the Syrian regime. Total number of Conservative MPs: 331 The Labour Party Labour is split on Syria. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, until recently chairman of the Stop the War Coalition, has written to all of his MPs saying he does not back Mr Cameron's case for air strikes. With at least half of his shadow cabinet believed to be in favour of intervention, this letter generated an angry reaction from some on his front bench, with one member warning of resignations if Mr Corbyn tried to impose his view on the party when it comes to the vote. The party leadership also asked for people to email their views on Syria bombing and claimed that 75% of the 100,000 who responded opposed the bombing. After what was apparently a stormy shadow cabinet meeting on Monday, the Labour leader has offered a free vote on the issue - which means his MPs won't be instructed to vote in a certain way. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that, as of Tuesday, around 50 Labour MPs had indicated they were likely to vote for Syria bombing. Total number of Labour MPs: 231 The Scottish National Party The SNP, which opposed military action in 2013, has vastly increased its Westminster presence since the general election and can exert real influence. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has said her party will vote against airstrikes, the decision having been taken after a careful assessment of the options. She said while David Cameron had made progress in convincing sceptics, the SNP still had two main concerns - the lack of reliable ground troops and the need for post-conflict reconstruction in Syria. Ms Sturgeon said there was an \"honest difference of opinion\" with the prime minister. Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader, has also said there was no effective ground support in place to take and hold territory. And he said there was no fully-costed reconstruction plan in place for Syria. Total number of SNP MPs: 54 The Liberal Democrats Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has written to party members setting out his reasons for backing the government's stance. He told them in the letter that \"the threat to Britain and our allies is clear\" and that \"we can and must play a part to extinguish Isil\". Mr Farron has also said: \"I've made it very clear that our position will be, on balance and in many ways reluctantly, to back the government - because on balance it's a much bigger risk to not act that it is even to act. And I hope that my fellow members of parliament in the Liberal Democrats will join me.\" He said that he had been affected by visiting refugee camps on Greek islands and at Calais. \"I can't in all conscience, personally, look at that situation, having met those people in those camps and not act when I could have done,\" he added. Total number of Lib Dem MPs: 8 The Democratic Unionist Party The Democratic Unionist Party, along with the SDLP and the UUP, helped to sink David Cameron's last attempt to launch air strikes in Syria, with five of its MPs voting against the move and three absent. But DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds has now said that the party would support the government's motion. He said there had been \"much discussion\" with the prime minister and others in government and that his party had \"concluded that the time is right for us to act, and to act decisively\". Mr Dodds added: \"Terrorism requires an answer from all civilised countries. We in Northern Ireland know what it's like for terrorism to be ignored or appeased.\" Total number of DUP MPs: 8 Plaid Cymru Voted against military action last time and would be expected to do so again. Party leader Leanne Wood said her party would \"listen very carefully\" to Mr Cameron's case for air strikes.

But UKIP has been consistent in its opposition to further military action. Green Party The Green Party's only MP Caroline Lucas has confirmed she will vote against military action in Syria on the evidence presented so far, describing the case presented by Mr Cameron as \"neither comprehensive nor compelling\".

Two companies - Ruag of Switzerland and MDA of Canada - were asked to produce competing six-wheeled demonstrators that were nicknamed \"Bradley\" and \"Bruno\". You may have seen them or their predecessor prototype, \"Bridget\", at various shows around Europe in recent years. The billion-euro project has however got to the point where it must move forward with a single design, and either Ruag or MDA will now be contracted to build it. This week, the European Space Agency (Esa) released another 70 million euros to advance the rover mission towards its date with a Proton launch rocket in May 2018. More money is required, of course, and where it will come from has yet to be precisely determined, but for the moment the venture remains officially \"on track\". That is in large part thanks to the Russians who have stepped into the gaping hole left by the Americans' retreat from ExoMars in early 2012. As well as that Proton, Russia's key contribution to 2018 will be the mechanism that gets the rover down to the surface of the Red Planet. This will be built by Lavochkin, which produced the extraordinary 1970s Lunokhod Moon rovers, one of which drove more than 40km. And it is probably worth keeping these vehicles in mind because some of the kit that Lavochkin is proposing for ExoMars' descent is reminiscent of its old technology. The Lunokhods came down on legged landers that then deployed ramps for the rovers to drive down. The 350kg ExoMars will do something very similar. Of course, the big difference between Mars and the Moon is that the latter is an airless body. An atmosphere must be negotiated at Mars and that can cause all kinds of grief. ExoMars will be encapsulated in a heatshield-protected module when it arrives at the Red Planet in early 2019, travelling at some 6km/s. It will be the classic \"seven minutes of terror\" as the engineering tries to slow the velocity to no more than 1m/s by the time ExoMars reaches the surface. Lavochkin's current strategy is to use two parachutes - one opened while the module is still moving at supersonic speeds, and another deployed once subsonic flight has been achieved. As we saw with Nasa's Curiosity vehicle last year, the heatshield will eventually fall away from the entry capsule to allow ExoMars to emerge also, riding its retro-rocket-equipped lander. The last kilometre or so to the ground is guided by radar, which sends information about the approaching surface to the lander's pulsed thrusters. Hopefully, we'll hear the rover operations team, who'll be based in Turin, Italy, call out \"Tango Delta Nominal\", or some such equivalent, to indicate a soft, safe contact. Europe's one and only attempt to land on Mars in 2003 ended in failure. The Russians have tried many times and have not had any success really worth talking about. So there is huge pressure on both parties to get the 2019 touchdown right. It should help that some key technologies will have been tested on the \"other\" ExoMars mission in 2016. This is the satellite that will search for methane and other trace gases in the planet's atmosphere. The intention is for the satellite to despatch a short-lived, battery-operated weather station to the surface as soon as it arrives. The sub-sonic parachute, the radar and the GNC (guidance, navigation and control) system used to get this station to the ground will all be re-used in Lavochkin's lander a year and a half later. \"We should learn a lot in 2016,\" says Vincenzo Giorgio who leads the ExoMars industrial project at prime contractor Thales Alenia Space. \"These systems will be thoroughly tested. The radar, for example, we are about to start testing on a helicopter next week. And we will take it also to Morocco, near Marrakesh, to a terrain that looks very much like Mars.\" Incidentally, the Russians plan to put a meteorological station on the rover's lander, with the difference being that it will be powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator - a nuclear battery. This will give the weather sensors long-term power. We have to hope it all works. ExoMars has been such a long-drawn-out affair, I'm not sure I could bear a crash-and-burn story in 2019. The vehicle will go with a suite of nine instruments that will for the first time since Viking try to answer the \"is there life on Mars?\" question. Recent missions have restricted themselves to chasing the history of water on the planet and wondering whether conditions in the past might have been habitable. ExoMars will have a stab at looking for microbe activity and will drill up to 2m into the ground to look for clues. Its big onboard lab, Moma, will check dirt samples for organic chemistry linked to biology. \"We have to do this and we have to succeed,\" Esa's director of science, Alvaro Gimenez, told me this week. \"It's not going to be easy but it should be really exciting.\"", "output": "Looking forward to Europe's 'seven minutes of terror'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer. The lists of candidates in each constituency and the guide to parties' policies remain available online during polling day. Coverage on the day is usually restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. It tends to focus on giving information which will help voters with the process of going to polling stations. Subjects which have been directly at issue or part of the campaign must not be covered while polls in the UK are open. No opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until after the polls have closed. Whilst the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish anything about the way in which people have voted in that election. From 22:00 GMT, normal reporting of the election resumes, with rolling coverage.", "output": "General election 2019: How the BBC reports polling day", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The SNP claimed the new goal was achievable, after the government confirmed Scotland had beaten a 31% target for 2011 by about 4%. But the Scottish Greens warned that without ending the use of fossil fuels the long-term targets would not be met. The first minister told delegates the renewables industry presented a \"massive economic opportunity\". He said the new target would help build on the current 11,000 jobs in green energy following a \"bumper year\" for investment, with projects estimated to be worth \u00a32.3bn. Investment in jobs The Scottish government's new interim target for 2015 is contained in a refreshed Routemap for Renewable Energy for Scotland. According to figures published in July by the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change, the period between April 2011 and June 2012 saw \u00a32.3bn of investment announced in Scotland on green projects. SNP ministers hope that will create up to 4,500 jobs. Earlier this year, the Scottish government confirmed Scotland had beaten its 2011 target on renewable energy. Official figures revealed that about 35% of Scotland's electricity demand was met by green energy - beating the target of 31% set in 2007. Mr Salmond told the conference: \"When I became first minister in 2007, I inherited a target for 50% of Scotland's electricity to be produced by renewable sources by 2020. \"We now know that we can achieve much more than that, more quickly - having already exceeded our 2011 target. \"Last year, we published a Routemap for Renewable Energy for Scotland, outlining how we would meet the equivalent of 100% of Scotland's electricity demand from renewable sources by 2020. \"Today, we are publishing an update to that Routemap. It shows clearly the progress that has been made in the last year. \"In the light of that progress, I can announce that we have set a new interim target - by 2015, the equivalent of 50% of Scotland's electricity demand will be met by renewable sources. \"This target is ambitious, but also achievable. It is based on current data about capacity which is operational, under construction, or has been consented.\" Missed target But last week the Scottish government was attacked for failing to meet its own climate change targets in 2010, according to the latest official figures. They showed greenhouse gas emissions rose by 1.9% on 2009 figures, after taking emissions trading into account. At Holyrood, Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse blamed \"exceptional cold snaps\" among other factors for missing the target. But opposition politicians said the SNP had resorted to blaming the weather instead of their record on climate change. Responding to the announcement of the new target, Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said: \"50% by 2015 is clearly achievable but the most important target is the long-term reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \"Renewable energy will help us to get there but only if we reduce fossil fuel consumption at the same time, sadly something the SNP are less keen on.\" Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser, convener of the Holyrood energy committee, said: \"The biggest problem with the SNP's renewable energy target is that it's completely underpinned by wind power. \"Not only is that an unreliable and intermittent source, but it's led to turbines blighting communities across the whole country.\" WWF Scotland said it was vital to match the progress made with similar ambition to improve energy efficiency in homes and tackle emissions from transport.", "output": "Scottish green energy target set at 50% of demand by 2015", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

But Mr O'Leary said there were signs the \"recovery has already begun\". Bookings are up from 500,000 a week in early April to 1.5 million a week now. \"The rate of bookings suggests there is a huge amount of confidence,\" he told the BBC. \"We are very optimistic for the next couple of months.\" And he predicted that after \"most European populations are vaccinated by September\", the airline should see a particularly strong recovery in October to March, the second half of its financial year. \"For vaccinated Britons going to the beaches of Portugal, Spain and Greece, I think there is very little risk. Everybody is right to be cautious, but I think everybody can take their holiday in Europe with a high degree of confidence.\" From Monday, holidaymakers from England, Scotland and Wales can fly off for some early summer sun as the ban on foreign holidays is lifted. Travellers can now visit 12 countries on the government's green list, including Portugal and Israel, without isolating on their return. But the vast majority of tourist destinations remain on the amber and red lists, meaning travellers must quarantine when they get back. Mr O'Leary told BBC Breakfast that the air travel sector was offering some \"good deals\" for this summer as it tried to kick-start demand after a torrid year. But he forecast prices would rise in 2022. With the collapse and contraction of airlines like Thomas Cook and Alitalia reducing capacity, carriers will be able to push up prices, he said. The scale of the financial crisis facing airlines was underlined on Monday when Ryanair posted a record after-tax loss. The airline said it flew 27.5 million passengers in the year ending 31 March, down from 149 million the previous year. Ryanair's annual \u20ac815m loss was slightly better than an \u20ac834m loss forecast by many analysts. \"It's better than we predicted, but still a fairly traumatic loss for an airline that has been consistently profitable for our 35-year history,\" Mr O'Leary said in a pre-recorded statement accompanying the results.", "output": "Ryanair: Signs of summer travel rebound", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

In December, it emerged that almost half of Northern Ireland's taxi drivers failed to apply for a previous emergency support grant set up by Stormont.

The department said the first scheme had made payments to more than 4,100 drivers, with about 90% of applications being processed by the end of this week. Ms Mallon said she hoped new payments could be made to those eligible \"without delay\". \"I understand why some of these drivers changed their insurance so they could save money when they could not get any work,\" she said. \"I have always been focused on helping those in need and that is why the second scheme will provide a payment to them based on the period of time that registered drivers had the relevant insurance to drive a taxi.\"", "output": "Covid-19: Funding for taxi drivers ineligible for first grant", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Five others have already been convicted of the same charges after 12 shots were fired at police in August. The West Midlands force helicopter was also shot at. Tyrone Laidley, 20, Nicholas Francis, 26, of Thetford Road, Great Barr in Birmingham, Renardo Farrell, 20, of The Terrace, Finchfield in Wolverhampton and Wayne Collins, 25, from Ouseley Close in Luton, Bedfordshire, were all convicted of riot, reckless arson and possession of firearms with intent to endanger life. Arson attack A teenager, 17, who cannot be named, was convicted of riot and firearms offences but cleared of arson. They will be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. Joyah Campbell, 19, of Hanover Court, Aston, in Birmingham and another 17-year-old were cleared of the same charges. The court heard during the trial that the force helicopter had been shot at by Laidley, of Chadsmoor Terrace, Nechells, in the early hours of 10 August. Police footage showed a man appear to drop to one knee by a car in Clifton Close, Aston, and point a gun at the helicopter, prosecutor Andrew Lockhart QC said. It was targeted after 12 shots were fired at police called to an arson attack on the Bartons Arms pub. Small fires were started at the Grade II-listed pub but put out without anyone being hurt. 'Blocking carriageway' Furniture was taken outside and from a nearby nightclub and used to blockade the A34, a main route in and out of the city, in what police said was a deliberate attempt to lure officers to the scene and attack them.

Senior investigating officer Det Insp Andy Bannister said: \"It was pre-orchestrated with a view to creating an incident which we would say was setting fire to the Bartons Arms pub with complete disregard to the residents upstairs before blocking the carriageway to draw police officers there and attack them. \"It's completely distinct from any other experience that I've had where police officers arrive and individuals ditch their weapons or run away.\"", "output": "Birmingham riots: Jermaine Lewis convicted over police shooting", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Cameron Ortis had access to information coming from Canada's global allies, the RCMP national police force said. Canada is in close contact with its intelligence partners over the case, Mr Trudeau says. \"We are in direct communications with our allies on security,\" the prime minister said while campaigning in Newfoundland on Tuesday. \"We are also working with them to reassure them, but we want to ensure that everyone understands that we are taking this situation very seriously.\" Canada is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance that also includes the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand. \"We recognise that these allegations, if proven true, are extremely unsettling,\" said RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki on Tuesday. What are the charges against Mr Ortis? Mr Ortis, who was a civilian director general with the police force's intelligence unit, is accused of breaching the Security of Information Act and the Criminal Code. The charges filed against him include the \"unauthorised communication of special operational information\", possessing a device or software \"useful for concealing the content of information or for surreptitiously communicating, obtaining or retaining information\", and breach of trust by a public officer. Few other details have been released about the alleged offences, though they took place during his tenure as an RCMP employee. What do we know about the investigation? The investigation dates back to 2018, when the RCMP was assisting the FBI on a separate investigation, during which investigators came across documents that suggested there might be some internal corruption - \"a mole\". That sparked a separate investigation to discover the source of the leak. The inquiry led back to the RCMP and then to the eventual arrest of Mr Ortis last week, Ms Lucki said during a news conference on Tuesday. As soon as it learned there was cause for concern, the force took immediate steps to safeguard intelligence, she said. Under his security clearance, Mr Ortis had access to information the Canadian intelligence community possessed and intelligence coming from international allies. The RCMP said it was aware of potential risks to operations of its partner agencies in Canada and abroad and was assessing what impact, if any, the case may have had on security operations. \"The investigation is continuing and we are evaluating the potential repercussions of [Mr Ortis]' activities,\" said Ms Lucki. How damaging is the case? Ms Lucki says for the moment allies continue to share intelligence with relevant Canadian authorities despite the fact that the leaks could have hurt their nations' intelligence operations. But she conceded there is \"always the possibility\" that partner agencies might lose trust in the RCMP. \"I would definitely imagine that there is concern amongst our Five Eyes community as well as within Canada,\" she said. Ms Lucki said the national police force put measures in place to mitigate the current risks - and to prevent something similar from happening again. CBC News reports that Mr Ortis had highly classified material that, if it were released, would cause a serious damage to Canada and its allies. Mr Ortis was looking into allegations that Russian tax fraudsters had laundered millions of dollars through Canada, a US financier told Reuters. Bill Browder, a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said he had met Mr Ortis twice in Canada in 2017 after alerting the RCMP to the matter.", "output": "Cameron Ortis: Trudeau reassures allies amid alleged spying case", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The government said the overhaul would save more than 1 trillion reais (\u00a3210bn; $270bn) over the next decade. But opposition parties argue the changes would penalise the poorest. The proposal must be approved by both Houses of Congress. Many previous governments in Brazil have tried but failed to reform the country's pension system, which is running large deficits, a situation expected to worsen in coming decades as the country's population ages. President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who was elected last year, said the issue would be the number one priority at the start of his new government. \"We need to change the rules of the pension system,\" said Leonardo Rolim, the official responsible for pensions at the Economy Ministry. \"People are living longer and women have fewer children, which means that the working population will decrease.\" A way to kick start growth? Analysis by Daniel Gallas, BBC South America correspondent This will be the toughest test yet for President Jair Bolsonaro, who is still a relatively untried political negotiator. To approve the main changes, he will need backing from two thirds of Congress. Brazilian lawmakers are known to strike hard bargains, often demanding changes in other policies in exchange for their support. And attempts at reform by other presidents have failed in the recent past. Everyone is watching the issue very closely. Market analysts often describe pension reform as the most important factor to kick start growth in the economy again. But workers say they will be paying an unfair price for the changes. Under the current system, workers in Brazil can retire after contributing to the pension system for at least 35 years in the case of men, or 30 for women. The new proposal would set minimum retirement ages for men and women, and delay full payout of pensions until 40 years of contributions. Workers could access partial pensions after 20 years. Mr Bolsonaro has also proposed increased contributions from wealthier taxpayers and creating a more private system of individual savings accounts, funded by employees, as another alternative. The new rules would phase in over 12 to 14 years, But opposition parties have vowed to block the bill. They say it will penalise the poor, who are more likely to start working at a young age and would now be required to work longer before being able to collect pension benefits. Unions have mobilised mass protests against previous reform efforts.", "output": "Bolsonaro proposes pension overhaul for Brazil", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

He accused the Church of forcing bishops to retire in favour of replacements picked by Beijing. The Vatican did not directly mention Cardinal Zen but said criticism of its China policy was \"fostering confusion and controversy\". Cardinal Zen had in a Facebook post on Monday revealed that a Vatican delegation had asked a bishop to give up his post to make room for a replacement backed by Beijing. Cardinal Zen, whose term as bishop of Hong Kong came to an end in 2009, said he had travelled to the Vatican earlier this month and personally raised the issue with Pope Francis. \"Do I think that the Vatican is selling out the Catholic Church in China?\" he wrote on Facebook. \"Yes definitely, if they go in the direction which is obvious from all they are doing in recent years and months.\" In its response, the Vatican said the Pope was in \"constant contact with his collaborators... on Chinese issues\". \"It is therefore surprising and regrettable that the contrary is affirmed by people in the Church, thus fostering confusion and controversy,\" the Director of the Holy See Press Office Greg Burke said in a statement. China and the Church China broke off diplomatic ties with the Holy See in 1951, and many of the nation's Catholics face the choice of attending state-sanctioned churches approved by Beijing or worshipping in \"underground\" congregations.

However, recent reports have indicated that China and the Vatican are close to a historic agreement governing the selection of bishops for the country's 10 million Chinese Roman Catholics.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Margaret Prosser, a former union leader and Labour treasurer, said it was \"completely silly\" just to focus on organised labour. \"The idea that the whole focus of Labour's proposal or offer ought to be around organised labour is just daft,\" she said. \"We have to be able to say that the government, a Labour government is going to be there for all kinds of people.\" Paul Kenny, of the GMB union, said her criticism was out of date. 'None of that' But Mr Kenny told the BBC he would prefer to have a public row and \"blood bath\" now rather than in two years' time. He said Labour would struggle without union funds, adding that \"if you took away the support from the affiliated unions financially, then it would be difficult to see how the Labour Party would fight a national election\". Ms Harman said while she expected a \"robust debate\", she did not expect Unite to end its affiliation to the Labour Party. The party had changed the way its leader is elected, adopting a one member, one vote system, she said. \"Last time the unions communicated directly with many of their members, sending them ballot papers with accompanying material only mentioning one candidate,\" she said. \"There will be none of that this time. \"The Electoral Reform Society will send out individual ballot papers to each member of the electorate.\"", "output": "Unite won't sever Labour Party ties - Len McCluskey", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The \u00a313m project includes an eight-lane pool, cafe, fitness centre, dance studio and sports hall. The new lido is planned for a site on Aberavon seafront. Neath Port Talbot council said the overall budget for the project had increased by \u00a3232,000. Council leader Ali Thomas said the process had taken longer than expected. This was due to the \"difficult site clearance issues\" following the 2009 fire, the design requiring an extensive consultation, the need for planning permission and the tendering process for the work. \"However, this report marks the final stage of that process and we are now able to deliver the new facility with construction to start before the end of the month,\" said Mr Thomas. \"This will not compromise on quality or the mix of facilities that will be available at the new centre, and additional resources have been allocated to the project to meet the commitments we gave to the community and the wider area.\" The original Afan Lido was opened in 1965 by the Queen, while Graham Jenkins, the brother of the late Hollywood star Richard Burton, was its first manager. The venue hosted major concerts by Spencer Davis and Pink Floyd in its early days, and Coldplay and McFly in recent years. But in December 2009 the building was gutted by fire and finally demolished in late 2011. A total of 2,628 people took part in a Neath Port Talbot council consultation on replacing the facility.

Here, too, sits the nation's book town and home to an annual poetry prize - one section of which celebrates the Scots language. But as soon as this year's winner of that particular award speaks, you would know she hails from a little further west than Wigtown. Renita Boyle was born and raised in Wisconsin. She picked up a storytelling bug from her great-grandfather, a lumberjack, who used to tell her tales he had once recounted around the campfire. Then personal loss saw her turn to poetry. \"I think, like a lot of people who write poetry or any kind of writing at all, they do it because they can't not - it is just something that is in you to do,\" she said. \"My father died when I was 13 years old and the first thing I did was go up to my bedroom and I wrote a poem. \"It is quite a therapeutic thing for me to do.\" Nonetheless, it was still quite a journey to end up gaining recognition for her writing in Scots. It is partly about belonging, she explained. She met her future husband in Glasgow more than 30 years ago. She was welcomed into that family before having family of her own and then moving to Wigtown a decade ago. Storytelling has always been in her blood but now, over the years, the words and ways of Scotland have started to seep in. Another factor has been the role of Wigtown itself, which she credits for a creative energy and artistic support network that gave her the push to give the language a try. One key figure in that effort was Scots poet and former James Hogg writer-in-residence, Rab Wilson. 'Beautiful work' \"Rab is always trying to get everybody to read and write in Scots,\" said Ms Boyle. \"He's the one that actually said - when are you going to write a Scots poem?\" Then Spring Fling writer-in-residence Marjorie Lofti Gill encouraged her to consider writing about an artwork. Her winning poem, Sloe Jen, was inspired by a piece by artist Lisa Hooper but also a motherly fear of watching her teenage son leave the nest. Judges praised the \"lovely, consistent\" use of the Scots language and described it as a \"sad and beautiful work\". Some will wonder how an American can possibly write in Scots, but Ms Boyle said that was not such a problem. It's reciting, still with a distinctive accent, that is most testing. But she has braved those waters just the same, thanks to a passion for the language that might put a few native Scots to shame. \"I don't think I have conquered the Scots language,\" she said. \"Although I have written in Scots, I won't ever write in Scots the way that a Scottish person would write in Scots. \"There are some things you will never do in the same way as somebody who is native but there are other things you can bring to it because you are not native.\" Ms Boyle said it might be a one-off, she might never write poetry again in the language of her adopted nation but she burst with pride at the recognition her work received. \"It meant a lot to me,\" she said. \"I actually cried when I won and that was not just about winning a prize, that was actually about affirming an identity I think.\" As the world becomes a smaller place, it could be a trend we see more and more. Historically, too, some writers have turned their backs on their mother tongue for one they feel suits them better. A language is, after all, a living and evolving thing. So, perhaps you don't have to have used it all your life in order to get the best out of it.", "output": "Frae Wisconsin tae Wigtown: How an American won a Scots poetry prize", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The US president is expected to repeat his support for Britain's EU membership when he visits the UK next week. Backers of Remain dismissed Mr Johnson's remarks as \"nonsense\", citing US membership of Nato and trade bodies. The White House has indicated Mr Obama is ready to offer his view on the issue but will stress the decision is for UK voters. Speaking in Washington, Chancellor George Osborne said it was the \"overwhelming view\" of foreign governments and international institutions such as the IMF and Nato that the UK should remain. Backing from Mr Obama could boost Prime Minister David Cameron's efforts to persuade the country to vote to remain in the EU in the 23 June referendum. Asked about the US president, the London mayor said everything about the history of the US suggested they would never share sovereignty. \"I don't know what he is going to say but, if that is the American argument then it is nakedly hypocritical. The Americans would never dream of it,\" he told the BBC. 'Absolutely bizarre' \"I think that President Obama has got a perfect right to make any intervention that he wants. Indeed I welcome the views of everybody in this debate. \"I just find it absolutely bizarre that we are being lectured by the Americans about giving up our sovereignty and giving up control when the Americans won't even sign up to the international convention on the law of the seas, let alone the International Criminal Court.\" Labour MP Stephen Kinnock dismissed Mr Johnson's comments as \"utter nonsense\". \"The last time I checked, the United States was a member of Nato. You look at article five of Nato, it says any attack on a Nato member is an attack on all. You couldn't have a greater pooling of sovereignty than that,\" he said. \"The United States is a member of the WTO [World Trade Organization] and a range of other international organisations. We pool our sovereignty in order to make ourselves stronger.\" Analysis By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Boris Johnson could hardly be more dismissive of the arguments being put forward by the prime minister, the IMF, the Bank of England, Nato and the White House. The mayor of London said economic concerns about leaving the EU were fundamentally wrong and he claimed the union was corrupt. And he said that President Obama's likely warnings about departure would be nakedly hypocritical. Remain campaign sources say those arguing to leave can't answer basic questions about the economic risks and can't attract the backing of any third parties of any stature. When pressed for endorsements to rival the In camp, the mayor of London stumbled. Yet Mr Johnson described his colleagues who want to stay in the union of being the Gerald Ratners of British politics. They believe the EU is \"crap\" - his word - but say there is no alternative. Maybe his plain speaking is the passion of the newly converted. But with Boris Johnson as one of the Leave campaign's biggest voices, if they lose, it won't be for fear of being bold. Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said: \"The real issue here is that it's actually Boris Johnson who has been nakedly hypocritical on this issue because of course in January [he] was saying that he actually wanted us to stay in [the EU]. \"I think what Boris Johnson has done is made a calculation about him being the future leader of the Conservative Party rather than his views on whether we are stronger in Europe or out of it.\" Mr Johnson also reiterated his view that Mr Cameron should stay on as prime minister even if voters backed leaving. At a rally for the Leave campaign in Newcastle on Saturday, Mr Johnson said the referendum was \"a massive opportunity to... burst out of the shackles of Brussels\". The London mayor was applauded when he spoke of the EU being \"deeply anti-democratic\" and \"sometimes borderline corrupt\" in how it allocated its budget. And he said Britain would \"thrive and flourish as never before\" if it left the EU and agreed its own free trade deals.

But Mr Johnson said Mr Clarke's comments were \"uncommonly pessimistic\". He said Mr Cameron would be in a \"strong position\" to lead post-referendum negotiations and there were no previous examples of European leaders who had been forced to step down after suffering \"adverse referendum results\". \"Obviously David Cameron should remain in place,\" he said.", "output": "EU referendum: Boris Johnson accuses Barack Obama of 'hypocrisy'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Baldessari had begun his career in the 1950s by sticking to tradition. He was in his twenties, and he was still figuring out who he was as an artist and, most importantly, who he wanted to be. The result was an inventory of relatively traditional semi-abstract paintings. Rather than doing what most artists do and simply storing them away, he gathered them up, took them to a crematorium in nearby San Diego, and had the entire lot destroyed. The ashes filled 10 large boxes - some of which were stored in a book-shaped urn, engraved with his name, which then lived on his bookshelf for the rest of his life. Baldessari combined some of the other ashes with cookie dough, and the resulting cookies were exhibited at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). \"To be creative you have to have destruction quite often too,\" Baldessari would tell an interviewer years later. \"It's like the idea of a phoenix rising from the ashes.\" In honour of the old artworks, he placed a death notice in a local newspaper. Just a year later, he declared to the world: \"I will not make any more boring art.\" John Baldessari died on 2 January, aged 88, having kept that promise. Baldessari was born on 17 June 1931 in National City, California, just a few miles from Tijuana on the Mexican border. He studied art and art education in San Diego, and was almost immediately drawn to teaching - taking up teaching posts at a junior high school, a community college, and then University of California, San Diego. He even spent a summer teaching art to teenagers at a camp for juvenile offenders run by the local authority. Baldessari had already begun experimenting with new art forms before the cremation in 1970 - including paintings that were text-based, or combined text and image. For example, he printed an intentionally bad photograph on to a canvas, with nothing but the word \"WRONG\" written underneath it. In another work, Tips For Artists Who Want to Sell, he painted his deadpan advice for creating commercially appealing artwork - including tips such as, \"paintings with light colours sell more quickly than paintings with dark colours\". In summer 1970, after the cremation day, he began teaching a course at CalArts on \"post-studio art\" - that is, art beyond the studio. As well as teaching, it was there that he started making experimental videos - including the now-famous short film of himself writing \"I will not make any more boring art\" over and over again on a ruled notebook. But as conceptual art developed a reputation for being cerebral (that is, code for impenetrable), Baldessari injected humour into his work - sometimes by riffing off other conceptual artists, such as Sol LeWitt. \"The first thing you would say about John is that he was hilarious,\" curator Kate Fowle tells the BBC. \"He took his job as an artist very seriously - but he didn't take art seriously. He didn't take the art world seriously. He understood what it was, of course, but his joy was... well, he used to say to people, 'just go out and look at art - it doesn't matter if you don't like it, just go and look, something will resonate in the end'.\" As well as being hilarious, she adds, he was tall. Very tall. According to artist David Salle, one of Baldessari's friends and CalArts students in the 1970s, he was 6'7\" - something that, for a long time, earned him \"the distinction of being the tallest serious artist in the world\". In the 1980s, he began working with photo collages - in particular, old Hollywood movie stills and photographs from newspapers. One such photograph, Ms Fowle recalls, was a film noir still. In it, a beautiful woman reclined on the beach, calmly reading a book. Baldessari's text caption beneath this serene image? \"Learn to read.\" He would also often obscure the people in these photographs with coloured stickers, which turned out to be old price tags. As he told NPR years later: \"I just got so tired of looking at these faces.\" \"John didn't make work that demanded that you know something before you could enjoy it,\" Ms Fowle says. \"He would mix in words and images, but it wasn't like, if you worked really hard you would get to the bottom of the puzzle. He wasn't trying to test people.\" 'We arrived in time for the birthing' Imparting the joy of art to others through teaching was Baldessari's passion - as much as making his own art. His gallerist, Marian Goodman, tells the BBC: \"He gave a great deal to his students - a great deal. He really helped them become significant artists. People came from all over to study with him, and were beholden to him for all that he taught.\" Salle, writing in Interview magazine in 2013, described taking Baldessari's post-studio art class was \"legendary\". \"[It] bestowed on those of us with enough brains to notice, a feeling of unbelievable luck of being in exactly the right place at the right time for the new freedoms in art - we arrived in time for the birthing, so to speak.\" He remained a prolific creator, too - even into his 80s. In late 2009, Tate Modern in London staged a retrospective of his work - often a signal that an artist is entering the autumn of their career. Baldessari, however, spent the next two years creating an entirely new collection of work. These were shown at an exhibition at Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow in 2013. Two years later, in 2015, the man who began his career by burning his own \"boring\" paintings to a crisp was awarded the National Medal of Arts by then-US President Barack Obama. As Salle wrote: \"Collectors who, a few decades ago, might have considered 'conceptual' art something they probably didn't have time for are now lining up for a chance to own a Baldessari. \"Despite - or perhaps because of - John's contrarian nature, he is firmly in the canon.\"", "output": "John Baldessari: The artist who cremated his own paintings", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Two students had to be rescued by firefighters, one from the sixth floor. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said it used new evacuation procedures put in place following the Grenfell Tower disaster. The fire service report found the cladding on the seven-storey failed to stop the spread of fire, which was started by a discarded cigarette. Witnesses said the fire ripped across and up the building within minutes, \"crawling up the cladding like it was nothing\". The fire service arrived just over three minutes after the 99 call at 20:30 GMT on 15 November 2019, and within 25 minutes the fire had spread to \u201call floors\u201d.

Mr Livingstone also said he would provide funding to create more out-of-hours childcare places at 200 nurseries across London. A London Assembly report published last month said many parents in the capital could be prevented from working because of high childcare costs.

The CO2 scarcity has already forced beer, fizzy drink and meat firms to curb production. Warburton's supplies 1.5 million crumpets a week to UK consumers, packaged using carbon dioxide to give them longer shelf life and prevent mould. But plants in London and Burnley have run out of CO2 and supplies at the company's Stockton site are intermittent. \"We have had quite big shortfalls,\" said Tearmh Taylor, a spokeswoman for Warburton's. \"We're probably running at about 50% of what we can normally make\" she said. You may also be interested in: Only the Midlands plant is operating normally and the firm doesn't know when supplies will resume. Their supplier said it could be next week but have had no confirmation. Meanwhile, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said brewers were \"working their socks off\" to keep the beer flowing. Scotland's biggest abattoir is closed and other meat producers are considering adapting their products to use less CO2. Some food and drink firms have asked whether the government could help alleviate the problem. \"If a similar issue were to affect the water industry... then you feel government would be acting with far greater urgency,\" the Food and Drink Federation said.. What is the problem? CO2 is widely used in the food processing and drinks industries. It puts the fizz into beer, cider and soft drinks, and is used in food packaging to extend the shelf life of salads, fresh meat and poultry. The gas is also used to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter, and create dry ice to help keep things chilled while in transit. However, several UK and mainland European producers of carbon dioxide - a by-product from ammonia production that is used in the fertiliser industry - closed for maintenance or scaled down operations. In the UK, only two of five plants that supply CO2 are operating at the moment. The shortage comes at the same time demand for food and drink is soaring. \"The football, the weather, the BBQs have created the sort of demand for beer we only see at Christmas,\" one big UK brewing company told the BBC. What are the pubs saying? Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association struck a reassuring note: \"Although stocks of bulk CO2 remain low, brewers across the country are working their socks off around the clock to ensure there is still plenty of beer to go around. \"The UK can produce as much as 10 million pints of beer per day, and with signs of things improving, pubs will certainly not be running dry. \"Our message to beer drinkers and England fans is clear: Keep calm and carry on going to the pub. If your usual beer of choice isn't available, then why not use it as an opportunity to try something new?\" These assurances come after big pub chains in Wetherspoon and Ei Group reported they had temporarily run out, or were short of, brands including John Smith's, Strongbow, Amstel and Birra Moretti in the run-up to Thursday evening's England match against Belgium. What about the meat industry? Scotland's biggest abattoir closed this week until further notice, and meat processors are considering shortening \"sell by\" dates because packaging will contain lower levels of CO2. There have been concerns about animal welfare if animals don't go to slaughter at their usual rate. \"The last few days have alerted the country to how dependent we are on CO2,\" Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors' Association, told the BBC on Thursday. He criticised CO2 producers for a lack of information about when carbon dioxide supplies might return to normal. \"It makes planning difficult,\" Mr Allen said. The British Poultry Council said its members continued to live \"day-to-day\" as they tried to stretch out their dwindling supplies of the gas. What does the government say? The meat industry has become increasingly frustrated by a lack of information coming from CO2 firms and the UK government in particular over when supplies might return to normal. \"They are not telling us, which means we can't plan,\" said Richard Griffith, from the British Poultry Council. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Department of Business both said they were monitoring the situation. However, the Food and Drink Federation said ministers should really be on the \"front foot\" over what could develop into a major food supply issue. When can the industry expect more supplies? The industry trade journal Gas World, which first reported the news that CO2 was running short, said that two tankers full of liquid CO2 from mainland Europe have been delivered to ports in the UK in the past couple of days. A number of European plants are beginning to increase supplies, while another factory that had closed because of technical issues rather than maintenance, is due to come back online in mid-July.", "output": "Warburton's shuts crumpet plants due to CO2 shortage", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

It is the first time the ex-military pilot has spoken in public since he was pulled from the wreckage of his plane. Mr Hill, 54, from Sandon in Hertfordshire, denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. His vintage jet crashed on to the A27 on 22 August 2015 after failing to complete an aerobatic manoeuvre. Asked by his defence barrister Karim Khalil if he had ever \"any mind to cause risk to anybody\" at an air show, Mr Hill said: \"Absolutely not. It was the primary aim of the display to avoid risk.\" 'Disciplined approach' Questioned about what he got out of displays, he said it was \"probably the highest level of discipline in what you could do with flying an aircraft, particularly in this environment now I'm in the civilian world\". Mr Hill went on to reject the prosecution's description of him as a \"cavalier pilot\", saying he \"took a structured, disciplined approach\" to flying. \"I held back from areas I was uncomfortable doing... we have our strengths and weaknesses and experience,\" he told the court. Taking the court through his thoughts and processes when preparing for display flights, Mr Hill said he was known for his \"detail and preparation and planning\". Before he took off at North Weald airfield on the day of the crash, he was seen walking around in his flying suit. He told the court he had been carrying out a practice by walking through the display, which is something he does with all his displays, after making diagrams of his routines on paper.

The court heard about a flight at Duxford where Mr Hill received a \"display line\" call, alerting him to the possibility he might breach the \"display line\". Mr Hill said: \"I disregarded it because I was concentrating on flying.\" He said later the flight information controller apologised to him for making the call and told him he had not realised what he was doing. Asked if he had any concerns on whether he could control the manoeuvres he had in mind, Mr Hill replied: \"No.\" Jurors earlier heard Mr Hill was educated in Kent, and was recruited into the RAF as a frontline pilot straight from university. During his career, he was on active service for a month in northern Iraq, and also received an award for writing a computer programme that contributed to aircraft safety. Mr Hill left the RAF in 1995 and went into civil aviation, becoming a commercial pilot starting with Virgin Atlantic before moving to British Airways and progressing \"relatively quickly\" to the most senior position of captain. He suffered burns, fractures and a collapsed lung after the vintage jet he was flying crashed. Mr Hill had passed medical checks before the crash, while tests and scans carried out afterwards did not show any sign of a medical condition - including cognitive impairment - which may have affected his health leading up to the crash, the court heard.

Overall 22,041 knife or weapon offences were recorded, the highest number since 2010 - and a 34% increase on 2015. The total number of first-time offences rose between 2014 and 2019. But the proportion of first-time offenders is actually at its lowest level since 2009 as the number of arrests of people with previous convictions has gone up by a greater degree. The MoJ figures come amid a national debate on the issue of knife crime, following a spate of assaults and killings involving young people. They show the offences were committed by 14,183 first-time offenders and 5,653 people with at least one previous knife or weapon crime to their name. One in five of those convicted or cautioned was aged between 10 and 17, a slight fall on the previous year. About 37% of offenders were jailed - the same as last year. The average jail sentence rose from 7.2 to 7.9 months for adults - and from 5.9 to 7.7 months for 16 and 17-year-olds. The latest available figures for Scotland, released by the Scottish Government, show that convictions for handling offensive weapons - such as knives - dropped for the 10th consecutive year in 2017-18, falling by 1% to 1,451. Charlotte Pickles, from the Reform think tank, said the figures suggested tougher sentences were not an answer to knife crime, adding: \"Politicians focusing on law enforcement are mistaken - you cannot arrest your way out of this.\" She said the root causes of poverty, school exclusion, poor mental health and drugs must be addressed. Javed Khan, chief executive of the charity Barnardo's, said: \"Knife crime is a symptom of a much bigger problem. When young people feel there is little or no possibility of a positive future... they are vulnerable to exploitation and criminality.\" Diana Fawcett from Victim Support, said: \"It's so important to remember that behind these statistics are victims, bereaved families and friends, witnesses and communities who have all been left devastated.\" Data reflects knife crime surge - and police response A close look at the data suggests that, in terms of knives and objects with blades, a record was set in the first three months of 2019 for the number of possession cases dealt with by police and the courts. There were 3,682 offences - the highest quarterly total since the statistics were first compiled in 2007. The figure, which is an estimate because of the time for some cases to be processed in the system, has been above or near the 3,000 mark for three years. It clearly reflects the surge in knife crime, particularly in large cities, as well as increased police action to tackle the problem. For example, in the Metropolitan Police, the number of stop-and-searches has rocketed, from 10,940 in March 2018 to 26,913 a year later. Searches that month led to 514 weapons offences, which may go some way to explaining the record possession figures nationally. The MoJ figures also show: Justice minister Robert Buckland said the government was committed to doing everything in its power to stop knife crime and its devastating consequences. He added the Offensive Weapons Act, which came into effect last month, would make it harder for young people to buy knives and help the police target those most at risk of being drawn into violence. Stabbing victims in 2019 More than 100 people have been fatally stabbed in the UK so far this year.

Another survey has also found a big majority in favour of renewable energy. The poll comes ahead of the Clean Energy Ministerial which will bring ministers from more than 20 nations to London to discuss low-carbon energy. Among various initiatives there, the UK and US are announcing a joint push to develop floating wind turbines. On Thursday, Prime Minister David Cameron will make what is being trailed as his first \"green\" speech since taking office on a pledge to lead the \"greenest government ever\". A recent opinion poll found that only 2% of the public believed the government was living up to that billing. Recent months have seen an escalation in the battle of words in and outside Westminster over wind power. In February, M100 MPs wrote to Mr Cameron asking that wind subsidies be slashed. Newspapers including the Daily Mail have run many articles criticising the technology, US property magnate Donald Trump is campaigning against it in Scotland, and last week saw the launch of a new anti-wind campaign group, National Opposition to Windfarms. But the public appears to be supportive of wind and other renewables. Earlier this month, Ipsos-Mori asked a representative sample of just over 1,000 adults to what extent they favoured wind power. Sixty-six per cent were either \"strongly in favour of\" or \"tended to favour\" the technology, against just 8% who were opposed. Two-thirds also found turbines' impact on the landscape acceptable. '2p per day' Clean energy development is subsidised through the Renewables Obligation, which obliges electricity companies to buy a certain amount of their electricity from renewable sources. The additional cost is passed onto the consumer. According to the regulator Ofgem, the cost of this in 2010-11 amounted to \u00a315.15 per household per year. Just over half - \u00a37.74 - was accounted for by wind power. Ipsos-Mori asked people \"to what extent do you consider this good or poor value for UK energy consumers?\" RenewableUK has just released the responses to this question - 43% thought it was either \"very good\" or \"fairly good\" value, against 18% who found it \"fairly poor\" or \"very poor\". Asked why they approved of wind power, a majority of respondents said it helps curb greenhouse gas emissions, helps tackle climate change, and contributes to the UK's energy security. \"The misleading refrain that wind energy is an expensive burden on the public was disproved by recent figures from Ofgem,\" said Maria McCaffery, Renewable UK's chief executive. \"In fact it adds just 2p per day per household to energy bills through the government's Renewables Obligation. Wind energy is a fantastic investment that brings broad benefits and the public knows it.\" Scottish power However, the price of building offshore wind farms is rising. Companies are constructing ever bigger turbines, which should prove more economic in the long run despite their higher initial costs; and are moving into locations where construction is more difficult, for example in deeper water. Ofgem calculations indicate that the \u00a37.44 annual figure is likely to rise to \u00a312.75 for 2012-13. Further endorsement for renewables came in another poll, this time by YouGov, commissioned by Friends of the Earth. The survey asked a representative sample of 2,884 UK adults which sources of energy they would most like to see providing more electricity in 10 years' time. Sixty-four per cent backed renewables - wind, wave, tidal and solar - while just two per cent wanted a gas-led supply. Support was higher in Scotland, where 88% wanted a future based on renewables. The Scottish government plans to generate all of its electricity from renewables by 2020; and with further capacity due to be added after that date, it is set to become a net exporter of electricity to England. Recent moves by the UK government, however, suggest an expansion of gas-fuelled generation, with generating companies assured that new and existing gas plants will not face limits on CO2 emissions until 2045. Details of Mr Cameron's speech are being kept under wraps, though Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Barker has described it as \"a major policy intervention\". The government has revealed that the UK and US will sign a memorandum of understanding on the joint development of floating wind turbines. A number of prototypes have been built and tested, with Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden among the countries involved. In principle floating machines can access the higher wind speeds found further offshore, but many engineering issues remain to be resolved. The coming week will also see the launch of several reports on clean energy in the UK and globally.

The story that Richard's bones were tipped into the local river at this time was widely believed, but the independent historian found evidence suggesting this was not the case. He also spent years tracing the descendants of Richard's sister, Anne of York, which meant any bones discovered could be positively identified.

Wandsworth, Richmond and Hillingdon councils spent \u00a3300,000 from their general funds on legal action. Windsor and Maidenhead Council spent \u00a350,000 from its development fund. The details were obtained using Freedom of Information laws. Council general funds are where money for most council services is drawn, with funds raised from council tax and central government grants. The four councils failed in an attempt to challenge the decision to build the runway at the High Court in January. Contingency budget London Councils, the body that represents London local authorities, says that by 2020 there will be a budget gap of around \u00a32bn in London local government, which council budgets will have to accommodate. Hillingdon Council has set aside a contingency budget of \u00a3200,000 for possible future legal action against the third runway, while Wandsworth has budgeted \u00a325,000. The case against the runway brought by the councils was struck out by Mr Justice Cranston in January on the basis that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the claim, but further legal action against the runway may take place. John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, questioned whether the councils were making the right spending decisions. \"Those are huge sums of taxpayers' money spent on legal fees which could have otherwise gone towards road maintenance or adult social care,\" he said. \"Given that Hillingdon residents have seen their council tax rise by over 45% in real terms over the last 20 years, the decision to allocate so much money for further action raises serious questions over the council's priorities. \"Many residents may well oppose the third runway, but they are free to form groups to launch legal action themselves.\" 'Wasting time' Stan Woods, a resident of Longford, which will be demolished to make room for the third runway, feels there is little the councils can do to affect the outcome. \"I worked at Heathrow for 38 years, so can see the reason for expansion, but equally wish I could keep my home,\" he said. \"I guess the councils feel they are acting on behalf of their communities, but to be honest this decision will be taken higher up the political ladder.\" Councillor Raymond Puddifoot, leader of Hillingdon Council, said it was time the government stopped \"wasting time and money\" and turned its attention to finding a \"workable alternative\" to Heathrow. \"The government spent more than \u00a33.8 million of taxpayers' money on the expansion of Heathrow Airport in the 18 months between July 2015 and December 2016, and this figure has risen dramatically over the last few months and will continue to do so,\" he said. \"We will continue provide both the funding and the integrity necessary to both defend and represent our residents for however long it takes to win this battle.\"", "output": "Heathrow third runway: Councils spent \u00a3350,000 on legal action", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The regulations will be in force from Thursday 28 May until 18 June, when they will be reviewed. The plan does not affect cross-border travel from Northern Ireland. The Irish government continues to advise Irish citizens and residents against all non-essential international travel, and passengers arriving into Ireland from overseas are asked to self-isolate for 14 days. The form will need to be partially completed by people arriving in Ireland from overseas for onward travel to Northern Ireland. Minister for Health Simon Harris said: \"These are extraordinary measures but they are necessary in a time of a public health crisis. \"We continue to advise everyone against non-essential travel. \"However, if a person does arrive into Ireland, they will legally obliged to fill out this form, regardless of their nationality.\" The restriction will apply to all those arriving into the country at ports and airports. It will be an offence not to fill in a passenger location form. Analysis: Shane Harrison, BBC News NI Dublin correspondent The Irish government's decision to make the completion of passenger forms mandatory was inevitable after it became clear a third of those being asked to fill in forms at Dublin Airport had refused to do so. With the Republic's lockdown restrictions easing and its number of coronavirus cases falling, authorities want to minimise new cases in what they fear will be an inevitable second wave of the virus. But there are complications: How can Dublin enforce the 14-day isolation on people travelling to Northern Ireland? And will the authorities north of the border, where the self-isolation period can be seven days, co-operate? Because of a flaw in the Irish government's emergency legislation, people from Northern Ireland cannot be made to comply with the Republic's Covid-19 travel restrictions. So is there not an incentive for people from the rest of the UK who want to travel to the Republic do so via Northern Ireland? Garda (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris has said people from Northern Ireland have largely respected the laws south of the border. Indeed there is evidence people in tourist-friendly areas don't want visitors until the government allows. The authorities' hope must be that this sense of good citizenship north and south will prevail - especially in a battle against a virus that doesn't recognise borders. The UK government has announced that people arriving in the UK must self-isolate for 14 days from 8 June to help slow the spread of coronavirus. Travellers will need to tell the government where they will quarantine, with enforcement through random spot checks and \u00a31,000 fines in England. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the measure would \"reduce the risk of cases crossing our border\". Lorry drivers, seasonal farm workers, and coronavirus medics will be exempt. The requirement will also not apply to those travelling from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The UK announced new quarantine rules today. Exemptions for road hauliers and medical officials will apply, while the common travel area with Ireland will be unaffected.

Conservative former minister Caroline Nokes, for Romsey and Southampton North, told the Commons her constituent Mr Taylor was trying to prevent what he described as a \"politically-motivated extradition to Monaco\" and deserved protection given his whistleblower status. Speaking afterwards, Ms Nokes said: \"It is setting a really chilling example to future whistleblowers that the government will not step forward. \"I'm very worried for his well-being and it would be far more satisfactory for him to come back to the UK.\" Read more about whistleblowers: Ms Morton told MPs she did not accept the UK was \"abdicating responsibility\" on the matter. \"We understand that the CPS has advised that they have no outstanding case against Mr Taylor and therefore the UK has notified the Croatian authorities that we are not seeking to extradite him,\" she said. The government had also approached the Monegasque Prosecutors' Office to request the details of the charges against Mr Taylor, who was being provided with consular support, said Ms Morton. Following Mr Taylor's evidence SBM Offshore agreed to a $240m (\u00a3186m) settlement with the Dutch authorities. It paid a similar sum to settle a case in the US.

The announcement of the Greener Homes Innovation Scheme followed last week's 2013-14 budget which announced investment in construction, skills and the green economy.

It is claimed that the construction process is faster, waste is reduced and there is less disruption to the environment. In its report, which was based on interviews with staff at 17 companies, Edinburgh Napier University said offsite construction in 2011/12 accounted for 6,000 houses or apartments. It said if market demand was to increase, output could rise to 16,500 homes - even without additional manufacturing premises.

Monetary policy is starting its long journey away from the trillions of pounds of stimulus pumped into the system to keep the economic ship from the rocks. Now, shareholders are beginning to wonder how much of their investments are in companies with strong fundamentals. And how much is simply holding up an asset bubble - frothy prices led ever higher in an era of ultra low interest rates and cheap money. Fingers are hovering over the \"sell\" button. And once investors start looking at their portfolio and selling out of the froth, automatic algorithmic trading tends to \"chase the dip\". Central banks led by the Federal Reserve have been gently tightening - withdrawing stimulus - as concerns grow that inflation is returning. It is the first time there has been such a synchronisation in major central bank policy since the financial crisis. When the Federal Reserve spoke of \"tapering\" in 2014, the Bank of Japan was in full monetary easing mode. When the Fed raised interest rates in December 2015, the European Central Bank cut them further into negative territory. Now the Fed is signalling further interest rate rises. The ECB's quantitative easing programme - the purchasing of bonds - is being reduced. And the Bank of Japan has also slowed its purchasing of long dated bonds. The next move by the Bank of England on interest rates is likely to be up. Make no mistake - we still have monetary policy broadly set for recession despite global economic growth being at its most positive since the financial crisis. Globally, the economic fundamentals are strong and the market falls we have seen come after a record long run of equity highs.

It comes despite fears that shoppers would leave the city because some high street names have closed stores. Experts say the rise could be due to new homes, offices and a university campus being built in the area. According to the council's service plan indicators and targets, footfall for Newport city centre stood at 8,939,472 in the year 2011/2012. That is a rise of 192,638 on the year 2010/2011 and 1,504,633 more than the council predicted for 2011/2012. It follows figures from the National High Street Index which show a 7.6% rise in the number of people in Newport City Centre this June compared to last. According to this study Cardiff saw a 1.6% drop - and Swansea a 4.5% drop. James Urquhart, the co-owner of Total Toys, has moved from a stall in the city's indoor market to a bigger shop on the high street because of the rise in footfall. \"We're seeing a bit of an increase because we're seeing more shops re-opening,\" he said. \"One of the people down town, called Missy, he shut for a while but now he's back. Obviously for him to come back there must be an increase - he was talking about going to Cwmbran, but he's come back to Newport as well\". 'City landscape changing' It is difficult to pinpoint any one reason for the rise in footfall, but some experts believe it may, in part, be down to new housing in the centre, professional services relocating to the city and the new University of Wales Newport campus on the banks of the River Usk. Dr Jonathan Deacon, a reader in Marketing and Entrepreneurship at the University of Wales Newport says the city landscape is changing. He said: \"We have to rethink and redesign what our city centres are all about - and the city centre of Newport has taken a brave step in saying that maybe it's not just about retail, that it's not just about office space - it's about this kind of mixed activity, so dwelling spaces as well as commercial spaces\". The rise in footfall comes after fears that Newport was losing shoppers to other shopping centres in nearby Cardiff and Bristol, along with Cwmbran, where there is an out-of-town retail park. Big high street names, including Marks and Spencer, Next, Burton and Topshop, all shut stores in the city centre last year. But in March it was announced that plans to revamp Newport's shopping centre with the Friars Walk development for John Frost Square had been approved. Work is likely to start on the \u00a3100m development next year to create a new shopping centre and a department store, along with a six-screen cinema, eight restaurants and cafe.

But UKIP would not \"prop up\" a government led by another party unless it offers an \"immediate\" EU referendum. The UKIP leader also claimed his party was now the only \"truly national political party\" in the UK. He dismissed the Conservatives as a \"regional party for the South of England\" and Labour as a similar party for the North. saying UKIP, by contrast, was \"the challenger in virtually every parliamentary seat from Birmingham up to Hadrian's Wall\". He said UKIP was also \"beginning now to dig quite deep into some of the ethnic community vote\". 'Little man' Speaking at a cinema in Canvey Island, Essex, he said UKIP would not engage in \"dirty politics\" as its opponents \"turned nasty\" during the election campaign. Analysis, by political correspondent Robin Brant This was a soft campaign launch but it was an important speech from Nigel Farage. It was heavy on the rhetoric and made no attempt to hide the fact that UKIP is a party tugging at the heart strings, perhaps learning a lesson about the power of emotion from the (ultimately unsuccessful) Yes campaign in Scotland. The word \"believe\" was uttered dozens of times in Mr Farage's short speech; believe in Britain, believe in change. But it was light on weighty policy. Everything mentioned from the podium, in a cinema by the Thames Estuary, has already been announced and it was mostly low level \"retail\" policies, such as ending car park charges in NHS hospitals. Nigel Farage repeated two key things: UKIP won't go into a coalition with any party after 7 May's general election, if it gains more MPs, and their big negotiating demand - their only one - is an \"immediate\" EU referendum. But Suzanne Evans, who is writing the party's manifesto, refused to answer my question about their deficit reduction plan. And on the NHS - an increasingly significant issue for UKIP - Mr Farage wouldn't say if he believed the current way of funding the health service was sustainable.. All he would say was there can't be any cuts. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg are also staging campaign events on Thursday, the final day before Parliament breaks up for a 10-day recess. Mr Farage, who is hoping to be elected to Westminster as MP for South Thanet, went on to suggest that the two largest parties were failing to \"cut through\" to the public. \"Out there, beyond Westminster, the small businessmen, the backbone of the country, have become victims of a modern form of corporatism. \"We are the only party standing up for the little man.\" Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Farage suggests that campaigning this year has been \"incredibly dull so far\", with Labour's focus on the NHS and the Conservatives' prioritisation of the economy \"pretty predictable\". Health service The UKIP leader has said his party's main policies, including leaving the EU, taking all those on the minimum wage out of tax, ditching HS2 and scrapping tuition fees for science, maths, medicine and engineering degrees, have a wide appeal across the country. Addressing UKIP's policy on the NHS, Mr Farage says it would inject \u00a33bn into the health service but would change the way the institution operated, prioritising research and innovation over middle management \"to make it work for those who need it\". His remarks come amid continuing debate in the party over how to meet the rising demand for healthcare at a time of continuing strain on the public finances. Labour accused UKIP of following a Conservative agenda on the NHS and the economy. Shadow Health Minister Jon Trickett said: \"No single speech is going to hide UKIP and Nigel Farage's long-held beliefs on increasing NHS privatisation and further tax breaks for those at the top. \"The truth is UKIP are a party of Tory people, Tory policies and Tory money: they are more Tory than the Tories.\"", "output": "Nigel Farage says other parties 'fear' UKIP", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Among 14 recommendations, it has also called for the re-examination of Wales' 2010 national housing strategy to ensure it is fit for purpose. The Welsh government said it would publish a housing white paper in May. Community Housing Cymru (CHC), which represents not-for-profit housing associations, welcomed the committee's call for an affordable homes building target, adding that at least 8,000 needed to be built by 2015. The committee's recommendations followed an inquiry into the provision of affordable housing. More than 50 people and organisations gave written evidence or appeared before the committee, including housing charities, mortgage lenders and house builders. \"The committee recognises that the Welsh government intends to address some of our concerns in the forthcoming Housing Bill which will be put forward during this assembly,\" said Ann Jones, the committee's chair. \"Our hope is that the findings of this inquiry and the recommendations we have made contribute towards shaping that Bill. \"The barriers hampering the provision of affordable homes in Wales are complex and require the input and co-operation of, among others, governments in Wales and Westminster, local authorities, agencies and construction firms. \"But with clear leadership from the Welsh government in particular, we believe that these barriers can be overcome.\" 'Falling off a cliff' CHC chief executive Nick Bennett said: \"A [house building] target will focus minds and resources and we welcome the committee's recommendation to Welsh government. \"Whilst it won't be possible given public spending cuts and a challenging lending environment to meet the 5,000 homes needed every year according to the Holmans report, we need to do as much as we can to meet the high level of need, need which is likely to grow given the economic downturn and cuts in welfare provision.\" Mr Bennett said as well as delivering much needed homes, the target would assist with creating jobs and training opportunities and boost economic growth. \"The sector has produced around 2,000 new additional houses this year but we will be falling off a cliff unless we can sustain investment over the next three years,\" Mr Bennett added. A Welsh government spokeswoman said it would study the committee's report and respond in due course. She added: \"The Welsh government's white paper on housing, which will set out our action for the housing sector and will include a target number of affordable homes, will be published in May.\" More than 15,000 people sought council help for being homeless in Wales during 2011, up 11% on the previous year, figures obtained by BBC Wales revealed last month.

Her story was closely followed by all of Russia's major media outlets until she was detained near the Turkey-Syria border, flown back to Moscow and handed back to her relieved father, who had initiated the search for his daughter. Thousands of Russian followers Ms Karaulova's case is not unique. Two weeks after her return, Mariam Ismailova, another young woman studying at a well-regarded university in Moscow, went missing amid suspicions that she was also on her way to join IS. Several other students attending universities in large Russian cities are reported to have followed suit. Their fate remains unknown but the considerable media interest in their stories has prompted senior officials to start disclosing figures on just how many Russian nationals are believed to be fighting for IS. Russia's Federal Security Service estimates that Russian passport-holders could account for as many as 8% of IS fighters. \"The numbers are becoming really upsetting,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov said on 7 July. \"There are currently about 2,200 people from Russia taking part in military operations in Iraq and Syria,\" he revealed. Why Russians? According to Alexei Malashenko, from Moscow's Carnegie Centre, Russian is now the third most used language within IS's self-proclaimed caliphate, after Arabic and English. And IS has increased its Russian-language propaganda output over the course of this year. In March, IS began broadcasting its daily Al-Bayan Radio news bulletins online in Russian in a range of formats. In early May, the group released the first edition of a new Russian-language magazine called Furat.Press. Later the same month, IS's multilingual media outlet, HMC, published a more sophisticated Russian-language magazine called Istok (The Source). Many officials and observers agree that IS propaganda has steadily become more effective. They note that at least a few of the Russians leaving the country to join IS come from regions other than Muslim-majority areas in the south. Students and young people are often recruited through social media, and leave Russia with the promise of love, affection and a better life under IS. Followers from all walks of life Many Russians were already familiar with reports of militants from the North Caucasus joining IS. More people are leaving the Muslim-majority southern republic of Dagestan to join IS than any other Russian region, according to Varvara Parkhomenko, an expert at the International Crisis Group. Many of the recruits are from Chechnya as well as from Orthodox Christian North Ossetia, she said. And they come from all walks of life, she pointed out. \"Poor or rich, well-educated or not... people are going not only to battle but to live, to marry, to preach.\" The reports have prompted pundits and officials alike to voice concern about the extent of the IS recruitment network in Russia and the effectiveness of the messages that the group directs at Russian audiences.

The US and Cuba cut formal diplomatic ties more than five decades ago. The talks, which took place in the Cuban capital, were also centred on other topics of mutual interest, including aviation safety, co-operation in counter-narcotics work, protocols on preparing for oil spills, search-and-rescue work, and renewing postal services between the two neighbours.

It was here that he found his way in to comedy, filling in for a club comedian and laying the path for his future fame. His debut on NBC's The Tonight Show in 1963 led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers, and the release of a series of award-winning comedy albums. On one of those, 1968's To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With, he established the themes that would define his work - the father as a loving disciplinarian; siblings who could plot together one minute, then scream blue murder the next; and a confidence in the bonds of family. The album sleeve noted: \"During his time on stage, Cosby never once told a joke. He didn't sing or dance or do tricks. All he did was talk\" - but the performer had the 10,000-strong audience in the palm of his hand throughout. By the time the album was released, Cosby was already a TV star. What boundaries did Cosby break as a black actor? In 1965, he had become the first black actor to star in a drama series, when he was cast in the espionage show I Spy. He played Alexander Scott, an undercover agent posing as a tennis instructor, alongside Robert Culp, who played fellow agent Kelly Robinson. Cosby wasn't originally in line for the role, which was intended for an older actor, but producer Sheldon Leonard had been wowed by the comedian's stand-up routine and decided to rewrite the show as a buddy comedy. Premiering during a time of great upheaval for race relations in the US, it was banned by some stations in the southern states. But Cosby went on to earn three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role - a record that still stands. Despite his prominence on TV, Cosby made a conscious decision not to directly address race relations in his act - preferring a more subtle challenge to the status quo. \"A white person listens to my act, and he laughs, and he thinks: 'Yeah, that's the way I see it, too,'\" he once said. \"OK. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? \"So I figure this way, I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy.\" The Cosby Show, which was launched by NBC in 1984 and aired for eight seasons, was his biggest success and established him as a household name. Based on his stand-up routines, Cosby's portrayal of an educated, affluent doctor - Heathcliff \"Cliff\" Huxtable - and the trials of raising five young children drew parallels with his own life. His TV wife, Claire, was loosely based on his own wife Camille, whom he married in 1964. One of the most popular shows of the 1980s, the sitcom was watched by about 30 million viewers each week. By 1989, its star was earning $4m (\u00a32.5m) a month in syndication rights alone. When the show was cancelled in 1992, Cosby embarked on a number of projects including film roles, but was never able to emulate the success of his star vehicle. In 2013, he received rave reviews for his first TV stand-up show in 30 years, which led to a national tour. But his comeback fell apart as several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault going back almost 30 years. What were the allegations? The accusations first surfaced in 2005, when Andrea Constand, a staff member at Cosby's former university, said she had been drugged and molested by the star at his home a year earlier. Prosecutors declined to press charges, citing lack of evidence, but Ms Constand filed a civil case against the comedian. Thirteen women, 12 of whom remained anonymous, agreed to be witnesses, each with a similar account of sexual assault. Cosby denied the accusations, which his lawyer called \"preposterous\", and the case was settled out of court in 2006 for an undisclosed sum. In subsequent years, some of Ms Constand's fellow witnesses came forward and told their stories to the media. But the accusations were not comprehensively reported until Cosby's planned TV comeback thrust him back into the limelight. More than 50 women accused the star of sexual assault or rape, but due to time limits on cases in the US, only one - Andrea Constand - took the case to criminal court. Cosby's lawyers consistently denied the charges, calling them a \"media frenzy\" and asking why the women had not made legal complaints at the time when they said they were assaulted. In 2014 Cosby said he had not addressed the allegations in public because \"a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos\". But shortly afterwards, previously unseen court papers from 2005 came to light and showed he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to young women he wanted to have sex with. The sedatives, called Quaaludes, render people unable to move. The accusations disrupted his hopes of a return to show business. Cable station TV Land pulled repeats of The Cosby Show, some of his stand-up shows were called off and protesters showed up to the ones that he still put on. His statue was removed from the MGM Hollywood Studios park in Florida, and several colleges removed honorary degrees they had given him. His portraits were taken down from the walls in his alma mater, Temple University in Philadelphia, and he resigned from the board of trustees. What happened when the case came to criminal court? At first, it appeared unlikely that criminal action would be taken against Cosby for any of the alleged incidents, partly because the statute of limitations applies to cases of rape and sexual assault in most US states. That means there is a time limit on cases. However, one case came to criminal trial: that of Andrea Constand. The case was seen as one of the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American football player OJ Simpson in 1995. In June 2017, Ms Constand told her story in court for the first time, having previously been barred from doing so due to a 2006 settlement. She said Cosby had given her pills that he claimed were herbal and said would \"take the edge off\", but which left her \"frozen\". \"In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen\", she said. About 20 minutes later, she said, he put his hand on her genitals. \"I wasn't able to fight it in any way,\" she told the court. \"I wanted it to stop.\" Cosby continued to deny the allegations. He did not give evidence in court but had one witness. In the end, with Cosby possibly facing the rest of his life in prison if found guilty, the jury was deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared in June 2017. How was the retrial different? The retrial, which began on 9 April, took place in a changed atmosphere. A flood of sexual misconduct accusations starting last October against powerful men in the entertainment industry such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey triggered the #MeToo movement. The Cosby trial became one of the first celebrity trials of the #MeToo era, and the decision by the judge to allow five more women to testify against him was seen as a key development. On this occasion, the jury of five women and seven men took two days to find the comedian guilty on all three counts of sexual assault. Months later, he was sentenced to a total of three to 10 years in a state prison. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Possible applications include robots looking after the elderly, rescuing earthquake victims or doing housework. Details are in the journal Nature. We marvel at the robots we see in films: some try to wipe out humanity, such as Ultron in the recent Avengers film, while others like C-3PO in Star Wars are helpful albeit slightly annoying. But they are the still the stuff of science fiction, partly because if the slightest thing goes wrong with a real-life robot it usually stops working altogether. In a step towards making the machines of the movies a reality, French and US researchers have developed a learning algorithm that enables robots to adapt very quickly when they are damaged. Factory and laboratory robots have a strictly pre-defined way of operating. So if a component breaks, it normally has to be replaced for the robot to continue with its task. Most self-learning systems that seek alternative ways of continuing with the task are too slow, because they try out billions of possibilities. Using software that filters out the ineffective strategies, the new system vastly speeds up the process. The team demonstrated the principles with a six-legged, spider-like robot that found a new way of crawling across the floor after one of its legs was broken. They also unveiled a robotic arm that could adapt to a broken joint and learn a new way to drop a ball in a bin. In both instances, the robots were able to learn a new strategy to complete their task in less than a minute. Traditional self-learning systems would have taken days. According to Dr Jeff Clune of the University of Wyoming, the development represents an important first step toward robots that are able to operate independently, outside of the carefully controlled confines of a laboratory or factory floor. \"Having the kind of intelligent robots you see in the movies is much closer than people realise. Our algorithm should in principle work on any kind of robot no matter how complex it is,\" he told BBC News. \"If anyone can get a working C-3PO, our algorithm could help it to deal with unforeseen situations and damage.\" Sampling strategies The new system uses a computer simulation to filter out all the possible solutions that will not work well. It then collects the ones that are both effective and different from each other, so that the robot does not waste time testing out similar strategies. Next, the robot tries out what the simulation predicts will be the best solution. If that fails, it tries out something entirely different. It carries on doing this until it finds a strategy that works. The research points the way to robots that are more robust, adaptable and cheaper to maintain than today's machines, according to senior author Jean-Baptiste Mouret, from Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris. \"If you have robots in your home they would probably be expensive and you would not want them to stop working if a small part breaks,\" he told BBC News. \"Robots are used in factories because they are a controlled environment and nothing unexpected can happen to them. We would like to put these robots outside of factories to help in the outside world, where anything can happen.\" Alongside recent advances in artificial intelligence, such as the self-learning system developed by Google's DeepMind Technologies, this development could see the emergence of new uses for robots. \"The things (DeepMind) is working on are amazing,\" says Dr Clune. \"(Together) we will bring closer a future where robots are helping humans. \"We should be sending robots into Fukushima instead of asking human volunteers to take lethal doses of radiation. Robots should be putting out forest fires so we don't have to risk human lives and they should be used to help us in our homes,\" he said. Home help Among the ideas for household robots are machines for cleaning, cooking, or loading and unloading dishwashers. Most of the development of the system was done by Antoine Cully, a PhD student working with Dr Mouret. He says one of his principal motivations was to help those who are infirm. \"I hope we can have robots that are assistants for the elderly,\" he said. Dr Clune, though, believes this technology could have applications at the other end of the age spectrum. He has very recently become a father, whose newborn child has been keeping him awake into the early hours of the night. He confesses that he has spent the extra sleepless hours pondering \"long and hard\" whether he could use the new system to create a robot that can soothe a crying baby. \"Necessity is the mother of invention, so maybe that will be my next invention,\" he joked. But I was left with the impression that his comments were not entirely in jest.

The analysis of half a million people, published in Scientific Reports, showed early puberty increased the odds of type 2 diabetes by 50%. The researchers said it was \"astonishing\" that puberty was having an impact on health in mid-life. The team at the MRC Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge used data from a huge study of the health of British people - the UK Biobank. The project recorded the age of girls' first period, but a measure of the start of puberty is harder to define in men, so they were asked if they were earlier or later compared to the rest of their peer group. In girls an early puberty was defined as starting between eight and 11, while a late puberty started between 15 and 19. A normal puberty was between nine and 14 in boys. The study showed that early and late puberty was linked to a wide range of health conditions, such as: Hormones have been implicated in some of the conditions, such as cancer, although the researchers admit that they have \"very little idea\" what might contribute to diseases such as asthma. Dr Felix Day told the BBC News website: \"From a biological point of view, it's actually quite fascinating that something that happens when you're a teenager can have an effect on diseases that you wouldn't encounter until middle age. I find that quite astonishing.\" The age of puberty is changing around the world. In the UK it is currently starting about one month earlier every decade. In China it is more than four months earlier every decade. Dr Day said this was \"something people involved in public health should be aware of\". \"The move towards earlier puberty is an added risk factor in terms of development of particularly metabolic diseases.\" However, as the study showed an increased risk for both early and late puberty, there could be a decrease in the incidence of some conditions. He added that because someone had an early or late puberty did not mean they would develop these conditions - it just altered the odds. Dr John Perry, from the MRC Epidemiology Unit, added: \"We are continuing to work to understand how puberty timing impacts later health and how this information may be used alongside efforts to support healthy lifestyle changes and prevent disease. \"It is important to note that the increase in disease risk attributable to puberty timing is still relatively modest and represents one of many factors that contribute to the overall risk of developing disease.\"", "output": "Puberty age affects many diseases, says study", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Simba is the late Mufasa's only son, as the older cat's aggression meant he never successfully mated. Instead, the zoo decided to try to continue his bloodline through the rarely-used process. According to a spokesman, his semen was collected by what the zoo described as \"electro-ejaculation\" for artificial insemination. After that, frail Mufasa - who, at 20, had outlived his wild siblings by six to 10 years - had to be euthanised. The animal was not only old, but also suffering from atrophy. The primary procedure was therefore \"to euthanise Mufasa on humane grounds\", the zoo told the BBC. \"Semen collection while Mufasa was under anaesthesia was a secondary procedure, albeit an important one, to ensure his bloodline continues after his passing.\" Simba however, seems all set to carry on his father's bloodline: at three months, the little cub is apparently thriving. Simba - whose name, like his father's, is a nod to Disney classic The Lion King - was actually born last October, but the zoo waited until now to announce the news. Some feeding issues due to his mother Kayla having inflamed glands meant that Simba was eventually bottle fed but maintained his close connection to the mother. The Wildlife Healthcare and Research Centre in Singapore Zoo said he is \"growing up to be a healthy and inquisitive little lion\", with a particular fondness for a rattan ball he can tussle with. \"He has started to enjoy small amounts of raw meat together with his milk and spends most of his day playing with enrichment devices prepared by his keepers to nurture his development.\" According to the zoo, Mufasa's genes - now passed on to Simba - will be of \"high value in contributing to the genetic diversity and sustainability of African lion populations in zoological institutions\".

But in Scotland, there were about 5,000 lung cancer cases in 2009 compared with some 4,400 cases of breast cancer. The charity called for cigarettes to be sold in plain packs. Jean King, Cancer Research UK's director of tobacco control, said the figures highlighted the deadly impact of tobacco in Scotland. She added: \"The high number of cases reflects the number of smokers from several decades ago when attitudes were different. \"Tobacco advertising hasn't appeared on UK TV since 1965, but that didn't stop the marketing of cigarettes. New, more sophisticated marketing techniques have lured many thousands into starting an addiction that will kill half of all long-term smokers. \"It's vital that the UK closes one of the last remaining loopholes that portrays smoking as something glamorous and safe, rather than the lethal product it truly is. Ending the packet racket and putting all cigarettes in plain packs with large health warnings is key.\" Previous decades Cases of lung cancer mirror smoking rates two to three decades earlier as more than 80% are caused by tobacco, according to the charity. And the differences in lung cancer cases for men and women reflect the smoking patterns in previous decades for each sex. Smoking rates for women in the UK were highest throughout the 1960s, with about 45% women smoking. This has since fallen to 20%. More than 65% of men smoked during World War II and throughout the rest of the 1940s, with lung cancer rates in men peaking around 30 years later in 1979 at nearly 115 men out of every 100,000. Now, 22% of men are smokers. Until the late 1990s, lung cancer was the most common cancer across the UK as a whole.

'Something gives' Sir David is said to have told Oxford's department of politics and international relations: \"We have a whole load of tasks expected of us. \"Our political masters are quite happy to reduce the size of the armed forces but their appetite to exercise influence on the world stage is, quite understandably, the same as it has always been. \"Often politicians say to me 'can you go and do this?'.

Several people including an old woman were injured as crowds threw stones at vehicles and attacked police officers. The Sabarimala temple has historically been closed to women of \"menstruating age\". Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals. But while most Hindu temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, the Sabarimala temple was unusual in that it was one of the few that do not allow women in a broad age group to enter at all. This was overturned by the Supreme Court last month, with judges observing that \"the right to practice religion is available to both men and women\". The temple did open its doors as directed by the court ruling. However, not a single woman was able to enter because of the protesters. 'A mob searching for women' James Clayton, BBC News, Kerala As the day got hotter the protesters got more agitated. They'd gathered around a fork in the road, blocking the road, looking for women of \"menstruating age\". A huge roar would go up if they found someone. Some of the women we saw had to be protected by the police. Cheers would go up as buses and cars turned around. The mob then turned on journalists - seemingly in the belief that they hadn't had a fair hearing in the national press - although the targets appeared to be women. We'd put our cameras down as we had been told it had become dangerous. We saw one female journalist getting attacked. We saw another reporter's car had been smashed. Our own car was hit with bottles. It was an intimidating atmosphere for journalists - one can only imagine what it was like for any women wanting to attend the temple. The protesters also include many women - they have participated in rallies, blocked roads and checked vehicles heading towards the temple to see if they contain women between 10 and 50. Every year, millions of male devotees trek up a steep hill to visit the shrine, which is believed to be about 800 years old. They undertake a rigorous 41-day fast before they begin the pilgrimage. The campaign to allow women into the temple gathered momentum in 2016 after a protest by female students. They were outraged by the Sabarimala temple chief's statement that he would allow women to enter only after a machine was invented to detect if they were \"pure\" - meaning that they weren't menstruating. Nikita Azad, who started the campaign, told the BBC at the time that there was no \"right time\" to go into a temple and that women should have the right to go \"wherever they want to and whenever they want to\". Petitioners who appealed to the Supreme Court to lift the ban said that this custom violated equality guaranteed under India's constitution. They added that it was prejudiced against women and their right to worship. Supporters of the ban argued that the practice had been in effect for centuries, and there was no need to change it now. This is the third religious site in India where women have gained the right to enter through judicial intervention. Courts had earlier directed officials at the Hindu temple Shani Shingapur and the Muslim Haji Ali shrine, both in the western state of Maharashtra, to allow women inside.", "output": "Sabarimala: Mobs attack women near India Hindu temple", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Mark McPherson, director at Homeless Link, said: \"While we don't believe people should be made to feel obliged to make personal donations in order to solve homelessness, this pledge from Andy shows how seriously he takes the issue... \"Ending rough sleeping, however, requires many different solutions and the key will be to ensure that these donations, alongside public money, are used to best effect.\"", "output": "Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham launches homelessness fund", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Her lawyer argues that she is listed as female on her passport and identity card, and considered a woman in every other aspect of her life. Hong Kong's marriage registry has refused her request because her birth certificate still classes her as male. The government has argued that she cannot get married as it would constitute a same-sex marriage, which is not legal in Hong Kong. \"The laws of marriage can and should recognise that sexual identity can change,\" W's lawyer David Pannick said. He added that the issue of same-sex marriage was not relevant to this case, and that W's gender change surgery had been considered medically necessary, and been performed in a public hospital using government funds. 'Societal consensus' W's birth certificate, which cannot be changed under Hong Kong law, still classes her as male. Robert Ribeiro, one of the judges hearing the case on Monday, questioned whether this was an issue that could be resolved through the courts alone. He said the issue may need to be resolved through legislation. W took her case to the Court of Final Appeal after Hong Kong's High Court ruled against her case in 2010. At the time, High Court Judge Andrew Cheung said he saw no evidence to support \"a shifted societal consensus in present-day Hong Kong regarding marriage to encompass a post-operative transsexual\".

Europol said it wanted to highlight that women were just as capable as men of carrying out serious crimes. Although women are perpetrators of serious crimes, statistics show the majority globally are committed by men. A recent study on women in serious crime, commissioned by the British government and published this year, also emphasises that most criminal roles - including senior roles in organised crime groups - are dominated by men. What is in Europol's campaign? Of the 21 fugitives featured on the Crime Has No Gender site, 18 are women and three are men. Each person's gender is left intentionally ambiguous until their mask is removed. Among the criminals is Elena Puzyrevich, who trafficked nine young Russian women into C\u00e1ceres in Spain and forced them into sex work. Another, Angelina Sacjuka, is wanted for beating a young woman to death in Riga, Latvia, five years ago. Claire Georges, a spokeswoman for Europol, said the campaign was an extension of an existing website, EU Most Wanted, launched in 2016. She said the agency aimed to increase its chances of finding the fugitives featured in the campaign. \"We wanted to show that women are just as likely to commit violent crimes as men. Even though the discourse is often around 'male fugitives', women can be just as bad,\" she said. She said the agency asked EU member states to submit their most wanted female fugitives. Three states - the UK, Cyprus and Luxembourg - sent men instead. Are women more responsible for serious crime than we think? Dr Marian Duggan, an expert in gender and criminology at the University of Kent, told the BBC that Europol was right about there being a stereotype casting men as more likely than women to perpetrate serious and organised crime. But the stereotype existed because it was true, she said. \"Obviously all crimes can be committed of anybody of any gender,\" Dr Duggan said. \"But while some women do commit serious crimes, they do so far less frequently than men.\" Dr Duggan said gender stereotypes were often exploited by organised criminal groups when carrying out large-scale crimes. Many of the women in Europol's campaign, for example, have been accused or convicted of sex and drugs trafficking - roles in which Dr Duggan said women \"can prove quite useful\" to criminal bosses, but where they very rarely act alone. \"For human trafficking, there's a false sense of security with women, so they might be used to gain the trust or compliance of victims,\" she said. \"With drugs trafficking, we tend to see women used as decoys or to facilitate the movement of drugs - but not in the very high or powerful roles.\" Equating these crimes to those of the male fugitives listed by Europol, many of whom are wanted for murder, was \"disingenuous\", Dr Duggan said. \"I wouldn't see it as equitable,\" she said. \"I think (the campaign) will probably be very popular... but I don't think it will shift the narrative to 'women are as criminal as men' because I think most people know that to not be true.\"", "output": "New Europol campaign reveals 'most wanted' women fugitives", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Mr Dutton told 2GB radio some asylum seekers were using \"blackmail\" to come to Australia. Australia had given A$26m ($19m; \u00a326m) to Nauru's hospital for the treatment on the Pacific island, he said. A Somali woman who became pregnant after allegedly being raped on Nauru arrived in Australia earlier this week. The woman, 23, had been asking for weeks to be transferred from Nauru, part of Australia's offshore network housing people seeking asylum, to Australia so she could have an abortion. Abortion is illegal in the tiny island nation of Nauru, except where the mother's life is at risk. 'Firm stance' In Thursday's interview, Mr Dutton said the Australian government would not \"be taken for mugs\". \"The racket that's been going here is that people at the margins come to Australia from Nauru... We can't send them back to Nauru and there are over 200 people in that category.\" Mr Dutton said asylum seekers could be sent to an international hospital in Papua New Guinea if sufficient medical care on Nauru was not available. He said Canberra had provided A$11m for that hospital. \"If people believe that they're going to somehow try and blackmail us into an outcome to come to Australia by saying we're not going to have medical assistance and therefore we put our babies at risk - that's a judgement for people to make... But we're not going to bend to that pressure. \"I believe very strongly that we need to take a firm stance, provide the medical support that's required, but if people think they're going to force our hand to come to Australia - that is not going to happen.\" The Refugee Action Coalition group earlier expressed concerns for seven pregnant women, saying Nauru was not equipped to deal with complicated births, Australia's ABC broadcaster reports. Under Australia's tough asylum policy, any irregular migrants trying to reach the country by boat are intercepted and held in centres on Nauru and Manus Island, Papua New Guinea.

The libel case focused attention on the freedom of Ecuador's media. \"I've decided to... pardon the accused and grant them remission of the sentences they rightly received,\" Mr Correa said in his statement. The three owners of El Universo - brothers Carlos, Cesar and Nicolas Perez - and columnist Emilio Palacio were found guilty of libelling the president. They were each given three-year prison terms and had multi-million dollar damages and fines awarded against them. Mr Correa brought the lawsuit after an article in El Universo questioned an army raid to rescue him from a violent protest by striking police officers in September 2010.

Fabricio Correa has repeatedly said they were the result of public tenders. President Correa, in office since 2007, has long been at odds with the country's media.

Other major councils including Glasgow, Aberdeen, South Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire have already said they plan to leave Cosla in 2015. A row over how Cosla takes decisions is at the root of the dispute. The motion to be discussed at West Dunbartonshire Council next week states: \"Council notes that a number of Scottish council's have already served notice to quit Cosla with effect financial year 2015/16.

Glasgow, South Lanarkshire, Inverclyde, Renfrewshire, West Lothian, Aberdeen and Dumfries and Galloway councils have already given notice. If all the councils which are currently threatening to leave Cosla do go, it could seriously weaken the organisation and have consequences for local government across Scotland.

It also looks after national negotiations on pay. Some Labour councillors feel that Cosla has not stood up for them against government policies - a charge the organisation denies.

It comes as competition increases from rivals such as Walt Disney and Apple. The company, behind such hits at The Crown and Orange is the New Black, said in its statement: \"We don't believe competition was a factor since there wasn't a material change in the competitive landscape during [the second quarter] and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions,\" the company said.

Bridgewater, who was appointed CBE this week, shares her top 10 tips for being a successful designer. 1. Get a job Try and get a job in any capacity in a creative company that interests you. I did that for 18 months and what I learned during that time was kind of everything. That opportunity to be inside a creative company, see what's happening, feel the excitement of it, straight out of college, that's the best possible thing you can do. And don't hang around. I personally think you should be paid for it, but it doesn't matter how menial a capacity you are employed. Take any job at any price in order to get into a company that interests you. I knew I was going to be successful. When I first had the idea, I didn't know anything about the ceramics industry, so I came to Stoke-on-Trent in a haze of utter ignorance, but with conviction. I walked around and I could see very definitely that this great big Victorian factory was going to be making nothing but Emma Bridgewater designs one day. I do have a feeling that in your work, as with the whole of your life, if you can imagine the solution you want, that's half the job. But without it, you won't probably get anywhere much. I started off with just four shapes. A mug, exactly like the one I am drinking from now, a bowl, a milk jug and a dish. My \"polka dot\" and \"hearts\" designs are both really good examples of designs that are almost incidental. These nice, simple, pleasing shapes were a very good way of making a pattern that wasn't too \"patterny\". People have got to be feeling committed to the idea of decoration to buy roses and jolly animals and things. With spots you can just kind of sneak by someone, it's a pattern that doesn't daunt. I'm completely dedicated to the traditions of making pottery in this country. So the way we do it dominates what our range of pottery looks like. Inspiration is all around - from books that Matthew and I buy, to antique shops and flea markets, to the sort of hinterland of my upbringing. When you've got an idea, when you've got the shapes and the colours, there is a very nice thing that happens organically. There's a sort of hum that you build up that makes the genesis of new designs possible. It makes a fertile ground for new designs to pop up in. It's vital to keep having new ideas. Don't set out to do something that you are not absolutely passionate about because, to get through the hard work of it, you have got to feel passionate and I think probably for me, a big saviour has been the cause of Stoke. I think at times, if it had just been about making money, I probably would have seriously doubted my intention to carry on. Whereas the feeling of caring about the industry and the city and the people who work here and their skills, the passion for that has been a great driver. I think to try and sell widgets all your life would probably be terrible, you've got to love it! I read English at University and pretty much thought I was going to go into publishing. Maybe as a literary agent, something like that. Then after I graduated, I had a clear idea in my head that I was going to start my own company. It was going to be fun, but it was going to be orderly and it was going to make money. My cousin and I were making canapes for people's drinks parties. We didn't kill anyone, astonishingly, and I was sleeping on her sofa. It was all very uncertain and then I had a wonderful, wonderful moment in a china shop when I was trying to buy Mum a birthday present. It struck me absolutely, straight between the eyes, that there was a great big yawning gap where the right pottery for her way of life should be. It's strange, isn't it? But I just knew it was going to work. It's completely vital to have a good name for your brand. I think it's a very simple and single issue: If the company bears your name, there is a connection. You can embody the brand in a very direct way and I think Cath Kidston shows that in the most extemporary fashion. People get where they get by all sorts of different roads but I don't know many successful people who take lots of holidays. For years and years, Matthew and I and the children only ever took two or three days off at a time. There is no point dressing it up, it is blindingly hard work and if that seems daunting it isn't worth doing. I find it quite hard to switch off. If I'm on my own, I make a very conscious effort to listen to music or a play or an audio book rather than spend the whole time on the telephone. It's vital to have a nice home to escape to. I work with my husband. For a lot of people the very idea of it is the third circle of hell, but it's worked for us. There's plenty of scrapping but we tend to have found that very productive. I'm sure our children would say it's been a nightmare! My family have been a huge influence. You do it for your family and then frankly you feel tremendously guilty that the work you're doing, for their benefit, means that you're never there. Matthew's parents have been massively involved, they've done a huge amount, more school concerts and school runs than me. There's a sort of inherent uneasy dynamic for most working women, I think, which I don't have a secret answer to. Compromise is all there is... and common sense. I feel constantly dissatisfied with things I haven't done, rather than pleased with the things that I have. If people ask me whether I regret how hard I've worked its always \"yes, no, yes, no, yes, no!\" The answer I always end up giving is \"no\". Like most working women, I think, I probably spend a lot of time on that particular guilt treadmill. But when you step away from it and think about making jobs in an industry that has taken the most appalling knocks; and think about making lovely things that people really, really enjoy giving to each other - those are important things and I think the children do all inherently understand that and think that it is a good thing, too.

Mr Price made several proposals for a \"vibrant, confident, successful nation\" to be achieved by 2030. He also called Wales \"a wealthy country whose people live in poverty\". Mr Price, AM for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said the party will \"tackle the myth\" Wales is a poor nation by claiming, in terms of per capita income, it is richer than \"every nation in Asia bar two, every nation in the Americas bar two, and richer than more than half of Europe\". Under the pledge, if elected, Plaid Cymru would establish a Wales national carrier with direct connections to the Americas and mainland Europe, create a national energy grid, set up a national housing company and provide free university education for Welsh students. A referendum on Wales' constitutional future would be held at the end of the second term of a Plaid government, which Mr Price said would \"ask this coming generation where they want Wales to be mid-century and will include independence as a realistic option\", he said. \"Are you ready to add your voice to that greatest of all causes?\" Mr Price asked party members, as he rounded off the closing speech of the conference. \"To liberate this nation from poverty, from sickness, from ignorance and timidity. \"Are you with us? Then let the work begin.\" Speaking at the spring conference on Friday, party leader Leanne Wood said Plaid Cymru members needed to stand \"shoulder to shoulder\" in order to dislodge Labour. She said hers was the only party that could offer an alternative Welsh government, following a call from two Plaid MPs to reposition the party in the centre and to be open to working with the Tories. Speaking to BBC Wales on Saturday, Ms Wood said: \"The centre in Wales is Welsh Labour and that place is filled, you could argue.\"", "output": "Plaid Cymru 'would hold Wales independence referendum'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The scientists blame the problem on rising sea temperatures. The research, published in journal Nature on Thursday, was carried out by a group of scientists last year. It measured how many adult corals along the reef had survived following the mass bleaching events, and the number of new corals that had been produced. \"Across the length of the Great Barrier Reef, there was an average 90% decline from historical [1990s] levels of recruitment,\" co-author Prof Andrew Baird told the BBC. The study highlights the link between coral vulnerability and rising sea temperatures resulting from sustained global warming, and recommends increased international action to reduce carbon emissions. Coral bleaching is caused by rising temperatures and occurs when corals under stress drive out the algae - known as zooxanthellae - that give them colour. If normal conditions return, the corals can recover. But it can take decades, and if the stress continues the corals can die. 'Nothing left to replenish the reef' Prof Baird said the \"pretty extraordinary\" decline was unexpected. It was most likely the reef's first re-growth problem on a mass scale, he added. \"Babies can travel over vast distances, and if one reef is knocked out, there are usually plenty of adults in another reef to provide juveniles,\" Prof Baird said. However, the bleaching in 2016 and 2017 affected a 1,500km (900 miles) stretch of the reef. \"Now, the scale of mortality is such that there's nothing left to replenish the reef,\" Prof Baird said. The study also found that the mix of baby coral species had changed. It found a 93% drop in Acropora, a species which typically dominates a healthy reef and provides habitats for thousands of other species. The researchers said coral replenishment could recover over the next five to 10 years if there were no future bleaching events. However, given current estimates, this likelihood was \"almost inconceivable\", said Prof Baird. \"We've gotten to the point now where local solutions for the reef are almost pointless - the only thing that matters is action on climate change,\" Prof Baird said. The reef - a vast collection of thousands of smaller coral reefs stretching from the northern tip of Queensland to the state's southern city of Bundaberg - was given World Heritage status in 1981. The UN says it is the \"most biodiverse\" of all the World Heritage sites, and of \"enormous scientific and intrinsic importance\".", "output": "Great Barrier Reef: Mass decline in 'coral babies', scientists say", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The 26-year-old woman had used the Uber smartphone app to book a taxi home on Friday night but said she was taken to a secluded area and raped. Although the driver has not yet given a statement, police say he has confessed to the crime. \"Following the incident of a heinous crime... the government of Delhi has banned Uber to provide any transport related service in Delhi,\" the home ministry said in a message to state governments around the country. All internet-based taxi services which are not licensed with the government are also prohibited from operating until they get registered, the letter says, adding that all other states and federally-administered union territories are advised to do the same. In an order issued late on Monday, the Delhi government said only six registered radio taxi companies were being allowed to continue to operate in the capital. \"All other transport/ taxi service providers through web-based technology, who are not recognised, are prohibited from providing such services... till they get licence/permission from the transport department,\" S Roy Biswas, Delhi's deputy commissioner of transport, said. Media reports said the ban could hit a number of taxi services in the city, and thousands of drivers would be out of work. A BBC correspondent in Delhi says Uber is still accepting bookings on its app and it is not yet clear how the ban will be enforced since Uber taxis do not carry any visible branding. Uber has not yet commented on the ban. On Monday, the company described the incident as \"horrific\" and said it would do everything \"to help bring this perpetrator to justice\".

The survey of 1,006 parents by Chance to Shine cricket charity marks 100 days since the end of London 2012. The government said it was investing \u00a31bn over the next five years. One of the key parts of the London Olympic bid was inspiring the athletes of the future. The Chance to Shine survey found 54% of pupils had been inspired to take up a new sport as a result of the Olympics. However, eight out of parents said their children were playing the same amount of sport or less during school hours following the Games and its results suggested many pupils do less than the recommended two hours of sport a week. 'Aspiration' It also found that 54% of the parents five to 16-year-olds polled said their children played less than two hours of games or PE in school a week. In Sheffield, the home of gold medal-winning heptathlete Jessica Ennis, 60% of parents say their children do less than the stipulated two hours a week. Rules requiring schools to report on whether they had met that target were scrapped by Education Secretary Michael Gove in 2010. The Department for Education said at the time it was an unenforceable aspiration. However, Mr Gove told schools at the time he expected them to maintain their current levels of PE and sport. When parents in the survey were asked what the biggest challenges facing schools trying to increase the amount of sport their pupils play, 42% of parents blamed time pressures of the curriculum. A third of parents blamed a lack of facilities and 29% blamed a lack of funding for school sports. 'Inspired' Wasim Khan, chief executive of Chance to Shine, which runs cricketing schemes in 6,500 schools in the UK, said: \"The fact that parents are saying that their children are doing less than two hours of school sport a week is a concern. \"We want young people to do as much physical activity as possible in and out of school - whether it's cricket, athletics or another sport - to help them lead active, healthy lives. \"Parents are saying that many of their children were inspired by the Olympic Games to play more or to try a new sport. \"We owe it to those children to ensure we have the right infrastructure to make it a reality.\" Olympic legacy? A message on the youth legacy section of the London 2012 website says: \"Since it won the bid to host the Games, London 2012 has worked closely with partners and stakeholders on activation programmes to promote sports participation in the run-up to, during and after the Games. \"For example, 14,000 schools and more than five million young people took part in the 2012 National School Sports Week sponsored by Lloyds TSB.\" General secretary of the National Union of Teachers, Christine Blower, said the Olympic Legacy was alive and well and being nurtured by our PE teachers. \"Many NUT members are involved in sports clubs of all kinds both during and outside of school. \"Think how much more, though, could be done if the government hadn't all but scrapped the Schools Sports Partnership and presided over the sell-off of playing fields. \"Teachers want to see an Olympic legacy.

Apart from a month in 2019 when MP Mike Hill was briefly suspended from the party, it has been red since 1964. But, in 2004, former cabinet minister and key architect of New Labour Peter Mandelson put his comfortable majority up for grabs when he quit as the town's representative to become European Commissioner. No fewer than 14 candidates signed up for the resulting by-election. One of them was Dick Rodgers, a doctor and ordained priest and the Common Good Party's only candidate. He does not stand in elections to win, he says, but to share ideas. Which is just as well. He's lost in European, parliamentary and local elections in Peterborough, Newark, Henley, Dunfermline and West Fife and the West Midlands, where he lives. Distance from home is clearly not an issue though \"Hartlepool is rather a long way away,\" he says. He rode up on his Honda C90 Cub - he likes motorbikes; \"little ones, that are economical\" - and pitched his tent on a campsite in Crimdon for the duration of the campaign. \"It makes me feel like the SAS, inserting myself into the centre of things, quietly,\" he says. He was happy living in a tent - it was warm and cheap - but he found Hartlepool could be challenging. \"I think it was difficult to get a rapport, quite honestly,\" he says. \"I found it quite difficult to get through, to really have a heart to heart with people on the doorsteps.\" He also found he couldn't get around all that many houses by himself, and resorted to standing in the town centre with a placard. But he remembers when door-knocking nearly got the better of the Liberal Democrat candidate, Jody Dunn. She was noted up to this point for her \"charisma\" and ability to charm even staunch Conservative voters, but the family law barrister was to say something she would come to regret. In her campaign blog - something so innovative back then it was still referred to as a weblog - she described a night of pouring rain and difficult door-knocking. \"We'd picked what appeared at first to be a fairly standard row of houses,\" she wrote. \"As time went on, however, we began to realise that everyone we met was either drunk, flanked by an angry dog or undressed; and in some cases two or more of the above.\" It was a gift for her Labour opponents which, in her words, they \"milked\". Immediately her tongue-in-cheek description of one street was taken as her opinion of the town's population in general. Labour hired a double-decker bus and followed her around town with it. \"As I walked with volunteers they would follow me in the bus with loud speakers repeating the words that I'd said as though I had deliberately insulted people,\" she says. She'd meant no disrespect with her \"clumsy words\", she says, but accepts it was naive not to anticipate the consequences, and that arguing context makes little difference in politics. \"I absolutely regret giving them that sort of material but it was never said with any ill intent whatsoever,\" she says. 'Just cried' She came so close to winning - reducing Labour's majority from 14,571 to 2,033 - that she clearly has considered the possibility her blog lost her the election. \"I don't know whether the result would have been different,\" she says. But it feels like she does. The campaign was as dirty as any and her closet was thoroughly searched for skeletons. Some newspapers accused her of being soft on drugs and asked if she had been \"involved in some kind of orgy in the back of a van\" at a party conference. \"You felt like you were looking over your shoulder the whole time,\" she says. \"It did feel hard. There were times when I came home after a day of doing my best and just cried.\" And then, on the night of the count, just as she started thanking her volunteers and the voters who had given her a \"really warm welcome\", Fathers 4 Justice candidate Paul Watson stepped forward and tipped purple powder over her head and shoulders. \"I wasn't sure what had been thrown at me but I knew something had,\" she says. \"I represented something about the country that he hated. \"That made me really sad, that it had to finish on that note and I wasn't really able to say thank you in the way that I'd hoped.\" Analysis By Jonathan Swingler, BBC Look North This was the first election I covered after finishing my journalism course and my tutors had never covered the scenario of one candidate attacking another. It was surreal to hear shouting and see Paul Watson, who represented Fathers 4 Justice, pour purple powder over the Liberal Democrat candidate Jody Dunn. Having seemingly been targeted because of her profession, she carried out her media interviews that night with a smudged purple forehead and told me: \"I've had better days.\" Watson was taken away by police and later pleaded guilty to assault. I was living in Hartlepool at the time and the town had been turned into a colourful mix of placards as 14 candidates vied for votes. A turnout of just under 46% reflected a general antipathy to their efforts. Labour held on to what had previously been a safe seat but saw their 14,571 majority plummet to just over 2,000. At the end of the night I asked one of their supporters what he thought. \"It was crap,\" he muttered as he looked at a mic stand covered in purple glitter. The campaign was more fun for Monster Raving Loony Party leader Alan \"Howling Laud\" Hope. \"I thoroughly enjoyed it,\" he says. He particularly remembers fellow candidate Ronnie Carroll - the only singer to have represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest two years running. \"We ended up on stage and, when it came to our turn to say something, we both sang Danny Boy,\" Mr Hope says. Impromptu music should not have surprised anyone, given the party's campaign pledge to set up an inquiry to find out \"if the Hokey Cokey is really what it's all about\". That \"went down really well\", Mr Hope says. Well enough to persuade 80 people in the town to vote for him. He lost his deposit - as usual - but he didn't come last. Mr Hope met one fan in a town pub who was so supportive he offered transport. \"I tell you what, he said, I can get hold of a fire engine - do you want to use it as a campaign bus?\". As a man who once campaigned to incorporate the rules of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in driving tests, he was clearly never going to turn down an offer like that. For the next few weeks they drove it around town transmitting party slogans via a loud hailer. In the end, Labour came very close to losing. Jody Dunn polled more votes than any Liberal Democrat before or since - except herself in the following year's general election - knocking the Conservatives into fourth place behind UKIP. She had slashed Labour's majority and another 10 days \"might have just tipped it\", she says. She believes her party gave up on Hartlepool and moved on, missing the opportunity to capitalise on her gains eight months later. \"They'd come in for the by-election and there was a huge presence everywhere,\" she says. \"We only had a handful of volunteers for the general election. \"It just felt to me as though the Liberal Democrats thought 'well, we had our shot, it was a by-election, we had publicity for that, we're not going to get the same, we're just one of many constituencies in the general election, so let's concentrate on our marginals'. I don't think they quite realised that we had made that seat a marginal. It was probably a one-off in history but it was a marginal then.\" There are a lot of eyes on Hartlepool again now. Dr Rodgers believes the country needs to pay more attention to the North. \"The North matters and rather cut-off parts of the North, like Hartlepool, do matter,\" he says.

My dad made it home, but it could be said that what he suffered in the aftermath, eventually went on to lay him to rest 13 years ago. Today in Aberdeen a volume of documents were published pulling together decades of knowledge in a bid to avoid a repeat of Piper Alpha disaster. Had my dad been alive, he would be as adamant as he always was that the contributions of the oil and gas industry to the Scottish economy and the industry's shareholders do not compare to the massive contribution of the men and women who work on the installations. Their lives matter. He believed in creating a safe working environment, no excessive working hours, and a compassionate management. When you put into perspective what happened that night - which saw the deaths 167 men - nobody should have survived, but 61 did, including my dad. Lord Cullen chaired the inquiry into the disaster and I spoke to him nearly three decades on. He said he hoped the offshore workforce could feel free to voice any fears. The judge's report, following a 13-month inquiry, led to massive changes in offshore safety. He told me: \"The disaster was a huge shock for the industry, things were never the same afterwards, when oil prices have gone down, when installations are aging, and so on and so on, these are huge challenges and companies have got to keep the balance right between safety and make sure that it never slips.\" I asked Lord Cullen if he was worried people might fear raising concerns over safety in the oil industry. \"I jolly-well hope not\" was his simple reply. He added: \"It's been a repeated worry from time to time. \"What I hear are reassuring messages, but I cannot say that there aren't instances of not wanted (back), but I hope it's not happening anymore.\" 'Not wanted back' is an unofficial term when workers say they have been blacklisted. Before the disaster, maintenance and upgrading work had been under way but Piper Alpha had been continuing to produce oil. That fateful night resulted in a blazing inferno in the icy, yet scalding depths, of the North Sea. For many, its aftermath is a trauma that will never leave. The lost and broken lives that resulted from the Piper Alpha disaster should never be taken in vain by any employers involved in the North Sea oil and gas industry. At the 10th anniversary service, my Dad recited a poem, by Birago Diop, that will always marry so respectfully with those who perished. \"Those who are dead are never gone; they are there in the flickering shadow.\"", "output": "My dad survived the Piper Alpha disaster", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

But, as a family, they sign up to a scheme in Dorset that allows them to get on court all year round for \u00a330. \"It is really accessible here. It means we can come to play here as much or as little as we want,\" says Rebecca, a 37-year-old clinical psychologist. Charlie says he does not ask for the most expensive equipment, but maybe he will in time. \"There is always pressure,\" says Rebecca. \"But at the moment he has got his racquet and that is all he needs.\" Play in the park For two weeks each year, Wimbledon serves up a feast of big hitters, big personalities and big winners' cheques. But for the other 50 weeks, the sport's authorities in the UK are trying to promote the concept of \"anyone for tennis\". The Dorset scheme, called Tennis in the Park, is one programme aimed at dispelling the image of tennis as elitist. Others are in place up and down the country, aimed at allowing people to get out to play even if their household budget is squeezed. In Sheffield, the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) is running Mini Tennis sessions, which cost \u00a35 for a family of four. There are cardio and coaching sessions in Manchester that cost \u00a31.50 for children and \u00a33 for adults, so people can get fit with a racquet in their hands. Across the South East of England, people who have never played before can get involved in beginner games every weekend for \u00a33 per family. They get a free tube of tennis balls on their first visit. Other LTA projects are in place across England, Scotland and Wales. Saving tips It is not just access to the courts that can cost money. However, Simon Johnson, operations manager for the LTA in the South West region, says that there are other moneysaving tips to keep costs down, especially for those playing for the first time. They include: \"It is not just for the rich and famous. It is one of those sports that mum and dad can play with their kids,\" he says. Tennis is one sport hoping to attract new players and greater participation as a result of the success of the London 2012 Olympics. Sport England's figures, compiled twice a year, showed that 4,000 more people play tennis once a week than did so a year ago. That put it sixth on the participation list in the Active People Survey, with 424,300 people playing. Swimming is top of the chart. However, this comes after a few years in which participation levels fell. Sport England withheld some funding from the tennis authorities last December, saying it would only release the money if participation increased. Involved in coaching Southbourne in Dorset is among the tennis clubs hoping to benefit from a renewed interest in the game after Wimbledon. Chairman Keith Mitchell says that all that is needed to get started is a pair of trainers. His club is involved in coaching for schoolchildren, players who have learning difficulties, and wheelchair tennis. About 150 adults have signed up to the club's membership for \u00a33.75 a week, and 120 children are on the club's books too. They hope that finding the next young star to break into the big time does not have to break the bank too.", "output": "Can you play tennis on a budget?", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

For that price, you could buy a house in the UK (where the average dwelling costs \u00a3223,285, according to the Halifax) and still have plenty left over. Yet astonishingly last year someone did pay that amount of money for a rare 2014 Himalaya Birkin - a matte white handbag by Hermes. You may also like: It was fashioned from Nilo crocodile hide and adorned with 18-carat white gold and diamond-encrusted details. While \u00a3279,000 is a record breaking price tag for this \"holy grail\" of handbags, it is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the increasingly lucrative market for buying and selling pre-owned luxury \"arm furniture\". High-end bags have come a long way from the days when Princess Grace of Monaco used an Hermes Sac a depeches to hide her growing baby bump from the paparazzi. It was subsequently renamed the Kelly bag after the former Hollywood star. Expensive handbags are now ubiquitous among celebrities such as reality TV personalities Kim Kardashian West and her mother Kris Jenner. However, these bags are no frivolous trinkets. Auction house Christie's says the global pre-owned luxury handbag market has jumped from being worth \u00a35.1m in 2011 to \u00a326m in 2016. Heritage Auctions believes that the worldwide secondary auction market for the \"ultra high-end bags\" is between $75m and $100m \"and growing\". In investment terms, these assets can offer a huge return on your cash. Investment bank Jefferies reckons that some bags can generate returns of about 30% a year. Handbags made by Hermes, the French luxury goods house, are the most sought-after. Rachel Koffsky, a specialist in handbags and accessories at Christie's, says Hermes handbags \"have been crafted in the same way, in the same materials for decades, whereas many other brands have been inconsistent in production over the past 100 years\". She adds that the three best-known bags - the Kelly, the Birkin, made for the singer and actress Jane Birkin, and the Constance, named after the fifth child of Hermes designer Catherine Chaillet - \"have remained virtually unchanged since they were designed\". However, Jefferies says: \"Over the past 10 to 20 years, luxury brands have increasingly been able to raise the prices of their handbags and use more premium materials so in the future the top of the market is likely to become less dominated by Herm\u00e8s.\" Heritage Auctions says that as well as Hermes, Chanel's iconic flap bags \"are always favourites for the paparazzi to catch on the celebrity arms of the world's most famous\". Ms Koffsky adds that, in the 1990s, two designers in particular were responsible for ushering in the \"era of the It-bag\" - Tom Ford at Gucci and Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton. These, along with the characters in the TV series Sex and the City, \"brought collectable handbags into the mainstream\". It also means that the somewhat intimidating world of auction houses is opening up to a different kind of clientele. Ms Koffsky says: \"Handbags have a very wide appeal and is a category most consumers are more comfortable with when compared to traditional flat or even decorative art.\" Jefferies says that handbags are the \"most accessible category\" at Christie's because of the lower cost of the lots, adding that 40% of the 712 buyers in that category were new to the auction house. Heritage Auctions says that there is no typical buyer. They can range from people who want to add to their existing handbag collection - or those who would like to start one. Ms Koffsky says quite often buyers become sellers and vice versa. She says: \"At the top end of the buyer spectrum, we have collectors who count their handbags among their most valuable assets. On the other end, we have young and savvy shoppers looking for a vintage piece that will stand out from current trends, oftentimes it is significantly less than retail. \"Perhaps it is their first time buying at auction.\" However, while handbags have attracted a new clientele, it isn't a world open to everyone. A new Kelly or Birkin bag can cost about \u00a37,000 each - if you can get your hands on one - while a new Chanel classic mini flap bag costs $3,300 (\u00a32,392). Choosing a second-hand bag may snag a buyer a bargain but these are not accessories within everyone's grasp. Flavio Cereda, an analyst at Jefferies, says that Hong Kong has become a hot spot for high-end handbags. Forbes recently reported that the combined wealth of Hong Kong's billionaires soared by $60bn to $307bn last year - the biggest rise for a Forbes Asia 50 list. Christie's said 46% of its luxury handbag auction sales were in Asia in 2017, followed by the US at 30% while Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for 24%. It is no coincidence that those two rare Himalaya Birkins bags were auctioned in Hong Kong. These are the type of handbags that make good investments, says Ms Koffsky. \"For a positive return on investment, numbered and limited edition pieces will stand out as they are only created in a very limited run,\" she says. \"The less pieces exist on the secondary market, the more that a collector will spend to get a hold of it.\"", "output": "The handbag that costs as much as a house", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

It is being demolished and reconstructed as part of the continued electrification of the Midland Main Line to Kettering and Corby. A spokesman for Network Rail said it would be a \"challenge\" but would improve passenger journeys. The road will reopen on 18 April, but will close completely at a later date to allow the height of the bridge to be increased so overhead power lines can pass underneath. Dr Barry Monk from Bedford said: \"It will cause major disruption, it will be absolute mayhem. \"The electrification could be absolutely fantastic but it better be jolly good indeed to make up for the misery people are about to be put through.\" Bill Bruster, who lives near the bridge, said: \"There's no way round it, they have to rebuild the bridge. As much as it's an inconvenience, I can't see anyway round it.\" However, local resident Ken Tyso said the \"essential work needs to be done\", but said one of the answers was to use the town's bypass and avoid the area. Underground services running through the bridge will be taken away and moved, before it is demolished and rebuilt. A temporary footbridge will be built for pedestrians and cyclists. Network Rail has not said how long the work will take, but says it will be completed by 2020. A spokesman said: \"It is a major artery into the town so it was always going to be a challenge for us\".

Also, outlets that sell electrical goods; do key cutting; undertake shoe repairs, plus garden centres and plant nurseries can continue the collect service. For qualifying businesses, staggered appointments will need to be offered to avoid any potential for queuing, and access inside premises for collection will not be permitted. 2. Takeaway services Customers in Scotland will no longer be allowed to go inside to collect takeaway food or coffee. Businesses will have to operate from a serving hatch or doorway. The aim is to reduce the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff. 3. Alcohol consumption It will be against the law in all level four areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public. This will mean that buying a takeaway pint and consuming on the street will not be permitted. It is intended to underline the message that people should only be leaving home for essential purposes. 4. Working from home The Scottish government is strengthening the obligation on employers to allow their staff to work from home whenever possible. The law already says that people should only be leaving home to go to work if it is work that cannot be done from home. This is a legal obligation that falls on individuals. However, statutory guidance is being introduced to make clear that employers should support employees to work from home wherever possible. 5. Home maintenance The Scottish government is strengthening provisions in relation to work inside people's houses. Current guidance says that in level four areas work is only permitted within a private dwelling if it is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household. This guidance is now being put into law. 6. Stay at home message The final change is an amendment to the regulations requiring people to stay at home. This is intended to close an apparent loophole rather than change the spirit of the law. It will also bring the wording of the stay at home regulations in Scotland into line with the other UK nations. Currently the law states that people can only leave home for an essential purpose.

The winning candidates are set to hold positions in the European Parliament for the next five years. As MEPs, they will have the power to approve, amend or reject EU legislation, meaning their votes will affect policies on almost everything, from migration to the environment. Here are some of the politicians to look out for: Silvio Berlusconi: Controversial Italian veteran He is no stranger to European politics. The 82-year-old, who served three times as Italian prime minister, decided to return to Brussels, where he previously served as an MEP at the turn of the century. Berlusconi stepped down as prime minister in 2011, partly because of his involvement in so-called \"bunga bunga\" sex scandals. This was the billionaire businessman's first bid for election since being found guilty of tax fraud in 2013. Speaking to members of his centre-right Forza Italia (Go Italy) party in March, he said he wanted \"a much more united Europe, a Europe with only one foreign policy, with only one defence policy\". He argued that by uniting its armed forces, Europe could become a \"world military power\". Jordan Bardella: Fresh-faced champion of France's far-right The 23-year-old is seen as the rising star of the far right in France. The lead candidate for Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration National Rally, Mr Bardella is part of efforts to soften the party's image and attract youth voters. He joined Ms Le Pen's National Front aged 16 and went on to lead its youth movement. His rise continued when the party was rebranded as the National Rally, following Ms Le Pen's 2017 French election defeat. Mr Bardella says his party's goal is to protect people from globalisation. \"Progress today is called localism. It's called defending borders. It's called protectionism,\" he told the Associated Press news agency. Oriol Junqueras: Jailed Catalan separatist He might be behind bars, but that hasn't stopped Mr Junqueras from running in the European elections. He is the lead candidate for the European Free Alliance, which says it wants to \"build a Europe of all peoples\". He is accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds over his role in Catalonia's push for independence from Spain in 2017. The EFA's manifesto promotes self-determination and language diversity, and accuses \"centralised states\" of exploiting \"some regions, peoples and stateless nations\". Nathalie Loiseau: Diplomat heading Macron's Renaissance The experienced politician stood on a centrist, pro-EU platform, but faced controversy on the campaign trail over previous links to the far right. Ms Loiseau headed the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) - a college specialised in selecting and training leaders - before joining French President Emmanuel Macron's government. She resigned as France's European affairs minister to become lead candidate for Mr Macron's La R\u00e9publique En Marche (LREM), which adopted the name \"Renaissance\" for this campaign. An outspoken critic of Brexit, she sparked controversy last month when it was revealed that she had campaigned on a far-right student union list back in 1984. Robert Biedron: Polish progressive The openly gay former mayor is a popular Polish progressive with a history of dissent against conservatives, in a deeply Catholic country. Mr Biedron, 43, heads the pro-EU Wiosna (Spring), which campaigns to improve women's rights, increase wages and switch to renewable energy sources. He wants to see a complete separation of church and state and broaden access to abortion. He has come under fire from some for refusing to join forces with Poland's opposition European Coalition, led by the centrist Civic Platform. Critics say his position has hurt efforts to counter the ruling Eurosceptic Law and Justice Party (PiS). Thierry Baudet: Rising star of Dutch populism The political novice has taken Dutch politics by storm with his outspoken views on nationalism, race and gender. Mr Baudet, 36, has pushed for \"Dutch first\" policies with his Forum for Democracy party. He wants the Netherlands to leave the EU and has blamed immigration for what he sees as a decline in traditional values. He has likened outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to Hitler and Napoleon in their dislike of Russia. \"The power-hungry of Europe legitimise the centralisation of power in Brussels because of some great enemy [Russia] and I don't see it,\" he said in a recent debate. Katarina Barley: German justice minister taking on social media The German justice minister says she wants Europe to unite and become stronger, as she eyes tougher regulations on tech companies. Ms Barley, 49, is the top candidate for Germany's centre-left Social Democrats. She is an experienced politician who holds both German and British citizenship. She used the European election campaign to talk about data privacy, calling on tech giants such as Facebook and Amazon to do more or face fines. Ska Keller: German Green vowing to battle corporations She became the first Green \"Spitzenkandidat\" (top candidate) in the 2014 European elections, and now she's eyeing a second shot at the top spot - European Commission President. Ms Keller, 37, has been an MEP since 2009. She has a master's in Islamic Studies, Turkology and Jewish Studies. She has long campaigned against corruption in the EU, and promotes policies that protect the environment. Peter Lundgren: Swedish nationalist facing abuse allegations The top candidate of the nationalist Sweden Democrats (SD) was caught up in allegations of sexual harassment during the campaign. Mr Lundgren is a former truck driver who has been an MEP since 2014. His party was the most critical of the EU in Sweden's election, but currently calls for reforms rather than leaving the bloc. The party champions anti-immigrant policies, blaming a rise in sexual attacks reported to police in Sweden on increased immigration. Swedish prosecutors have opened an investigation into allegations that Mr Lundgren sexually harassed a party colleague. He has admitted improper behaviour, blaming alcohol, but has reportedly not been disciplined by his party. Jorge Buxad\u00e9: Spanish lawyer with a controversial past The Catalan lawyer, 44, says he wants to disrupt things in Brussels but is less eager to discuss his past links to fascism. The far-right Vox party, for whom he is the lead candidate, opposes Catalan independence and promotes Spanish nationalism. The new party has enjoyed a recent surge in support in Spain. Critics describe it as a nationalist throwback to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. In the 1990s, Mr Buxad\u00e9 twice stood as a candidate for Falange Espa\u00f1ola - a nationalist group founded in the 1930s that was influenced by Italian fascism. In an interview with Politico, he said he had \"gone through a whole intellectual evolution\" since then.", "output": "European elections 2019: People to look out for", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Almost 40% of Ethiopians do not have clean water close to their homes, compared to the global average of 10%, according to Water Aid. Muluneh shot some of the photos in a studio while others were staged in the extreme landscape of one of the hottest and driest places on earth, Ethiopia's northern Afar region.

The lack of water means people do not have proper bathrooms, creating a huge health risk in communities. \"I wanted to express this point through the structure that we built. \"The red door has been placed higher to express the lack of access and to emphasise the point,\" Muluneh says. In this image, the prop of a traditional wooden bed expresses the reality that people in rural areas lie in this type of bed when they are ill, and may even be carried to a clinic for treatment. The mask symbolizes the bacteria and diseases contracted from drinking contaminated water. \"While developing this concept, I have always questioned the many diseases that arise from the lack of clean water. \"I remember working in the southern regions of Ethiopia and hearing an old man speak about how the simple fact of getting a water well has reduced the number of deaths and illness in his community,\" Muluneh says. This shot focuses on girls - especially how the lack of water and bathrooms in schools affects their education. \"The fact that most girls don't attend school when they are menstruating is a major hindrance on the progress of women in our society,\" Muluneh says. In this piece, the moon is based on a woman's monthly cycle, the red wings illustrate her freedom and strength but also the fact that she cannot achieve her full potential because she is shackled by the natural occurrence of menstruation. \"In a sense, it is like a caged bird that cannot fly but is grounded. \"The striped floor is symbolic of the road to destiny in which our path to success is in front of us but we must take the step forward,\" Muluneh says. Photographed on the salt lakes of Dallol in northern Ethiopia, this image is intended to show that Ethiopia has huge water reserves underground, but many people still do have access to clean water. \"In a sense I wanted to express that we are walking on lands with water but due to the limited irrigation of the water, we are living in a paradox,\" Muluneh says. And finally in this image, the white bottles symbolize clean water while those marked with red dots address the relationship between water and life (blood). \"The access to clean water might be a norm for those living in the city while the same reality is not a privilege in rural regions,\" Muluneh says.

Other genres to suffer declines include science fiction and fantasy which is down 25% and horror, down 30%. Eight of the top 10 bestselling novels last week were works of erotica. The fiction chart continued to be led by EL James's Fifty Shades trilogy, which originally started as a work of online fiction. Although sales fell by more than a quarter from the previous week, the three books sold nearly 340,000 copies altogether. The only two non-erotic novels in the mass market fiction chart were Lee Child's latest Jack Reacher thriller, The Affair, and John Grisham's The Litigators. \"The whole book market this year was suffering because of the growth of the digital market with print books losing money to ebooks,\" The Bookseller's Philip Stone told the BBC. \"When Fifty Shades came out it was such a phenomenon that sales grew for a few weeks but at the detriment to other sectors of the market. \"It's a case of lots of people buying Fifty Shades to see what the fuss is about and not buying other books.\" Mr Stone added erotica was now stealing sales from the rest of the book industry as publishers scrambled to take on new titles to make the most of the current boom. \"Publishers haven't really taken erotica seriously and have never had it on their books,\" he said. \"So they've been looking at other self-published authors and seeing what's being talked about online to snap them up as soon as possible.\" Non-fiction sales also appear to be affected by the erotica trend, with sales of hardbacks down 16% year-on-year and paperbacks down 8%.

According to Manx National Heritage, it was built for politician and bank owner George Quayle between 1789 and 1793. Alison Fox of MNH said the sandbags will protect \"venerable timbers\". During the excavations more than 50 tonnes of 19th Century landfill were removed from under Mr Quayle's former Castletown home. Rather than the expected slipway, a beautifully constructed dock was discovered, which would have enabled Mr Quayle to float her gently in and out of the boathouse in the late 1700s. The removal of ground however left part of the dock vulnerable to the sea that still fills and empties the dock each day. Volunteers from the Civil Defence have now built the wall of sandbags to protect the timbers until they can be further examined. Ms Fox said it was a \"daunting task with with numerous logistical challenges\". \"The sandbag wall will protect the fragile gates over the coming winter and help ensure the protection of this unique part of the Island's maritime heritage\". After Mr Quayle's death, the boat was locked away for almost 120 years, until it was rediscovered in 1935. Edmund Southworth, of Manx National Heritage (MNH), said \"Internationally, Peggy is quite simply one of the world's oldest yachts to survive.\" MNH is currently embarking on a five-year programme to remove, conserve and study the vessel.

It's a description on which everyone can agree. This is not the only set of options at this election to undermine the cynical non-voters' assertion that \"they're all the same\". If it were to implement its manifesto, a majority Labour government would make Britain look and feel very different. There's quite a lot of detail there. Few pressure groups, other than business, fail to have their pet projects given a sentence or two. You find, for instance, a commitment to \"end nationality-based discrimination in seafarer pay\" and \"an advocate for human rights at every bilateral diplomatic meeting\". The most powerful pressure groups within Labour, the trade unions, can take credit for the most detailed set of proposals, changing the way the labour market works, and giving a boost to public sector pay. This is the union barons' agenda. And amid the detail and analysis, you get some simple statements of breathtaking, radical ambition, and of potential cost and complexity: All that while nationalising rail, mail, energy supply, English water companies and broadband; also setting up a public corporation to make generic medicines; oh yes, and sorting out Brexit. What you don't sense, in reading this document, is that Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is given to making difficult choices or setting priorities. The commitments just keeping coming. And there don't seem to be many trade-offs in this view of Britain's future. Only a few objectives are given the more cautious language of aspiration, their achievement to be pushed off towards the end of the parliamentary term after next. Among them is the Universal Basic Income, which gets merely a pilot or two. Bus pass It's one of several parts of the manifesto where Labour thinking overlaps with the Scottish National Party and follows decisions of the Scottish Parliament going back 20 years. These include the \"free\" provision of long-term social care, prescription charges, dental checks, student tuition and hospital parking. There's catch-up on childcare, and a desire to push the profit motive out of anything to do with the National Health Service. With those in place already, the Scottish Labour Party has the space and a lot of moola to start developing ideas for the 2021 Holyrood election. The Scottish version of the 2019 manifesto is a sort of work in progress. It has Labour's position at Holyrood inserted into it, much of it a critique of Scottish government policy as not going far enough. On this basis, Richard Leonard would have \u00a35bn of additional Holyrood block grant from a Labour Chancellor by 2023-24. That's the share of \u00a384 billion of extra Treasury revenue (day-to-day) spending for that one year, in addition to big increases for pensions and benefits which would apply throughout the UK. That sounds a lot, on a budget currently around \u00a330bn. It's in addition to a \u00a350 billion share of additional capital spend over 10 years, translating to a doubling of the current annual level. Yet Labour has scaled back one of its eye-catching ambitions, of a bus pass for all, and not just those past 60. That's still an aspiration (now shared with Scottish Greens), but initially, Scottish Labour is committing to free buses for those aged up to 25 as well as 60-plus. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has signalled one use of the funds, if he wins in 2021, would be expansion of free school meals to all pupils, every day of the year. At present, they're provided on school days for primary one to three. (The costings, as reported here, look suspect - more than four times as many pupils, 80% more days, yet less than a doubling in budget?) Back in 2007, Scottish Labour's manifesto for Holyrood came unstuck on the failure to agree an alternative to council tax. Alex Salmond and the SNP hounded them on \"the hated council tax\" with the pledge (since broken) to replace it with a local income tax. Twelve years on, big change for council tax is merely a small part of Labour's revolution. The new way of raising funds for councils would be \"a progressive alternative based on up-to-date valuations\", while giving local authorities powers to raise money from \"land value capture\" (meaning, probably, that private landlords would be denied the windfall benefits from development). The noisy election exchanges on Scotland's constitutional future are around the question of another independence referendum - Labour's leadership in London leaving the option open, though not \"in the early years\". But buried amid those many manifesto promises are two significant developments for devolution of powers to Scotland: borrowing of funds, and workers' rights (the latter on condition that they are no weaker than the rest of the UK). Borrowing risk The issue of borrowing brings us to one of many big questions about Labour's programme for government: how can it be funded? The answer has several elements: some ambitiously low costing, assuming that more public spending boosts growth and therefore revenue, a lot of borrowing, big changes to the way in which public accounts work, and a tax raid on higher earners, the wealthy and business. The first magic trick is to push capital spending out of the fiscal targets. That is deemed to be investment, and therefore productive, so it seems we're not to treat it as actual money going out the door. The project goes further, by asserting that a pound invested in capital projects or nationalised companies is, or should be, a pound accrued to public assets. The key measure thus becomes \"public sector net worth\". All of a sudden, a burgeoning national debt doesn't look so bad. What matters is how the bond markets see this. What interests financiers is the extent of risk in buying bonds issued by the UK Government. It is already nearing \u00a32 trillion of debt. Under Labour's plans, there would be \u00a384 billion per year of additional spending by 2023/24. If that is deemed to bring an uncomfortable risk of default, the credit rating gets a downgrade, and borrowing becomes tighter and more expensive. Tax raid International finance will also make a calculation on whether the UK, under Jeremy Corbyn, is a welcoming place for investment, and that's where this grand plan is setting off corporate alarm bells. High rollers On personal taxation, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is sceptical about the claim that the figures can be made to add up by going after only the top 5% of earners. That's what Labour says it will do. Changes to top rate tax throw down challenges and opportunities to Holyrood. Having powers over income tax, it could move from having higher tax rates for higher earners to having lower ones, potentially becoming a magnet for high rollers. Or it could match the rise, also in the expectation (though no certainty) that it would increase revenue. Among unintended consequences, Holyrood could gain from the closing of loopholes on wealthy Scots who derive income from capital gains and dividends in their companies. At present, these are taxed at relatively low rates by Westminster. If they are re-classified as income, they would come within Holyrood's tax reach. So while the spending side of Labour's manifesto leaves a lot for Holyrood to adapt, many tax implications reach across the border. The windfall tax on oil and gas, to pay for the mass re-skilling of oil and gas workers, could be expected to have a disproportionate effect in Scotland. The imposition of VAT on private school fees would apply in Scotland, with a working assumption that 5% of pupils would be priced out, and shift into state-funded schools. Viewed overall, you can't criticise Labour for lacking ambition, even if you think they're the wrong ones. Its manifesto opens up a big choice on the role and reach of the state, and therefore of the private sector. Implementing it could be expected to meet dogged resistance from vested interests, starting with business. But at least as big a challenge is that it includes so many moving parts.

The county has been under strict restrictions that prevent people from travelling in and out except in exceptional circumstances. A spokesperson for Mr Hogan told the Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 that the incident happened while he was en route from Kilkenny to Kildare to collect \"personal belongings and essential documents\" at his apartment there before driving on to Galway for the golf event.

Opposition politicians had called for the recall in the wake of the dinner controversy that has already claimed the resignation of Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary, who had also attended the event. Irish police are investigating if the Oireachtas golf society dinner breached Covid-19 regulations. The event came a day after tighter lockdown restrictions were announced. 'Unnecessary stress, risk and offense' In a statement on Sunday, Mr Hogan said he particularly wanted to \"apologise to the wonderful healthcare workers, who continue to put their lives on the line to combat Covid-19 and all people who have lost loved ones during this pandemic\". \"I acknowledge my actions have touched a nerve for the people of Ireland, something for which I am profoundly sorry,\" he said. \"I realise fully the unnecessary stress, risk and offense caused to the people of Ireland by my attendance at such an event, at such a difficult time for all, and I am extremely sorry for this,\" he added.

Calls for its return were also made by Labour leader Alan Kelly, and co-leader of the Social Democrats, Catherine Murphy. As well as Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary, Jerry Buttimer, who was the leas-chathaoirleach (deputy chairman of the Irish senate), also stepped down from his roles after attending the event.

But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said there were \"thousands of houses\" within five miles of Newham which fell within the cap. Westminster council is also understood to be considering a similar proposal. As part of its welfare reforms, the government has introduced weekly caps on housing benefit of between \u00a3250 for a one-bedroom flat and \u00a3400 for a four-bedroom property.

It says the local private rental sector in Newham is beginning to \"overheat\" because of the \"onset of the Olympic Games and the buoyant young professionals market\", and it can no longer afford to house tenants on its waiting list in private accommodation. Newham Council is offering to pay Brighter Futures 90% of the local housing allowance plus \u00a360 per week.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We have got a waiting list of 32,000 - we've got hundreds of people looking for places to stay and the result of government benefit cuts, which are still working through as well, means that many more people from wealthier parts of London are looking for places to live in London and they're just not there. \"We have written to 1,179 organisations [housing associations] saying could you accommodate some people? We're not looking to push people all to one place, we're looking to find the best possible solution for citizens.\" But ministers have pointed to a \u00a3190m discretionary fund available to help councils and insisted that even after the cap, families can still claim up to \u00a321,000 a year towards their rent. Mr Duncan Smith said the cap had been in place since April 2011 and \"every other council\" was \"managing\" with it even though it was \"difficult\". \"We need to get people into housing they can afford to go work from, so the taxpayer doesn't have to foot that bill.\" He added: \"I suspect this is somewhat a little political at a time of local elections.\" 'Kosovo-style cleansing' Ministers say the way housing benefit is calculated means 30% of homes in an area will be within the cap - and they argue the changes are simply \"shaving \u00a32bn off a \u00a325bn per annum budget\". But Sir Robin said just because there were 1,000 properties available, did not mean landlords would take housing benefit claimants. Meanwhile, Westminster is said to be considering an offer from Smart Housing Group - a private association with homes in Nottingham and Derby - in conjunction with its partner councils Chelsea and Hammersmith, and Fulham. It has suggested it could provide properties for Westminster residents deemed \"homeless\" as a result of the cap - and if accepted, each of the three London councils would send 50 families. Ben Denton, Westminster's director of housing, worklessness and regeneration, said there were more than 1,000 families on the waiting list so it had no option to look for \"fair and realistic\" alternatives. He said candidates for a move were those \"with minimal connections to Westminster\", while those with \"a genuine need to live in Westminster such as those with children at crucial stages in their education or those with social care packages\", a discretionary payment could be made to allow them to stay. Shadow communities secretary Jack Dromey said the government's policies were \"harming families and forcing them from their homes\" and as private rents in London had risen by 7% in 2011. When the housing benefit cap was announced in 2010, London's Conservative Mayor Boris Johnson said he would \"not accept any kind of Kosovo-style social cleansing of London\" adding: \"The last thing we want to have in our city is a situation such as Paris where the less well-off are pushed out to the suburbs.\"", "output": "'Social cleansing' housing benefit cap row: Duncan Smith hits back", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

But at a global mayors summit, Paris is showcasing a simple technology using water piped from the Seine to cool apartments near the Champs Elysees. London Mayor Boris Johnson said he wanted London to follow suit by cooling buildings using water from the Thames. \"I don't like to admit it - but the French are ahead of us on this,\" he confessed. The system works by taking water from the river and piping it round people's homes like ordinary piped water air conditioning. In summer a heat pump is used to make the water even cooler by employing technology similar to a fridge. The mayors meeting in Paris City Hall is timed to coincide with the UN climate summit. It brings together half of the 80 mega-city mayors who are working together to tackle climate change. The chairman of the group, Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio, said the mayors represented 600m people and a quarter of the global economy. \"We can be very effective,\" he said. \"Sometimes governments move slowly - we can often move more quickly.\" The mayors said they had learned from each other to spread green solutions round the world. They claim to have collectively made 10,000 climate initiatives since 2009. They spoke about their favourite initiatives: Boris Johnson's team said since the Mayor was elected in 2008, carbon emissions in London were down by 14%, even though population had swelled. He said a major preoccupation was to find ways of finding a low-carbon way to provide the heating and cooling from natural gas, which made up nearly 50% of the city's emissions. Darren Johnson, Green member for the London Assembly, told BBC News: \"On the whole Boris Johnson has been a real disappointment. He has expressed climate sceptic views and failed to meet most of the targets in his (climate) strategies.\" The global commission advised by Lord Stern concluded recently that climate change could only be tackled if new cities to house a burgeoning population could be planned less like Los Angeles and more like Paris.

Mr Pashteen has drawn tens of thousands to rallies in cities around Pakistan. A fellow protest leader said he was being punished for simply demanding human rights. The powerful military, unused to criticism, denies wrongdoing. Mr Pashteen, a charismatic former veterinary student who shot to prominence two years ago, has become the face of the Pashtun Tahaffuz (Protection) Movement (PTM), in a country where few openly challenge the military. A number of cases highlighted by the PTM and investigated independently by the BBC came to light in a report last year. \"It has taken us almost 15 years of suffering and humiliation to gather courage to speak up, and to spread awareness about how the military trampled our constitutional rights through both direct action and a policy of support for the militants,\" Manzoor Pashteen told the BBC. The non-violent protests began over the alleged extra-judicial killing of a young man of ethnic Pashtun heritage by police in Karachi. The movement then expanded, demanding accountability from Pakistan's army for alleged human rights abuses committed against Pashtuns during the war against Islamist extremists in the country's north-west. Pashtuns make up the majority of the population along the border with Afghanistan. The protests, which have at times drawn tens of thousands of demonstrators, have rattled the military. A protest that threatens army power By Abid Hussain, BBC Urdu in Islamabad Since January 2018 Manzoor Pashteen and his movement have become the most significant challenge to the military. Historically in Pakistan such movements have often fizzled out or been co-opted by the state - but the PTM has grown and grown in strength. All the while its 27-year-old leader with his trademark red cap has steadfastly maintained a modest lifestyle - he doesn't even have a security detail to speak of. The state seems to have been unsure how to act against him, and the decision to detain him appeared sudden. Charges were laid on 21 January, but it took a week to make the arrest. Almost laughably, the reason cited for the move is him speaking in an insulting manner about Pakistan and refusing to accept the constitution, when he has often stressed in his speeches the need to uphold the law. Now the state has finally made its move, how will the PTM respond? Manzoor Pashteen ensured that while he led the movement, no violence took place. But will his supporters now show the same discipline? Manzoor Pashteen has been accused of \"hate speech\" and sedition among other offences. The latter carries a possible life sentence. He was remanded in police custody in Peshawar for 14 days but is expected to be taken to appear before a magistrate in Dera Ismail Khan, some 300km (186 miles) to the south, where charges against him have been filed. His fellow protesters have demanded his immediate release. Another PTM leader, MP Mohsin Dawar, urged supporters to remain calm in response to the arrest. This is the first time Manzoor Pashteen has been held, and why the authorities chose to detain him now is unclear. The authorities have repeatedly arrested other PTM leaders and activists since the movement came to prominence. Last year Mohsin Dawar and his fellow PTM member of the National Assembly, Ali Wazir, were detained for four months after a deadly clash in Waziristan. A media blackout has ensured the PTM's peaceful rallies stay off front pages and TV bulletins - although the movement has been successful in getting its message out via social media. According to authorities and independent research groups, militant violence since 2002 has forced more than five million people in Pakistan's north-west to leave their homes to seek refuge either in government-run refugee camps or rented houses in peaceful areas. There are no official figures of the total death toll of this war but estimates from academics, local authorities and activists put the number of civilians, militants and security forces killed at well over 50,000. Many see the PTM as breaking new ground in the political landscape of a country where proxy wars have disenfranchised large populations not only in tribal areas and the north-west, but also in Balochistan and other parts of the country.", "output": "Manzoor Pashteen: Activist who dared to challenge Pakistan army held", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

He planned to use the ransomware to steal company secrets for extortion, prosecutors alleged. The 27-year-old pleaded guilty on Thursday in Reno, Nevada. Mr Kriuchkov acted on behalf of criminals abroad and tried to bribe a Tesla employee in person, prosecutors said. Ransomware attacks companies or organisations by scrambling their internal computer networks, stealing information or locking users out. The attackers then demand large sums of money in return for ending the hack. The FBI said the planned attack on Tesla was stopped before it could take place. Mr Kriuchkov told a court in September that the Russian government was aware of the planned hack, but the FBI and lawyers have not alleged that there were ties to the Kremlin. \"The swift response of the company and the FBI prevented a major exfiltration of the victim company's data and stopped the extortion scheme at its inception,\" Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas McQuaid said in a statement. Mr Kruichokov was in the US for five weeks on a tourist visa in July and August last year when he tried to recruit the Tesla employee, according to court documents reported in US media. He was quoted as saying that he and his co-conspirators would steal the data, and if Tesla refused to pay the ransom the company's secrets would be placed on the internet. The US Department of Justice said that he took the employee out for drinks multiple times and gave him a phone. After the employee told Tesla about the plan, the company contacted the FBI who instructed the employee to record their conversations with Mr Kruichokov.

She claims that other senior IRA members later investigated and covered up her alleged abuse. She has accused the police and Public Prosecution Service of failing to properly investigate her allegations. Three separate trials later collapsed after she and other witnesses withdrew their evidence. A man accused of rape and IRA membership, and four others facing IRA charges, were all acquitted. Ms Cahill claims that one reason that happened is because it took more than four years for the cases to go to court. Speaking on Friday, Ms Cahill said: \"I welcome the fact that he (Sir Keir Starmer) has been brought in very, very quickly which, I believe, is a vindication of the fact of my frustration at how the court process evolved. \"There was a hierarchy when it came to alleged abusers and that hierarchy came in when those abusers also had the mantle of the IRA which they could then use to doubly instil fear in the victim.\" This review is examining whether the Public Prosecution Service was at fault. Sir Keir said: \"It was very important for me to meet the complainants very early in the process so that I could assure them as to how I was going to conduct the review, engage with them and do my best to ensure they had confidence in the process. \"So I'm very grateful to them for taking the time today to meet me, to share their concerns with me and to have done so at this early stage.\" Sir Keir rejected any suggestion that his review would be simply a box ticking exercise.

The UK was among 19 nations that supported the law in its European Council vote. But Poland was one of those that objected on the grounds that it could pave the way to internet censorship. EU sources say that five other countries also opposed the rules - Italy, Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - while Belgium, Estonia and Slovenia abstained. Google had led lobbying efforts against the law's introduction. At one point it had featured pop-up notices on its YouTube video-streaming service warning that the effort could have \"unintended consequences\", including the blocking of some of its clips to EU-based members. In particular, there was concern that memes featuring clips from TV shows and films could no longer be shared. However, tweaks to the law subsequently made an exception for content used for the \"purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche\".

Corey was treated like a criminal when he told authorities he felt unsafe, his mother previously said. A serious case review found the teenager had been groomed by gangs from the age of 13. 'Inadequate' The Ofsted report published on Monday found young people at risk of exploitation were \"not always effectively identified, and protective action [was] not consistently instigated to safeguard children\". Inspectors said there were examples where police started interviews with children without a social worker present, which meant some young people had to relive distressing experiences. Case loads were also found to be \"too high in several teams to enable good social work\". Since the department was rated as \"requiring improvement\" in a 2014 inspection, there \"has been a lack of child focus by leaders,\" the report states. \"[This] means that the standard of social work practice in Newham has deteriorated significantly.\" The latest report rated the service \"inadequate\".

Today's lecture is about the basics. They are learning English, a language most have never studied before. They are also undergoing something of a crash course in how to live in the UK, which includes how to register with a GP, how to get medication from a chemist's and how to get children into school. There's a lot to learn. 'Build a future' But the men and the women, with their bright headscarves, who have escaped from the horrors of the Syrian war, are determined to take it all in, impatient to start their new lives in this country. Suha is here with her husband Abdul Aziz, both 24, and their one-year-old baby daughter Arerm. For her this is a chance to start again, to make a future for her baby, who was born a refugee. \"Yes, of course we are happy,\" she says. \"Now she is guaranteed the opportunity to study and to build a future. That is so important. We can all see the situation back in Syria and even in Jordan, where things are getting worse.\" The couple, who met while studying at university in the Syrian city of Homs, have been separated from other family members since coming to the UK. Suha says she has left behind two sisters who are currently still in Homs and battling against a \"very dangerous\" situation. Meanwhile Abdul believes two of his relatives have made it to Australia, which has pledged to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees. But both admit they have \"lost people\" in the conflict, and did not want to elaborate further. However, the family are among the lucky ones. Just 216 Syrians have so far come to Britain under the government's Vulnerable People Relocation Scheme (VPRS), which was launched in January 2014. That is about to change, with the prime minister's announcement that 20,000 refugees would be brought from camps in countries bordering Syria into the UK by 2020. The process starts in the refugee camps and frontier towns on Syria's borders with Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Officials working for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will conduct interviews to identify the most vulnerable people meeting the requirements, who will be invited to Britain. To qualify, a person must either be a survivor of torture or violence, a woman or child at risk, or in need of medical care. There may also be further interviews by Home Office staff to address any security concerns. Before anyone can travel to the UK, a local authority must agree to take them in. Facts about the Vulnerable People Relocation Scheme But the issue of who pays for the relocation scheme may become a contentious point. Bill Dennis is from Migration Yorkshire, one of several regional groups tasked by the Home Office to establish which local authorities across the UK will take Syrian refugees. He says councils are coming forward to take on refugees, but many are asking for more detail. \"They're saying, 'we need to see the package, we need to see the details and what the implications are'. \"But I don't think that will stop councils responding positively in the long run.\" Currently 106 of the 216 refugees in the UK have been given a roof over their heads in Bradford. The city's Horton Housing Association has been funded by the Home Office to find them accommodation and offer other support, such as English classes. The association's chief executive, Paul Gartland, said the first task was to make the refugees understand that they were no longer in danger. \"People land in the UK, a very strange country to them I'm sure; different norms, culture, and the first thing is to make them feel safe, secure and welcome - which is what we do at the airport,\" he said. In the modest, but spotless, flat where his family now lives, Abdul thanks God and the UK for the chance to start again. The war stopped his university studies in Homs but he says his student days are over.

The new bills - being brought in by the energy regulator Ofgem - are designed to make charges easier to understand. Ofgem defended the changes, saying Which? had not taken account of all its forthcoming reforms. Since January, energy suppliers have had to advertise their tariffs in terms of two rates: The new tariffs are already used on price comparison sites, but the first bills showing them will not be sent out until 1 April. Previously, not all companies quoted a standing charge, and some quoted two tiers of unit rates, a higher and a lower rate. 'Too complicated' But the Which? survey showed widespread confusion when consumers tried to work out which was the cheapest rate on the new-look bills. Even amongst those who used a calculator, only half managed to spot the best deal. The following examples, taken from suppliers' websites, show why the new rates are still potentially confusing: Consumers not only need to so some mental arithmetic to work out the cheapest deal, they also need to know how much gas or electricity they use in a year. \"In spite of Ofgem's tariff reforms to simplify the market, consumers are still failing to spot the cheapest deal because energy pricing remains too complicated,\" said Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which? The consumer group would like to see a single flat rate for energy, as happens with the price of petrol. Right Deal In an attempt to provide that, Ofgem will introduce a Tariff Comparison Rate (TCR) on bills from April, similar to an APR comparison on a loan. This is designed to combine the Standing Charge and the Unit rate into a single measure. For example, bills might show a TCR of 15.24p/kWh, which consumers should be able to compare directly with other suppliers. But Which? warned that TCR is calculated only for a medium user of energy, so it does not always provide an accurate guide for switching supplier. Ofgem said it had conducted widespread research amongst consumers before deciding on its reforms. \"We are confident that our reform package will make the market simpler, clearer, and fairer for consumers, and make it much easier for them to choose the right deal,\" said Philip Cullum, Ofgem's Consumer Partner.", "output": "Energy bills 'still confusing', says Which?", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Martin Richard The eight-year-old was standing with his family, cheering the runners as they completed the race. The prime position near the finish line put him in the path of one of the bombs. He was the first person killed in the attacks to be publicly named. He was described as \"kind, caring and loving\" by staff at his former school. His younger sister Jane, six, suffered a serious injury to her leg, while his mother, Denise, sustained a head injury and required emergency surgery. In an emailed statement, Martin's father, Bill, wrote: \"My dear son Martin has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Boston. My wife and daughter are both recovering from serious injuries.

Students at the university said he had always made an effort to get to know them, so he \"knew which students he was protecting every day when he came to work\".

But he did not give in to demands to adopt all the examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). Critics in the Labour Party said the article had changed nothing. In his article, he said he recognised the \"strong concerns\" about Labour's code of conduct and that many Jewish organisations believed it should include all 11 examples of contemporary anti-Semitism cited by the IHRA in its guidelines. Mr Corbyn, a long-standing supporter of the rights of Palestinians, defended Labour's decision not to include one of the examples - which warns against \"claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour\". He said this had \"sometimes been used by those wanting to restrict criticism of Israel that is not anti-Semitic\". But he added: \"I feel confident that this outstanding issue can be resolved through dialogue with community organisations, including the Jewish Labour Movement, during this month's consultation.\" The Labour leader also wrote that he would \"not for one moment accept that a Labour government would represent any kind of threat\" to Jewish life in the UK. \"That is the kind of overheated rhetoric that can surface during emotional political debates,\" he said. Analysis By Susana Mendonca, BBC political correspondent This was supposed to be Jeremy Corbyn reaching out to the Jewish community to repair frayed relations. The tone of some of what he said was conciliatory. He acknowledged the party had a problem with anti-Semitism and accepted the Jewish community should have been consulted earlier on the code of conduct. But there was no sudden change in policy on the code - and nothing short of that was ever going to silence his critics. The timing didn't help either as it was released just before the Jewish Sabbath, leading some to suggest that was intended to avoid reaction from the Jewish community. Labour tells me that was not the case and the article was supposed to have been published much earlier in the day. Nonetheless the reaction has come - and it hasn't been positive. \"Vague and meaningless\" was the assessment from the Campaign Against Antisemitism. Expect this row to continue rumbling on through this long hot summer. Labour MP Ian Austin, who is being investigated over his alleged behaviour during a row about the party's code of conduct, said Mr Corbyn's article will \"make matters much worse\". \"Under his leadership, the Labour Party has caused huge offence and distress to the Jewish community yet he's not just completely failed to make a single change, but repeated some of the things that have caused this problem,\" he said. Another Labour MP, Wes Streeting, a leading critic of Mr Corbyn's stance on anti-Semitism, told the BBC his party leader was guilty of \"the same old hand wringing we've heard time and time again\". A Jewish Labour Movement spokesperson said: \"Today, other than another article bemoaning a situation of the party's own making, nothing has changed. There is no trust left. We find ourselves asking once again for action, not words.\" But Barnaby Raine, a Jewish Labour party member and supporter of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4 that the article demonstrated a significant step forward for the leader. \"He has acknowledged that anti-Semitism is a serious problem in the Labour party,\" he said. \"He has taken on those people that say that they support him, even though they are anti-Semities. \"And he has done something\u2026 which I think this is especially important - he has condemned those people, not just who hold anti-Semitic attitudes, but who dismiss this whole thing as just a smear on the Labour party.\" 'Still no wiser' Earlier it emerged that Labour had offered to drop disciplinary action against Dame Margaret Hodge if she issued an \"appropriate apology\" over an anti-Semitism row. The party launched an investigation into the veteran Labour MP after a confrontation she had with Mr Corbyn. She has published letters on social media between her lawyers and Labour's general secretary, Jennie Formby. \"I'm still no wiser as to what I'm accused of; the nature of complaints received; who the investigating officer is; or what the time frame for the investigation will be. Is this fair?,\" Dame Margaret said. Solicitors from Mischon de Reya, which is acting for Dame Margaret, have told the Labour Party either to proceed with the investigation or to drop it, and if not, they have warned that she may take the Labour Party to court. They also say the Barking MP will not apologise as she does not accept that she breached Labour rules.

The minister expressed concerns about the autumn budget being cancelled and lack of clarity for an upcoming UK Spending Review. Mr Murphy said it was \"making it impossible\" for Stormont to plan. He and the Welsh and Scottish finance ministers have collectively asked the British government for \"urgent clarity\" about the timing and scope of the next Spending Review. \"They're experiencing exactly the same problem in giving budget certainty to their own institutions,\" said Mr Murphy. This is not the first time that the three ministers have collectively called for more flexibility with spending powers. Mr Murphy said if the executive wanted to respond effectively to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in this year and future years, it would need to have \"flexibility to transfer Capital funding into Resource budgets\". He also called for the Treasury to \"loosen restrictions around transferring funding from one year to the next\". The minister said restrictions on underspends did not \"encourage good financial management and risks year-end surges of spend as departments seek to ensure budgets are maximised\". Mr Murphy also raised concerns about the impact of Brexit on the Stormont budget, with the transition period due to end on 31 December. \"We do not have the clarity we need on key issues such as implementing the Irish Protocol and replacing EU funding,\" he told the assembly. \"I have written to the Treasury outlining the costs of implementing the protocol and have yet to receive confirmation that those costs will be met by the British Government, as they promised to do.\" The minister said he and his Welsh and Scottish counterparts were \"collectively asking for assurances the British Government will provide full replacement funding of EU programmes without detriment to devolution\". Mr Murphy also said that a commitment in the Stormont New Decade, New Approach deal, to set up an independent fiscal council, had not yet been delivered. \"Things have slipped because of Covid and the necessity for all departments to focus on the challenge of it, but I hope to bring a proposition to the executive very soon,\" he said.

The CDC's guidelines suggest pupils and staff all wear face coverings and stay at home if necessary. They also suggest schools should implement staggered timetables and socially distanced seating arrangements, and close communal spaces.

Education Secretary John Swinney said he was disappointed by the rejection of a \"strong and fair\" offer. The teaching unions claim the real value of teachers' pay has fallen by 20% over the past decade, and a big rise is needed to boost recruitment and retention of staff. Last month tens of thousands of teachers marched in Glasgow in support of a \"fair deal\" that would \"value teachers\".

The EIS said 98% of members who voted rejected the offer, with a turnout of 74%. In the SSTA ballot, 97% rejected the deal, on a 73% turnout. EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: \"Today's near unanimous rejection of the pay offer is a landmark result, one of the strongest rejections of an offer in EIS history, and one which is indicative of the current mood of Scotland's teachers, increasingly agitated on pay but angry also at excessive workload, mainstreaming on the cheap, and austerity driven cuts to resources.\" 'Strong message' SSTA general secretary Seamus Searson said the vote sent a \"strong message\" to the Scottish government. He said: \"It is time for government to return to the negotiating table and treat teachers with respect and seek a meaningful settlement.\" A third teaching union, the NASUWT, said survey of more than 1,000 of its members suggested more than half were willing to take industrial action in support of the claim.

Dr Howard-Jones will say that \"most parents would discourage their children from having a midnight chat to friends on the doorstep, but having access to a mobile phone under the duvet can also be a bad idea.\" He will say there is evidence that staring at a small bright screen under the covers can disrupt the secretion of the hormone melatonin which regulates our sleep cycle, more strongly than watching television. He will add that another study suggests that teenagers who text after lights out are four times more likely to experience daytime drowsiness and yet more studies have linked playing video games even early in the evening with loss of sleep. Dr Howard-Jones, of Bristol University, specialises in neuroscience and education and in particular on the effects of computer games and digital technology on the brain.

Scare stories He told BBC News he believes some of the scare stories about changes to the brain brought on by use of digital technologies are overstated. However he says the science shows that there is a definite effect on the brain, particularly in children. He says that some recent studies have shown that use of social networking sites by teenagers is linked to positive well-being and greater social connectedness but adds that a willingness to seek the company of strangers whether online or offline is linked to poorer social well-being. \"That makes it sensible to be asking questions about, for example, the effects of social networking sites on their offline lives.\" He told BBC News that reading the articles made him focus on the difficulties of monitoring and regulating his own children's use of smart phones and video games. \"All the time I was thinking 'what does this mean for my family and what does it mean for me in practice as a parent?' \"I appreciate the difficulties of monitoring and regulating their technology use. With increasing connectivity on mobile devices it's an increasingly difficult task for parents.\" Justine Roberts of Mumsnet commented: \"It's important that parents keep the rules very clear about digital usage and are not put off by the fact that children and teenagers may use the technology better than us. \"Just because it's technology, parents should not shy away from applying the usual parenting rules and boundaries. \"It's important to keep a dialogue open about online activities just as you would with any other conversation or activity.\"", "output": "Texting at night 'disrupts children's sleep and memory'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The SEND Action group said: \"As in the last lockdown many are being turned away because they are not regarded as vulnerable enough.\" The government said it was prioritising children with special needs. It announced a third lockdown on Monday, with schools being closed except for children deemed \"vulnerable\". This term does not only mean children in care but also those with special educational needs and who have an EHCP (Education, Health and Care Plan). Mother of two Jen Smith, from Bristol, spent two years in a legal battle to get an EHCP in place, as well as an education provision at a specialist school in South Gloucestershire. \"It's a worrying time,\" she said. \"I have a child with an EHCP who already missed most of year seven and eight and it's taking the first term of year nine to get him settled into a new school that could meet his needs. \"Now that we've just gone into lockdown there's no guarantee that he'll get a place.\" She said she was waiting to hear back from her son's school and things were \"up in the air\". \"We live in an overcrowded flat and we don't have the space to really properly do home learning.\" She also felt that nationally, the system for SEND was \"a mess\". \"We have head teachers who are pitted against the government and then parents pitted against the schools and head teachers. \"It feels like a constant ongoing fight.\" For other parents, lockdown has meant more struggles alongside a long-running \"battle\" to secure an EHCP. Those parents have a My Support Plan in place for their child, which is a level below the EHCP. It means the school recognises the child has additional needs but unlike the EHCP, there is no ring-fenced funding in place. Special needs teacher Jennifer Holt, from Huddersfield, says her 10-year-old son is waiting to get a EHCP and is awaiting an autism diagnosis by independent specialists. He has been already diagnosed with severe dyslexia and dyspraxia. She said: \"Not being able to attend for another, probably minimum two months, it's going to make him step back. \"He is so difficult to get engaged in any formal learning, which the school know about. \"He won't get any formal education at all, he won't engage any written work at home, he won't contribute to any Zoom meetings. He shuts down.\" She said his school class size was small so social distancing measures were achievable. \"It's so soul-destroying how much you have to fight for this brilliant little person that you've got, that you know how brilliant they are and other people fail to, or don't want to recognise or support them. \"The feeling of rejection I had was heartbreaking.\" A spokesman for Kirklees Council said: \"Like all local authorities, we are supporting schools to continue to provide the best possible standards of safety, care and education at an incredibly difficult time for schools and families. \"If this particular family would like to contact us, we would be keen to discuss their circumstances.\" While some parents remain in limbo, for others the decision to remain at home has been based on medical grounds. Rumya Kumar, from Swindon, has decided to keep her 13-year old son, who has autism, at home as she has lupus. She kept him home during the national lockdown last March, but his condition deteriorated as a result. \"He is quite happy not to go out, to stay at home with no school. \"But the problem is the more he stays at home, which is his comfort zone, then the harder it gets to send him to school.\" She added that it took him the whole of the winter term to readjust to school. Due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, she said the doctors had to increase his anxiety medication to help him cope. Ms Kumar also hopes to be vaccinated soon so her son can return on a part-time basis. Alice Marshment faced a tense wait for just over a day to see if Bristol City Council would reinstate school transport for her son. It had been temporarily pulled but the council has since confirmed transport would be in place for the the twice-daily two-hour round trip. She said she would have been unable to drive him there, as she also had to home-school her son. \"It feels as though the SEND children, the Cinderella siblings with the education system, have just been forgotten about again,\" she said. \"To be fair, the government hasn't been on top of anything to do with education in this pandemic. \"If we feel that the children generally have been at the bottom of the ladder in terms of the government's concern then SEND children aren't even on the ladder.\" She added that SEND children needed to be prioritised. \"All schools, special schools included, have to find a way to make it work for those children who want to be at school... the government and the local authorities need to work together to make sure that that can happen,\" said Ms Marshment. \"We have very little reserve left to get us through. \"We need this support, it's not an optional extra.\" A SEND action group spokeswoman said: \"In order to close the gap between rhetoric and reality, DfE and the government need to engage with special schools and families of disabled children regarding the particular challenges these schools face and the support required to address them.\" A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"We have prioritised vulnerable children and children with special educational needs and disabilities throughout the pandemic.\" They said they were addressing issues \"urgently\", that \"alternative provision schools remain open\" and that the government would \"publish guidance in due course\".

He went on to become deputy churchwarden and showed ambition to become a vicar. From the outside he seemed a staunch Christian. But Field was secretly manipulating two vulnerable victims - fellow member of the congregation Peter Farquhar, 69, and his 83-year-old neighbour, Ann Moore-Martin. In August, 28-year-old Field was found guilty of murdering author Mr Farquhar in 2015. He was cleared of the attempted murder of Miss Moore-Martin. \"No-one who came into contact with Ben Field was not manipulated by him,\" the Diocese of Oxford said in a statement at the time. And that is certainly true for the Stowe congregation and its members who were revealed to be on a list of 100 \"clients\" Field had identified as \"useful\" to him. The list included Miss Moore-Martin and his own grandparents. Archdeacon of Buckingham Guy Elsmore said: \"This was a young man who presented himself as faithful and friendly and helpful and was, in fact, the opposite of those things. \"There were one or two individuals who were close to Ben on whom the pastoral impact on this has been severe. \"People have found the whole experience deeply shocking and traumatic as anyone would.\" Away from the church Field had other friends he duped. Lucy - not her real name - had been friends with Field for a long time, and thought she knew everything about the man who made her laugh with his funny stories. But she admitted to BBC Radio 5 Live documentary Killer in the Congregation that the \"person I knew probably didn't ever exist\". \"He was always a bit odd,\" she said. \"Like loveable odd. The stories he told would make me laugh because he was always very good at observing people.\" When Field was charged with murder, Lucy wanted to believe he was innocent. But reading the evidence against him made her realise she didn't know him at all. \"I guess there's always a part of you that hopes it will turn out to be some weird joke and then you see photographic evidence and you're like 'oh God',\" she said. In the picturesque village of Maids Moreton, near Buckingham, Field fooled nearly everyone around him into thinking he was a caring, young Christian with a calling to become a priest. At Oxford Crown Court, the truth emerged. Field was a master manipulator who used his knowledge of the church to seduce Mr Farquhar and Ms Moore-Martin. He pretended he was in love with the two elderly, vulnerable neighbours so they would change their wills and leave him their money and houses. His victims were similar to each other in that they were single, deeply religious and did not have children. During the trial, Field admitted he sometimes enjoyed tormenting Mr Farquhar and found it amusing. Mr Farquhar's brother Ian said hearing the callous disregard for his brother drove him to anger. \"I was coping fine until Ben went into the witness box,\" he said. \"There was one day he just started saying disrespectful things about my brother, how everything he did to my brother was purely for gain. \"I realised I was really close to going up there and socking him.\" Mr Farquhar was a revered academic who met Field when he was one of his students at the University of Buckingham \"Peter was a man with a very acute mind, a man who didn't suffer fools gladly\u2026 so it was a substantial thing that Ben did to dupe him,\" Ian Farquhar said. Field nearly got away with Mr Farquhar's murder. It was only when police began investigating his dealings with Ms Moore-Martin that the truth was uncovered. Just as he did with Mr Farquhar, Field pretended to be in love with the retired head teacher. He wrote her poetry and love letters and secretly wrote messages on Miss Moore-Martin's mirrors - hoping she would believe they were from God. Miss Moore-Martin's niece was concerned about the relationship and alerted Thames Valley Police. Senior investigating officer Mark Glover said: \"Ann realised that she'd been had over in a massive massive way by Ben Field and she was humiliated and no doubt depressed about that.\" Killer in the Congregation is available now on BBC Sounds by following the link", "output": "Maids Moreton: How murderer Ben Field fooled a church", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The authorities say that without drastic action the country's fragile health system will be overwhelmed. Compared to other countries, Lebanon had until now coped relatively well with the coronavirus. Despite a rise in the number of new cases, the government relaxed restrictions ahead of Christmas and New Year, hoping to bolster the country's crumbling economy. Bars and nightclubs were allowed to open for the first time in months. Health officials said that the easing of restrictions had now led to a dramatic spike in infections. Lebanon, which has a population of six million, has reported more than 222,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,629 deaths since the start of the pandemic. But in the past week alone, 30,250 people have tested positive and 117 have died, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. \"We have seen dreadful scenes of citizens waiting in front of hospitals for a chair or a bed,\" President Michel Aoun said at a meeting of the Supreme Defence Council on Monday afternoon. \"Radical measures must be taken so that we can mitigate the catastrophic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak,\" he added. Caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab blamed the spike in cases on \"the stubbornness of people and their rebellion against measures taken to protect them from the threat of this pandemic\". But he also admitted that \"the enforcement of these measures was not equal to the level of the risk\". A statement from the Supreme Defence Council said only health professionals, those working in the food sector and other essential workers will be allowed out on to the streets during the curfew, which is scheduled to last until 05:00 on 25 January but could well be extended. Supermarkets, bakeries and grocers may remain open but only for delivery. Rumours that they would be shut completely had sparked a wave of panic buying before the announcement. Land and sea borders will also be closed to all travellers unless they have a valid transit visa, and passengers flying in from Baghdad, Istanbul, Adana, Cairo and Addis Ababa will need to quarantine in a hotel for seven days and undergo two coronavirus tests. Save the Children warned that the curfew would exacerbate the suffering of vulnerable families and urged the government to provide fair and transparent social assistance packages. \"Almost half of the population can't afford to buy sufficient food to last them through the supermarket closures,\" said Jennifer Moorehead, the charity's Lebanon director. \"We fear they will face hunger as it is uncertain whether stores have the capacity to deliver food to people's homes.\" Lebanon is already reeling from an economic collapse that has seen a huge number of people lose their jobs. The local currency has also lost 80% of its value against the US dollar in the past year, which among other things has seriously disrupted the importation of medical supplies. Lebanon expects to receive its first shipment of Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech in mid-February.

According to the WWF wildlife charity, seven out of the 13 great whale species are still endangered or vulnerable. Commercial whaling is one of the challenges they face, with an estimated 1,000 whales a year killed for the market, says the WWF. Other hazards include toxic contamination and the effects of climate change. But a more recent danger has arisen, in the form of collisions with ships. Doubling of death rates Nowhere is this phenomenon clearer than in the Mediterranean. It is now estimated that around 20% of whales found dead in the Mediterranean had collided with a ship. When you consider that vessels weighing more than 100 tons cross the Mediterranean around 220,000 times each year, it becomes a little easier to understand why. This stretch of water has become the maritime equivalent of London's Piccadilly Circus, without the traffic lights. One of the species particularly at risk is the fin whale. These graceful creatures, measuring up to 24m (78ft) swim the Mediterranean's blue waters in a number of areas, but often gather in pods in the northern region between Italy and France to feed. One recent study published in 2006 by the Marine Pollution Bulletin estimated that there are around 3,500 fin whales in the Mediterranean. But according to the same report, the numbers dying after collisions has doubled since the 1970s. \"They simply can't get out of the way of the great cruise liners and other vessels,\" says Marco Costantini, from the WWF in Italy. 'Battering ram' And the cruise line market has been growing fast. According to Cruise Industry News, in European waters alone, passenger numbers have risen from 3.7 million in 2007 to 4.5 million this year. A further 16 large vessels are on order for the European market, each one capable of carrying at least 5,000 passengers and crew. All that extra traffic is potentially bad news for the whales. The biggest obstacle to them is what is known as the ship's \"bulb\", the protruding section of the bow. Its purpose is to direct the waves around the ship to lessen their impact on it, giving passengers a smoother ride. But when the ship is at sea this extension careers through the water, under the surface, like a huge battering ram. The whales do not stand a chance. But now, thanks to a unique venture between one cruise company, WWF, and a number of other technology firms, help is at hand. Four vessels, including the Costa Pacifica, owned by Costa Cruises, one of the biggest operators in the business, have been fitted with a software system called Repcet. Repcet allows ships to share real-time information on the location of the whales. Once a ship spots a whale, the co-ordinates are entered into the system. They are sent, via a satellite connection, to a server in France. The server then centralises the data and sends out an alert to equipped vessels that are likely to be affected. The alerts are displayed on a dedicated screen located on the ship's bridge and it all happens in seconds. In addition to accurately positioning the whale sightings, the system calculates and displays the associated risk zones. These are displayed as grey circles on the screen. 'Commercial sense' The system allows alarms to be programmed in, helping crew members to anticipate potential encounters, thereby avoiding the necessity of continuously watching the mapping screen. The area covered by Repcet is about 90,000 sq km. Massimo Pennisi, the captain of the Costa Pacifica, says he sees a whale \"about once a month\". \"This new tracking system works very well. We can adjust speed and direction immediately,\" he says, adding that it is also useful for avoiding the giant metal containers that can fall off ships in storms. \"Hitting a whale or a container at a speed of 20-plus knots could be bad news for the ship, so Repcet makes commercial as well as environmental sense,\" he adds. To be truly effective many more vessels will need to join the project. \"It's a start,\" says Marco Costantini from WWF. \"It's also a new direction for a non-governmental organisation like ours to work so closely with the private sector in order to protect wildlife,\" he says. The idea is to eventually expand the system to be applied in any areas where collisions are a known issue, such as the North Atlantic, Japan, and the Canary Islands. Conservation and commerce are sometimes rivals on the high seas, but now they are setting a common course for the mutual benefit of those both above and below the waves.", "output": "Hi-tech look-out could save whales' lives", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

He noted that he was the most pro-China of Google's triumvirate leadership. In March last year Google stopped co-operating with China over censorship - a joint decision that Mr Schmidt said he was happy with. \"Over time I would hope - especially in my new role with more of an external focus - that I can try to get more of Google, appropriately and within our policies, into China,\" he told the BBC's economics editor, Stephanie Flanders, at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Unruffled reshuffle It was revealed earlier this month that Mr Schmidt, 55, would make way as chief executive for Larry Page, 37, who co-founded Google with Sergey Brin. \"Between the three of us, I have always been the person who believes the most in expanding into China,\" he claimed. Mr Schmidt will remain as \"executive chairman\", a role he said would be two-thirds external and one-third internal, with most of his time devoted to customers and partners. Referring to the Davos shindig, he said that \"the great regret is that there are not more Chinese leaders here - both political leaders as well as business leaders\" - in contrast with the number of Indian attendees. He said Google's leadership reshuffle was a \"clarification of roles\" intended \"simply so that we could make decisions more quickly\". He denied that the change was due to a lack of innovation at the company, although he conceded there had been a sense that decision-making was taking too long. Cultural sensitivities Mr Schmidt spoke about the importance to the company of taking into consideration the cultural sensitivities of different countries. \"It makes sense to me that governments will play a role in watching what we do,\" he said, referring to anti-trust and privacy concerns. He cited the example of Germany, where there was particular concern about Google's plan to photograph the roadside facade of every house in the country for its Streetview database. The firm offered German homeowners the right to opt out before the pictures were even taken, and nearly 3% duly did that. But despite this initial opposition, \"Germany is the second-highest user on a percentage basis of Streetview of any country in the world,\" he said. \"We know that German consumers really love our product.\" On Wikileaks, Mr Schmidt said the company had decided to make leaked documents searchable via its website, irrespective of the US government's opinion, because they believed there was no legal threat to them under American law. As for China, he said there were \"censorship laws that we simply do not like\", causing the company to relocate to Hong Kong last year. Google is still censored by the Beijing authorities - without Google's co-operation - via the \"Great Firewall of China\". But Mr Schmidt said that the arrangement was \"stable\" for them, and appeared to be the same for China, who recently renewed their licence. However, he cautioned that China could \"arbitrarily cut it off at any point\". Face-off? The Google executive chairman rejected suggestions that the company had lost its edge. \"We are the innovator and leader at scale,\" he said, citing among others its maps products and its new Chrome operating system. But he admitted that social networks like Facebook might have stolen a march on the company. \"We have been late at adding social capabilities to our core products,\" he said, despite claiming that the search engine was still experiencing high growth precisely because they continued adding innovations to it. He dismissed Facebook as a threat to the company and was poaching staff: \"We hire more people in a week than the total number of people who have left to go to Facebook.\" But he criticised social networks for being \"walled gardens\" - shielding its members' data from search engines like Google's - claiming their consumers would be better off if more information were disclosed. \"These closed systems of information threaten to some degree the... openness and accessibility of the [web],\" he said.", "output": "Google: Eric Schmidt hints at China ambitions", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Viagra As well as being the birthplace of the NHS, the (ahem) far-reaching potential of what was then known simply as sildenafil was first spotted in Wales - at a clinical research facility in Merthyr Tydfil. In 1993, a clinical trial into a potential heart drug threw up an unexpected result. The male volunteers - thought to be former miners - were asked an open question about any \"other effects\" they had experienced. Millions around the world were to benefit from their honesty - the drug was developed as a treatment for impotence and Viagra became one of the most prescribed drugs in the world. It has been used to treat other illnesses such as pulmonary hypertension, saving the lives of many babies, and there is now further research into whether it can help combat rare brain cancers. Dr David Brown, one of the co-inventors of Viagra, said he would like to get in contact with the Merthyr volunteers - whom he never met - if they were willing, because of the impact they had across the world. \"They made history - they probably were just desperate to earn a bit of income but they've made a big difference to many people's lives and they should feel good about that. \"If our research in cancer proves correct I think that good to humanity is going to expand massively in the next 10 years or so.\" Jellyfish Jellyfish may seem an unlikely source of human healing but they are contributing to scientific advances. Wales-based company Jellagen has created a business by harvesting the marine creature off the coast of Pembrokeshire. It uses them to create collagen products medical researchers can use, mainly aimed at the regenerative medicine market. 3D-printed implants Using 3D printing, Cardiff Metropolitan University's PDR research consultancy worked with surgeons at Morriston Hospital in Swansea to develop tailor-made implants for facial and cranial reconstruction - for example replacing a jaw bone. Now they have developed software so surgeons can cut out the middleman and design each individual implant themselves before sending it off to be printed. They also print a replica of the patient's skull (pictured) so they can practise the specific procedure before they operate. Now the PDR team are in the early stages of applying similar technology to preparing for spinal operations. 'Hubble telescope' of brain scanners This image of the brain was produced at Cardiff University by a \"Connectom\" scanner. It is a special type of MRI scanner and one of only three in the world, putting the city at the forefront of research into neurological conditions including MS, schizophrenia, dementia and epilepsy. The scanner can map the brain's axons - effectively wires - which are so thin it would take 50 of them to match the thickness of a human hair. Prof Derek Jones, CUBRIC's director, said it was like getting hold of the Hubble telescope when you've been using binoculars. \"The promise for researchers is that we can start to look at structure and function together for the first time,\" he said. The return of leeches As plastic surgery medical journal PMFA dryly noted: \"Patient acceptance is sometimes a barrier to [leech] therapy, particularly when sensitive regions of the body are involved.\" Two hundred years ago Wales claimed to be the leech-farming capital of Europe but medical leech use dropped off in the early 1900s. Now they are back and used for reconstructive surgery worldwide thanks to the anti-clotting properties of their saliva. There is also ongoing research into whether they can help relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Thankfully the women of Wales are no longer expected to wander barefoot around puddles on the mudflats of Pembrokeshire and Gwent to \"collect\" leeches on their ankles - they are now cultivated in laboratory. Biopharm in Hendy, Carmarthenshire, supplies 60,000 leeches to hospitals throughout Europe, making it one of the UK's biggest suppliers.", "output": "NHS at 70: Viagra to leeches, how Wales advanced medicine", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Theresa May chaired a special cabinet meeting at Chequers on Wednesday 31 August to discuss the government's approach. Mrs May opened the meeting by repeating the \"Brexit means Brexit\" mantra she's been using since the day she launched her leadership campaign. \"We must continue to be very clear that Brexit means Brexit. That we're going to make a success of it. That means there's no second referendum, no attempts to sort of stay in the EU by the back door. We're actually going to deliver on this,\" she told cabinet ministers. Beyond that, the prime minister has said precious little that defines the future relationship with the EU she is seeking. After the cabinet meeting, a Downing Street spokeswoman dropped a couple of hints when she said: \"The model we are seeking is one unique to the United Kingdom and not an off-the-shelf solution. \"This must mean controls on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services\". Only when there's an agreed negotiating position will the prime minister trigger what's called Article 50 - the mechanism to formally begin two years of EU exit talks. Mrs May has already said this will not happen before the end of 2016. The Labour leadership contender, Owen Smith, wants his party to vote against Article 50 being triggered unless the PM agrees to give the public another vote on the final Brexit deal. Downing Street has said there is \"no need for a parliamentary vote\". Economy Theresa May was quick to rule out an emergency budget following the EU referendum. However, she called for the government's \"surplus by 2020\" target to be dropped, the day before then-chancellor George Osborne announced that decision. The new chancellor, Philip Hammond, has said he is prepared to \"reset\" UK economic policy, if necessary, in his Autumn statement. Mrs May set out some of her thinking on economic reform in a leadership campaign speech in Birmingham on 11 July. She talked about improving productivity, issuing more bonds to pay for public works and overhauling corporate governance. In her speech launching her leadership bid, she said that if faced with a choice between spending cuts, increased borrowing or tax rises \"the priority must be to avoid tax increases\". Hinkley Point One major economic decision that is expected in the \"early autumn\" is on the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant. The government unexpectedly put off a decision shortly after Theresa May became prime minister. The former cabinet minister, Sir Vince Cable, has said that, as home secretary, Mrs May was concerned about China's involvement in the deal. Her chief of staff and long-serving adviser, Nick Timothy, has previously expressed security concerns about the Hinkley deal. China's ambassador to the UK has warned that any decision not to go ahead with Hinkley could damage relations between the two countries. If a decision is not made before Theresa May travels to China for the G20 summit, questions over Hinkley Point's future could become a dominant feature during the trip. New runway Another big, much-delayed decision due this autumn is on airport expansion. After the Brexit vote, the then transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin put off an announcement until \"at least October\". The Davies commission, published in July 2015, set out three options and recommended building a third runway at Heathrow. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Education Secretary Justine Greening have strongly opposed that idea. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is on the record supporting Gatwick's expansion instead. The prime minister, whose Maidenhead constituency is on the Heathrow flight path, is chairing the Cabinet sub-committee that will decide. Social reform Mrs May has spoken about making \"Britain a country that works, not for a privileged few, but for every one of us\". In both her leadership speeches and in her first address as prime minister, she highlighted what she called \"burning injustices\". \"If you're born poor you will die on average nine years earlier than others. If you're black, you're treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you're white. If you're a white, working class boy, you're less likely than anybody else in Britain to go to university. If you're at a state school, you're less likely to reach the top professions than if you're educated privately. If you're a woman, you will earn less than a man. If you suffer from mental health problems, there's not enough help to hand. If you're young, you'll find it harder than ever before to own your own home\" She has not said exactly how she intends to tackle these issues but she has committed to doing so. Mrs May chaired a new cabinet sub-committee on social reform in Downing Street on 1 September. It seems reasonable to expect more on this agenda in her speech at the Conservative Party conference on 5 October. Education In the context of social reform, Mrs May has specifically talked about school reform. She was due to give more detail on her plans had the Conservative leadership contest continued. The Daily Telegraph has reported that she wants to end the ban on new grammar schools in England. The Department for Education has confirmed that the new secretary of state, Justine Greening, is \"looking at the issue\" having told the BBC that she is \"open-minded\" about it. As a child, the prime minister won a place at a grammar school which converted to a comprehensive during her time there. Devolution One other area where Theresa May has signalled a potentially different approach is on devolution. In July Theresa May promised \"a proper industrial strategy to get the whole economy firing. And a plan to help not one or even two of our great regional cities but every single one of them\". Whatever that means, it does not appear to mean ditching the Northern Powerhouse, which continues to have a dedicated minister. Writing in the Yorkshire Post and the Birmingham Mail, Mrs May also confirmed plans to go ahead with mayoral elections next year. Scotland Theresa May stressed her commitment to the Union as she arrived in Downing Street as PM: \"We believe in the union, the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\". Within two days she travelled to Edinburgh to meet Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Ms Sturgeon has said a second independence referendum is \"highly likely\" following the Brexit vote and has begun a \"listening exercise\" to gauge support. At the same time, Ms Sturgeon is seeking to retain Scotland's links with the EU as part of the UK's exit negotiations. The prime minister said she was \"willing to listen to options\" without giving any firm commitments. After the Brexit cabinet at Chequers, a spokeswoman for the prime minister made clear that none of the devolved nations would have a veto over the timing or content of the negotiations to leave the EU.", "output": "What's in Theresa May's in-tray?", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Offences such as pickpocketing, shoplifting and bicycle theft rose 2%, the only crime category to show a rise. Separate data, based on interviews with 46,000 adults, suggests crime levels are broadly flat. They were conducted as part of the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), previously known as the British Crime Survey, which asks people whether they have been the victim of any offences during the past year. About 9.5 million incidents took place, according to the survey respondents. 'Other thefts' The ONS figures show crime recorded by police forces fell by 4% to below the four million mark for the first time since 1989. Officials said the fall in homicide figures was not unique to England and Wales and there had been reductions in Europe, Asia and North America since the mid 1990s. The number of homicides rose from around 300 a year in the 1960s to about 1,000 a decade ago. The number last year was the same as in 1983. The figures also show attempted murders also fell substantially, indicating that the fall in homicides was not principally because surgeons were saving people's lives through advances in medical techniques, said BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw. The \"other thefts\" category also included people stealing items from garages and sheds and rose 4% the previous year. More than 1.1 million such incidents were recorded by police last year. John Flatley, head of crime statistics at the ONS, suggested the increase was mostly driven by rises in thefts of metal, mobile phones and bags left unattended in pubs and bars. He added the CSEW indicated that pickpocketing had risen 17% in the last two years and this \"might represent an emerging upward trend mirroring that seen in the comparable recorded crime category\". Mr Flatley said the estimated 5,000 offences committed during last summer's riots had been \"swallowed up by the larger volume reductions we've seen elsewhere\". The recorded crime figures also show: Policing Minister Nick Herbert said the figures showed crime has continued to fall despite the challenge of reduced police budgets and \"give the lie to the spurious claim that there is a simple link between overall police numbers and the crime rate\". He said the introduction of elected police commissioners in November would make forces more accountable for \"areas of local concern\" highlighted by the ONS. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said the figures were a \"credit to those officers and staff who have faced the challenge of major efficiencies while continuing to tackle crime in our communities\". Separate crime figures were previously released by the Scottish Government and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. In 2011-12, Scotland's eight police forces recorded 3% fewer crimes than the previous year, while offences in Northern Ireland dropped 1.6% year-on-year.", "output": "Crime data: Homicide at 30-year England and Wales low", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The change could take effect from July, but first it requires approval by the European Parliament and member states. The deal was offered in return for Turkey taking back migrants who crossed the Aegean Sea to Greece. The EU fears that without it, Turkey will not control migration. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, welcomed the recommendation, saying the visa proposals have opened a new page in Turkey's relations with the EU. What is the Schengen agreement? Turks look to EU to scrap visas 'Still work to be done' The visa liberalisation deal remains controversial in a number of capitals across the EU, but the Commission praised Turkey for its progress in fulfilling its requirements, particularly in recent weeks. Vice-President Frans Timmermans said: \"There is still work to be done as a matter of urgency, but if Turkey sustains the progress made, they can meet the remaining benchmarks.\" The Commission outlined several outstanding issues, with Turkey required to do more to tackle corruption and bring its laws on terrorism in line with European standards, among others. Five benchmarks still to be met by Turkey: Full European Commission Statement The commission is also giving Turkey until the end of the year to upgrade its passports, so that they meet the latest biometric standards. Mr Timmermans stressed that no Turkish citizen would enter the EU without a visa if they do not have a biometric passport with a facial image and fingerprint data. He said: \"I would rather have somebody at my border with a biometric passport where I can be sure that the person carrying the passport is actually mentioned in the passport, than a person with an old-fashioned passport and a paper visa.\" The deal will scrap the requirement for Turks to get a three-month, short-stay Schengen visa for tourism or business trips. Visa-free travel will apply to all EU Member States except for Ireland and the UK, and to the four Schengen associated countries - Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. But it will not grant Turks the right to get a job in Europe. Separate to the deal with Turkey, the Commission also proposed granting visa-free travel to citizens of Kosovo. The tiny Balkan state declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and is still not recognised by Belgrade and five EU states. Under the plan, Kosovans with biometric passports would be able to enter the Schengen zone without a visa and stay for up to 90 days. Migrant crisis role Turkey has threatened to stop taking back migrants from Greece if the EU fails to deliver on visa liberalisation. The large influx of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe from Turkey, and from North Africa, has caused a political crisis among EU states. Under the EU-Turkey agreement, migrants who have arrived illegally in Greece since 20 March are to be sent back to Turkey if they do not apply for asylum or if their claim is rejected. For each Syrian migrant returned to Turkey, the EU is to take in another Syrian who has made a legitimate request. Parliament's concerns The deal will now be sent to the European Parliament, which has already said it will not vote on the proposal until the Commission confirms all of the conditions have been met. Concerns have been raised in Parliament before that the visa-waiver looks like a reward for Turkey, because of its co-operation in the migrant crisis. It says Ankara falls short of many EU human rights benchmarks. MEPs accept that Turkey is a \"key strategic partner\" for the EU. But they say reforms have slowed down in Turkey in many areas, including freedom of speech and judicial independence. MEPs have also voiced concern about continuing fighting in south-eastern Turkey between government troops and Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels, whom the government in Ankara describes as \"terrorists\". A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "output": "EU backs Turkey visa deal, but says conditions must be met", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Apple said it appreciated all the customer feedback it was receiving about the app and would work hard to improve it. The problems emerged a day before the global launch of its iPhone 5 handset. Hundreds of people have camped out for days to ensure they are among the first to buy one of the smartphones. At Apple's flagship store on London's Regent Street almost 1300 people were in line for one of the phones. The mapping system comes with updates to Apple's phone operating system and is bundled in with the iPhone 5. Lost towns Apple embarked on the development of its own mapping software after deciding it no longer wanted to use Google's equivalent. Apple's own system has been created using data from navigation firm TomTom and others. In a statement Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the launch of Apple Maps was a major undertaking for the firm. \"We are continuously improving it, and as Maps is a cloud-based solution, the more people use it, the better it will get,\" she said. \"We appreciate all of the customer feedback and are working hard to make the customer experience even better,\" added Ms Muller. Apple was also planning to work closely with external developers to put the work they have done on apps for local transport into the mapping software, she said. On Friday TomTom, which provides the data underlying the map app, said it was \"more than willing\" to help Apple improve the application. \"We stand by the quality of our maps,\" said TomTom spokeswoman Caroline Fisher. She added that although TomTom did not have a team in place at Apple it was happy to supply developers to help make the app work better. It is unclear whether this will be enough to mollify users who took to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and other social media networks to mock the failings of the mapping application. The BBC received a lot of complaints about Apple's maps, with users saying that some towns, such as Stratford Upon Avon, were missing and others were in the wrong place. In addition some places, including a train station, were shown to be in the ocean and many others were wrongly labelled. Before the release of the iOS6, Apple's updated mobile operating system, many developers had warned about the poor quality of the mapping app. It was particularly poor, they said, at finding local businesses via search. Apple seems to be aware of a need to beef up its mapping expertise. Many tech news sites noted that Apple had placed a lot of adverts on its jobs site for mapping experts in the past week or so.

Her cousin said it was \"horrendous\" to have to listen to his lies during the court case. Hannah O'Callaghan said: \"It felt like Grace was on trial, yet not able to defend herself.\" She said of the planned new law: \"It won't change things for us but hopefully it will stop any other family having to go through this. \"Men must not be allowed to use this defence as an excuse to kill women, knowing they can get a lesser sentence. \"Families won't have to sit and listen to only one side of the story while the victim is re-victimised and does not get the chance to tell their side.\" Miss Millane's death provoked an outpouring of anger, partly because of her killer's attempts to explain her death. Personal details about the 22-year-old's sex life were discussed in court and reported around the world.

Norwegian security authorities said they were investigating the possibility that the cyber-attack was caused by a relatively new form of ransomware known as LockerGoga. However, they added it was not yet clear that this was the case. A spokesman for Hydro also told the BBC that he could not yet confirm who was behind the attack. He added that digital systems at Hydro's main smelting plants were programmed to ensure machinery worked efficiently. However, these systems had had to be turned off at some of the facilities. \"They are much more reliant today on computerised systems than they were some years ago,\" a spokesman said. \"But they have the option of reverting back to methods that are not as computerised, so we are able to continue production.\" Work was also stopped at some metal extrusion plants, where aluminium is processed into products such as building facades. Relying on back-ups The firm said it was working to contain and \"neutralise\" the attack and added that it had not caused any safety-related incidents. It added that it had data backups ready with which to restore systems once the virus had been dealt with. Norway's state cyber-security agency is helping Hydro to respond to the incident. Cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont told the BBC that if the LockerGoga ransomware had been used, it would likely have been deployed to Hydro's systems manually by an attacker. This could have been done by someone who had gained administrator access to those systems. \"For an industrial manufacturing business this is potentially bad news, as it may have spread across their company, including near industrial control systems,\" added Mr Beaumont.", "output": "Huge aluminium plants hit by 'severe' ransomware attack", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

It occurs in five or six births every year in the UK and there is no cure. Her mother Vicky, from Uphall, West Lothian, said: \"We've been given the worst diagnosis you can have.\" Mirryn was born at 31 weeks and weighed just over 3lbs. In January 2017 she was diagnosed with delayed myelination, a problem with the nervous system. But further MRI tests revealed the full extent of her condition and she has now lost all motor skills. 'Never tried to hold her bottle' Her mother Vicky told BBC Scotland's John Beattie programme: \"It came to about the six months stage when babies should be holding bottles; when they should be reaching out trying to touch things; when their motor skills start to develop. \"Mirryn never tried to hold her bottle and could only hold gaze for maybe a couple of minutes then move away. As she got older and should have been doing more things, she wasn't rolling over or trying to touch a ball or any toy in front of her. \"There was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing because she was premature - people saying it will come, it's just delayed. My gut was going, 'no it's not'. She's now starting to lose more functions - even the little ones that she had are now all gone, including swallowing.\" The condition Mirryn has is a rare disorder of the nervous system which typically begins in childhood. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the first signs of Batten disease are impaired muscle co-ordination and seizures. Vicky said she faced a battle to get a conclusive diagnosis after first speaking to her health visitor. She said: \"Mirryn was just over 3lbs when she was born at 31 weeks. She was in hospital for quite a while but just with jaundice, nothing else. Everything came back fine from brain scans and all the tests they run on premature babies. \"I tried to talk to my health visitor who referred me to St John's hospital in Livingston and it was a bit of a struggle to try and get them to pay attention to me. \"But we eventually got a really amazing doctor called Dr Valentine and he instantly referred us for EEGs and MRI tests.\" That was in December 2016 and Mirryn was initially diagnosed with delayed myelination, which means signals don't get through to the brain properly. Following continued pleas from Vicky, Mirryn had two more MRI scans and was eventually diagnosed with the CLN1 strain of Batten's in January this year. A full support network has now been put in place for Mirryn and her family are determined to make the rest of her life as memorable as possible. Vicky said: \"She's got a palliative care team and community nurses, so the support aspect now that we've got the Batten's diagnosis is amazing. \"The support from the public as well is totally heart-warming and the messages that Mirryn gets sent show us that we need to stand up and say, Batten's is real, dementia in children is real - it's very rare but it happens. \"I think the reason that it took so long to get her diagnosis is because, even now, doctors that see her in the Sick Kid's Hospital or in Glasgow have no idea what Batten's is. \"Now, it's just about us making memories. There's nothing we can do to slow it down - there's nothing we can do to cure it. \"We had wanted to take her to Disneyland Paris but unfortunately due to Mirryn's condition I just didn't want to take the risk of being in the air if anything happened. \"So we've decided to bring Disney to our home town. It's taken a lot of work but we've got every single Disney character coming in fancy dress, we'll have a Disney show, Disney games, a bouncy castle.

Sharp, which has struggled amid falling sales and a rising yen, has had its credit rating cut to \"junk\" status. It said it was looking to restructure its business in an attempt to return to profitability. When a firm's bonds are rated as \"junk\" it means some institutions may no longer invest in them, making it harder for them to raise fresh capital. \"Sharp is in circumstances in which material doubt about its assumed going concern is found,\" the company said in a statement. Analysts said that given its troubles, Sharp may find it tough to survive in the long run. \"Perhaps it will not fail within this year, but I don't think Sharp has a viable business in the next three to five years,\" said Tetsuro Ii, chief executive of Commons Asset Management in Tokyo. \"The company hasn't got much time left and they need to cut off businesses that they can, conserve cash and... produce something that's really competitive.\" Growing troubles Sharp's troubles are not isolated. Most of the big Japanese electronics giants have seen their fortunes tumble in recent times. Also on Thursday, Sony reported a loss of 15.4bn yen for the July to September quarter. On Wednesday, Panasonic said that it now expected to make a loss of 765bn yen in the current financial year. It had previously forecast a profit of 50bn yen. Japanese electronics makers have been hurt by a slowing demand and falling prices of TVs in key markets. At the same time, rising competition from low-cost manufacturers coupled with a strong yen - which makes Japanese goods more expensive - has also hit their competitiveness. Faced with these challenges, Sharp, Sony and Panasonic have all announced plans to restructure their business in an attempt to cut costs and improve profitability. However, analysts said that while these attempts were a step in the right direction, it was unclear how the firms will drive future profit growth, not least because demand for their key products continued to remain subdued.", "output": "Sharp issues survival warning as it forecasts huge loss", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The Friends of Blencathra group has applied to Cumbria County Council to make the mountain a community asset. That would give the group six months to raise funds for the purchase, in which time no one else would be able to bid. The group would have to raise the asking price of \u00a31.75m, which would be fixed during the six months. The council will decide whether to put the mountain on its register of community assets on 1 July, the day before the deadline for sealed bids. Early stages If the group's application is unsuccessful, or it fails to raise the funds, it will have to compete with other bidders. Debbie Cosgrove, from Friends of Blencathra, said the six-month window would give the group time to \"sort out the funding\". \"We're pretty confident. People's interest has been absolutely fantastic. We've been getting calls from all over,\" she said.

The prizes cap a breakthrough year in which the star performed at the Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. She also has the UK's best selling album of 2012 so far. East London singer and rapper Plan B won two prizes at the 17th Music of Black Origin ceremony. The best male and best hip-hop/grime artist awards were reward for the critical and commercial success of his third album Ill Manors. The Mobo Awards were established in 1996 to champion artists that were under-represented in the mainstream. But with thousands of teenage fans letting out ear-splitting screams for their idols on the red carpet and inside the Echo Arena, Mobo artists now dominate the pop music world. Boy band JLS provoked a high-pitched frenzy on the red carpet before winning the prize for best video during the ceremony for Do You Feel What I Feel? There were also screams and chants for Kosovo-born, London-raised pop star Rita Ora, whose three UK number one singles this year helped her to the best newcomer crown. Labrinth, who rose to fame as a producer and writer for Tinie Tempah, was another popular winner, picking up the best song trophy for Earthquake, his hit collaboration with the rapper. He confirmed his transition to star status with a performance that saw him begin by playing a grand piano and end by wielding a guitar in front of banks of pyrotechnics. Labrinth is currently number one in the UK singles chart with a collaboration with Emeli Sande. Sande, a Scottish former medical student, returned to the Mobos three years after making her TV debut at the event. After scooping her hat-trick on Saturday, she said: \"I really didn't expect to get three. I feel fantastic, I feel like all the hard work pays off when you get acknowledgement like this, so I'm very happy.\" Colourful US rapper Nicki Minaj was named best international act, while Sean Paul won the reggae prize and Zoe Rahman picked up the award for best jazz act. Nigerian singer-songwriter D'Banj was named best African act and the award for best gospel artist went to Birmingham's Rachel Kerr. The surviving members of US R&B group TLC travelled to receive the outstanding contribution to music honour a decade after their bandmate Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes was killed in a car crash. And pop legend Dionne Warwick was bestowed with the Mobo lifetime achievement award. Other Mobo nominees ranged from hip-hop acts like Wiley and Professor Green to artists whose music is less obviously of black origin, such as singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran and teenage pop star Conor Maynard. But Maynard said: \"I grew up listening to people like Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder and a lot of my musical influences are black artists.\" JLS heartthrob Jonathan \"JB\" Gill said a lot had changed in the charts in recent years. \"I don't think that music of black origin is any longer unrepresented,\" he told BBC News. \"A few years ago guys like Wiley and Dizzee Rascal might not have been recognised, now they're getting to number one. That's an incredible step for music of black origin and the Mobo Awards. They're definitely starting to put a lot of artists on the map.\" But Mobo founder Kanya King rejected the suggestion that the Mobos' mission was now complete. \"The gospel winner, the jazz winner - where else are they going to get a platform?\" she said. \"Who else is going to champion them? \"And it's amazing to have someone like Dionne Warwick on the same stage as some of the up-and-coming stars. It helps to bring it to a global audience. Our work is never done.\" Warwick, known for hits like Heartbreaker and Walk On By, said that without black music, \"you wouldn't have any music\".

There are about six million households in this situation, according to the Resolution Foundation. The BBC News website asked three families who identified themselves as \"just about managing\" what they wanted to hear from Chancellor Philip Hammond. We will return to them after the Autumn Statement on Wednesday to see if the government has met their concerns. David Watssman, 34, Invergordon, near Inverness 'My wife works part-time, but half her money is lost to childcare' I have three children, and I work full-time while my wife works part-time, and together we earn around \u00a336,000. We've worked hard all our lives, don't smoke or drink, don't have expensive hobbies, don't have any great debts and watch our money carefully. Still, we just manage to keep our heads above water. It's harder than it should be and is so difficult to have a decent lifestyle and make the finances work. We haven't been on holiday for a couple of years - and the last time we went was after we had a windfall. I haven't seen much of a wage rise recently. I work in the salmon industry, and that has been hit by fish prices and the drop in the pound. I don't see many job prospects up here - but if I was to move the family away, that would mean extra costs in terms of housing. We have just sold our house and are looking to move but are currently living with my in-laws. If we didn't have family to rely on, it would be very difficult. Half of my wife's money is lost to childcare and the one thing I'd like to see the government do is increase the number of hours of subsidised childcare. Childcare costs is the one thing that is really stifling us, as my wife has to turn down work because of it. Lisa Shimmins, 30, Bembridge, Isle of Wight 'Everyone who works hard deserves to earn a decent wage' We just about get by - but after we pay our rent, council tax and all the other bills, there's not a lot left. We can't save. My partner works while I look after our young children, aged six years, two, and four months. He works really hard as a builder and earns about \u00a312 an hour. He's self-employed, so the amount he earns varies and if he is sick, we lose out on money. If we have a problem with the car, or if my partner needs a certain tool for work, we might not have the money to make the rent or council tax. So we end up paying much more later. When we go shopping, sometimes we can't believe we haven't got any money despite working. It feels like people who are not working are better off. It's unfair that you have to have [high level] education to make a decent living. Everyone who works hard deserves to earn a decent wage. We'd like to buy a property, but we just can't save up. The one thing I'd like to hear from the government is help for people like us to buy a home. Everyone should be entitled to a house. I also think that people on lower wages should pay less tax. Sarah, 48, Ickenham, north-west London 'The last week of the month is tough' I am a single mum, working full-time, paying my own mortgage and all my own bills. I work in a children's centre as a receptionist and earn just over \u00a321,000. I have a daughter at university, and I claim child tax credits, which I have to use to help her pay her rent. She is the last year of students to receive a grant, but it still isn't enough for her to pay rent and living costs. My son is at college, but I worry that I won't be able to help him go to university, because when he goes to university, the grants will have been abolished. I'm not officially low-income, although I don't earn very much at all, so I don't qualify for any help with housing costs or my income. There is no money for luxuries, holidays, new clothes or nights out for me. I try very hard to make sure the kids don't miss out, but I end up staying in all the time as I can't afford to go out. We get to the end of the month, and the bills are all paid. Sometimes I think I don't quite know how. I would never borrow money - no payday loans. The last week of the month is tough. I went on a budgeting course run by Christians Against Poverty. I don't have large debts, I don't smoke, drink, gamble and I try to give to charity monthly and I volunteer every month. I do everything I can to work hard and pay my own way, yet my situation is getting worse and worse. If interest rates go up, I'm going to find things even harder. We're also in the process of moving to a cheaper area in Hertfordshire. What do I want from government? I'd like them to reduce university fees and reinstate maintenance grants. I'd like them to re-examine the level they call low income. Whilst people's wages can potentially go up, they don't go up in line with costs.

They say there is huge confusion among government departments about responsibility for the territories. The government calls the criticism unfair and points to its creation of large marine protection areas. The UK holds jurisdiction over 19 British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies - parts of the British Empire that have not been granted independence or have voted to remain British territories. Their lands hold an extraordinary wealth of rare species: 94% of the UK's endemic species - found nowhere else in the world - are in outposts of the former empire. Among the endangered creatures are a giant frog called the Montserrat mountain chicken; the Spiky yellow woodlouse, existing only land the size of a tennis court on St Helena; and the Grand Cayman blue iguana. Representatives of 14 of the territories - ranging from Bermuda to Pitcairn and Gibraltar - joined the meeting of the UK Overseas Territories Conservation Forum on the Channel island of Alderney. The islands are highly vulnerable to climate change, but ministers complained that the government had almost halved Foreign Office spending on the climate. They also said cuts had eroded the capacity of the experts in the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), who used to offer conservation advice. The delegates in Alderney said other decisions on funding were going against them and that civil servants who had previously provided support are distracted by Brexit. Who's in charge? Confusion reigns over responsibility for supporting the islands, the ministers said. The Foreign Office has the policy lead but it delegates biodiversity issues to the environment department, Defra. The lead for the Crown Dependencies of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey (which includes Alderney) is with yet another department: the Ministry of Justice. Claude Hogan from Montserrat said: \"There is confusion in policy. We don't know the best person to approach and we end up going round in circles between different ministries. \"To protect the island and adapt to climate change we need to put in sea defences - but we only get enough money to go from one consultancy to the next.\" The territories had previously received support for environment-focused programmes from the aid department DFID. But they said that ministers have now switched interest towards traditional job creation - even though the islanders said their economic future depends on a healthy environment. Brexit is a major concern, as many of the territories have received substantial funding from the EU. The minister from from Pitcairn, Michelle Christian, said: \"We can apply for EU funding for environmental issues such as soil erosion, waste management and water, so we are concerned about the future.\" Gibraltar's minister John Cortes, a professional ecologist, said he was nervous at the possibility of Spanish encroachment on protected marine zones after the UK has left the EU. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said the government was already working to improve cross-departmental policies on the territories. She pointed to the internationally-acclaimed programme of marine protection around some key territories. The zone around Pitcain, for instance, will protect an area of ocean three and a half times the size of Britain. The spokeswoman added: \"Climate change and energy work is a network-wide priority. The Foreign Office works closely in partnership with departments across Whitehall on the international climate change agenda.\" 'Critical environmental issues' The government's delegate had been forced to withdraw from the meeting in Alderney because of the election. The meeting's organisers said the government had declined to foot the bill for the meeting, which was funded by Alderney in conjunction with voluntary groups. They applauded the government's marine programme, but said many of the most critical environmental issues were on land. Their best hope is that when Brexit is settled, the UK will devote more of its time and energy to them, rather than less.

It was 2004, and the country was barely emerging from a decade of war. Teaching, then accounting at the office set up to recover properties stolen under the Mobutu government, had once offered promising careers to Mr Osombo. But those jobs were synonymous with unpaid salaries and hardship. A native of the mineral-rich Kasai region, he set up shop in Kinshasa's open-air diamond market. Like him, all the diamond dealers who sit at the plastic tables under trees that line one side street in the Congolese capital's city centre hail from Kasai. Security issues Their first reaction to a visit by a journalist is cautious, if not downright hostile. The diamond trade is traditionally secretive and the Kasai region is the stronghold of firebrand opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, which has led to widespread intimidation against Kasaians. These traders are not looking for publicity. But after a few visits and assurances that reporting will be strictly business-focused, Mr Osombo and his colleagues finally give a tour of their open-air market. One thing they are not worried about is security, despite the dozens of diamonds being traded within easy reach of passers-by. \"We have a business association with its own president, vice-president, secretary (that's me) and we have our own security agents on the market. We control everything,\" Mr Osombo said. \"If a suspicious person comes to the market, if we see something is not right, our security agents will stop them and call the police.\" Non-conflict diamonds Traders here say they can recognise Congolese diamonds, which are mined outside conflict zones, and refuse stones smuggled from countries like Zimbabwe. The market registers the identity of all buyers and sellers, something Mr Osombe says ensures traceability and helps keep \"blood diamonds\" out. His business fits in a briefcase: diamonds and cash - US dollars only - to conduct transactions, as well as a few light tools, are all he needs for a day's work. \"Each one of us brings his own capital and occupies his own table corner. We buy diamonds and resell them to official export houses. The majority of our buyers are Jewish and Lebanese people who take care of the export side of things,\" Mr Osombo explains. DRC legislation reserves the right to diamond trading inside the country to Congolese nationals, with two layers of middlemen involved: some are based close to the mines and buy directly from artisanal diggers, while Kinshasa-based traders like Mr Osombo are closer to the foreign exporters. The foundation of his business is $5,000 in capital, which he rotates between diamonds, shipments of clothes and other Chinese-made goods sent upriver to the mining regions of Kasai, where four people work as his commercial agents. Apart from diamonds, they also send him back agricultural products such as maize and cassava. Each month, Mr Osombo says his business returns \"10-15% of his capital\" - $500 to $750, compared with the $150 he earned as a civil servant. Middlemen Those who don't have a wad of carefully saved banknotes under their mattress to buy and sell their own diamonds offer their services to established traders.

Another inmate, Charles Warner, was scheduled to be executed on 29 April. Last month, a judge ruled that the secrecy surrounding the source of the state's lethal injection drugs was unconstitutional. The court decision came as US states are having increasing trouble obtaining drugs used in executions, amid an embargo from European pharmaceutical firms. Critics say the states risk botching executions and causing unnecessary suffering with impure drugs. In January, an execution in Ohio took 25 minutes to complete, as the inmate reportedly gasped and made choking noises in the moments before he was pronounced dead. The state used two untried drugs to kill convicted murderer and rapist Dennis McGuire after the maker of the previous execution drug refused to allow its use. 'No proof' Oklahoma state law blocks officials from revealing - even during court proceedings - the identities of the companies supplying the drugs used to sedate the inmates, paralyse their respiratory systems, and stop their hearts. The challenge to Oklahoma's law was brought by Lockett, who received the death penalty for the 1999 shooting of a 19-year-old woman, and Warner, who was convicted for the 1997 murder and rape of an 11-month-old girl. Oklahoma County district court Judge Patricia Parrish struck down the secrecy law on 26 March, saying the protocol that prevented the inmates from seeking information about the drugs used violated their rights. The state said on 1 April that the men would be executed using midazolam, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride - a combination never before used in Oklahoma, according to the Associated Press. But the lawyers for the inmates said they had received no information showing that the drugs were \"safe, or to prove that they were acquired legally\". The supreme court stayed the executions on Monday until final determination of the issues surrounding the secrecy law are settled, according to reports. Thirty-two US states have death penalty laws and 18, as well as the District of Columbia, have abolished capital punishment.

It appeared to be a protest against the government's plan to limit access to sites deemed inappropriate. Tens of thousands of people have signed a petition against the proposal they call the \"Great Firewall of Thailand\". The name is a reference to the so-called \"Great Firewall of China\" commonly used to refer to the Chinese government's censorship over internet content. 'Inappropriate websites' A DDoS attack works by exceeding a website's capacity to handle internet traffic. They are usually orchestrated by a program or bot. But on Wednesday, calls went out on social media in Thailand encouraging people to visit the websites and repeatedly refresh them. Among the targets were the site of the ministry of information, communications and technology (ICT) and the main government website thaigov.go.th. ICT Deputy Permanent Secretary Somsak Khaosuwan said the site did not crash because of an attack but because it was overloaded by visitors checking to see whether and attack was happening, the Bangkok Post reports. 'Single gateway' Since seizing power, the Thai military government has increased censorship, blocked websites and criminally charged critics for comments made online. News it was planning to set up a single government-controlled gateway as a \"tool to control inappropriate websites and information flows from other countries\" emerged last month. Internet gateways are the point at which countries connect to the world wide web. Analysis: Jonathan Head, BBC News, Bangkok What are Thais angry about? The cabinet had ordered a single gateway to be imposed in order to block \"inappropriate websites\" and control the flow of information from overseas. That the decision, made at a cabinet meeting on 30 June, was kept secret has caused more alarm. Why does the government want a single gateway? A statement by Minister for Information Uttama Savanayana that the decision was not yet final, and that the single gateway was only intended to reduce the cost of internet access. This was met with disbelief by many Thais, and then the shutdown of government websites. Will the DDoS have any impact? Thai netizens insist this is not an attack, but a form of civil disobedience. The military may still push ahead with its firewall, whatever the opposition. The need for control, as it confronts the task of managing a sensitive royal succession, will probably trump any concerns it may have for the digital economy. Thailand used to have just a single gateway but slow internet speeds led to the liberalisation of the industry and today there are 10, operated by private and state-owned companies. The apparent attack renewed the vibrant debate over the single gateway plan on social media, with many users declaring the end of privacy. \"Thailand is developing. Thailand is developing into North Korea,\" one Twitter user said. \"I personally & professionally support free flow of information & fair competition on ICTs,\" said Supinya Klangnarong from the National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commissions (NBTC) on Facebook. \"Hope NBTC's website won't be attacked tonight.

He has gone public with criticism of Superdry's strategy after its latest profit warning last week. The firm's shares have fallen from almost \u00a320 in January to \u00a37.29p apiece. Mr Dunkerton told the BBC he was offering to return to Superdry \"in any capacity\" to correct what he described as a failing strategy. He argued that the policy of putting new products in its stores more frequently was misguided. It should focus on its core jackets and hoodies and offer a far wider range of variations online, he said: \"Superdry is a series of core products - stick with them and tweak them.\" 'The ship needs to turn' The decision to start discounting jackets two days before Christmas meant there was not enough stock for the rest of the winter, Mr Dunkerton added. \"This is just about the strategy - it's not about ego,\" he said. \"The ship needs to turn and it needs to turn quickly.\" Mr Dunkerton founded Superdry in Cheltenham 15 years ago with designer James Holder, who left two years ago and still owns a 9.7% stake in the company. He said his co-founder backed his plan to return to the company as both believed they could no longer stand back and watch as the shares continue to sink. Mr Dunkerton said any retail shareholders he spoke to also wanted him to go back. He has hired the broker Cenkos to help persuade institutional investors to support his campaign. However, Aberdeen Standard Investments, which is the second-largest shareholder in Superdry with a 10.6% stake, has criticised Mr Dunkerton for failing to make contact before going public with his campaign. Frederik Nassauer, a fund manager at Aberdeen Standard, has gone on record to support the company's management and strategy. \"Euan Sutherland was appointed chief executive in 2014, as Julian decided to step aside as chief executive after several profit warnings,\" he told The Times. The other major shareholders, Old Mutual, Artemis and Blackrock, which have stakes of 7%, 5% and 4.7% respectively, are yet to reveal their stance on Mr Dunkerton's campaign. Peter Bamford, chairman of Superdry, said the former chief executive had raised several issues about strategy since he left the business. \"We have reviewed and discussed these issues and, while we have sympathy with some of his points, we have a different view on the best strategy or approach to addressing them,\" he said. \"The board believes that Julian's view of strategy has not evolved with the needs of the business. We remain fully committed to our successful global digital brand strategy and the board is confident that Superdry has in place the right leadership.\" The company makes up to three quarters of its profits in the second half of the year and has embarked on an 18-month plan to broaden its range in order to be less dependent on sales of winter jackets, jumpers and hoodies. Superdry last week blamed poor sales over the summer on unseasonably hot weather in the UK, continental Europe and on the US east coast. That situation continued into October. The profit warning sent shares down by a fifth and the company is now worth just under \u00a3600m. In July Mr Dunkerton raised \u00a371m by selling 5.5 million shares to institutional investors at \u00a312.85 a share, reducing his stake from 25.2% to 18.5%.", "output": "Superdry founder Julian Dunkerton seeks return to the fold", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Dog theft has been rising since 2012. Insurance firm Direct Line is the latest to publish figures, from police forces in England and Wales, showing that 121 more dogs were stolen in 2017 than the year before with almost 2,000 reported to the police last year. These numbers were released under Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation from 38 police forces in England and Wales. There are 44 police forces around the UK with Scotland and Northern Ireland each having a single centralised force. A similar exercise was carried out by another firm, the Insurance Emporium. It also obtained data under FOI from 38 forces, including the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The Insurance Emporium looked at dog thefts between 2015 and 2017 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, finding a rise from about 1,700 to 2,000 a year in that time period, although the average number in Northern Ireland actually fell by a quarter. Neither company managed to get hold of Scottish data. Animal charity Blue Cross, which provides advice for people on how to prevent their animals being stolen, has been carrying out similar research since 2010. Blue Cross's Louise Lee said that it's \"impossible to say why there was a drop and worryingly now a rise in crimes involving pet theft\". She added: \"Perhaps more forces are better at recording this sort of data or more owners feel like they can come forward and report their pet as stolen, not just missing.\" This is a sense shared by the Insurance Emporium, whose spokesperson said: \"Dog thefts are rising due to more accurate reporting of crime statistics by regional forces, we think. \"This means the public are able to get a more fair reflection of the problem of dog theft.\" Pedigree cats are also stolen but in much smaller numbers, with certain breeds far more likely to be targeted. The top five most commonly stolen dog breeds in 2017 according to police reports, were: And according to the Royal Veterinary College, the most commonly-owned breeds in the UK are: Direct Line says the fact that specific breeds are stolen suggests the influence of celebrities driving up the popularity - and therefore the value to criminals - of \"designer dogs\". Head of pet insurance at the firm, Prit Powar, said: \"The fashion for certain types of dogs means people are willing to pay thousands for an animal, which unfortunately makes them prime targets for thieves.\" The insurance company said the rise in the numbers of crossbreeds being stolen coincided with the rise in popularity of breeds like cockerpoos and puggles. And another commonly stolen breed, French bulldogs, may have been popularised by celebrity owners like Leonardo DiCaprio, Lady Gaga and Madonna, it claims. The company also puts the rise in ownership of huskies and \"other wolf-like breeds\" in part down to \"the Game of Thrones effect\" although this is hard to pin down. In some cases these dog-nappings are thought to be carried out by organised criminal gangs who sell the animals on the black market or demand a ransom. While on average, thefts are rising, that's not the case throughout the UK. Dog theft is far more common in certain parts of the country than in others. In the West Midlands police force area there's been a 24% fall in thefts between 2016 and 2017 while in the East Midlands there was a 43% rise in the same period. We're talking about relatively small overall figures so these changes aren't quite as dramatic as they sound, but that still equates to the difference between about 40 more, or fewer, animals being stolen from their owners. Richard Jordan, from campaign group Pet Theft Awareness, said: \"We actually want to pay tribute to the police for starting to take this type of crime more seriously. \"Some of the regions with the highest figures are actually the ones we know are taking steps to tackle it, which include more effective recording of data.\" He added that an estimated one in three people who have their pets stolen report the incident to the police.

And we favour animal charities with our pennies, too. When people who have donated to charity in a previous month were asked which causes they gave to in a 2016 survey, animal charities were the second most popular recipient after medical research charities. They came in ahead of charities for children and young people according to the Charities Aid Foundation. Combined, those three categories accounted for three-quarters of all causes donated to in the UK last year. There was some seasonal variation, however. Homelessness charities don't appear in the top five causes people gave to throughout the year but accounted for almost a quarter of giving in December around the Christmas period. But that's just looking at what proportion of donors gave to those causes, not how much they gave. Once you look at that, the proportion of all donations going to animal charities fell to only 7%, and medical research charities to 8%, while 20% of all money donated in 2016 went to religious organisations despite far fewer people donating to them. Despite, or perhaps because of, this pet-loving culture, the RSPCA says it receives more than a million calls a year reporting concerns about an animal's welfare. They say that on average every 30 seconds someone in England and Wales dials their helpline. About a tenth of these calls lead to an animal being rescued and around half of these go on to be re-homed.", "output": "The rise of the dog-napper", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The Daily Telegraph says he faced an \"onslaught of criticism\" over his handling of the campaign, while the Sun reports that he \"infuriated\" MPs by continuing to blame Brexit and the media. HuffPost UK believes that part of the emotion stemmed from the lack of any personal apology from Mr Corbyn. Paul Waugh, the website's executive editor for politics, suggests that whoever replaces him as leader, Tuesday's meeting \"showed just how difficult it will be for any pro-Corbyn contender to keep order in a shattered party in Parliament\". The Spectator's deputy political editor, Katy Balls, notes that \"despite the anguish, not one MP called directly on [Mr Corbyn] to go immediately\". Instead, she says, the focus was on ensuring that the leadership contest next year was a \"fair fight\". The Guardian has an interview with the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, in which he criticises what he calls the \"baggage\" that Labour took into the election. He tells the paper that the party did not deal with anti-Semitism - and that \"became a question of values and a question of competence\". Sir Keir - who admits he's \"seriously considering\" standing for the leadership - says Labour must return to being a \"broad church\". In short, he concludes, \"it can't be a fight for one side to obliterate the other\". Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to pass legislation preventing an extension of the post-Brexit transition period beyond December next year is - concludes the Financial Times - a \"high-risk strategy\".

The Times reports that the EU believes the move is just \"sabre-rattling\" - and a predictable gambit before trade talks next year. The Sun feels Brussels now looks \"as keen as [the prime minister] to sign a rapid new free-trade relationship by this time next year\". The Guardian notes that, while the legislation would not prevent Mr Johnson from changing the law again to allow extra time, government sources believe \"the symbolic legislation will focus minds in Brussels\". Writing in the Daily Mail, Stephen Glover argues that \"by insisting it must be done quickly, and on his timetable, [Mr Johnson] has seized the initiative\". He acknowledges there are risks, but he thinks \"a satisfactory agreement can be reached by the end of next year, and the perils of No Deal averted\".

The Herald believes she also hinted that Mr Johnson's plans to accelerate the approval of the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be the \"next constitutional flashpoint between Holyrood and Westminster\".

The aim is to combat plastic waste pollution, which is harming the seas. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which is behind the campaign, said if current trends continue, there could be more plastic than fish in the seas by 2050. The foundation was launched in 2010 by the record-breaking yachtswoman to improve environmental standards, particularly on plastic use, after she was shocked by the level of plastic pollution she observed on her round the world sailings. An estimated 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic had been produced since the early 1950s, with 60% of it ending up in landfills or the natural environment. And while packaging, such as bottles, yoghurt pots and wrappers, is not the sole source of plastic pollution, it represents the biggest use of plastic. The move was welcomed by environmental campaigners, Friends of the Earth. Friends of the Earth plastics campaigner Julian Kirby said: \"It's encouraging that more firms and governments are listening to public demands to curb plastic waste and are pledging to act. A global movement on this issue is urgently needed.\" According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, signatories to the pledge - which include big firms like Burberry and Mars, as well as governments and NGOs - have made commitments to: One signatory, Marmite-maker Unilever, told the BBC it recycles about two thirds of the plastic it produces but has been cutting plastic waste for some time. In February, stopped sealing its pyramid-shaped PG Tips teabags with polypropylene, using corn starch instead. 'Circular approach' It is also looking at ways of reusing black Tresemme shampoo bottles and getting recycled plastic into Hellmann's mayonnaise bottles. Currently Hellmann's bottles can be recycled but contain no recycled plastic. \"The aim is to move towards a circular approach, where you are only using recycled content and you work toward eliminating single-use packaging,\" Mr Blanchard told the BBC. \"We are seeing consumers wanting fully recyclable solutions. In the next few years people who use our products will be looking for packs that are recyclable or use recycled content, and we will be telling them on the packaging when that's the case.\" Dame Ellen MacArthur, founder of the MacArthur Foundation, said the pledge offered a \"clear vision for what we need to create a circular economy for plastic\".

A final decision on the time period or extent of potential closures has not yet been made. The government is also likely to introduce a three-tier system for local lockdowns. Under the system, different parts of the country would be placed in different categories - although ministers are still discussing the precise details of the toughest level of restrictions over the next couple of days. A formal announcement is not likely to come until Monday, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has challenged the government to publish the scientific evidence behind the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants - and refused to say whether his party would vote in support of the measure in Parliament next week. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said there was \"evidence hospitality plays a role\" in spreading the virus. But pressed on whether the government would publish this evidence, he told the BBC: \"It is commonsensical that the longer you stay in pubs and restaurants, the more likely you are to come into contact with other individuals. \"The more drinks that people have, the more likely that some people are to break the rules.\" He added that it was right to \"take action decisively, rather than waiting for the most detailed epidemiological evidence to emerge\". On the possibility of additional restrictions for some parts of England, Mr Jenrick said the government was \"currently considering what steps to take\" and the precise measures for different areas would be announced \"in the coming days\". He did not rule out pubs being closed but said measures would be \"proportionate and localised\". He added that the government was trying to give \"greater consistency on rules so they're easier to understand\" and was working on \"slightly broader canvases of regions or cities and counties to avoid differences in people's daily lives if they drive over the border\". It comes as significant new measures are introduced in Scotland. From Friday, all pubs and restaurants across central Scotland, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, are to close, while in the rest of Scotland hospitality venues must shut at 18:00 BST and alcohol can only be served outdoors. Industry leaders are warning the measures could be the final straw for many businesses. On Wednesday the number of UK cases rose by 14,162, with a further 70 deaths reported. The planned tightening of restrictions in parts of England follows rising infection rates across much of the country, with medical leaders warning the NHS is at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne have the highest infection rates in the country. A government source told the BBC the situation in the north-west and north-east of England was \"very troubling\", with growing numbers of hospital admissions and more elderly people in intensive care. These areas will be placed into the top tier of restrictions, with an announcement possibly as early as Monday, in a new system called the Local Covid Alert Level. But there remains a debate within cabinet over how far the restrictions in the top tier should go, with some in No 10 arguing for measures like those in Scotland. The plan is for schools to remain open in all circumstances. The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, reacted angrily to the reports, tweeting: \"No discussion. No consultation. Millions of lives affected by Whitehall diktat. It is proving impossible to deal with this government.\" It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion. But Boris Johnson also knows that his own MPs and the opposition parties are more and more sceptical as each day passes about what the government proposes. It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the \"circuit breaker\" that we have talked about on here lots of times. But there are many questions still to be settled. Read more from Laura here. Under the new system, all areas would be subject to the current England-wide restrictions, but there would be much more robust measures for the top tier - the one with the highest infection rates. There are already tighter restrictions in parts of the north-east and north-west of England, Birmingham and Leicester, where the rate of infection has been rising. But there are currently no extra restrictions for hospitality venues in these areas beyond those in force nationally, such as the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants. The Treasury is looking at providing financial support to the industry in the worst-hit areas, and a memo seen by the BBC shows plans for additional money for local authorities. They would get \u00a31 per head of population if placed into tier two, and \u00a32 per head for tier three. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said if venues were forced to close the industry would need a return to a full furlough scheme and additional financial support. She said the \u00a340m of support announced for hospitality venues by the Scottish government, when shared between 16,000 premises, equated to just over \u00a32,000 each, which \"barely keeps the lights on, let alone saving jobs\". The planned changes come as medical leaders warn that rising infection levels across the country could leave the NHS \"unable to cope\". The Academy of Medical Colleges, which represents the UK and Ireland's 24 medical royal colleges, called on people to abide \"strictly\" to coronavirus measures to prevent NHS services from becoming overwhelmed. Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the academy, said: \"Given the recent dramatic spike in both the number of cases and hospital admissions it is clear that we could soon be back to where we were in April if we are not all extremely careful.\" She told BBC Breakfast that while there were hotspots in the north-east and north-west of England, a lot of cities were now seeing \"serious problems\" and the virus was \"working further south\".

Tenovin was found to kill the cancer in Leukaemia patients without affecting the level of a tumour-suppressing protein. It is thought it could lead to improved treatments in future. Normally, Tenovin affects cancer cells by increasing levels of the \"guardian angel\" protein p53 within cells, which plays a crucial role in controlling cell mutations. However, the team found that when treated with the drug, the CLL cells died but without showing a change in p53 levels. The scientists then discovered that in leukaemic cells, Tenovin is able to interfere with the process of \"self-digestion\" that leukaemic cells use to protect themselves during periods of stress. Protection disrupted The study was led by Dr Sudhir Tauro from the Dundee Cancer Centre at Dundee University. He said: \"This process, called autophagy, is important to the survival of all cells. \"It is noteworthy that while it has the important effect of disrupting this process in CLL cells, Tenovin did not affect normal blood-forming cells. \"Based on these findings, we can now exploit that difference and begin to develop safer anti-leukaemic drugs for CLL.\" Current anti-leukaemia drugs often cause toxicity-related problems, particularly in older patients where treatment can affect a normal blood count.

But the Albanian man, who lives in Metz, says he lost his leg as the result of a 1997 shooting in Albania. The European Commission, which is responsible for the distribution of such images, says the man is mistaken. The man's son discovered the picture - which bore recognisable burns and scars - when he bought a packet of rolling tobacco last year in Luxembourg, French media report. He brought the packet home to his family. \"He [my brother] was coming back from Luxembourg. Without saying a word, he put a big box of rolling tobacco on the table,\" the man's daughter told regional newspaper Le R\u00e9publicain Lorrain. \"We were stunned. We did not believe it.\" The family thought it was indeed a picture of the father's leg. \"It's our father's. His scars are characteristic,\" the daughter added. The man, who has not been named, says he had never agreed to the picture being used. He believes it was taken at a local hospital he visited in 2018 to find out whether he could be fitted with some kind of walking apparatus. He has been walking using crutches for more than 20 years following a shooting incident in Albania in 1997, in which he lost his leg. 'Betrayed' The family's lawyer, Antoine Fittante, is also adamant that the picture is of his client's leg. \"Each scar is specific, unique. This man also has burn marks on the other leg, it's very clear. An expert will have no trouble identifying the image. \"It's rather incredible that a person finds themselves without their agreement on cigarette packets throughout the European Union,\" Mr Fittante said. \"My client feels betrayed, wounded in his dignity, by seeing his disability [displayed] on cigarette packets in tobacconists; one must admit that's not very pleasant.\" Mr Fittante has written to the hospital to find out how the photos ended up being used. Le Parisien newspaper, however, cast doubt on the claim by showing the same photograph in a collection used for an EU anti-tobacco campaign dated 2017 - before the man's visit to the Metz hospital. It also appears in an EU image database from 2014. The newspaper also said it had contacted the hospital, which could not confirm the man's story. \"We have the identity, the agreement and the rights for all the people photographed for this campaign,\" a European Commission spokeswomen said, quoted by Le Parisien. \"From the information we have, we can say without a doubt that this individual is not one of them.\"", "output": "Man finds 'own amputation' on cigarette packets without consent", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

In a statement, it added: \"When using Autopilot, drivers are continuously reminded of their responsibility to keep their hands on the wheel.\" As yet, it has still to be confirmed that the Autopilot mode was indeed engaged. The California crash appears to be the latest example of semi-autonomous vehicles struggling to detect stationary objects. A Tesla driving in Autopilot hit a stationary fire engine in Utah in May. According to a police report obtained by the Associated Press, the Tesla accelerated before it hit the vehicle. It has also emerged that a Tesla Model 3 driver has blamed Autopilot for a crash in Greece last Friday, in which the car suddenly veered right \"without warning\". The motorist, You You Xue, voiced his concerns about Autopilot on Facebook. \"The vigilance required to use the software, such as keeping both hands on the wheel and constantly monitoring the system for malfunctions or abnormal behaviour, arguably requires significantly more attention than just driving the vehicle normally,\" he wrote. One influential tech industry-watcher has raised concern about Tesla's software, noting that Google's car division has claimed that an all-or-nothing approach is safer. \"There is a serious argument that the incremental, 'level 2/3' approach to autonomous cars followed by Tesla, where the human isn't driving but might have to grab the wheel at any time, is actively dangerous and a technical dead end,\" tweeted, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. \"Waymo decided not to do this at all.\" It is not the first time the Autopilot feature has been linked to dangerous behaviour. In England, a driver was banned from driving after putting his Tesla in Autopilot on the M1 and sitting in the passenger seat. 'Deceptive' naming The news comes after two US rights groups urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Tesla over its marketing of the assisted driving software. The Center for Auto Safety and Consumer Watchdog said it should be \"reasonable\" for Tesla owners to believe that their car should be able to drive itself on Autopilot. It called the naming of the Autopilot \"deceptive and misleading\". Media questions The chief executive of Tesla, Elon Musk, has previously complained abut media attention on Tesla crashes. He tweeted: \"It's super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage.\" His comments received support from prominent academic and psychologist Steven Pinker, who has in the past voiced concerns about Tesla's Autopilot.", "output": "Tesla hit parked police car 'while using Autopilot'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

While not quite the United Nations, it would seem that those in charge of health in Northern Ireland are also making good out of a crisis. For decades civil servants have striven to reduce the number of hospitals and centralise certain services but there was always something or someone in the way of making it happen. After all, over the past three decades, which health minister or political party would dare close a ward let alone a hospital even though it was obvious too few staff and resources were available to run it? In fact, 12 months ago, each of the health trusts warned they were working towards a deficit. But at no time did anyone tell them to stop spending. Now there is a \"crisis\", it is out of the politicians' or ministers' hands and they can claim they have no other option but to centralise, regroup, consolidate or shut services, albeit temporarily. The last major facility to \"temporarily\" close was the emergency department at the Belfast City Hospital. That \"temporary\" move was three years ago. The financial situation looks unlikely to improve. In fact, some health officials are already describing 2016/17 as meltdown for the health sector.

The UK's medicines regulator has said under-30s should be offered an alternative Covid jab due to evidence linking it to blood clots. Dr Roberts insisted the vaccine was safe for anyone aged over 30 without underlying health conditions. A review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found that by the end of March 79 people had suffered rare blood clots after having the AstraZeneca vaccination in the UK - 19 of whom had died. This was out of 20 million administered doses - giving a risk of about four in one million of developing a blood clot, and one in a million of dying. The people who died were aged between 18 and 79, with three of them aged under 30. The side effects are however, extremely rare and the vaccine's effectiveness was proven, the MHRA said, while the Welsh government had said it did not \"envisage a delay to the roll-out of our vaccine programme in Wales\". Dr Roberts told BBC Radio Cymru the AstraZeneca vaccine remained a safe choice for those aged 30 and above, but that the balance of risks for younger people meant another vaccine should be used. \"For those people who are receiving the [AstraZeneca] vaccine now, in their 40s and 50s, the balance of risk and benefits lies heavily on the side of the benefits,\" he said. \"If you consider a million people in their 40s, if all of them caught Covid then 1,000 deaths would occur. \"You must balance that against the risk of one in a million dying because of a very rare blood clot.\" Dr Roberts said under-30s would be offered Pfizer and Moderna vaccines instead as the rollout continued across Wales. He said other medicines such as the contraceptive pill carried risks of blood clots, and added: \"We must accept that we cannot get effective [medicines] that carry no risk at all. \"Nothing can be 100%, and we must accept some risk in order to get the benefits.\" In Wales, 1,519,760 people have been given their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - 48.2% of the population.

Discussions will focus on what changes are needed to the party's rules in order to implement proposals from the year-long democracy review. The conference will then vote to approve or reject them. There is a left-wing, pro-Corbyn majority on the National Executive Committee (NEC) but some issues have proved divisive even within the left. Momentum - the group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership - has been pushing for 'open' parliamentary selections. This would allow parliamentary hopefuls to compete against any sitting MP between general elections for any Labour nomination. But some unions - also under left-wing control - believe this would diminish their role in the process of choosing MPs. So I am told a compromise is being brokered. Currently for a sitting MP to be challenged, 50% of their local party branches have to agree - and that includes not just branches consisting of individual party members, but branches of 'affiliated' trade unions, too. In other words, those unions that pay for a link to the Labour Party such as Unite and the GMB. Under the compromise plan, a contest would be triggered if just 30% of union or party branches agree. So the existing system of selections would be reformed rather than swept away. Part of the union There has, however, been a further wrangle over the compromise. The democracy review was sold as a way of empowering the membership and some on the left are fearful that it will instead further empower trade union leaders. Some local trade union branches have very few members while many of the branches consisting of fully-paid up individual party members are much larger. So a relatively small number of trade unionists could trigger a re-selection contest since it would be much easier to get 30% of trade union branches to give the sitting MP the thumbs down than 30% of the (often much larger) membership branches. There had been talk of a further compromise - giving less weight to smaller union branches. On the latest information I have, it looks like this further proposal may have been dropped. One NEC member suggested privately that the \"compromise\" - rather than either protecting sitting MPs or giving members a much greater say - would in effect allow Unite chief Len McCluskey \"to pick off whoever he wants\". So even the \"compromise\" hasn't been agreed. Not knowingly undersold, one insider said \"it could be war\". Follow the leader There has also been a change to the initial proposal for selecting Jeremy Corbyn's eventual successor. What was floated at the last meeting of the NEC was a new system which would allow a candidate to get nominated with the backing of just 5% of MPs (the current threshold is 10%) so long as either 10% of local constituency parties, or 10% of unions, also nominated them. Today the NEC will discuss a new proposal - a future leader would require not only the support of 10% of MPs and local parties but would now also require the support of two trade unions that account for 5% of 'affiliated' members. Complicated as that is (and believe it or not, I have simplified the options) the upshot is that a leadership candidate wouldn't get on the ballot without the backing of some big unions. And some Momentum activists are complaining that this would skew power away from rank and file party members and are pledging to oppose it. Momentum has been pressing its members to deluge the NEC with emails calling for the leadership threshold to be reduced to 5% of MPs and for any compromise on parliamentary selections to be ditched. \"Their phones are imploding under the weight of emails,\" one source said. The NEC is likely to be expanded to include, specifically, party members with disabilities and those from an ethnic minority background. But the proposal today is that these new places will be elected equally by unions and rank-and-file members, not just by the party membership alone. Local authority After the last NEC meeting, a Corbyn-sceptic told me he had \"kicked into the long grass\" a proposal that the leaders of local authority Labour groups would be elected by the wider membership and not just by councils. Well, someone has got the political lawnmower out, because it's back on the agenda now. And local government manifestos might be drawn up not by councillors but wider local government committees which include trade union nominees. Pretty vacant? Under the current system when an NEC place chosen by the members (the unions, councillors, shadow cabinet and MPs/MEPs have their own dedicated places) becomes vacant, the runner up in the annual elections is automatically promoted onto the NEC. I understand an NEC member is considering standing down and that would mean comedian Eddie Izzard (who wasn't supported by the left) would be elevated. But under proposals to be discussed today a by-election, seen as unnecessarily expensive by opponents, would be held in future - increasing the chance of a left-wing replacement A proposal to have existing NEC members choose amongst themselves who joins them has been dropped. Democracy is coming? Clearly there are plenty of issues still to be agreed, but whatever backroom deals are done, or compromises concluded, it's likely by the end of Labour conference that it will be easier to replace sitting MPs and that it's even more likely that someone on the left (not necessarily the so-called 'hard left') will replace Jeremy Corbyn when the time comes.

The culture secretary said the UK film industry is \"one of our biggest success stories\" and that there was a need \"to nurture and foster the next generation of talent\". She said the skills plan \"will be instrumental in helping to deliver this, as well as making sure that the films in the UK are truly representative of the UK's diverse society\". Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, which produces the Star Wars films, said: \"More points of view, more perspectives, and more voices will only make films better\".

Three per cent of the production and post-production workforce are from a black, Asian and minority ethnic background. Oscars criticism The research cites a culture of nepotism, unpaid work experience and a lack of appropriate training as being reasons why people are prevented from entering the industry. There are even bigger problems for minority groups, the report's authors say.

Mr Marshall had described himself as Virginia's \"chief homophobe\". The district that elected Ms Roem, which includes outer suburbs of Washington DC, strongly supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Ms Roem championed gay, transgender and immigrant rights during her campaign, but the race mostly focused on the state's transport infrastructure. Headlines of the night Diverse politicians chosen across the US Reasons for Republicans to worry Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Democrats finally have a victory of the non-moral kind. After coming up short in a handful of special elections across the US, they went to the polls in a battleground state and posted a huge win. How the Democrats, from governor candidate Ralph Northam on down, swept through election night in Virginia should be particularly concerning to Republicans across the US. Turnout from Democratic supporters surged. They ran up huge margins with college-educated voters and residents in the wealthy Northern Virginia suburbs. The legions of rural voters who turned out for Donald Trump in 2016 were a non-factor. Democrats won legislative races that were considered to be in play only in the rosiest of Democratic wave scenarios. Exit polls show a plurality of Virginians went to the polls to send a message to Mr Trump. Their top issue was healthcare. At least in Virginia, the president's dismal approval ratings translated into ballot-box poison. The stage is now set for the midterm elections in 2018. Republicans will have a year to brace for what could be an anti-Trump tsunami forming on the horizon. What they - and Mr Trump - do next could decide their fate. Mr Marshall had a strong record of opposing equality legislation. The veteran Republican co-sponsored a 2006 Virginia constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. He also introduced a bill that would have banned transgender school students from using the bathrooms of their choice. Ms Roem is not the first openly transgender state lawmaker in the United States. Stacie Laughton won a seat in New Hampshire's legislature in 2012, but she resigned before taking office. A closeted transgender woman, Althea Garrison, won a seat in the Massachusetts legislature in 1992. Ms Garrison was later outed by a conservative newspaper. Also on Tuesday former television anchor and Democrat Chris Hurst, whose girlfriend was fatally shot on-air in 2015, unseated a Republican incumbent in Virginia's House of Delegates.

Lawyers for his mother claim the \"inhuman and degrading\" conditions breach the Human Rights Act. The Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, is contesting the case. The High Court was told that Ms Truss had \"conceded\" that AB's placement in solitary conditions had breached his right to a private life and was unlawful because prison rules weren't followed. \"The real dispute relates to Article 3,\" said Dan Squires QC, for AB's mother, who also claims that he has been denied the statutory minimum of 15 hours' education per week. Mr Squires said AB was placed on \"single unlock\" when he arrived at Feltham last December, meaning that he was allowed out for only 30 minutes each day to shower, exercise, make a phone call and take medication. He was given no education. What's life like inside a young offender institution? Since February, the boy has been permitted out of his cell for slightly longer periods, mainly to attend classes, but still spends at least 22 hours alone in his cell. \"All he has to do is to watch television...or lie on his bed,\" said Mr Squires. The court heard the boy had experienced \"emotional and physical abuse and serious trauma\" when he was younger. According to papers submitted by his legal team, he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder anxiety, hyper-vigilance, hyper-arousal and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, for which he requires a \"high dose\" of medication. He is due to be released in July. 'Challenging behaviour' The documents say AB has been known to police since he was 10, and has been convicted of a range of offences. According to the legal documents the boy was placed in solitary confinement because of his behaviour at another young offender institution on a previous sentence, and continued after he shouted abuse at staff and other children. But Mr Squires said it was \"common practice\" at Feltham to hold inmates with \"challenging behaviour\" in solitary confinement, citing an inspection report which found that 25% of boys there were locked alone in their cells for 23 hours a day. The judicial review action has been brought on behalf of the child by the Howard League for Penal Reform.

Supplies of donated blood are needed by the NHS for people having surgery or giving birth and those with conditions such as cancer and sickle cell disease. NHS Blood and Transplant said it was concerned the cluster of major events in 2012 could create a \"perfect storm\" and dramatically impact the number of blood donations coming in. Assistant director for blood donation, Jon Latham, said: \"Approximately two million units [470mls - just under a pint] of blood will be needed by hospitals throughout 2012, and the equivalent of 500 extra donations will be needed each week in the first six months to help us build blood stocks and cover extra potential need from Olympic visitors. \"We're calling on the public to make regular blood donation a New Year's resolution. \"Whether you've never donated before or haven't done for a while, please book your appointment and help save lives in 2012.\" Figures show that in 2011 thousands fewer people donated blood due to a crop of bank holidays around Easter and the Royal Wedding.

Frontbencher Rebecca Long-Bailey said it was \"devastating\" to \"realise that the Jewish community had lost faith in our approach to anti-Semitism\". But she said the party took a \"zero-tolerance\" approach to the issue. \"I think there is a lot more that needs to be done and I think Jeremy addressed that clearly yesterday. He has always been a militant opponent of anti-Semitism,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. In a joint statement, Jonathan Goldstein, chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council and Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said they had been \"overwhelmed\" by the response to the Parliament Square protest, which followed an open letter to Labour MPs saying \"enough is enough\". \"Never has our community made a more powerful statement that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism in the Labour Party,\" the leaders said of Monday's protest. \"We note Jeremy Corbyn's apology but we are almost three years into his leadership and words are no longer enough - now we need action. \"The Labour Party must finally demonstrate that it has the genuine will and determination to act effectively against the hate in its membership. We will not be silent and we will continue to hold it to account.\" On Monday, Mr Corbyn acknowledged anti-Jewish prejudice had surfaced within Labour and it had been wrong for some people to dismiss it \"as a matter of a few bad apples\" and called for a meeting with Jewish community leaders. He pledged to deal with allegations of abuse more quickly and improve \"political education\" among activists. What is anti-Semitism? Former Prime Minister Tony Blair told Newsnight the time for words was over and Mr Corbyn had to show he was \"prepared to act\" to \"root it out, completely, 100%\". Mr Blair, who became a Middle East envoy after leaving power in 2007, has long been accused by the left of having too cosy a relationship with successive Israel governments. Asked if he was conflating legitimate criticism of Israeli policy with anti-Semitism, Mr Blair said activists could oppose the actions of individual governments but \"that's different from being anti the state of Israel and its existence - and when people are in that position it very quickly trends across into anti-Semitism\". Mr Corbyn made a similar point in his letter to Jewish groups, saying: \"Jewish people must not be held responsible or accountable for the actions of the Israeli government.\" A succession of Labour MPs made their feelings known at Monday's demonstration in Parliament Square and at a subsequent meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party. Luciana Berger, chairwoman of Jewish Labour, said anti-Semitism was a \"stain on the conscience of the party\". At the protests By Brian Wheeler, BBC political reporter, in Parliament Square A few of those present in Parliament Square were clearly not fans of the Labour Party or Jeremy Corbyn, although most I spoke to were Labour supporters who felt real anger about what they saw as Mr Corbyn's \"soft\" stance on anti-Semitism. Tim, from Bermondsey, told me: \"I have been a member of the Labour Party since 1981 but I never thought I would be in the position of standing outside Parliament complaining about the treatment of our Jewish comrades.\" The counter-demonstration organised by Jewish Voice for Labour was smaller, but everyone I spoke to was a Labour Party member and felt Mr Corbyn was being persecuted unfairly. One man was handing out \"Labour against the witch hunt\" leaflets. Leah Levine, the co-chairwoman of Jewish Voice for Labour, did not deny there was some anti-Semitism in Labour just as, she said, there was in society as a whole - but she argued it was being blown out of proportion by opponents of Mr Corbyn - and that anti-Semitism was a far bigger problem on the right. \"We are not a racist movement,\" she told me.", "output": "Jeremy Corbyn told to act on 'stain' of anti-Semitism in party", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Earlier, Health Secretary Tom Price apologised for his private plane trips. He said he would reimburse taxpayers and fly commercial in future. According to political news website Politico, Mr Price's travels have already cost the US taxpayer more than $1m (\u00a3750,000). The figure includes the cost of military aircraft used for Mr Price's trips abroad, and his use of private jets for domestic flights, Politico added. President Trump, who had earlier said he was \"not happy\" with the expense, said he would decide on Mr Price's future shortly. \"He's a very fine man. We're going to make a decision sometime tonight,\" he told White House reporters. \"He's a very, very fine man.\" Why this hurts Trump Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Now that the \"Price-tag\" for the health secretary's private air travel has passed the million-dollar mark - with reports that other administration officials have a similar penchant for the Learjet lifestyle - the issue is metastasising from embarrassing to full-blown scandal. The reason this story particularly damages the White House is it cuts against one of Donald Trump's strengths and key campaign promises - that he has the business acumen to rein in runaway government spending, waste and abuse. What's more, Mr Price and EPA head Scott Pruitt have proposed drastic cuts to the budgets they oversee. For them to drop big dollars to avoid elbow-rubbing with the masses makes for painful headlines and fosters resentment within government ranks. Mr Price's promise to pay for the cost of \"his seat\" on those flights is already being decried as not good enough. It's the equivalent of buying an aged porterhouse steak on the federal dime and reimbursing for a hot dog. At some point, lest the White House appear responsible for creating a culture of profligacy, the president is going to have to do more than express dissatisfaction over these revelations. He will have to take action. As well as the Vegas-Montana trip - a route served by commercial flights - Mr Zinke is also reported to have used private jets between St Croix and St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands in March, and a military aircraft to travel to Norway in May. US government officials are expected to take commercial flights for work-related travel, unless they are dealing with national security matters. \"As with previous interior secretaries, the secretary travelled on charter flights when there were no commercial options available,\" interior department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement. \"All travel is pre-approved by the ethics office before booking and the charter flights went through an additional level of due diligence.\" Two other members of Mr Trump's cabinet are under scrutiny by inspectors for their use of private planes while on the job: Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, responding to the latest revelations, urged Mr Trump \"to emphasise to cabinet secretaries the necessity of using reasonable and cost-effective modes of travel in accordance with federal restrictions\".", "output": "Ryan Zinke: US interior secretary 'spent $12,000 on flight'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

This is despite having the same access to treatment, the study in the British Journal of Cancer shows. As yet unidentified biological factors may be to blame, say the Cancer Research UK investigators. Such women might respond less well to breast cancer drugs like tamoxifen because of the genetic make-up of their tumour, they say. The research team, based at the University of Southampton, looked at data from nearly 3,000 UK women - of whom 118 were black - who were younger than 40 when they were diagnosed with breast cancer. Even when individual differences such as body weight and treatment variations such as availability of chemotherapy were taken into account, black ethnicity remained an independent indicator of poor prognosis. Dr Ellen Copson and colleagues say there have been similar findings in the US, suggesting this could be an international trend, but further research is needed to try to pin down the exact cause or causes. Early diagnosis may also play a role if black women are less aware of the symptoms or less \"breast aware\", and so less likely to identify worrying changes, they say. This could mean their cancer is diagnosed at a later stage which would reduce the chance of successful treatment and recovery. Although NHS treatment is designed to be equal for all, some cultural factors such as recent immigration to the UK or language barriers may in practice affect use of health services, they say. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK's head of health information, said: \"It's worrying that ethnic background may be a factor influencing a woman's chance of surviving breast cancer.

First up, Hector's House: A children's TV series that ran on the BBC from 1968 to 1975. It's low tech (hand puppets), low concept (a male dog and female cat share a house next door to a frog) and utterly brilliant. It doesn't matter what age you are, Hector's House is a guaranteed five-minute hit of faultless, charming entertainment. Hector is a doe-eyed, floppy-eared hound prone to pomposity and delusion who lives with Zsazsa, a clever cat who gently teases him with willing help from their friend next door, Kiki the frog. The show was imported from France (where it was called La Maison de Toutou) and owes plenty to the classic slapstick comedies of Jacques Tati, a genius of post-war French cinema who captured better than most, that off-kilter feeling of being at odds with the modern world. You can find much of his work online, including the fabulous 1958 film, Mon Oncle (featuring stunning architecture). While Hector was in his house, the straight-talking Australian art critic Robert Hughes was on the road in New York filing a report on contemporary art in a documentary called Pop Goes to the Hayward (1969), which is available on the BBC iPlayer. It's a compelling watch, not least for Hughes himself, who gives a masterclass in the art of documentary-making: interviewing with polite scepticism, while delivering his superbly written script with spiky belligerence. He keeps out of shot unless absolutely necessary (such as being cast for a sculpture by one-time chicken farmer, George Segal), and lets the artists do the talking (Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg), which is what you want because they were depicting a new way of living that would become our way of life. Like Hector's House, these American artists owed a huge amount to a French genius, in their case the pioneer of conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp, who you can watch here in conversation with Dame Joan Bakewell in 1968. On the shelf to my left are three non-fiction books that I constantly refer to for inspiration, only to put them down again in desperation, realising that I can never come close to the essential talent of the authors. They are, in chronological order: The White Album by Joan Didion: a collection of her journalistic essays from the 1960s and 70s. The Age of Movies by Pauline Kael: a collection of her film criticism for the New Yorker and others. And, The Most of Nora Ephron: a collection of all her work from early journalism to mid-career movie scripts (inc. When Harry Met Sally). All three writers are American and share a strong cultural connection, not least the influence of the so-called New Journalism of the 60s - a literary form of reporting pioneered by the likes of Didion, Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese, who wrote perhaps the most famous article in the genre for Esquire magazine called, Frank Sinatra has a Cold (1965), which is very good. Few have been able to match them, but some do so occasionally. The British writers Olivia Laing and Zadie Smith are excellent non-fiction essayists, as was the late David Foster Wallace, an American writer and academic whose work reads like an ingenious form of stand-up comedy. You can read most of it online. I'd recommend the essay Federer as Religious Experience. He was also a compelling - albeit nervous - public speaker, who delivered a memorable speech to Kenyon College's 2005 graduating class.

There will be a lot of new content coming on stream in the coming weeks, including contributions from many of the venues that are currently closed but keen to continue to serve their audiences. The BBC announced earlier this week that it would be working with museums, galleries, arts centres, comedians, poets and a whole host of talented folk to help bring their work to the public through TV, online, radio and podcast. The Met in New York has responded very quickly and impressively. It is uploading an opera a night, filmed to a very high standard and performed by the best singers in the world. The shows are from the Met's back catalogue, for which you would normally have pay but can now see for free. I have just watched La Traviata and was blown away by the production values and all-round quality of the presentation. If you're not sure about opera, I think the Met might convert you. Lastly, a podcast pick. There are so many, but for this moment in time, I'm going with the award-winning Have You Heard George's Podcast by the London-born performer and writer George Mpanga who goes by the stage name George the Poet. Admittedly, it is not exactly a hidden gem, but it is a rare jewel. Each episode is presented in his informal, gentle style that lyrically coaxes you into his vividly observed vision of our world. I like what he sees and what he says and hopefully you will too. That's my five 5-star nuggets of free content gold but what about yours?

The programme has been a success, producing more than 2,000 giant tortoises since it began in the 1960s. Diego's sex drive was said to be one of the main reasons. The 100-year-old tortoise has fathered hundreds of progeny, around 800 by some estimates. The programme has now finished, and Diego will be returned to his native island of Espa\u00f1ola in March, the Gal\u00e1pagos National Parks service (PNG) said. He will join a 1,800-strong tortoise population, at least 40% of which park rangers believe he has fathered. \"He's contributed a large percentage to the lineage that we are returning to Espa\u00f1ola,\" Jorge Carrion, the park's director, told AFP news agency. \"There's a feeling of happiness to have the possibility of returning that tortoise to his natural state.\" The park service believes Diego was taken from the Gal\u00e1pagos 80 years ago by a scientific expedition. Around 50 years ago, there were only two males and 12 females of Diego's species alive on Espanola. To save his species, Chelonoidis hoodensis, Diego was brought in from California's San Diego Zoo. Diego is currently in quarantine before his triumphant return to Espa\u00f1ola, considered one of the oldest parts of the Gal\u00e1pagos.

A reading below 50 indicates shrinking activity. However, the sector has now contracted for 22 months in a row, according to the Markit survey. In Germany, Europe's largest economy, the PMI figure rose to 49.4, just below the 50 threshold and marking its highest level for three months. Spain and Greece saw the most dramatic improvements. Spain's PMI reading of 48.1 was a 24-month high, while Greece's reading of 45.3 was a 23-month high. \"It is reassuring to see the rate of decline ease to such a marked extent,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \"The sector still seems some way off stabilising, however, and therefore remains a drag on the economy.\" Mr Williamson said the survey indicated that eurozone GDP was likely to have fallen by 0.2% in the second quarter of the year. If GDP falls again in the April-to-June quarter, it will mean the eurozone's economy has contracted for seven successive quarters. The bloc's economy shrank by 0.2% between January and March. Last week, the OECD downgraded its forecast for the eurozone's economy again, predicting that it will contract by 0.6% this year, The European Central Bank has been under pressure to stimulate the economy, and last month cut its main interest rate to a record low of 0.5%.

But the way these contracts have been awarded - and the huge sums of money involved - have led to accusations of a lack of transparency. The government has also been taken to court with a judge ruling that Health Secretary Matt Hancock \"breached his legal obligation\" by not publishing details of Covid deals quickly enough. Mr Hancock told The Andrew Marr Show: \"My team were working seven days a week, often 18 hours a day, to get hold of the equipment that was saving lives.\" So what are the rules on government contracts, and what has changed during the pandemic? What are the normal rules? Usually, when the government needs to buy something, it must start a \"competitive tendering process\". A department will publish the specifications of what it wants to buy. Companies are encouraged to bid by saying the price at which they could offer those goods and services, as well as how long it would take, and details such as the quality of the product. The government then checks that the companies involved would be able to provide what they said they could and signs a contract with the one that offers the best value for money. This process can take anything from a few months to a few years depending on the complexity of the requirements (whether you're buying say a laptop or a submarine). The government has pre-approved suppliers, which saves time on checks and will sometimes allow only pre-approved suppliers to bid for particular contracts. Such companies are referred to as being on a framework agreement. By law, the government is required to publish a \"contract award notice\" within 30 days of signing any contracts for public goods or services worth more than \u00a3120,000. It is also required to publish the details of every contract worth over \u00a310,000. What happens in an emergency? When the procurement rules were updated in 2015, they included a provision that allowed the government to skip the competitive tendering process in certain circumstances. The government could go directly to a preferred supplier without any competition. This was called making a \"direct award\". These are allowed if there is only one possible supplier or in cases of \"extreme urgency\" due to unforeseeable events - where there is a risk to life, for example. According to a report published by the National Audit Office (NAO), between March and July 2020, new contracts worth \u00a317.3bn were awarded to suppliers. Of those: The government is still obliged to publish the details of large contracts if they're issued by direct award. Why was this system challenged? It was the failure to publish details of contracts within the required 30 days that led the judge to rule that the health secretary had acted unlawfully during the Covid pandemic. The Good Law Project, a campaign group involved in the legal action against the government, estimates that since March 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care has taken an average of 98 days to publish details of Covid-related contracts. The government gives a lower number - saying publication was, on average, 17 days over the 30-day limit. The public had a right to know where the \"vast\" amounts spent had gone and how contracts were awarded, the judge said. \"Government had permission to procure equipment at pace and without tendering under the law, but acting fast did not give it licence to rip up record-keeping on decisions,\" said Meg Hillier, Labour chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee. \"It did not publish contracts in time and kept poor records of why some companies won multi-million pound contracts,\"she said. And in documents seen by the BBC, government lawyers admitted on 25 February that 100 contacts for suppliers and services relating to Covid-19 - signed before 7 October - had yet to be published. Three days earlier, the prime minister told MPs that the contracts were \"on the record for everyone to see\". Most of the contracts during the pandemic were for PPE. The government has managed to buy 8.6 billion items of PPE so far. But there have been some problems with orders, as the BBC has been reporting throughout the pandemic. What was the high-priority lane? In order to help the government choose between the huge numbers of offers it was getting, it introduced a \"high-priority lane\" on 2 April. The idea was to treat offers of PPE support with greater urgency if they came from a supplier recommended by ministers, government officials or MPs and members of the House of Lords, from any party. The NAO report found that up to the end of July, about one in 10 suppliers who had been put in the high-priority lane were then awarded contracts, while the figure was less than one in 100 for other suppliers, outside the lane. \"Of course we fast-tracked the leads that we thought were most likely to get hold of the stuff fastest and they did that,\" the health secretary said. A problem was that the Cabinet Office, which led the process, was allegedly \"not entirely upfront about how it was done\", according to Tom Sasse from the Institute for Government. \"The Cabinet Office did not manage to keep a proper account of who recommended a particular supplier, which opens it up to accusations of cronyism.\" A government spokesperson told Reality Check: \"Proper due diligence is carried out for all government contacts and we take these checks extremely seriously. \"This process involves all contracts complying with robust rules and processes that prevent conflicts of interest.\" But shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves told Parliament that it had been \"an unedifying gold rush of chums and chancers\".

Those who remember the first time Richard Burton brought his new wife to the village near Port Talbot in south Wales where he was born, said the occasion resembled a royal visit. Taylor, who has died at the age of 79, was to return again and again. Near neighbour Lillian Howell was one of those invited in to share a cup of tea with the Hollywood couple in the house on Penhydd Street. \"Everybody came out to welcome them - she was such a glamorous person,\" she recalled. \"She had a double row of eye lashes and her eyes were violet blue. Absolutely beautiful. \"We sat in the house and she was very down to earth and so lovely, as was Richard. When we finished she wanted to do the washing up.\" The house is now home to Burton's niece, the actress Sian Owen. She too remembers the day her uncle brought his new wife to Wales for the first time. \"When they arrived you could not move as people had come from everywhere,\" she said. \"The press had come down from London and rented rooms in the houses opposite hoping to get a picture. \"When the men went to the pub that night they all had money for beer, but they did not need it as uncle Ritch paid.

The aerospace and rail company employs 4,000 people in Belfast, with about 1,000 making C-Series wings. Speaking at the Dubai Airshow, he said the Airbus deal meant higher production and \"more wings coming out of Belfast\". \"My message to all employees on the C-Series programme, and certainly in Belfast, is to keep doing what you're doing. You are producing in Belfast amazing wing technology,\" the president of Bombardier's commercial aircraft division told the BBC. The aircraft is at the centre of a US-Canada dispute. Production of the C-Series has gone over-budget and been dogged by delays. US manufacturer Boeing has complained that the aircraft is being subsidised and sold below cost in the US. Earlier this year the US Department of Trade sided with Boeing that C-Series sales in the US should be slapped with import duties of up to 300%. A final ruling is expected early next year. That put a question mark over the future of the programme and a sale of 75 jets to US airline Delta. Then last month, Bombardier announced that Boeing rival Airbus would take a majority stake in the C-Series, putting its production and marketing muscle behind the aircraft. 'Bigger volume' Airbus is to expand its production plant in Alabama, which will increase US content of the aircraft and help cut costs. Mr Cromer said this move was \"about increasing volume of the aircraft, and that should make people feel good in Belfast\". The Alabama expansion would create more jobs at Bombardier, he said. \"It is not a replacement of jobs. The US production line will give us bigger volume and give us access to the US marketplace.\" Delta has already said it will not pay the huge import tariffs on its Bombardier aircraft. Mr Cromer acknowledged that the delivery timetable for the Delta order could be adjusted if the trade dispute holds up the order. He said that an unnamed European airline was considering buying 61 C-Series aircraft, a deal that he hoped would be finalised by the end of this year. That potentially could help Bombardier if it was forced to reschedule the Delta deal. Mr Cromer said Delta was committed to the aircraft and was prepared to wait if necessary, although the airline was unhappy with Boeing's action.

With nowhere to go, the Swiss-owned ship started the long journey home. Its passengers, used to a new port every few days, last felt land six weeks ago. On Monday those passengers will finally get off in Marseille, having last disembarked in Wellington. Their voyage has included political storms, presidential pleas, one death, and - despite it all - plenty of fun. When the Magnifica left Genoa, Italy, on 5 January, the world looked very different. The \"unknown pneumonia\", as it was called, did not have a name. No one had died, the World Health Organization said, and just 59 people were infected, all in Wuhan. It is safe to say most of the Magnifica's 1,760 passengers - mainly Italian, French, and German - had not heard of the virus. And so, as they watched the sunset from the boat's Bar del Sole, or ate in the Quattro Venti restaurant, spirits were high. At the helm was Captain Roberto Leotta, from the small town of Riposto in Sicily. Captain Leotta has worked on cruises for 32 years, after three years on tankers and one in the Italian navy. Like many people from Riposto, his father and grandfathers were sailors. \"It is something that is in my DNA,\" he tells the BBC. After leaving Europe, the ship stopped in Cape Verde, off the west coast of Africa, before heading across the Atlantic. By the time they docked in Brazil on 19 January, the virus had left China, and Captain Leotta had noticed. \"We were always in contact with all the local authorities,\" he says. \"[But it was] after South America the situation became more concerning.\" The ship left Chile on 21 February, reaching Pitcairn in the South Pacific three days later. By now, cruise ships were in the news. Ports were closing their doors. Passengers from quarantined ships were dying. And the Pacific island of Aitutaki - just east of the International Date Line, population 2,000 - was worried. Cruise ships and the coronavirus The Magnifica was due in Aitutaki, famed for its turquoise lagoon and white sand, on 2 March. But as the coronavirus crept closer, local concerns grew. The island relies on cruise money but they asked the national government - the Cook Islands - to ban all cruises. The ship, which was virus-free, was allowed to dock on the main island, Rarotonga, but not Aitutaki. For the first time, Covid-19 had changed the plans of the MSC Magnifica's passengers. One of those passengers was Andy Gerber, then aged 69, from Bern in Switzerland. The Magnifica was his 20th cruise. In Auckland - the next stop after the Cook Islands - he enjoyed a beer in the sunshine; in Napier he admired the art deco; in Wellington he rode the cable car. But the big one was Sydney, a week after Wellington, where he would turn 70. \"A long time ago I reserved a steakhouse to celebrate with a bunch of friends,\" he tells the BBC. Until Australia, the Magnifica's itinerary was a blessing. In January, as the coronavirus emerged in Asia, the ship was far away in South America - where the virus wasn't recorded until late February. When it visited New Zealand, just five cases had been confirmed - all of them travellers, or their partners or relatives. But as the Magnifica approached Tasmania on 14 March, the coronavirus had caught up with the cruise ship. The island had six cases, and things were getting worse. The ship had permission to dock in Hobart, but Captain Leotta knew passengers may return with more than souvenirs. \"We decided it was much better for our passengers to remain safely on board,\" he says. The world - which seemed so big when they left Genoa in January - was suddenly much smaller. \"It was clear,\" says Captain Leotta, \"that there was basically nowhere to go.\" And so, in Sydney, the captain confirmed the news: the world cruise was over. They were heading home. The trip of a lifetime had become half the trip of a lifetime. Instead of the steakhouse, Andy Gerber celebrated his long-awaited 70th on board the ship, as the sights of Sydney were tantalisingly in view. How did he feel? \"At first - terrible!\" he says. \"But after the shock, we were grateful the captain decided not to let us ashore, as this meant we were 99.999% clean [of the virus].\" When the cruise was cancelled, passengers were allowed off - under strict conditions - in Sydney and Melbourne, if they wished to make their own way home. A few hundred did so, but most settled down for the ride: five weeks, 12,000 miles [19,000km], and a whole new meaning to long-haul. The ship was supposed to head north to New Caledonia in the South Pacific. Instead it went south, and sailed straight into a political storm. When a cruise ship wants to dock, it must provide the port with medical records, to show there are no contagious diseases on board. As the Magnifica approached Fremantle in Western Australia, the records showed around 250 people had visited the medical room in the past two weeks. Many were for painkillers, or dressings - routine visits. Crucially, there was no sign of Covid-19 on board. The Magnifica wanted only to refuel and resupply in Fremantle - not disembark. So, as he sailed up the coast, Captain Leotta was surprised to see the news conference from Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan. \"Currently more than 250 passengers [on the Magnifica] have reported upper respiratory illnesses,\" Mr McGowan announced. \"This morning I have contacted the prime minister\u2026I will not allow what happened in Sydney to happen here. \"We will not allow passengers or crew to wander the streets. This is a non-negotiable position.\" Somehow, Mr McGowan had the wrong information. Wires were crossed. The Magnifica was leading the news, when its passengers were healthy - and didn't want to get off anyway. The company insisted there were no respiratory diseases or flu symptoms on board. But Western Australia then accused MSC of \"inconsistent advice\" - something MSC denied. Either way, when it arrived in Fremantle, the ship was greeted by the police and border force - to make sure no one got off - and a handful of protesters. \"Let's say that was not nice,\" says Captain Leotta. \"It was disappointing, first of all because it was fake news. It was wrong. And you can imagine, this news went all around the world immediately.\" Despite the disagreement, the Magnifica was allowed to resupply in Fremantle, before heading onwards. But it would soon be in the headlines again. As the TV crews filmed the Magnifica in Fremantle, and the politicians gave their news conferences, Anura Herath was below decks, out of sight, working hard as usual. Being a chef on a cruise ship is hard enough. It's even harder when the passengers aren't disembarking for meals. But Anura, from Kandy in Sri Lanka, is used to hard work. The 31-year-old has been a chef for seven years, since graduating from a hotel school in Sri Lanka. After working in his home country, he moved to hotels in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, before joining MSC in August 2017. \"In Dubai, the salary is enough, but I could not save much,\" he says. \"So I decided to join the cruise line, because I can save, and I can travel the world.\" After Australia, the Magnifica's plan was to sail to Dubai for a \"technical stop\". But that, too, became impossible so they decided on Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka. By now, Anura didn't want to sail back to Europe. Would he be quarantined, and if so, for how long? How would he get home? And so, he went to his bosses with a plan: let me off in Colombo. Although it seemed to make sense, Sri Lanka would not allow anyone to disembark. He would have to see his homeland appear, and then disappear, from below deck. So, on 4 April - two days before Colombo - Anura, while wearing his chef's whites, recorded a 94-second video message for the Sri Lankan president and prime minister. Let me off, he said in Sinhalese. I am the only Sri Lankan on board. It will be too hard to get back from Italy. After publishing the message, Anura went to work. He shared it with a journalist friend in Sri Lanka, but didn't expect much. After finishing work in the small hours, he went back to his cabin. \"I tried to sleep, but my family called me and told me to look on Facebook,\" he says. \"So I looked - and so many people were sharing this message.\" On Ape Rata - the Sri Lankan site that picked it up - the video was watched half a million times. Now everyone wanted to speak to the chef from Kandy. \"Politicians, navy, army, so many people called,\" he says. \"It was like a dream. Everything was very fast.\" The Sri Lankan president decided to relax the rules and so, as the Magnifica arrived in Colombo to refuel, the navy brought Anura ashore. \"I prayed for it, but I didn't believe it would come,\" he says \"Everybody helped me - all the Sri Lankans.\" For Captain Leotta - who had the final say - it was another first in a journey full of them. \"We were proud of him,\" he says. \"He really did the impossible to get off the ship.\" As it turned out, Anura wasn't the only one to get off in Colombo. A 75-year-old German woman, who needed urgent (non-Covid) care, was also taken ashore and, sadly, later died. As for Anura, he is still in quarantine at the naval centre in Boossa, but hopes to see his mother in Kandy soon. As it pulls into Marseille on Monday, the Magnifica will be one of three cruises still sailing with passengers, the Cruise Lines International Association says. The other two are also due to disembark today: the Pacific Princess in Los Angeles, and the Costa Deliziosa in Barcelona (it will also drop off passengers in Genoa afterwards). For Andy Gerber, who turned 70 in Sydney harbour, life on board \"the last cruise ship on Earth\" has been enjoyable, despite the lack of shore visits. \"There is still plenty to do if you want,\" he says. \"Gym, games, shows, dance classes\u2026 \"We have two pools and perfect weather, plenty to eat and drink, and we have made a lot of friends - especially during all these sea days.\" A Facebook forum is also upbeat. Covid-19 never reached the Magnifica and neither, it seems, did cabin fever. What do I need to know about the coronavirus? While there are some complaints - mainly about other passengers - there are plenty of pictures of singing and dancing. A picture of one performance on 10 April is captioned: \"Maybe this is the only theatre in the world still open.\" And - despite it all - the man at the helm also has happy memories of his truncated tour. \"We found ourselves [globally] in a situation where Covid-19 has been isolating people, and distancing people,\" says Captain Leotta. \"Here was the opposite. We became like a family - our guests and our crew together. The spirit has been beautiful.\" But what of the cruise industry? Can it recover from the bad press, the cancelled bookings, and all the other problems Covid-19 brought? \"We will return to cruising, and we will return better prepared than before with more experience. We are learning a lot, we will be there stronger than ever before.\"", "output": "Coronavirus journey: The 'last cruise ship on Earth' finally comes home", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Every few months, he and his wife Su make the three-hour trip from the Kent coast to a hospital in south London to check it hasn't resurfaced. Steve's cancer, along with years of ill health, was the result of groundbreaking NHS treatment meant to transform his life. As a haemophiliac, his blood was missing the key material needed to clot properly. So like almost every person with the condition in the UK in the 1970s and 80s, he was treated with Factor VIII - an injection that replaces the missing clotting agent. But some UK supplies were imported, and much of the blood plasma used to make Factor VIII came from high-risk donors like prison inmates in the US, who sold their blood for a few dollars a time. \"They didn't explain that there was any risk of contamination,\" Steve says. \"We were exposed time, after time, after time.\" At least 4,689 haemophiliacs like Steve were infected with the blood virus hepatitis C. Around 1,250 were also injected with what were then called \"Aids antibodies\" or HIV, and had to live with the devastating health consequences, along with the stigma and abuse of the time. In the decades since, at least 2,883 have died. The infection changed Steve's life for ever. Hepatitis C is a malicious disease that can take years to take hold, leading to chronic fatigue and nausea. Some 65% develop liver disease which does, in many cases, lead to cirrhosis and cancer. After his diagnosis Steve and Su - from Broadstairs in Kent - were told they couldn't continue their cycle of IVF, ending any hope of having children. 'Ignored' Survivors and their families have been fighting hard for both answers and acceptable compensation for decades. \"I want to try and understand how so many warnings from as early as the 1950s were ignored, how any government can put a small, vulnerable part of their community at such severe risk,\" Steve says. \"And for those responsible, I'd like them to never enjoy a night's sleep ever again for what they did.\" Sarah Dorricott's father Mike died in 2015 at the age of just 47 from liver cancer linked to the hepatitis C he believed he contracted as a teenager. He found he was given Factor VIII before routine dental surgery. Like many mild haemophiliacs he could have been treated with older medication and did not necessarily need the new Factor VIII drug which caused so much damage. He didn't realise he was sick until decades later when he was finally tested for the virus. \"You can't even fathom how angry it makes us that he should never have received this product,\" says Sarah. \"It should not have happened to my father at all.\" Mike Dorricott received two liver transplants to extend his life but the cancer returned each time. Sarah says after his terminal diagnosis he met his local MP, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who \"made lots of promises to my dad\" about support and compensation. \"[He said] that he was going to sort everything out for him and he didn't have to worry about what was going to happen to his family. \"But as far as I'm concerned, he's not fulfilled them,\" she claims. Mr Hunt said he \"was incredibly moved by [Mike's] story, and it was in large part down to his powerful testimony that I successfully made the case to Theresa May for a full public inquiry into the scandal of contaminated blood\". 'Start moving on' In July 2017, the government agreed to a public inquiry into the scandal, after years of campaigning work by families like the Dorricotts. It will look at the reasons so many died, the government response and whether files and other details were destroyed or deliberately covered up decades ago. Contaminated blood also entered the system more directly through transfusions after childbirth or operations. It's thought another 35,000 British patients, all non-haemophiliacs, may have been infected in this way. For the first time, the inquiry will also have the power to demand documents and compel government and NHS officials to testify under oath. High Court judge Sir Brian Langstaff officially takes up his post as chairman this week with the full inquiry expected to start perhaps as early as next month. \"We need to be able to say this is what happened, this is who to blame and this is how we can finally start moving on for this,\" says Sarah Dorricott. \"I've taken the reins from my dad and want to do him proud. I want to say, 'Yes, we have finally got some justice'\" Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.", "output": "'The NHS treatment that caused my cancer'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Most significantly, a ceasefire and peace talks with the Taliban could dramatically improve the chances of survival for the weak Afghan government and army once Western forces leave. In a rare sign of the new relationship, recently not one but several senior Afghan officials in private conversations have praised the Pakistan army and its chief, Gen Ashfaq Kayani, for taking visible actions to encourage reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan government. For years President Hamid Karzai and other officials have openly accused the army and its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of supporting the Afghan Taliban. \"We believe now there is a change in Pakistan's policy and Gen Kiyani is absolutely genuine about helping bring peace to Afghanistan,\" said a senior Afghan adviser to President Karzai. In mid-November, Pakistan freed nine Taliban officials it had been holding, releasing them to the Afghan High Peace Council, which is tasked with opening talks with the Taliban. Pakistan said on 3 December it would soon free more Taliban prisoners. Officials said the ISI was holding at least 100 Taliban leaders and foot soldiers but was expected to free them all. Those Taliban being freed will have complete freedom of movement and association, say senior Pakistan military officials. Pakistan has also pledged not to interfere if the Taliban and the Afghan council want a third country as a venue for future talks. If these initial steps bear fruit, an even more decisive step may come later when the ISI asks hundreds of Taliban commanders and officials fighting Western and Afghan forces inside Afghanistan to support reconciliation talks with Kabul. Deal next year? According to senior Afghan, Pakistani and Western officials, Kabul and Islamabad have prepared roadmaps with timelines outlining how future reconciliation talks could take place. While the Afghans have shared their road map with the Pakistanis and the Americans, the Pakistanis will only do so when the Obama administration offers its own plan. Gen Kayani is now urging Afghan officials to strike a deal with the Taliban as early as next year rather than wait for 2014 as stipulated in its roadmap. However, the wounding of the Afghan intelligence chief on Thursday by a Taliban suicide bomber will be a setback to the process as it could trigger retribution killings. Meanwhile, a formerly slow moving tripartite commission made up of the US, Pakistan and Afghanistan has suddenly got teeth as it discusses issues such as safe passage for the Taliban, who will need to travel for talks, and how to take Taliban names off a UN Security Council list which labels them as terrorists. US-Pakistan relations were broken for the past two years, largely over Afghanistan, but relations are now on the mend. Gen Kayani has recently met US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr Karzai. However, US officials are more sceptical about the military's intentions and will wait to see what else the military delivers. Meanwhile, the US government has reached internal agreement on a policy document that for the first time links reconciliation with the US military withdrawal in 2014. In 2011 the US began secret talks with the Taliban in Qatar, but the Taliban pulled out in March, accusing the Americans of continuously changing their positions. At the time the US military and the CIA were opposed to peace talks. The new US policy document signals that there is now much greater consensus in Washington for talks with the Taliban. So far the Pakistan military has been loath to call its moves a \"change\" or \"shift\" of policy, because that would imply that it supported the Taliban in the past. Military officials argue that Pakistan has been calling for Afghan reconciliation for years, but the facts are that in the past the military has not taken any positive steps to implement reconciliation - something it is now doing. The civilian government has little input in Pakistan's Afghanistan policy. Reluctance The motives for the army's change of thinking is largely due to the worsening security and economic crises as hundreds of people are killed every month. Pakistan faces an insurgency in the north with terrorist strikes being carried out by the Pakistani Taliban, a separatist movement in Balochistan province and ever increasing ethnic and sectarian violence in Karachi. The army, which has endured heavy casualties fighting the Pakistani Taliban, is deeply reluctant to get involved in more fighting. Gen Kayani is now banking on the hope that reconciliation among the Afghans will have a knock-on positive effect on the Pakistani Taliban also - depriving them of legitimacy and recruits. There are several balls now in play. The US insists that the Qatar process is not dead and will respond positively if the Taliban resume that dialogue. Pakistan is not part of the Qatar process and is anxious that its own peace process gets off the ground. Until now the Taliban have said they will not talk to the Kabul government, but Pakistan may get them to change their mind. Qatar's failure has also led to a fierce intra-Taliban debate about the usefulness of talks. Pakistan does not control the Taliban and nor can it force them to the table. However a signal from the military at the right time that Taliban safe havens, recruitment drives, fundraising and other activities will come to an end by a certain date will put enormous pressure on the Taliban. Yet Pakistan cannot afford to antagonise the Taliban so that another front is opened and they join up with Pakistani extremists to fight the government. Time is now of the essence, even for the Taliban as their own public support base would not relish the thought of war continuing beyond 2014. And although President Karzai is unpopular, he cannot be a candidate for presidential elections in 2014, which now offers the opportunity of a new and invigorated Afghan leadership. Pakistan has supported the Taliban for too long and has paid a bitter, bloody price. However if all players are now learning that there is no way forward except for reconciliation, that effort needs uninhibited international support. The Americans in particular need to appoint a heavyweight diplomat to take the peace process forward, and President Obama needs to personally get engaged - something he has declined to do so far. Nato needs to play less of a waiting game and be more proactive in pushing the US to speed up the talks process. Above all, the Afghans who have battled for 34 years need to show maturity and seek a peaceful resolution to their wars.", "output": "Viewpoint: Pakistan seeks Afghan talks between government, Taliban and US", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters are teenagers who meet at a cancer support group and fall in love. It has become a worldwide success, with the 2012 novel having already sold nine million copies by the time its film adaptation topped the UK and US box office charts earlier this year. But for Samantha Shannon, author of The Bone Season series, the book still suffers from the label of \"young adult fiction\", or YA. She believes the genre's wide selection of novels, from James Dashner's The Maze Runner to Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, are tarred with the same brush - dismissed as works only for teenagers. \"I do feel there is a sense of young adult fiction being looked down upon,\" Shannon explained to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, when invited on the show by guest editor and singer Tracey Thorn. She said: \"There is a very strong sense of these novels [being categorised] both in terms of genre and age limit. \"But the idea that all YA is bad and doesn't challenge you in any way is ludicrous.\" Shannon believes adults should not belittle the genre just because it is populated predominantly with teenage characters: \"There's this bizarre idea that adults can't empathise with teenagers - even that there's something embarrassing about reading books about young people. \"That indicates to me that they're saying there's something fundamentally embarrassing about being a teenager.\" For broadcaster and author Caitlin Moran, young adult fiction also suffers from being pigeon-holed as a genre for girls. She said: \"The majority of it is written by and read by women, and the problem with anything women do is that it's looked down on, even though it sells more. \"The phrase 'chick lit' tells you everything you need to know about the way that people feel about women who write and read books, and the way that things are categorised. \"There are no categories for male fiction, it's all just 'books'.\" But she believes the importance of the genre for girls should not be underestimated. \"One of the big things that YA has done over the last couple of years is put forward very strong female role models,\" she explains, particularly in a landscape dominated by what she describes as the \"pretty girl\" and the \"manic, pixie fairy girl\". But she does worry that female protagonists in the genre's biggest titles, from Veronica Roth's Divergent to Suzanne Collins's The Hunger Games, are unnervingly resolute and heroic - both physically and emotionally. \"If I was a teenage girl and my big teenage female role models at the moment were all people in a dystopia who had to save the world, that's quite a lot of pressure when you're 13 and you're still trying to\u2026 work out what to do with your hair,\" says Moran. For Shannon, however, the genre's limitations come not from the characterisation of protagonists, but from how authors are expected to conform with the most successful novels. In particular, she feels her own work is pinned back by comparisons to the genre's most notable export - The Hunger Games's Katniss Everdeen, played on the big screen by actress Jennifer Lawrence. The third instalment of the film franchise, which centres on Everdeen - the reluctant heroine of a brutal reality show - accounted for two out of every three cinema tickets sold in the UK during the first week of its release in November. But Shannon believes the film's success does not excuse the fact she regularly faces questions such as 'Is your character based on Katniss Everdeen?' and 'How is she like Katniss Everdeen?' when asked about her own novels. \"YA fiction with female characters,\" she explains \"is now judged in a slightly different way to [books] with male characters,\" adding that the latter would not consistently be held up against Sherlock Holmes or Harry Potter. The success of young adult novels and their film adaptations has seemingly served only to reinforce preconceived ideas about the genre's characterisations. But perhaps this masks a great irony. Moran, a self-confessed \"snob\" in her reading preferences as a teenager, explains she purposefully read novels from the 19th and early 20th centuries as a girl, rather than those which would now be classed as young adult fiction - all in an attempt to feel more sophisticated. \"But now if I look at those books - Gone With the Wind and Jane Eyre, everything by the Bronte [sisters], all the [Jane] Austen novels - the female characters in them are teenagers,\" she says. The teenage Moran was \"inadvertently reading young adult fiction\". And perhaps many of the adults who scorn the likes of The Fault in Our Stars and The Hunger Games are doing exactly the same.

It has apologised for past failures in its \"organisational culture\". But one ex-employee said \"not a lot has changed\" at the charity in terms of its leadership since she was there in 2015. The review led by ethics expert Suzanne Shale was commissioned in February after sexual abuse claims against Oxfam GB staff in Haiti became public and threw a spotlight on the entire charity sector. Sexual harassment allegations that had been made by women against Save the Children's former chief executive Justin Forsyth and its former director of policy, Brendan Cox, were later revealed by the BBC. 'Spontaneous anger' Both men apologised for their past behaviour but said they did not accept all the claims that had been made against them. But Mr Forsyth subsequently resigned from his role as deputy director of Unicef, saying he did not want coverage of his past to \"damage\" the charities. Some 28% of the 700 current members of staff who responded to the review said they had experienced discrimination or harassment - 19% of the charity's total 1,068 staff, not including volunteers. The most common complaint from staff was of people's opinions being ignored but some said they had experienced \"spontaneous anger\" and had felt humiliated and ridiculed. Dr Shale's report said there were \"a small number of incidents of gender harassment and unwanted sexual attention\" in the last three years although no evidence of sexual coercion. Incidents highlighted included: Dr Shale said while most staff found Save the Children a \"supportive and collegiate\" employer \"any experiences of interpersonal mistreatment at work are disturbing\". The review called on the charity to provide better oversight and governance of staff. Chief executive Kevin Watkins pledged swift action on the findings, saying staff would be consulted on a new plan to ensure improvements in working culture. Mandatory training The charity would also aim to improve the diversity of its staff following recommendations from Dr Shale. \"Our brilliant, passionate, hard-working staff are committed to our mission of bringing hope to some of the world's most vulnerable children. They have a right to be protected against harassment of any kind,\" Mr Watkins said. He added: \"There have been failures in our organisational culture and processes, including widely reported historic cases in which there were abuses of power and authority. \"To the women affected, I unreservedly and unconditionally apologise on behalf of Save the Children.

Ms de Cairies said: \"I thought it said a lot of the same things that we saw in 2015 when I worked at the charity. Not a lot has changed in terms of the leadership of the charity.\" The Charity Commission is separately investigating how Save the Children dealt with allegations of misconduct and harassment against its staff.", "output": "Save the Children review details harassment of staff", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The band has a nihilist vibe as she screams and roars into a mic accompanied by feedback, dissonance and Ruben's impassioned drumming. He likes to play shirtless, showing off his heavily tattooed torso with the words Please Kill Me scrawled in capitals across his chest. They seem pretty hardcore at first, but looks can be deceptive as it quickly becomes apparent they are deeply in love having found a semblance of peace in each other's company. They're on a never-ending American tour, driving around in an RV that is so cool you immediately think of booking yourself a coast-to-coast driving holiday and then realise you can't because of Covid, but then you have to dream. They do. Of a new album, of a life together, of the open road. And then\u2026 Ruben loses his hearing. The doctor doesn't know why, could be the music, could be an autoimmune problem. Either way it isn't coming back and Ruben can't expose what little hearing he has left to any more rock 'n' roll. Game over. Story begins. Riz Ahmed is exceptional as the thwarted, scared, jumpy Ruben. He plays the character like a champion jockey, one moment he's reining in Ruben's brooding temper just before he explodes, the next he's giving him his head to make a connection with pupils attending a school for deaf children. His nomination for an Oscar is well-deserved. Olivia Cooke also turns in a solid performance as Lou, Lauren Ridloff steals the screen as a deaf schoolteacher, and Paul Raci - who is also nominated for an Oscar (supporting actor) - does a fine job as Joe, the shamanic elder statesman and Vietnam veteran running a rural retreat for people who are deaf and have addictions. Sound of Metal was co-written and directed by Darius Marder, a relative newcomer with a promising future. At no point does he let you forget this is a film about the sensation of sound, from the ever-present subtitles to the constant switching between audio POVs: complete silence, natural sound, distorted interference. It's unusual and effective and, unsurprisingly, the sound team are also nominated for an Oscar. It does have shortcomings, although at a gently paced two hours, duration isn't one of them. The plot lacks subtlety and depth. Ruben is taken to the edge but never forced to look over the precipice - instead he is allowed to exist in a comfort zone without the opportunity to fully reveal his character. And the binary position he is put in - either accept and embrace your hearing loss, or try to fix it and push off - is a little simplistic. But Ahmed's performance rises above any patchiness in the script to make this one of the season's must-see movies. Sound of Metal is available on Amazon Prime Video from 12 April and released in cinemas from 17 May.

The first-born son of the late president was nicknamed \"Fidelito\", or Little Fidel, after his father. He was a nuclear physicist, trained by the former Soviet Union. \"Fidel Castro D\u00edaz-Balart, who had been treated by a group of doctors for several months due to deep depression, took his life this morning,\" Cuba's official newspaper Granma reported - little more than a year after the death of his father. State television said he had been receiving medical treatment as an outpatient in recent months, following a hospital stay. Depression in the spotlight - Will Grant, BBC News, Havana Fidel \u00c1ngel Castro D\u00edaz-Balart had taken his own life after suffering with deep depression which doctors had been treating him for over several months, state TV said. As much as the death itself may shock ordinary Cubans, it was those unexpected circumstances which caught them by surprise. As the personal lives of members of the Castro family are generally kept away from the public eye, almost no-one will have known he suffered mental health issues prior to the announcement of his death. Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? At the time of his death, he was a scientific adviser for the Cuban Council of State and he served as vice president of Cuba's Academy of Sciences. He headed the island's nuclear programme from 1980 to 1992, before it was suspended after the Soviet Union's collapse. He was married to Mar\u00eda Victoria Barreiro and had three children from his previous marriage - Fidel Antonio Castro Smirnov, Mirta Mar\u00eda Castro Smirnova and Jos\u00ad\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Castro Smirnov. Fidel Castro D\u00edaz-Balart was born in 1949, during his father's brief first marriage to Mirta D\u00edaz-Balart, the daughter of a prominent pre-revolution politician. His father went on to overthrow the US-backed dictator, Fulgencio Batista, in 1959 - when his mother's family fled the island and went to Florida. His parents divorced and \"Fidelito\" spent some of his early years in the US before his father managed to bring him back to Cuba. This history explains why some of his close maternal relatives are among the most committed critics of the Cuban government - such as his cousin, Mario D\u00edaz-Balart, a US congressman. Fidelito himself was loyal to the ideals of the Cuban revolution, but was said in recent years to have grown weary - both of living in his father's shadow and having been sidelined from Cuban decision-making on energy resources, said reports. His ideas for developing renewable energy on the island were not incorporated into state policy, an academic colleague, Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, told Reuters. \"I imagine that was disappointing for him,\" Mr Benjamin-Alvarado said.

Kennedy wrote the entry in the summer of 1945 after touring the German dictator's Bavarian mountain retreat. It is thought by historians to be the only diary ever kept by the 35th US president. The original copy will be auctioned for the first time on 26 April in Boston by longtime owner Deirdre Henderson, who worked as a research assistant for Kennedy while he was a US senator with White House ambitions. He wrote that Hitler \"had boundless ambition for his country which rendered him a menace to the peace of the world, but he had a mystery about him in the way he lived and in the manner of his death that will live and grow after him\". The 61-page diary was kept by Kennedy around four months after Hitler committed suicide. At the time, the young American was touring Europe as a newspaper reporter after finishing his military service aboard a ship in the Pacific Ocean. Nearly two decades later Kennedy would address crowds in West Berlin as US president. He gave Ms Henderson the diary in order to inform her of his views on foreign policy and national security, she said. In a description of the auction, she wrote: \"When JFK said that Hitler 'had in him the stuff of which legends are made', he was speaking to the mystery surrounding him, not the evil he demonstrated to the world.\" \"Nowhere in this diary, or in any of his writings, is there any indication of sympathy for Nazi crimes or cause,\" she continued. The diary also contains JFK's thoughts about the British election and Winston Churchill, who Ms Henderson called his \"idol\".

Now, we can all obviously appreciate Britney as pop royalty, but I was surprised such an arresting scent would have a celebrity's name attached to it. Not long ago, fragrances were associated with well-established, fashionable names such as Ralph Lauren or couture brands like Chanel. But the number of celebrity perfumes on the market has rocketed in the last decade. Why? Jennifer Lopez. \"Glow changed everything,\" says Chandler Burr, the former scent critic for the New York Times and author of several books on the subject. He credits Lopez's first fragrance, which was released in 2002, with triggering a deluge of deodorants. \"Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first [to have her own scent], but Glow kicked the whole thing into overdrive,\" he says. Lopez had sparked what Jezebel brilliantly described as the \"scentocalpyse\". Suddenly, everyone and their goldfish had a scent of their own. And they sold by the truckload. \"Brands can see a huge surge in sales and awareness when a celebrity face resonates with their audience,\" says Gill Smith, managing director of The Perfume Shop. She cites Beyonce and Ariana Grande's ranges as some of the store's most popular products. So, what is the appeal of celebrity fragrances? \"Identification and intimacy,\" says Burr. \"Scent is an affordable unit of a star. Assuming the celebrity has actually been involved in its creation, a scent constitutes identification with that star viscerally and intimately. It is, in a small way, meeting them.\" Perfumes ideally have to match the celebrity's image while also appealing to their core audience (which explains why pop stars with younger fanbases have fragrances with sugary sweet smells). Smith says: \"We all still aspire to be more like our idols and connecting through a fragrance is one way of doing that. \"Britney Spears has stood the test of time. Diehard fans who wore Britney Fantasy over 12 years ago are still coming to us to try her new fragrances.\" This is probably a good moment for me to make a confession. And, before I start, it's not something I'm proud of, ok? It was August 2014. I'd been to Spain on holiday and was in the duty free section of Barcelona Airport. Early, bored and trying to get rid of the last of my euros, I was spraying various aftershaves up and down my arm when one caught my nose. I looked at the bottle and was surprised to see it was something called The Secret by Antonio Banderas. So I bought it, and was duly mocked by my friends for having spent money on something called The Secret by Antonio Banderas. But it did make me realise that, if something smells good, it will sell regardless. For celebrities who don't want to release a fragrance under their own name, the mere act of endorsing an existing brand can have a huge impact. \"Johnny Depp as the face of Dior Sauvage has helped to drive awareness for that fragrance,\" Smith says. \"Eighteen months after launch it's still one of our top 10 sales every day. \"Other examples include Gigi Hadid with Tommy Girl; Jared Leto with Gucci; and Estee Lauder Modern Muse with Kendall Jenner.\" She adds: \"More recently the announcement of Guerlain working with Angelina Jolie has given a more traditional fragrance house a celebrity boost.\" The stigma around celebrity fragrances may have faded over the last few years - but now the sales are fading as well. It's a decline that started several years ago in the US. \"We saw it in 2008 right after the crash, and it's now a given in the US industry that the celebrity market has collapsed - or at least hugely shrunk,\" Burr explains. \"Rihanna and a few others have scents that are doing well, but it's nothing like before.\" Consumers in the UK appear to be turning their noses up at them too. Figures released by market research group National Purchase Diary (NPD) show sales of celebrity fragrances declined by \u00a312m in the UK last year - a drop of 22%. But the fragrance market as a whole actually grew by 1.4% - so it's not that people stopped buying perfume, just that they're less drawn to celebrities. Just look at the sales of couture brands like Prada, Chanel and Dior, which collectively saw a 6% increase last year. \"The decline in celebrity perfumes is something we noticed in the past two years - it's not something we see normally,\" says Teresa Fisher, senior account manager in UK Beauty at NPD. That drop, she points out, could partly be down to fewer launches. \"The market was very healthy a few years ago because there were a lot of celebrity fragrances around,\" Fisher says. \"We saw One Direction and James Bond scents generate market growth, but now we aren't seeing as many celebrity launches.\" There might be fewer celebrities cologne-ising the shelves (sorry), but Smith says the market is still strong. \"It's definitely not the end of celebrity fragrance, we do still believe there is a place in the market for them,\" she says. \"Customers still want celebrity perfumes as long as it is the right celebrity, and the right scent.\" The right scent, of course, is the crucial part. When he was the NYT's scent critic, Burr famously awarded Britney's Midnight Fantasy four stars, implying there should be no snobbery about celebrities if the smell itself is good. He cites Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely as one of the best of the celebrity fragrances he came across and is now even developing his own, called You or Someone Like You. Fisher says: \"I think overall what we're seeing is the polarisation of the fragrance market. \"At one end, consumers look for value for money, they go for promotions and maybe celebrity fragrances. But at the other, consumers are becoming more selective. \"Rather than buying 10 times a year maybe they buy five times a year. They're spending the same amount of money but going towards a more niche or premium offering.\" The fragrance industry was worth \u00a31.25bn in the UK last year, and shows no signs of slowing any time soon. But if the current sales trends continue, there could well be far fewer famous faces plastered across perfumes in the future.

During a confrontation at the jail, Bronson said he had intended to put Mr Doherty in a gentle \"bear hug\" and ask \"where's my wife's photos?\". Bronson, who denies the offence, is currently serving a life term. Leeds Crown Court previously heard he pinned Mr Doherty to the ground and threatened to bite his nose off prior to a welfare meeting in January this year. Jurors heard Bronson was angry over a decision to ban electronic devices at his marriage to actress Paula Williamson in November 2017, for which he blamed the governor. 'Arrogant, ignorant man' Giving his version of events, Bronson, representing himself, said he was \"upset\" by the decision a few days before the ceremony to not allow the photographs to be taken out of prison. He was further angered, he said, that his son George - an \"ex-paparazzi\" - and a man he named as Basky Baskerville, described by Bronson as \"a lunatic\" who would often run on to football pitches, were not allowed to attend. \"When I went into the room I was not happy at all with the governor. I don't like him, make no bones about it. An arrogant, ignorant man,\" he said. Bronson, who claimed to have tripped as he entered the room, said he had no intention of harming Mr Doherty and his reputation had caused prison staff to \"over-react\" and restrain him. He also suggested Mr Doherty's \"minor\" injuries could have been caused by a prison officer. \"It's a possibility, it happens,\" he said. \"If I was going to attack him he would have had serious facial injuries.\" He said his nose-biting comment, caught on bodycam, was \"horrible\" but \"a figure of speech\" he would never dream of carrying out. Bronson concluded his evidence by thanking members of the jury for listening to him, adding that although he had been making progress in prison it \"wasn't to be\". 'Don't mess with mother' \"Members of the jury, here I am facing the biggest farce probably in prison history and that's why I am here today,\" he said. Cross-examining Bronson, prosecutor Carl Fitch outlined a number of Bronson's previous convictions, including one for actual bodily harm against the governor of HMP Woodhill in 2014, The attack came after the governor decided to stop Bronson's post going out, the court heard. \"My mother's post by the way. I should have punched him a few more times as well,\" Bronson said. \"You don't mess around with elderly ladies, especially my mother.\" Bronson, currently at HMP Frankland in Durham and who is standing trial under the name Charles Salvador, denies attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.

The safety of citizens \"must be put before everything else\", Mr Price said. But Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething cited advice that cancelling events would not make a difference in saving lives. However he said a recommendation the Scottish Government has made, that large events should not go ahead from next week, is also being considered in Wales. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said that, from Friday, people with symptoms of a new cough or fever would be asked to self-isolate for seven days as part of an escalated response to the coronavirus. Plaid earlier cancelled its own spring party conference, due to be held on 20-21 March in Llangollen. Welsh Labour and the Liberal Democrats also announced they have cancelled their conferences. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has recommended that mass events involving more than 500 people should not go ahead from next week. Mark Reckless, Brexit Party group leader in the assembly, called for all schools in Wales to be closed from Monday. \"I recognise the disruption this will cause, but I believe social distancing should begin sooner rather than later, and that doing so now may make a significant difference to the rate of infection and save lives,\" he said. Adam Price said: \"The safety of our citizens - including the most vulnerable and at risk of coronavirus, must be put before everything else.\" He called for the Welsh Government to take \"urgent and aggressive action\" rather \"than waiting for instruction from London\". They should consider instructing public sector workers to work from home, whether schools should break up early for Easter, the party leader said. \"All mass gatherings and events should be postponed or cancelled with immediate effect - that would mean no indoor gatherings larger than 100 and no outdoor gathering larger than 500.\" Earlier Plaid Cymru said cancelling its conference \"is the most responsible course of action for the party to take in the current circumstances.\" Conservative assembly member Andrew RT Davies said postponing the Wales-Scotland match was \"surely the sensible move\". In a robust response, Mr Gething told a press conference that politicians, including those in the opposition, should take a \"responsible approach\" and should not try to suggest \"there is public health advice to take a step when actually it does not exist\". \"The challenge about larger events is that the science doesn't tell us it really makes a difference either in significantly delaying the peak of the outbreak or indeed in terms of saving life.\" However, he said that the Scottish Government view on larger events may be taken by Welsh Government. \"That is something we are actively considering. And we may make the same decision next week as well.\" He said the Scottish Government was thinking about the impact on emergency services.

They are just one of a range of creatures that make their home around the carcasses of the giant mammals, in communities known as \"whale falls\". Mr Higgs will join the research trip led by senior scientist Robert Vrijenhoek of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. He will take part in a week-long cruise in which they will survey four whale falls - three artificial and one natural. By studying the worms, scientists hope to learn more about these communities evolved. Whale falls occur when a whale dies in the deep ocean and sinks to the sea floor. Unlike whales that die in shallow waters (less than 200m deep), whose carcasses are quickly devoured by scavengers, the whale carcasses in the deep oceans can provide a feast for a complex community of organisms. Species found around whale falls range from clams and shrimp to larger creatures like octopuses, lobsters and even sharks. Osedax worms were not discovered until 2002 when they were observed living on the bones of a decaying grey whale in Monterey Bay, California. The worms, named after the Latin osedax or \"bone-eating\", are commonly called bone worms or zombie worms because of their strange feeding practices. Even though the worms have no mouth or stomach, they are able to burrow into the solid bone to feed and can eventually destroy an entire whale skeleton, leaving virtually no trace of the fossil record. Nick is particularly interested in how they bore into the bone: \"Because Osedax worms were only discovered a few years ago, there's still an awful lot we don't know about them. \"For example, different species of worm appear to like different parts of the bone, with some staying around the surface and others burrowing deep into the middle. \"I can also use CT scans to generate a 3D image of the bore holes and what they look like from the inside. Armed with this information, I hope to explore fossilized whale bones to see if I can find traces of this bone-eating worm in the fossil record.\" Researchers rarely stumble across natural whale falls so a lot of the communities they study are from whales that have died through beaching, which they then take back out to sea and artificially 'sink'. They will use submersible robots fitted with cameras to observe the communities surrounding the whales and may collect samples to study back in the lab.", "output": "Leeds student and the deep-sea 'zombie worms'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

He said it was a \"common story\" among many patients seen by consultants at Castle Hill Hospital in Hull. The government said it had \"full confidence in these tests\". Prof Morice started showing signs of the virus last month and was tested at the drive-through swabbing site at Castle Hill Hospital. He said: \"It came back negative and I was advised I could go back to work but at that point I couldn't lift my head off the pillow. \"By the second week I felt very unwell. The lethargy was absolutely dreadful and by day 10 my heart went a bit dicky. \"There was no point doing another test because clinically it was obvious I had the virus.\" Prof Morice said the test was accurate in terms of a positive result, but that a negative test \"meant nothing\". In response, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We have full confidence in these tests - they're reliable and our highly-skilled scientists do everything possible to make sure false results are extremely rare.\" \"More than 1.4 million people have now been tested, and the vast majority have had no issues with their test results.\" Prof Morice said negative tests results could give carriers false confidence to go about their lives as normal and inadvertently spread the disease. He added: \"It's vitally important especially now as restrictions are being eased and people are going back to work that if you are displaying symptoms, even if you've tested negative, then you should assume you have the virus and should self isolate.\" Patrick Lillie, infectious diseases consultant at Castle Hill, said in about 75% of cases, infected patients would get a positive result. He said in instances of false negatives, it would be linked to not getting a good enough swab or the virus being too far down in the chest. \"If you've got classic coronavirus illness and an X-ray which looks like coronavirus, it doesn't matter what the test says, you should treat them as if they have it,\" he said.

But he said people must continue to respect social distancing measures. It comes as a further 36 deaths from coronavirus were announced in the past 24 hours. It brings the UK death toll - across all settings - to 41,698. The latest daily figure is the lowest since before lockdown began on 23 March, but there tends to be fewer deaths reported at the weekend, because of a reporting lag. While food shops and pharmacies, as well as other essential retailers including banks and petrol stations, have been open throughout lockdown, non-essential stores, such as book shops and fashion outlets, have been shuttered since 23 March. The prime minister said he was \"very optimistic about the opening [of shops]\", but stressed \"the most important thing is public safety and the health of our country\". He said it was difficult to tell whether there would be \"a huge wave... or a trickle\" of customers on Monday, but urged the public returning to the shops \"to observe the rules on social distancing and do it safely\". With \"fewer than 1 in 1000 cases in the population\", people had made \"a huge sacrifice...and we can't throw it away\", Mr Johnson said. Analysis: A re-imagined shopping experience By Katy Austin, business correspondent Not all shops will raise the shutters on day one: the reopening will be gradual. But for many, it's an important opportunity to welcome spending customers back in store. Having spent time and money preparing safety measures, in line with \"Covid-secure\" guidelines, shop owners are hoping the public will have the confidence to return, and that they will follow rules on queuing and hygiene. Some expect an initial surge of activity; others expect much lower levels of trade in the coming months, compared to before the crisis. One reason is that social distancing will limit the number of customers in store, another is that the experience will be different. There will be less spontaneous browsing, for example, and no relaxing at a caf\u00e9 or restaurant while most hospitality venues remain closed. The lockdown also accelerated the move towards online shopping, with fewer physical stores likely to be needed in future. Mr Johnson's comments echoed those of Chancellor Rishi Sunak who earlier praised retailers' \"extraordinary\" efforts to create a 'Covid-secure' environment. From Monday, most retailers can open as long as they follow safety guidelines. Those who fail to ensure their premises are Covid-secure could face enforcement notices. Plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft 5ins) apart - already a regular fixture in supermarkets - will be a key feature. Other measures will include pleas not to touch items unless customers intend to purchase them and decontaminating shopping baskets after each use. It comes as Mr Johnson faces increased pressure to ease the 2m social distancing rule, which many ministers see as crucial to the further reopening of the economy. Mr Sunak told the BBC the government would \"actively\" look again at the measure, given its \"enormous impact\" on the profitability of businesses. \"You are right to highlight the impact it has on business - it is the difference between maybe three-quarters and a third of pubs opening, for example, so it is important we look at it.\" It is understood the review will aim to report back by 4 July - currently the earliest mooted date for the reopening of pubs, bars, restaurants and hairdressers in England. While other countries have enforced a lesser distance of 1m (just over 3ft), in keeping with the World Health Organization's recommendation, the UK government's scientific advisers have so far maintained that being 1m apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. \"Ultimately it is for ministers [to decide],\" said Mr Sunak. \"We are the people who are elected to make decisions in this country. People should hold us responsible and accountable for making those decisions.\" The chancellor acknowledged many people would be \"anxious\" at the prospect of going out shopping again after almost three months in lockdown. But he stressed \"it is a safe environment and we should all be able to go out knowing that we should be able to shop in confidence\". \"Shops up and down the country are desperate to welcome us all back and I think we all want to see our High Streets spring back to life again,\" he said. 'If we don't innovate, we won't be here for long' Designer men's clothing retailer Brother2Brother will be reopening its Reading store on Monday for the first time since March. Buying director Steven Hall said the firm \"could not wait\" to reopen, although the shopping experience might be different from what customers are used to - with staff provided with PPE and a limit of six customers at a time. In addition to \"cleaning of counters after every purchase [and] cleaning of the changing rooms after use... we will also have to quarantine the goods for at least 24 hours before they are put back into circulation\". He added that customers will be encouraged to try things on at home and return them where possible and \"pretty much everything\" will be given a sale price as the company looks to shift its seasonal stock. One way the store is attempting to drum up business is by letting customers book 30-minute slots, allowing staff to prepare a selection of items suited to their tastes. \"If we don't try to innovate and make sure business can operate at some sort of level we probably wouldn't be here for very long,\" Mr Hall said.

The targets were published as part of a review into how the BBC is governed, following what the trust called \"a number of significant failures\". Several changes will be made to make the BBC more \"accountable and transparent\". The BBC Trust will regularly publish the objectives it sets for Lord Hall from now on. It said the \"quality, variety and originality of new drama on BBC One\" should be one of his \"immediate priorities\", especially in peak time. BBC One has recently enjoyed success with Doctor Who and Last Tango in Halifax. However, other dramas such as The White Queen and Ripper Street - which was cancelled last week - have not done so well. The \"quality and prominence\" of BBC One and BBC Two's current affairs coverage was another key area where Lord Hall was encouraged to \"achieve new peaks of distinctiveness\" by looking at the \"creative culture\" in TV management and commissioning. The governance review was launched in September following \"a year of difficult events at the BBC\". They included revelations about late presenter Jimmy Savile, multi-million pound pay-offs to senior management and the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative (DMI), which wasted almost \u00a3100m. 'Sensible changes' The review's key conclusion is that there has been \"confusion about who is responsible for what in certain key operational areas and this has undermined confidence in the governance and operation of the BBC\". BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said he and Lord Hall had now agreed some \"sensible changes\" to the working relationship between the Trust and the BBC Executive, to make things clearer in terms of their roles and responsibilities. There will now be new three-stage performance reporting, to ensure better monitoring of specific BBC projects. It will enable issues to be identified and dealt with early - unlike the DMI project, which was supposed to modernise the BBC's video production and archive systems, but which collapsed after five years, at a cost of \u00a398.4m. The BBC's Executive Board, which is responsible for making decisions, will now have to report to the Trust more often and more comprehensively throughout the year, so that the trust can assess how it is doing. Some of these meetings will be filmed and broadcast on the trust website, including end of year discussions about the corporation's performance. The trust will also ask licence fee payers to help set the priorities for the BBC each year, but it will no longer involve itself in operational decision making. \"This is an important first step in making the BBC simpler and better run,\" said Lord Hall of the changes, which come into effect from 1 April, 2014. Value for money The BBC has also appointed former Sony chairman and CEO, Sir Sir Howard Stringer, to strengthen the team and bring his \"extensive broadcasting and commercial experience\" to the BBC Executive Board from 1 January, as one of two new Non-Executive Directors. \"People don't just expect the BBC to produce great programmes, they want it to be run well,\" said Lord Patten. \"While much has gone well in the past, the last 15 months have seen a number of significant failures. [These changes mean] the BBC can get on with the job of running the BBC, and the Trust can rightly focus on holding the Executive to account on behalf of licence fee payers.\" One of the other objectives laid out by the Trust, and originally sent to Lord Hall in July, is that \"BBC managers need to spend public money as if it is their own money\". In an effort to improve the value for money provided to licence fee payers, the BBC is also tasked with providing \"a clear and sustainable response to the NAO's review on severance payments, to make sure we put a stop to any future excessive payments\". Lord Hall announced within his first few weeks in the job that he would put a \u00a3150,000 cap on pay-offs for senior managers. Other objectives include pursuing new creative partnerships with other major cultural organisations and institutions and responding to the general issues revealed by the Pollard report.

Learners will have to follow road signs or a series of directions rather than being told where and when to turn. The new practical standard also applies to the motorcycle module two test and to the LGV test. Chris Nelson, 18, from Hampshire agreed to try it out to see how it compares with the old one. He originally passed last year with a few minor faults and said he found it quite easy. \"The manoeuvres were hard but my driving instructor had prepared me well,\" he said. 'Likely to fail' Once in the car, Chris was told to follow signs to Stanmore, northwest London, for 10 minutes without asking for help. He managed OK but said he found it hard because there was a lot to think about at the same time. \"You do have to look at the signs and it does take you away from concentrating on your driving,\" he admitted. \"If I had had that as my driving test a year ago I think I would have got more flustered, which would have made me more likely to fail.\" One of the reasons the new test has been brought in is because the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) found new drivers were struggling to find their way around after they had passed. Pass Rates Chris thinks the independent driving will make things easier in the long run. \"People drive to different destinations all the time and they need to know how to get there. \"But if you have just started it will be harder and you will probably have to have more lessons.\" The DSA says it does not expect there to be a big drop in the pass rate and that drivers shouldn't need any more lessons. Chris's examiner Cheryl also thought it would also be quite straightforward. \"Now that instructors know this is going to be included it will be quite easy for them to prepare their pupils,\" she said.", "output": "Driving test changes bring in 'independent driving'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Habbo's owner, Sulake, is operating a separate temporary site called The Great Unmute where they can post their thoughts. Experts said that Habbo must end its reliance on human moderators. At launch the site was inaccessible for many and Paul LaFontaine, Sulake's chief executive, tweeted: \"We have so many users hitting the site we had to increase processing capacity by 400%. Keep it coming!\" The temporary site was originally scheduled to be taken offline at 8pm BST, but Mr LaFontaine said that limit would be extended to \"make sure everyone gets the chance to input their story\". Habbo's future Habbo temporarily removed its chat facility last week after Channel 4 reported that the service was routinely being used by adults to engage children in explicit conversations about sex. \"For a full week since Channel Four's report went on air, my team has worked tirelessly to create the best possible solutions to the challenges we face from a small minority,\" said Mr LaFontaine. \"Now it's time to allow our loyal and legitimate users a brief chance to have their say before we finalise our plans for Habbo's future.\" As well as written comment, Habbos will also be able to upload multimedia content. \"The Great Unmute is a chance to get creative in new ways; the site will allow multimedia content, giving users a real chance express their views in a responsible way with a watching world,\" said Mr LaFontaine. \"You have my word, my team and I will be reading every comment, looking at every picture and watching every video clip. My commitment to you right now is to deliver the safest possible user experience.\" Behaviour profiling Some believe that the answer to the problems experienced by Habbo could be solved by investing in technological solutions. Adam Hildreth, chief executive of Crisp Thinking, a firm which provides monitoring technology for hundreds of online children's games, told the BBC: \"The current Habbo model is completely flawed. 200 moderators for over 70 million messages each day is never going to work.\" \"Habbo has to invest in some clever technology, whether they develop it themselves or use a third-party. Otherwise they are fighting a losing battle,\" he added. Crisp's technology employs behaviour profiling and is used by online children's games, including Moshi Monsters and Bin Weevils. It is often used in conjunction with human moderators. The tech has also recently be used by the Metropolitan Police to analyse chat logs of a man suspected of online grooming. \"It is able to distinguish between kids being kids and an adult pretending to be a kid,\" said Mr Hildreth.", "output": "Habbo Hotel opens separate site to seek users' views", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Meanwhile, technical analysis for a group of developing countries says Western nations have a duty to absorb CO2 over the coming decades. It also says the West is not living up to promises on climate finance. The summit opens at the end of the month in Durban, South Africa. Earlier this week, the powerful BASIC group - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - agreed a common position during a meeting in Beijing. Among other things, their ministerial declaration asserts that \"unilateral measures on climate change, such as the inclusion of emissions from international aviation in the EU-ETS (emission trading scheme), would violate the principles and provisions of the convention and jeopardise the effort of international co-operation in addressing climate change\". From next January, airlines operating flights beginning or ending at EU airports will be included in the carbon pricing scheme. The EU is not going to back down from the scheme at this late stage; so the Indian paper sets the scene for a new intractable conflict within the already strife-ridden climate negotiations. Weight of history Potentially even more damaging is the technical analysis provided to the BASIC ministers by an expert advisory group. Working from the standpoint that western nations have a heavy responsibility for climate change because they industrialised first through fossil fuel burning, the experts reviewed various studies on what a fair and equitable allocation of future emissions might look like. The analysis, seen by BBC News, is that industrialised countries should become net absorbers of CO2 rather than net emitters. In the first half of this century, it concludes, the developed world should absorb 239-474 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide while developing countries continue to emit. That, the experts say, would be fair and equitable. Analysts say it is not clear how far the BASIC bloc will push this line in negotiations. Although the West's historical role is acknowledged in the UN climate convention, demands that Western countries become net carbon absorbers would not be countenanced. 'Not new' Also included in the expert advice is a damning analysis of \"fast-start\" climate finance provided by western countries. At the Copenhagen summit two years ago, developed nations agreed to provide $30bn (\u00a319bn) of \"new and additional\" money over the period 2010-2012 to assist developing countries in \"greening\" their economies and protecting against climate impacts. Though much of the money has been pledged, the BASIC analysis says that only a small proportion is truly \"new and additional\" - the majority coming from aid budgets or programmes that were in existence before Copenhagen. Since that ill-starred meeting, a number of development charities have made the same point. The BASIC ministerial declaration also re-iterates the call for developed countries to pledge new emission cuts within the legally binding framework of the Kyoto Protocol. At the Beijing meeting, ministers referred to continuation of the protocol's binding curbs as \"non-negotiable\", sources say. However, Japan, Russia and Canada have made it plain that they will neither negotiate on the pledges they made unilaterally at Copenhagen, nor put them inside the Kyoto Protocol. A number of other western governments are reluctant, and the US has never been part of the treaty. 'Irresponsible' delay In a bid to build bridges across this apparently impassable divide, Norway and Australia recently proposed that a new legal agreement should be wrapped up by 2015. But in recent days, signals from the Japanese and Russian camps have indicated that they cannot countenance a deal until 2018. Japan is particularly concerned about losing economic competitiveness given that its main economic rivals are not covered by any internationally binding targets. \"The world's number one emitter (China) has no obligations under Kyoto, the number two emitter (US) is not a party and the number three emitter (India) has no obligations,\" Akira Yamada of Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the specialist reporting service Point Carbon News recently. In response, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) issued a statement describing calls to delay the agreement as \"reckless and irresponsible\". \"The world's top climate scientists have told us that global emissions need to peak well before 2020 if we're to hold global warming to below 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels... as everyone agreed last year [at the UN summit in] Cancun\", said Joseph Gilbert, environment minister of AOSIS chair Grenada. \"We therefore cannot continue to delay making the decisions, to 2018 or 2020, as there will not be sufficient time for countries to take action.\" In Copenhagen, governments agreed to review progress on carbon-cutting in 2015, with the implication that commitments would be tightened if the science demanded it. Observers point out that delaying a political agreement would neuter that review process. Finance-sector companies have also warned it could also weaken low-carbon investment. In public, the developing world is as united as ever, with AOSIS shoulder-to-shoulder alongside both the BASIC group and the oil-rich Gulf states. But behind the scenes, there are concerns that some major developing countries are seeking to blame the West for failure to progress partly in order to conceal their own desire to stave off carbon curbs. \"The US, China and India are in cahoots over this,\" said one experienced observer of the UN process. \"And it's about time that China and India were called out.\" Those two governments point out that under the UN convention as it stands, the developed West is obliged to take the lead in reducing emissions and providing finance. But some - particularly among the small island states - argue that if the developing world giants stick to that position rigidly, there is no chance of keeping the global average temperature rise below 2C from pre-industrial times.

His work is hugely influenced by popular culture and has featured music artists David Bowie and Frank Zappa, along with comic book superheroes Superman and Batman. Fans of his art include Madonna and comedian and actor Ricky Gervais. Michael, who was an apprentice of the late Pop artist and acclaimed sculptor Gerald Laing, has been working on a small series of paintings since the start of the lockdown. He said: \"I've felt the conversation is about the spread of the virus and what economic strife may follow. I don't hear a lot about how the virus started.\" The virus is believed to have originated in a market selling wild animals for food in Wuhan, China, late last year. \"I wanted to spend my lockdown time making paintings that made clear we are part of the animal kingdom,\" Michael said. \"This might seem obvious too, but bizarrely I feel this is not how we conduct ourselves.\" \"If we are not careful, viruses and other diseases can leap from one species to another. My hope is that after this terrible time is over we can focus on how we treat nature, and abuse it at our peril.\" In the Western Isles, visual artist Moira Maclean, who describes herself as a \"wallpaper pirate\", has been raiding the attic of her home. \"The lockdown seems a perfect time for a clear out,\" said Lewis-born Moira. She has been sorting through, the trove of old wallpaper she has been amassing in her attic for 20 years or more. She incorporates the paper in her art. Moira's fascination with wallpaper started when she was a girl when she played in abandoned white houses, a type of home built to replace straw, thatched-roof blackhouses in the Hebrides. \"I was collecting bits of wallpaper from a young age, and any envelopes that came to our house,\" she said. Moira, who studied at Aberdeen's Grays School of Art and runs projects at Stornoway's An Lanntair arts venue, has strips of wallpaper from 100 years ago. \"Newspaper was used as lining for the wallpaper and some of the papers date from 1919,\" she said. \"I always think of the wallpaper as being a silent witness to the lives of the generations that lived in a home, and also that these fragile pieces of paper can outlive a heart.\" In Inverness, Falkirk-born Frank To has also been collecting pieces of paper. Before the lockdown, the Inverness College UHI art lecturer would travel between the Highlands and Glasgow, where most arts supplies are and where he would work on refining his drawings and paintings. \"When lockdown was announced, I had very limited supplies in Inverness,\" he said. \"However, it's not something that I'm a stranger to.\" Frank To's training at the University of Huddersfield taught him how to be resourceful in times of limited resources and he learned how to make his own paints and paper. Government letters Recently, he has been making drawings and paintings using gunpower and during the lockdown he has been creating drawings on government letters about Covid-19 he and friends have received in recent weeks. Some of his new work represents the lockdown's effect on nature, with wildlife venturing into urban areas, emboldened due to the reduced human activity. Explaining one of the drawings, the artist said: \"Seal of Disapproval is an art piece done using soot, fire and charcoal on the UK government Covid-19 letter. \"The piece highlights how despite the difficulties of the Covid-19 lockdown on a global scale, nature itself is repairing itself with animals now having room and freedom to move such as the stags bathing in people's back gardens in Paisley.\" So, it seems artists will emerge from the lockdown with exciting new works and ideas for their fans to enjoy.", "output": "How are Scottish artists reacting to the lockdown?", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Kaziranga, a world heritage site, is estimated to be home to 2,400 one-horned rhinos out of a global population of 3,300. The animal is currently listed as \"vulnerable\" by conservation groups. The national park is also home to elephants, water buffalo, the endangered swamp deer and tigers Tremors from an earthquake in Myanmar, also known as Burma, were felt in Assam and other eastern Indian states on Wednesday. But Kitty Tawakley, a spokeswoman for the British High Commission in New Delhi, said Prince William and Catherine were safe, the Associated Press reported. Analysis Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent When Prince Philip was in India with the Queen in 1961 he shot a tiger. He and his wife posed for a picture in front of the spoils of his hunting. Prince William is a different generation royal with a different agenda - to save not shoot Asia's one-horned rhinoceros. The two-tonne creatures - one of the oldest living mammals on the planet - are falling prey to poachers pursuing them for their horns. The prince and his wife have witnessed the work being done at Kaziranga National Park to protect them. They've also been told about the pressures that arise from people living close to wild animals. William, the campaigning conservation prince, hopes he can exploit the intense interest that is focused on his young family and draw the world's attention to the threat of extinction hanging over India's rhinoceros unicornis. Read more from Peter Hunt Conservationist Rita Banerji, who met them at the park, said: \"They had a lot of questions about the wildlife situation in the country. \"This visit by the royal couple will definitely help in grabbing attention of a global audience to the threats that endangered species face.\" William and Catherine visited a village on the edge of the park after the safari to find out how villagers live side-by-side with the wild animals. At the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) at Panbari reserve forest, they fed milk formula to a group of baby animals. Vivek Menon, chief executive officer of the Wildlife Trust of India, which established the CWRC with a number of other bodies, said: \"They were absolutely thrilled and loved being with the animals. \"The duchess loved the baby rhino particularly. The duke said if he could he would have spent the whole day there.\" After touring the centre, they visited the Kaziranga Discovery Park built by the Elephant Family, the charity founded by Mark Shand, the late brother of the Duchess of Cornwall. They saw the first-of-its-kind health clinic for working elephants and an elephant information centre which is under construction. William and Catherine also had the chance to show off their artistic sides by painting an Elephant Parade statue.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the line was hanging free after a first landing attempt had failed. No-one was injured in the accident. At the time of the incident, Airlander's developer, Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV), said the craft had \"experienced a heavy landing and the front of the flight deck sustained some damage\". The crew, however, were \"safe and well\". The AAIB report into the incident stated that ground crew had told Airlander's pilot the mooring line was about 50ft (15m) long, but it was in fact 155ft (47m). The rope became entangled in power lines near the airfield as the pilot attempted a second landing. \"The encounter contributed to a high final approach\", investigators said. The craft was about 180ft (55m) over the landing site and was \"reluctant to descend naturally\". The pilot attempted to manoeuvre the aircraft to a nose-down position to bring its mooring line within reach of the ground crew but it \"suddenly pitched further down to about 18 degrees and started to descend,\" the report stated. \"There was insufficient height in which to affect a full recovery and the aircraft struck the ground.\" Repairs were carried out on the cockpit and earlier this week HAV said these were complete and Airlander was undergoing \"an extensive test phase prior to its next flight\". A new landing system, which will allow it to return to ground from a greater range of angles, and a redesign to allow easier recovery of the mooring line, are among changes that have been made since the crash, the company said.

Female politicians in Italy have often been used either as decoration or as tokens of an equality that doesn't yet exist. But the new coalition between the populist Five Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) shows signs of a quiet shift. Seven women have been appointed ministers, in contrast to the five who were sworn into the previous populist coalition of Five Star and the far-right League Party. The new mood was epitomised by Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova, a former farm worker and trade unionist who left school at 15. She wore an electric blue dress at the new cabinet's inauguration. When journalist and ex-politician Daniele Capezzone tweeted a photo of her with the mocking caption \"Carnival? Halloween?\" he was slapped down by many Italians, indignant at what they saw as sexism and snobbery. \"She was criticised for her electric blue dress,\" says Emiliana De Blasio, professor of Political Science at Luiss University in Rome. \"But this was the first time that I saw the majority of people disagreeing with the analysis, with such superficial analysis against a political woman. So something has changed in the climate, in a month everything has changed in Italy. \"For the first time, some of the more important cabinet positions have been given to women. In the past there have been the same number of women, but not with the same power.\" Using the hashtag #qualcosadiblu (something blue), Ms Bellanova tweeted: \"True elegance is respecting one's own mood: yesterday I felt enthusiastic, electric blue with flounces, and that's how I presented myself.\" The new line-up includes Luciana Lamorgese, 66, who takes over the interior ministry from the League's leader Matteo Salvini, who has been sent into sudden opposition. The respective profiles of Ms Lamorgese and Mr Salvini could hardly be more different. The League leader sometimes posts on social media several times an hour. He devotes huge amounts of time to taking selfies with his supporters. By contrast, Ms Lamorgese does not have any social media accounts, nor is she known to take selfies. \"She's a very competent woman - very balanced,\" says Laura Boldrini, a former president of the chamber of deputies who repeatedly clashed with Matteo Salvini. \"She is somebody who knows how to do the job. She is experienced. She is the opposite of Salvini.\" Female politicians in Italy are routinely judged on their appearance. Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire businessman, surrounded himself with women he considered to be attractive. The Berlusconi era is remembered, among other things, for his so-called \"bunga bunga\" parties, in which aspiring showgirls were said to perform acts of striptease. To his critics, Mr Berlusconi epitomised an age of sexism and objectification. Years later, the women in the new cabinet line-up do not appear to care about getting ahead via their looks. Teresa Bellanova's blue dress symbolises that change. The critics were drowned out on Twitter by many who were relieved to see such a woman finally represented in cabinet. So is this a new Italy? It's a question I put to Laura Boldrini - who faced years of attacks from Matteo Salvini. \"In principle with this new government, there should be another way of speaking,\" she says. \"This is something that we really hope is going to happen. Salvini is less powerful, less visible. In opposition he has less ground in which to continue a hate speech campaign. Maybe this season is over. It was like having drops of poison in the water every day. Let's hope this is over.\" But the final decisions in Italy will continue to be made by men. Women have not yet risen to Italy's highest position. But they're now taking a greater share of power. It may be worth keeping an eye on the progress of Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese, as well as others outside government: Chiara Appendino, the Mayor of Turin; and Federica Mogherini, the EU's outgoing foreign affairs chief. \"When will there be a female prime minister in Italy?\" I asked Laura Boldrini. \"When?

The dispute is separate to a long-running row between Southern and the RMT union over changes to the role of conductors. Aslef said Southern had \"dug its heels in\" over the changes. Southern's drivers who are members of Aslef voted for walkouts by 87%. The union has announced its drivers will strike on 13-14 December, again on 16 December, and between 9-14 January. 'Two to tango' Mick Whelan, Aslef's general secretary, said: \"Our trade dispute with the company is that there should be no introduction and/or extension of new driver-only operated routes on Southern without the agreement of Aslef. \"We have genuinely sought to reach a compromise with Southern. We have always been prepared to talk to the company and we have always been of the view that it should be possible to do a deal, but it takes two to tango and the company has not been prepared to negotiate,\" he said. \"They have dug in their heels and forced us to ballot our members.\" Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC transport correspondent This ups the ante in an already vitriolic dispute. Up until now, Southern had managed to run about 60% of its trains on RMT strike days. Still incredibly annoying for customers but they could normally find a way of getting to work. Now that just under 1,000 Aslef drivers are joining the fray, albeit on different days, it's hard to see how Southern will be able to run any kind of functioning train service when they walk out. They're also stopping overtime, which is often vital to running the trains every day. This dispute has become the defining battle for one of the most contentious issues on our railways, the increasing introduction of what's known as \"driver-only-operation\" or DOO, where the driver, rather than the guard, takes control of closing the doors. The unions say it's a safety risk and an excuse to cut jobs in the long run, all to save money. The rail firms and the government argue that it's about modernising the railways, freeing up on-board staff to deal with customers. They also point out that the safety regulator, the ORR, says it's safe and that DOO is already commonplace on many lines. What happens on Southern is likely to determine what happens on other rail franchises in the future. 'Perfectly safe' Charles Horton, the chief executive of Southern's parent company Govia Thameslink, said: \"Passengers will be rightly furious that these wholly unnecessary and unjustified strikes have been called in the run up to Christmas and in the New Year. \"It's perfectly safe for the driver to have sole responsibility for the operation of a modern train and that's how a third of the trains up and down the country - with the full agreement and support of Aslef - already operate today.\" The RMT has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with Southern over changes to the role of conductors. More stoppages are planned in the coming weeks, in the run-up to Christmas and over the new year. Southern wants drivers, rather than conductors, to operate carriage doors at certain times. London Underground drivers are to stage a 24-hour strike on 6 and 7 December, coinciding with a walkout by Southern rail guards.

He started young - selling paraffin off the back of a lorry, having left school at 15 a serial truant who learned to neither read or write. He then moved on to work as a jewellery dealer in Bristol, a job which some might speculate gave him a taste for precious metals. But it was for his involvement in the 1983 Brink's-Mat robbery at Heathrow Airport which he became infamous and earned him his nickname. More than \u00a325m worth of gold was stolen in what was considered at the time as the biggest robbery to have ever taken place in the UK. Mr Palmer, who was one of seven children, was said to have melted the metal down in the back garden of his mansion at Landsdown near Bath. However, he denied knowing it was stolen and was acquitted in 1987, blowing kisses to the jury from the dock when the verdict was delivered. Worth around \u00a3500m in today's prices, most of the gold has never been recovered and the case remains open. John Palmer: The family man In the decade that followed, he seemingly managed to stay out of trouble, but it was not the case behind the scenes. He was secretly building a massive timeshare scam in Tenerife which propelled him to 105th on the Sunday Times Rich List, a position he shared with the Queen. His criminal activities netted him an estimated fortune of \u00a3300m, which he used to buy a mansion, a French chateau with its own golf course, a jet, two helicopters, a classic car collection and a yacht called the Brave Goose of Essex. But Mr Palmer knew he was playing a risky game, having left about 20,000 victims out of pocket, and he took to wearing body armour underneath his designer suits. Justice eventually caught up with him and he was jailed for eight years in 2001 for the Spanish scam. Mr Palmer represented himself - his defence being he was so rich he did not need to be involved with the fraud. John Palmer: The friend to criminals Roy Ramm, ex-commander of specialist operations at the Metropolitan Police, testified against him during the trial and describes him as \"a strange man\", who was well aware of the number of enemies he had accrued over the years. \"He was quite an arrogant man, which led him to dismissing his barrister,\" he said. Mr Palmer was arrested at his second home in Tenerife in 2007 and charged with fraud, firearm possession and money laundering. His family insists he had turned his life around by the time of his death, but he was about to stand trial and some were said to be concerned about what he would say in court. Another theory is he was a police informant, which would have worried many in the underworld. Officers say his colourful past finally caught up with him in the form of a professional hitman. \"He probably felt he was quite safe out in South Weald while he was at home,\" Mr Ramm said.

Jacqueline Allan, who suffered from diabulimia and set up a charity to help fellow sufferers, said the condition is no different to other eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. \"It was a pathological fear of weight gain and a complete obsession with losing weight,\" she told BBC Radio Wales. \"The only thing which changed was the mechanism by which I lost weight. \"I started the charity because one of the things we do is advocate for people with type 1 diabetes and eating disorders,\" she added.

It was still not known when schools would be able to open again. This year's exam grades are to be primarily based on estimates by teachers. Mr Searson made the comments in an interview in the education publication TES Scotland. He said: \"The SQA is going to have to change the way it delivers exams next year and I am of the view that next year should be the same as this year - the results should be based on teacher judgement. That, to me, is a logical way forward.\" Mr Searson argued that setting the system up that way would also make schools better able to cope if there was a second wave of the virus and another lockdown. He added: \"Within a week or two from starting with a new class the teacher will know who is going to be top and who is going to be bottom in terms of ability. The people who know the pupils best are the teachers and they know who the A-grade students are and who looks like they are on track for a C. \"If we say we are going to have exams that is going to put a lot of pressure on teachers and children and we are going to start the year with this monster we can't deliver. We need to think of ways to reduce the burden on teachers and pupils, otherwise they are going to have a few months to deliver a whole course and that's just not going to be possible.\" Education Secretary John Swinney has said it is still impossible to say when schools might reopen. It is being widely assumed that social distancing measures will still be in force when they do reopen. This could potentially mean pupils will only be back part-time. The cancellation of this year's exam diet was announced in March, a few days before the country went into lockdown. Last week, the qualifications agency, the SQA, gave full details of the system that will be used to determine candidates' grades. There will also be a free appeals system. An SQA spokesman said: \"Following the cancellation of the 2020 exam diet, and at the request of the deputy first minister, the SQA was asked to develop an alternative certification model for 2020. \"Planning for the 2021 examination diet is already under way and will continue.\" The largest teaching union, the EIS, has suggested that S4 students avoid exams next year and instead work over two years to sit exams at the appropriate level in S5. 'Eggs in one basket' This could mean, for instance, that some students might not sit a National 5 in English in S4, so the first qualification they obtained in the subject would be their Higher. A spokesman said: \"The EIS view is that there is an urgent need to future-proof our exams system and to move away from all our eggs in one basket, high stakes assessment such as the current exam diet. \"It is entirely possible that we could face a second wave of Covid next session. Taking all of this into account, there is certainly a strong case for next year's S4 to work towards their awards over two years in part to have sufficient time to cover the course work, but also because it is the exit qualification which is critical for future steps.\" The EIS has been keen to move the qualifications system in this direction since it went through a shake-up seven years ago.

It estimates that GDP, the measure of economic output, grew by 0.5% in the three months to October from a year earlier. But that still leaves it 2.8% below its peak level at the start of 2008. It is already the country's most drawn-out depression since the 1920s, beating the 1930s Great Depression. The UK is however no longer in recession - meaning that its economy is now enjoying positive growth, albeit much weaker than is typical at this stage of an economic recovery. According to data from the Office for National Statistics, Britain suffered a relapse of recession between September 2011 and June this year, but enjoyed 1% positive growth in the subsequent three months. Many years The tepid recovery is due to spending cuts by the government, households and companies, as well as weak exports, according to Niesr economist Simon Kirby. Even once the UK has regained its peak level of output, the economy will still have considerable spare capacity, he told the BBC, meaning that many will still be unable to find appropriate employment. \"The total number in employment has already regained its pre-recession level,\" he said. \"But the population has continued to grow in the meantime, and that means the employment rateis still below peak.\" In addition, many of those in work are under-employed - doing part-time instead of full-time jobs - or accepting employment below the level for which they are qualified. \"It will be a considerable number of years before the output gap is closed,\" he said, putting the date for this return to economic normality beyond 2017. The Niesr forecast predicts growth of 1.1% next year and 1.7% in 2014. Only from 2015 can we look forward to a sustained recovery. But even once the economy has regained its potential level of output, Mr Kirby predicts that its long-run growth rate will be only 2% each year, lower than the long-run average of 2.5%.", "output": "UK 'depression' to last two more years, Niesr says", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The reason for that seems to be there is \"currently no market\" at the moment for the buses outside London and so there will have been little appetite for bus operators to buy them. The ball-park figure for 600 buses will be around \u00a3180m of tax-payers' money with about another \u00a340m on top of that annually for the conductors' wages. Critics say that is too much and the money could have been better spent updating the bus fleet. The Mayor's supporters will no doubt say he has again delivered. Leon Daniels, TfL's managing director of surface transport, said: \"The buses will be purchased by TfL. \"We believe TfL can secure a better unit price by purchasing in larger numbers - rather than a bus operator ordering in smaller numbers on a per route basis.\" The buses will then be leased to the bus operators for a notional fee. This model of operation will offer a number of advantages. 'Madness' Firstly it will reduce route contract costs - because the operator will have to quote for just staffing, fuel and maintenance - and not vehicle costs. Secondly, TfL will be able to move the buses between operators when route contracts change and extend the operational life of the vehicle. \"After the initial purchase outlay we are confident that this ownership model will actually deliver savings of tens of millions of pounds over the life of the buses.\" Of course, crucially, we don't know those savings yet and so we don't know the benefit. London Assembly Green Party member Darren Johnson said: \"The mayor has called the new bus for London a world class piece of technology, but the problem is that no one outside of London is going to buy it. \"If Transport for London go ahead with this madness, then fares will have to rise to pay for the new bus for London and investment will have to be cut in other projects.\" Long term savings? There is no doubt the Mayor has delivered some new projects and he has done it in pretty much the same way. The new bus funding follows the same ethos. It's not free-market. In fact it uses front-loaded public money as 'seed' money and then it is hoped the benefits are accrued over many years through sponsorship or savings. I'm thinking the TubeLines takeover to smooth the Jubilee line upgrade, the cable car and the bike hire scheme. Usually the initial claims are nearly always, it seems, discarded as reality dawns. So claims that no public money would used on the cable car bit the dust as did these plans for bus operators to buy all the new buses. What it also usually means is tax-payers' money is used to attract private money - as was the case for the cable car and bike hire schemes. Or tax-payers' money is used to deliver claims of savings down the line - the case for TubeLines and the new bus. What is clear is that without the public money many of these schemes would struggle to get off the ground. Let me know what you think about the new bus and if it's worth the money.", "output": "The true cost of London's new bus discovered", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

On Tuesday, a new suffragan bishop of Woolwich was named - the first black man to be made a bishop in 20 years. The Church is hiring a minority ethnic vocations officer to attract more black people into the clergy. The Reverend Karowei Dorgu's appointment as Woolwich's bishop follows that of the Most Reverend John Sentamu, now Archbishop of York, who was announced as Bishop of Stepney in 1996. The archbishop is the only bishop from an ethnic minority to lead a Church of England diocese at present. There are now a total of five black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals in the senior ranks of the Church of England - archdeacon or above. Mrs Hudson-Wilkin, who is originally from Jamaica, said the only conclusion she could draw was that the Church has been institutionally racist. 'Visible yet invisible' \"We are visible yet invisible,\" she said. \"I do not believe that the Church recognises that we are there. \"With my hand on my heart, I do not believe that the Church respects and embraces its minority ethnic membership.\" Asked if she was describing the component parts of institutional racism, Mrs Hudson-Wilkin replied: \"I suspect that I am.\" She said: \"It's really a heavy burden to say that because that is the Church that I belong to, that is the Church that I love, but if someone else can genuinely give me another rationale as to why we are not there in senior leadership roles within the Church, then I'm prepared to consider it.\" In November, 29 senior black and Asian Anglicans signed a joint letter to the Church Times in which they said it should be \"a matter of deep shame for the Church that the entirety of its BAME senior leadership could fit in the back of a London cab\". Signatories included barrister Courtenay Griffiths QC and former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission Trevor Phillips. Earlier this year, the Church of England announced that it was hiring a national minority ethnic vocations officer to attract more BAME people into the clergy. Its figures show the proportion of non-white clergy rose slightly from 3.1% in 2012 to 3.4% in 2015. The proportion of BAME senior staff - archdeacons and above - rose from 1.2% in 2012 to 2.2% in 2015. Crown appointments The Bishop of Rochester, the Right Reverend James Langstaff said the figures were \"absolutely clear\" evidence of institutional racism. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I've said that myself in the past, yes. Other people use other language - they talk about unconscious bias.\" Bishop Langstaff said the Church is doing an \"awful lot\" to address diversity, with programmes to develop people's talent and foster people's vocations, as well as working with the groups who make the appointments. He said: \"These are often Crown appointments rather than Church appointments, but the Crown is advised by commissions and committees and we're working really closely to try and do unconscious bias training with these people in order to tackle these really serious issues\". He said the appointment of the new Bishop of Woolwich was to be rejoiced, adding: \"I would hope that we are going to have others following in the next few years.\" 'Thriving' Pentecostals Mrs Hudson-Wilkin said the Church of England could learn a lesson from thriving Pentecostal churches, many of whose pastors are black. \"Not only are there black leadership in the Pentecostal churches, but we see that here are lots of young people in those churches. \"Those young people see reflections of themselves. They are able to say 'I belong'. \"They cannot see those reflections of themselves within the Church of England.\"", "output": "Senior Church of England clergy 'not diverse enough'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

'No middle ground' While some theatres have started streaming online, he told the PA news agency it was \"a collective artform\". He explained: \"You need people around you to see it and do it and there is no middle ground now. \"If it's going to survive in any form it will need an aggressive government bailout and you either do or you don't do it. There is either theatre or there isn't any more. \"So there is kind of a clarity to what we need to ask government to do for it to survive and hopefully they will do it.\" Graham's stage credits also include This House, Ink and Labour of Love, and he penned the TV dramas Brexit: The Uncivil War and Coalition. \"I am already exhausted about the scale of the fight ahead because every industry, every small business, are all in the same situation and it's obviously very upsetting,\" he said. \"But because the theatres were the first to close... probably, because of the very nature of what they are, gathering people together in close proximity, they will be close to being the last buildings to reopen.\" Sir Andrew Lloyd-Webber recently said he does not expect theatres to reopen until the end of September. Graham continued: \"I am worried that to have the political argument to justify that level of arts investment again at a time when the economy will be devastated, that's difficult. \"I'm worried for what kind of work, what kind of artists, what kind of people, in a more dangerous climate, will be allowed to make the work. \"I think the default naturally goes to safety, rather than invention.

On Thursday, Ivor Bell, from Ramoan Gardens in west Belfast, was cleared of soliciting the widow's murder. The court also heard allegations that former Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams had recommended her murder and disappearance. However, Mr Adams, who was called as a defence witness at Belfast Crown Court, strenuously denied involvement. Tapes 'unreliable' The case against the 82-year-old Mr Bell was based on alleged admissions made to a Boston College oral history project, which were played in public for the first time during the legal action. Reporting restrictions were placed on the court case, but they were lifted on Thursday. During the hearing, the jury was played taped recordings of an interview with a man - alleged to be Bell - who said Gerry Adams was the IRA's \"officer commanding\" in Belfast and had been involved in the decision to kill and secretly bury Mrs McConville. The judge later ruled the tapes were unreliable and could not be used as evidence against Mr Bell. Addressing the jury, Mr Justice O'Hara said: \"There is now no evidence which the prosecution can put before you in order to support the case. \"My role now is to direct you to return a verdict of not guilty, because you simply cannot find him to have done the acts alleged.\" 'Some truth' Five of Mrs McConville's children were in court and in a statement issued afterwards, Mrs McConville's son, Michael, said the family was \"bitterly disappointed\" the Boston tapes could not be used as evidence and demanded a full public inquiry. He said: \"Throughout this, we have got many doors closed on us and we have walked many a road. \"This is the closest that we are going to get to justice.\" Susan Townsley, who was aged six when her mother was abducted, choked back tears as she said: \"This is the only thing we are going to get at the end of the day. \"As a family we are just going to have to stick together. It has been very hard on all of us.\" Mr Bell's solicitor, Peter Corrigan, said his client had been vindicated and that the Boston tapes were \"inherently unreliable\". 'Complex legal issues' The Public Prosecution Service defended the decision to take the case. Deputy Director Michael Agnew said: \"This case presented the PPS with a number of novel and complex legal and evidential issues. Whilst we respect the ruling of the judge, we remain satisfied the proceedings were properly brought.\" Detective Chief Superintendent Bobby Singleton of PSNI's Legacy Investigation Branch said: \"First and foremost our thoughts are with Jean's family on what will have been a day of mixed emotions. \"We will take some time to consider judgement and its implications on similar cases. It was always our firm belief that we had assembled a strong case and that it was in the public interest for the details to be heard.\" Secret burial Mr Adams has always denied being in the IRA and, in his evidence, he said he had no part to play in Mrs McConville's abduction, murder or secret burial. Appearing in court on Monday, the former west Belfast MP told the jury: \"I categorically deny any involvement in the abduction, killing and burial of Jean McConville, or indeed any others.\" Mr Adams, who spent over an hour giving evidence, said he believed Mrs McConville should \"not have been shot\", but should have been shown \"compassion\". Mrs McConville, who was wrongly accused of being an Army informer, was dragged from her west Belfast home in front of her children in December 1972. She was shot and secretly buried by the IRA, becoming one of the Disappeared victims of the Troubles. Her body was recovered from Shelling Hill Beach in County Louth in 2003. Disappearance 'recommended' Ivor Bell's defence team argued it could not be proven that he was the man on the tapes, known as 'Interviewee Z' and that he had been living in County Louth at the time of the murder. In a ruling on Wednesday, the judge said there was \"overwhelming\" evidence it was Mr Bell speaking on the recording. The so-called Boston tapes collated accounts from former IRA and UVF paramilitaries about their activities during the Troubles on the understanding these would not be made public until after their deaths. In 2014, the PSNI won a trans-Atlantic court battle and seized some of the tapes. Ivor Bell was subsequently charged with two counts of soliciting murder. He was deemed unfit to stand trial in 2018 and a legal process known as a 'trial of the facts' was launched to establish the truth of the allegations. He was excused from attending the court hearings on health grounds. On the tapes, Z was asked if there was \"a possibility\" that allegations Mr Adams had given the order for Mrs McConville's killing and disappearance were wrong. 'Policy of disappearing informants' Interviewee Z replied: \"The only thing I have to say is this - Gerry would have just passed the information back to GHQ [IRA's general headquarters] that one, she was a tout, two, she was taking money, three, she had to be executed. Right? \"Whether he knew she had 10 kids or not, I don't know.\" Interviewee Z was also asked about a \"policy\" of disappearing informants. He claimed it would have ultimately been a decision for the IRA's general headquarters, but that the \"Belfast brigade\" would have \"advocated\" it. Interviewee Z claimed Mr Adams was the IRA's commanding officer (OC) in Belfast at the time. 'We should shoot touts' He said: \"He was the OC of Belfast. I was operations officer. Pat [McClure] was the IO [intelligence officer]. Pat handled it and directly tied in with Gerry. \"The first I knew about that woman was [when] I was told she was being shot as a tout and the reason for it was she was an informer. \"They told me about radios, signals and pulling the curtains up and down. \"I said: 'I don't know anything about anything, other than we did not have jails so we should shoot touts.' \"The people who came to me was Pat and Gerry.\" The interviewer also asked about Mr Adams' attitude towards \"burying\" Mrs McConville. Interviewee Z said: \"Just that she was a tout and she should be shot. \"I wouldn't say he would have liked it very much.\" Z further described his own attitude towards informants. \"At the end of the day, she's an informer,\" he said. \"Worse than that, she's an informer for money. \"Whatever is decided, I will back that up. I said: 'I don't have a problem with shooting touts.' \"But they said: 'We are going to bury her.' \"I said I didn't agree with that... If that's done, it's done without my agreement. It defeats the entire purpose.\" 'Second thoughts' He later added: \"I said: 'If she's a tout, the fact that she's a woman shouldn't save her.' \"I wasn't told she had 10 kids and no husband. \"I can't say for sure that I would have said: 'No, don't shoot her.' \"But I may have had second thoughts.\" St Peter's priest Meanwhile, it was also alleged Mr Adams had asked a priest to get Jean McConville out of Belfast. According to Interviewee Z: \"Gerry said that they asked a priest to get her out of town and the priest for St Peter's refused.\" When asked about his motivation for taking part in the oral history project, Z provided two reasons - historical accuracy and annoyance at discovering he was being blamed for the controversial killing. The court heard claims high-profile republican Bobby Storey, referred to as a \"clown\" called at Z's house to make enquiries because Sinn F\u00e9in were coming under political pressure over the Disappeared. Z said: \"What annoyed me, he sent an idiot to my house to ask about the woman in the flats. \"I told him... my knowledge of that would be second-hand, why don't you ask Gerry? \"The annoying thing is, he actually believed Gerry.\" Most of the Boston College interviews with republicans were carried out by former IRA prisoner Anthony McIntyre, an outspoken critic of Sinn F\u00e9in. The judge ruled Dr McIntyre had asked leading questions, which tainted the evidential value of the tapes. Mr Justice O'Hara also ruled the false promise that testimony would remain confidential until the contributor's death could have liberated Mr Bell to speak the truth, but could also have given him the freedom to lie, distort, blame or mislead. There was clear bias that both Mr McIntyre and Mr Bell had an agenda and were \"out to get\" Mr Adams and others, the judge said. Earlier in the case, Professor Kevin O'Neill, a director of Irish Studies at Boston College, said the project was now held up as a model of how not to conduct oral history. But Ed Moloney, the journalist behind the Boston College project, said he welcomed Mr Bell's acquittal and called on the authorities to drop all other cases related to the tapes. He added those who criticised the project overlooked the fact that because of it the McConville family knows more about her disappearance than before.
