We don't live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happened within 20 miles from our home, so we moved. \n\nI won't be able to send you the address because the last family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so that they wouldn't have to change their address. This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well though: last week I put a load in and pulled the chain and haven't seen them since. The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days. About that coat you wanted me to send you, your uncle Stanley said it would be too heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. \n\nJohn locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out. Your sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what _ is yet. The baby looks just like your brother. \n\nUncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days. \n\nThree of your friends went off a bridge in a pick-up trunk. Ralph was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. You other two friends were in back. They drowned because they couldn't get the tail gate down. \n\nThere isn't much more news at this time. Nothing much has happened. \n\nLove, \n\nMom \n\nP.S. I was going to send you some money but the envelope was already sealed.', question: 'Who is writing the letter?", "output": "within 20 miles from home", "category": "Wrong Candidate Generation 1536.json"}, {"instruction": "This task is about reading the given passage and the question, return an incorrect answer to the given question.", "input": "story: When he was a teenager, Hunter Adam was very unhappy and he spent many years in a special hospital for people with mental health problems.

For example, he didn't like the doctor's white coats, so he wore shirts with flowers on them when he visited his patients and he tried to make them laugh. The doctors at the medical school didn't like Adams because he was too different. But Adams believed that people in hospital need more than medicine. He saw unhappy and lonely people, and he tried to help them as patients, but as people too. He spent a lot of time with children in the hospital and often dressed up like a clown to make the children laugh When he finished medical school and become a doctor, Adams opened his own hospital, called \"the Gusundheit Institute\",together with some other doctors.
