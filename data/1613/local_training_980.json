After tightening just a little they dragged on the ground. Then it seemed to me there wasn\u2019t enough arch support in them, I happen to have high arches and these were virtually flat. Also the heel was tight and the sandal pad itself was really hard!!! My feet hurt so bad after wearing these just twice for very short bouts. Absolutely disappointed & returning.** My friend had the same brand/size everything & hers were WAY different so idk what\u2019s going on here. ** I think I\u2019m just going to go into my REI to buy a sandal so I can try it on first, even the chacos. Another commenter said you have to break these in like a shoe? I don\u2019t think so.

Also able to go up to 2 weeks without recharging the batteries. The top of my unit got wet because of rain. The horn button seems fairly water-tight, but the top of the main unit's housing is another story. After 14 hours of drying-out there is still condensation inside the clear plastic covering of the solar panel. Also, horn electronics have shorted -- horn goes off randomly when plugged in or just produces an anemic chirp. There is also water leaking from the horn jack receptacle which entered through the solar panel cover. Leaving the unit in the sun all day doesn't recharge batteries, so I'm thinking the solar feature is more of a gimmick than anything useful. As a guesstimate, using the light with full-beam about 1 to 1.5 hours a week (with very liberal use of the horn whenever riding) requires the unit to be charged once every 2 weeks. A red light flashes when batteries are running low. Charging takes about 6 - 8 hours. As another nitpick, it's really annoying to cycle through 4 light modes just to turn the unit off. Depending on your riding style, the horn button clasp may be prone to slip when you press it. The horn clasp is a rubber band-like and not a bolt. Since most horn-light combos are like this, I wouldn't deduct points for this. Just something to be aware of. Overall it's a good light, but it's not rainproof or waterproof. And the solar panel feature is possibly a sales gimmick.

Answer with \"True\" if the sentence belongs to that section, otherwise answer with \"False\"", "input": "Review: I previously reviewed the first book in the series, Witching on a Star. That wasn\u2019t a success by any means \u2013 I rated it 2,5 stars, and while I had high hopes for a reverse harem set in a witching academy, my hopes fell flat and the book was a bit of a dissapointment. Still, I picked up book two, As You Witch, because I wanted to see if it would get any better. The series has a lot of potential, it just never executes it well, so I thought that maybe some of those kinks would\u2019ve gotten fixed in book two. Alas, no such luck, and I even liked this one less than the first one. This book was filled with unnecessary drama from the start until the end. With a million possible options to pick villains when your book is set in a witching world, the author keeps on using the mean girl as a villain. It\u2019s dull and predictable. The dialogue is so bad that I had to roll my eyes at every other sentence. Max is immature, childish, entitled, and the guys she\u2019s supposedly in love with are so bland and boring even I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep them apart. There is no conflict. There\u2019s nothing really at stake. The relationships are too perfect \u2013 these four guys are instantly OK with all of them being with the heroine, and none of them is trying to win her for themselves. Of the four guys, only two have a hint of a personality, and the other two are basically just thrown in so this would be a reverse harem and not a love triangle. Either give them more personality or focus on the two that do have developed personalities and that a reader can root for. Look, I know I\u2019m one of the few who isn\u2019t fond of this series, and it has really high overall ratings on Goodreads and Amazon. So, don\u2019t take my word for it, this is after all just my opinion. But as far as reverse harems go, I\u2019ve seen a lot better than this one. \n Rating: 2", "output": "True", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 429.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and rating for the product on a scale of 1-5 based on the review.

Answer with \"True\" if the sentence belongs to that section, otherwise answer with \"False\"", "input": "Review: I bought this less than a year ago, and I've been having consistent problems. So I will preface that this computer was barely USED by me until 3 months ago, and I've had nothing but problems since. There was no physical damage as far as I could tell however I've been having problems since I've decided to use it regularly: The wifi is very unstable and sometimes nonexistent, since I had to move from my laptop to using this desktop, I've been attempting to play games with my friends, only to disconnect every 30 minutes. Now I originally thought the issue was my internet provider, but none of my other devices were having issues. I decided to investigate my router, no issues at all. I move to the pc and I noticed that the usb dongle they include that either assists (or allows not even certain at this point anymore) the wifi connectivity was no longer operating. I removed it, and plugged it into my old laptop, it functioned, I attempted to use it on a different port, nothing. I decided to swap the usb with one that I knew was working, and it didn't work, AND afterwards that port ceased to function until next restart. THIS WAS ONLY WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF ACTUAL USAGE. (Computer was left untouched for most of a year and picked up for primary usage in May). I've been having this problem quite consistently with the ports, and I recently attempted to contact skytech support, of which all of their lines were busy and they had me leave my name and phone number and they'd get back to me as soon as possible. I called at 11 am PST (of which they are open until 5pm PST) and I didn't receive a call since. Now while this problem is quite recent, I would like to point out that this PC is not HTC VIVE compatible due to the fact that there is a significant lack of ports that actually function, some of the ports are not connected to the card which means they will NOT function whatsoever, so if you are using this computer for VR, your only option really is to get a RIFT S for it. \n Rating: 2", "output": "True", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 429.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and rating for the product on a scale of 1-5 based on the review.

Answer with \"True\" if the sentence belongs to that section, otherwise answer with \"False\"", "input": "Review: I still can't believe I dropped this much money on a duvet cover, it was more than the new down comforter we also bought! But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the \"dust\" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty.

Some of the recipes can be modified to fit the point values if one uses reduced-fat or fat-free products, but the recipe for 1 pound of bacon used in the \"Delicious Chicken BBQ Ranch\" recipe definitely does not meet the WW Freestyle program. I gave the book 1 star because of the misleading advertising. However, if one is not following WW, then perhaps the recipes would be of interest. I also gave the product 1 star because it's a self-published book that needs some editorial assistance. \n Rating: 1", "output": "True", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 429.json"}]
