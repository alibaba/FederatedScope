The game is not going well for the home team as the Gorillas, a group of oversized roughnecks, are not only dominating the Tea Totallers, made up of old men, but intimidating the umpire by knocking him into the ground like a tent peg after an unpopular judgment. The Gorillas home runs go screaming, literally, out of the ballpark and the batters form a conga line, each hitter whacking a ball out. Bugs Bunny, watching from his hole in the outfield, is fed up with the unfair game and the GasHouse Gorillas playing dirty. He talks trash against the Gorillas, claiming that he could win the game singlehanded with an endless barrage of home runs. He loses a bit of his bravado when he suddenly gets surrounded by the Gorillas. They force him to take up his own challenge and, as a result, Bugs now has to play all the positions on the opposing team, including speeding from the mound to behind the plate to catch his own pitches. Bugs throws his fastball so hard that it zips by the Gorillas batter but, as he catches it, he is propelled off screen, crashing into the backstop. In the course of his dual role, he shouts encouraging words to the pitcher before going back to the mound to make the next pitch, then returning to home plate to catch it. Next, Bugs decides to perplex em with his slowball, throwing a pitch so slow that three Gorillas in a row strike out attempting to hit it. For his first time up, Bugs selects a bat from the batboy, a literal hybrid of a bat and a boy. As promised, Bugs starts smacking the ball. On the first pitch, he makes a long hit, dashing around the bases while also showing off for the crowd, only to find a grinning Gorilla holding the ball just ahead of the plate. To allow himself to score his first run, Bugs pulls out a pinup poster, which distracts the Gorilla player. The scoreboard now shows the Gorillas as the home team, with 96 runs, and Bugs batting in the top of the fifth with one run so far. Bugs hits another one deep, and while rounding the bases, a Gorilla ambushes the plate umpire and puts on his uniform. Bugs slides into home, obviously safe, but the fake umpire calls him out. Bugs gets in his face, actually behind the umpire mask, and argues the call, pulling his timehonored wordswitching gag until the umpire ends up demanding that Bugs accept the safe call or go to the showers. Bugs gives in, and the fauxumpire gets wise too late as the board flashes another run. Bugs hammers the next pitch on a line drive that bounces off each Gorilla with a ping sound as in a pinball game. The scoreboard then blinks a random series of numbers and the word Tilted. The story jumps ahead to the final inning, announced by a radiostyle jingle, with Bugs leading 96\u201395, the Gorillas having lost a run somewhere along the way. Blancs voice is now heard as the announcer as the radio booth has lost its original playbyplay man. With two outs in the last of the ninth, a Gorilla is on base and another, menacingly swinging a bat he has just fashioned from a huge tree, is ready for the pitch. Bugs proceeds with a tremendous windup, lets the pitch go, and the ball is rocketed out of the stadium. Startled, Bugs desperately gives chase. He grabs a cab and is almost led astray until he realizes a Gorilla is driving it; he jumps out and catches a bus which takes him to the Umpire State Building. He takes an elevator to the roof, climbs a flagpole, throws his glove in the air and manages to catch the ball. An umpire appears over the edge of the roof, calling out the Gorilla player who has followed Bugs there. The Statue of Liberty agrees with the call.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Georges is a Romanianborn gigolo who has arrived in a Mexican border town seeking entry to the US. He has to endure a waiting period of up to eight years in order to obtain a quota number, living with other hopeful immigrants in the Esperanza Hotel. After six months he is broke and unhappy. When he runs into his former dancing partner Anita Dixon Goddard she explains how she quickly obtained US citizenship by marrying an American, who she then, just as quickly, divorced. Georges resolves on the same plan. He soon targets visiting school teacher Miss Emmy Brown de Havilland, who is in Mexico on a day trip with her class of about fifteen young boys. Georges manages to extend the time necessary to repair her broken down automobile. Emmy and her pupils sleep in the lobby of the fullup Esperanza Hotel. This provides Georges the opportunity to quickly and intensively woo Emmy in the early morning hours; she awakens to him sitting nearby and gazing at her lovingly. By claiming she is the exact image of the lost love of his life, his seemingly intense ardor toward a stranger is plausible, and they marry later that same day. However, George must wait some weeks before entering the US, and Emmy returns home with the boys. A few days later, Emmy unexpectedly returns, complicating Georges plans. Immigration inspector Hammock Abel also appears, hunting for con artists such as Georges, and necessitating Georges and an unwitting Emmys departure. He drives all night, arriving at dawn in a small village. They participate in a festival of traditional blessings for newlyweds, an event that Emmy assumes has been Georges destination all along. Georges had not planned on consummating marriage, believing that he could return her to her small town essentially unchanged by the marriage, and fakes a shoulder injury. However, as the trip continues, he is surprised and increasingly enchanted by Emmy. When they stop at the seaside, Emmy bathes in the cool green water and Georges is unable to resist making love to her. However this jeopardizes Anitas plan for she and Georges to meet in New York and work together, to which he had agreed. Anita has long been in love with Georges, and on their return, brutally informs Emmy of the entire scheme reciting the inscription on Emmys wedding ring, which Georges said was his mothers. Hammock then asks Emmy to verify the legitimacy of her marriage; she does not turn him in, partially blaming her own naivete, but nevertheless leaves him. Returning to the US, she drives distractedly, in anguish at Georges betrayal. When a black lace veil Georges had bought her is blown into her face, she is seriously injured in a car accident. When Georges learns of this, he immediately crosses the border, jeopardizing his visa to go to her. On hearing his voice she awakens; seeing him, her misery relieved and her breathing and heartbeat normalize as he sits with her for hours. However, Hammock is still on his tail, and when Georges sees police arriving, he takes off. He heads to Paramount to try to sell his story to director Dwight Saxon Mitchell Leisen, in order to get the money for Emmys care. Hammock catches up with him and returns him to Mexico. Some weeks later Hammock returns to the border town. Anita has a new sugar daddy. Georges has unsurprisingly not heard from Emmy, and believes the worst, sitting dejectedly on a bench writing notes in the sand. Hammock joins him, and tells Georges that he didnt report the illegal entry \u2013 Georges visa has been approved.

Frankie goes to DeCarlo, who gets Waxman to allow the group to pay the debt, which turns out to be considerably larger. Tommy must go to work for the mobs associates in Las Vegas until it is paid. Nick, irritated by Tommys irresponsibility, not being involved in the groups decisions, and never being able to see his family, also leaves the group. Forced to tour constantly to pay the debt, the band hires a set of studio musicians, and becomes Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, with Gaudio now acting solely as songwriter and producer. Valli learns from his now exwife, Mary, that his daughter, Francine, now a drug addict, has escaped from home. Valli meets his estranged daughter and regrets not acting as a better father for her when she was growing up. He also arranges for Gaudio to offer her singing lessons and for Crewe to cut a demo for her. A few years later, the group has finally paid off Tommys debt. However, this coincides with the news of Francines death by drug overdose. Frankie and Mary both grieve for their daughter. Gaudio composes a new number for Valli to sing, his first as a solo artist. At first, Frankie is hesitant, as he is still in mourning, but eventually agrees. The track, Cant Take My Eyes Off You, becomes a commercial success. In 1990, the Four Seasons are about to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band performs Rag Doll onstage, their first performance together in over twenty years. The music fades as the four men take turns addressing the audience. Tommy, in an ironic twist, now works for Joe Pesci, who has went on to become an Oscarwinning actor. Nick claims to have no regrets about leaving the group, enjoying the time he spends with his family. Bob has retired to Nashville, Tennessee. Lastly, Frankie states that the best time he had during his time with the Four Seasons was before their success, when everything was still ahead of us and it was just four guys singing under a street lamp.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

The human population has plummeted and the need for blood becomes desperate. Vampires deprived of blood for long durations degenerate into subsiders, psychotic batlike creatures with no memories of who they were and whose only thought is the craving for blood. The few remaining humans are captured and harvested in laboratory farms while scientists research a synthetic blood substitute. Edward Dalton Ethan Hawke is the head hematologist for the largest supplier of human blood in the US, owned by Charles Bromley Sam Neill. Edward and colleague Christopher Caruso Vince Colosimo are developing a blood substitute. Driving home from a failed experiment, Dalton accidentally runs another vehicle off the road. Checking on the occupants of the other vehicle, he learns they are humans. With the police approaching, Dalton has them hide in his vehicle. They part ways, but not before their leader, Audrey Claudia Karvan, learns Edwards name and occupation from the ID badge on his jacket. At home, Edward is surprised by his estranged brother Frankie Michael Dorman. Frankies gift of a bottle of pure human blood reignites a longstanding argument over Edwards sympathies towards humans. The argument is cut short when a subsider invades Edwards house, forcing the brothers to kill it. The next morning, Audrey visits Edwards home and hands him a note with instructions for a meeting. During the meeting, Edward is introduced to Lionel Elvis Cormac Willem Dafoe, a human who was once a vampire. Before he can say how he reverted to human, a military team arrives with Frankie, who had followed Edward and intends to capture both Cormac and Audrey. Audrey manages to knock Frankie unconscious and the three flee. Once they escape, Cormac explains that he was cured of vampirism when he was ejected from his sunproof vehicle by a crash. Exposed to the sun, Elvis burst into flames, but his life was saved when he landed in a river, having been exposed to the sun for a precise length of time to turn him human again. Edward agrees to help Cormac find a way to recreate the cure. That night Edward meets more human survivors, as well as Senator Turner Jay Lagaaia, a vampire who is secretly helping the colony develop a cure. A convoy of humans heading to Audreys group is ambushed and captured. The soldiers track the position of the vineyard, forcing Turner and the humans to flee. Audrey, Cormac and Edward stay behind so Edward can be cured. Edward is able to recreate the cure Elvis had explained, curing himself of vampirism. They attempt to regroup with Turner and the other humans, only to find they are all dead. One of the captured convoy, Alison Isabel Lucas, is revealed to be Charles human daughter. Charles has Frankie forcibly turn her into a vampire. She refuses to drink human blood, and turns into a subsider. She is rounded up with others and dragged into sunlight to burn to death. Witnessing Alisons death upsets Frankie, causing him to seek out his brother. Meanwhile the military imposes martial law to control the subsider population and preserve order. Edward, Cormac and Audrey break into Christophers home and ask him to help spread the cure. However, Christopher has finally discovered a viable blood substitute and is not interested in a cure. He summons soldiers who capture Audrey while Cormac and Edward escape. They are found by Frankie, who agrees to help. He attacks Cormac, but drinking his blood turns Frankie human again; revealing that the risky sunlight cure is unnecessary. Edward, trying to save Audrey, turns himself in to Charles, who gloats about his new monopoly of the blood substitute. Edward taunts Charles into biting him, making him human again like Frankie. Edward leaves Charles at the mercy of soldiers who are on the brink of becoming subsiders. Frankie arrives and, surrounded by soldiers, draws their attention to himself to allow Edward and Audrey to escape; a feeding frenzy results, as the hungry soldiers consume first Frankies blood and then that of the soldiers cured by it, until at last only three soldiers are left standing, cured and bewildered. Christopher, to cover up the cure, shoots the three and is about to shoot Edward and Audrey when Cormac kills him with a crossbow. The three survivors drive off into the sunrise. In a voiceover, Edward addresses the general population, announcing the cure.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

He still makes liquor, according to his granddaddys granddaddys recipe, in stills named Molly and Beulah. Every drop is aged two years, and bottled in glass never plastic. The Haggs have been making their recipe since before the Revolutionary War, and Jesse only sells to a friend in nearby Florence to ensure that his liquor is never blended with any other.

Tuckers exwife, psychiatrist Carol Bennell, begins to feel something is amiss when people seem to have changed. Her patient Wendy Lenk describes how her husband is not her husband, and one of her sons friends acts detached and emotionless. At a neighborhood Halloween party, Carols son Oliver finds a skin on a partier which is initially believed to be costume makeup. Carol speculates that the skin may be an organism connected to reports of a fastspreading flu. Carol takes the organism to her doctor friend Ben Driscoll to have it checked. Carol attends a friendly dinner meeting between Russian diplomat Yorish and Czechoslovakian diplomat Belicec along with female companion Luddie and discusses her postmodern feminism views over caviar and champagne. Meanwhile, Tucker uses the CDC to spread the disease further, disguising the spores as flu vaccine. Ben and Dr. Stephen Galeano, a biologist, discover how the spore takes over the brain during REM sleep. During this investigation, Luddie calls Ben, worried about Yorishs behavior. Driscoll and Galeano also find that people who had brainaffecting illnesses, such as encephalitis or ADEM, are immune to the spore because their previous illnesses prevents the spore from latching on to the brain matter. Carols son, Oliver, is immune to the spore because of the ADEM he had as a young child. Carol decides to get her son, who might show a way to a cure, back from Tucker. Before she drives to Tuckers house, she joins Bens team who is called to the house of the Belicecs, the Czech ambassador and his wife, in a case of emergency.

Galaneo and one of his assistants head to a base outside Baltimore where they and other scientists attempt to find a cure for the alien virus. Carol and Ben separate to find Oliver, who texts his location, the apartment of Tuckers mother, to Carol. Finally, Ben arrives, but Carol realizes that he too has become one of the infected. He successfully seduces her to give in to the new society, but also frankly states that there is no room for people like Oliver who are immune. Carol shoots Ben in the leg and flees with Oliver.

Blake quickly realizes that Castle is primarily using the case as a propaganda and fundraising tool for a Communist group. Insulted at being used, Blake returns to San Juno to see the trial through to the end and represent Angels interests. Blakes trial strategy is to rebut the prosecutions case sufficiently that he does not need to present a defense. But at the last moment Castle returns and, using his influence on Angels mother, threatens Castle with removal unless Angel testifies. Blake realizes that Castle wants the teen subjected to a harsh crossexamination that will ensure his conviction and execution: then he will be a martyr and Castle will be able to better utilize the case as a fundraising tool for the Communist Party. Blake remains on the case, but the crossexamination goes as poorly as feared. Chavez is found guilty, and as the jury did not suggest leniency, the death penalty will be automatic. Castle then does have Blake fired to keep him from speaking during sentencing, but he arrives anyway and requests and receives amicus status. Blake now says that since the charge of murder was based on a technicality, it is appropriate for the judge to apply another technicality, Chavezs status as a minor, in sentencing. Instead of being hanged, the boy can simply be sent to reform school. When the prosecutor agrees that this would be fair, the AfricanAmerican judge Juano Hernandez accepts the suggestion.

The pair find it difficult to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies exert influence over the public, and are linked to a branch of the Ku Klux Klan. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in a discreet conversation that the three missing men have been murdered. Their bodies are later found buried in an earthen dam. Stuckey deduces Mrs. Pells confession to the FBI and informs Pell, who brutally beats his wife in retribution. Anderson and Ward devise a plan to indict members of the Klan for the murders. They arrange a kidnapping of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack. There, he is left with a black man, who threatens to castrate him unless he speaks out. The abductor is an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman, who gives him a full description of the killings, including the names of those involved. Although his statement is not admissible in court due to coercion, Tilmans information proves valuable to the investigators.

Cowens, believing that his fellow Klansmen have threatened his life because of his admissions to the FBI, incriminates his accomplices. The Klansmen are all charged with civil rights violations, as this can be prosecuted at the federal level. Most of the perpetrators are found guilty, and receive sentences from three to ten years in prison. Stuckey, however, is acquitted of all charges, and Tilman, on the other hand, is later found dead by the FBI in an apparent suicide.

Henry Frapp Keith is Tylers good friend and fellow trapper. Together, they trap beaver, fight Native Americans, and drink at a mountain man rendezvous while trying to sell their plews, or beaver skins, to a cutthroat French trader named Fontenelle. Tyler looks for a legendary valley, in Blackfoot territory, so full of beaver that they just jump in the traps. Running Moon leaves her abusive husband, a ruthless Blackfoot warrior named Heavy Eagle, and comes across the two trappers in the dying days of the fur trapping era. While at first Bill only wants to take her to safety at the rendezvous, she eventually becomes his woman. While trapping Bill and Henry are attacked by Blackfeet and Henry is scalped by Heavy Eagle in front of Bill. Bill runs back to camp and he and Running Moon flee only to be caught. Later, Bill thinking Running Moon has also been killed is given a chance to run similar to the real life event of John Colter and is chased by warriors whom he initially eludes by hiding in a beaver den. They pursue him until he and Heavy Eagle fall into a raging river. Heavy Eagle makes it to shore and Bill goes over a waterfall. Heavy Eagle tries to make Running Moon his woman again which he cannot do. He knows Bill Tyler survived and will come for her as he had done. On his survival trek Bill comes across Henry who had survived the scalping and eventually learns that Running Moon is still alive. He and Henry set out to rescue her while they are followed by a pair of trappers Cassell and Lucking also looking for the valley of beavers. The story takes place during 1838, although its never stated in the film, based on the fact that the beaver market was declining and the rendezvous was held on the Popoagie River. The Era of the Mountain Man ended two years later. The story was written by Hestons son. The film was Langs directorial debut. This was Victor Jorys last film. John Glovers character Nathan Wyeth was clearly inspired by the historical Nataniel Wyeth, a New England ice merchant who pioneered the marketing of Northwest salmon. Keiths character Henry Frapp could have been inspired by Henry Fraeb, a nineteenth century trapper and fur trader.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.
