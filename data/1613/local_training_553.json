Scientists say that toys can harbor cold germs for weeks or even months. Prior research has already concluded that two common bacteria that cause colds, ear infections, and strep throat don't often live for long outside the human body, but a new study finds that they can linger a lot longer than previously thought. Exposure to any bacteria does not necessarily imply that you wil get a disease from it. There are not specific bacteria that only cause pneumonia, so exposure to someone with pneumonia, does not mean the exposed person will get pneumonia.

Anyone at any age can get walking pneumonia. Walking pneumonia from mycoplasma is most common, though, in older children and adults younger than 40. People who live and work in crowded places, such as schools, homeless shelters, and prisons have a higher risk of contracting the disease. That's because walking pneumonia is contagious. It's spread when someone comes in contact with droplets from the nose and throat of someone who has it. That commonly happens when the person with walking pneumonia sneezes or coughs. Cases of walking pneumonia are most common in the late summer and fall. But infections can occur with no particular pattern throughout the year. Researchers also think it takes prolonged close contact with an infected person for someone else to develop walking pneumonia; still, there are widespread outbreaks every four to eight years. When those outbreaks occur, walking pneumonia can account for as many as one out of every two cases of pneumonia. What are the symptoms of walking pneumonia? Symptoms generally appear 15 to 25 days after exposure to the mycoplasma and develop slowly over a period of two to four days. Almost all children are infected at least once by age two. they were extremely premature or if they have heart or lung problems. monthly injection of an antibody to RSV at the beginning of and continuing throughout the RSV season. addition, they should avoid exposure to tobacco smoke.

The recommendations hadn't been updated in the last decade, which had recommended diagnosis and treatment for kids ages 6 to 12, Reuters reported. Caring for a child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can be challenging for the whole family. Parents may be hurt by their child's behavior as well as by the way other people respond to it. The stress of dealing with ADHD can lead to marital conflict. These problems may be compounded by the financial burden that ADHD can place on families. With hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, the child may: 1  often fidget or seem constantly on the go. 2  run around when it is not appropriate. 3  become easily frustrated when asked to take turns. 4  interrupt others. 5  make a lot of noise. The leading pediatricians' group also said that ADHD medications, including Ritalin and Vyvanse, can be used to treat 4- and 5-year-olds whose ADHD symptoms are moderate to severe, NPR reported. Those drugs aren't FDA-approved to treat people younger than age 6, but doctors are still allowed to prescribe drugs without an FDA recommendation. Once your child has been diagnosed with ADHD, treatment can begin. You, your child's doctor or psychologist, and the school will need to work together on a treatment plan. This plan may include medication, family counselling, and an education plan. For more information, please see the Treatment section of this site. Every child may sometimes have one or two of these symptoms. For a diagnosis of ADHD, the child's symptoms need to be excessive, long-term, and pervasive: Excessive: they occur more often than in other children of the same age and sex. Its criteria for ADHD are: 1  evidence of at least six of nine symptoms of inattention and/or at least six of nine symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity. 2  symptoms are inappropriate for the child's age and stage of development. 3  symptoms impair the child's functioning. In general, a child shouldn't receive a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder unless the core symptoms of ADHD start early in life \u2014 before age 12 \u2014 and create significant problems at home and at school on an ongoing basis. There's no specific test for ADHD, but making a diagnosis will likely include: Standard treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children include medications, education, training and counseling. These treatments can relieve many of the symptoms of ADHD, but they don't cure it. It may take some time to determine what works best for your child.

If the landlord gave me a written lease, a complete move-in checklist, and a specific written statement within 21 days, does this prevent me from requesting my deposit back or disputing the charges? Are you ever going to see it again? Does it mean you don\u2019t have to pay your last month\u2019s rent? What is a security deposit? A security deposit is a fixed amount of money you pay your landlord, or management company, to cover any damage you might cause to the property. The landlord can\u2019t spend that money while you live in the apartment. The new law, which goes into effect January 15, 2017, requires landlords to charge no more than 1 month\u2019s rent for security deposit and nonrefundable fees. Additionally, tenants are allowed up to a 6 month payment plan for the security deposit, any nonrefundable fees, and last month\u2019s rent. How long does the landlord have to return my deposit? RCW 59.18.280 states that the landlord has 21 days from the time the rental agreement ends and the tenant vacates the unit to postmark the return of the deposit or a written statement detailing why portions of the deposit were withheld. The correspondence must be postmarked by the 21st day. The landlord sends you an itemized list of damages and repair costs, along with any remaining balance on your security deposit; When you move out, be sure to give your landlord your new address. They are legally required to send you an itemized list of damages and the balance of your security deposit within a certain time period, but they can\u2019t do that if they don't know where to find you. Information landlords must give tenants. Once your landlord has received your deposit, they have 30 days to tell you: the address of the rented property. how much deposit you\u2019ve paid. how the deposit is protected. the name and contact details of the tenancy deposit protection (TDP) scheme and its dispute resolution service.

Harvest Once blossoms appear and pollination takes place, zucchini will grow quickly in the warm weather and may be ready to pick in as few as four days or up to a week. Harvest zucchini when it is about 2 inches in diameter and about 6 to 8 inches long. Don't allow the squash to get too big or overripe, or it will be tough and seedy. For more delicate texture, zucchini can be harvested when it is even smaller. The blossoms can also be used in gourmet dishes. Zucchini should be ready to pick about two months after it is planted. Once you've started harvesting, continuing to pick the squash encourages the plant to produce more. Cutting the zucchini off with a knife prevents damage to the plant. Zucchini can be stored for up to two weeks.

Withdrawal can be broken down into three stages of severity: Stage 1 (mild): anxiety, insomnia, nausea, abdominal pain and/or vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, tremors, depression, foggy thinking, mood swings, and heart palpitations Several factors can play a role in the number of days detoxification will continue. 1  Amount of alcohol consumed. 2  How long the person has been drinking. 3  How often the person has been drinking on a regular basis. 4  Nutritional considerations. 5  Weight and age. 6  Was the alcohol combined with other substances. Congratulations on your decision to get sober. Yes, alcohol withdrawal after chronic, long term drinking can be dangerous. This is why (from what I\u2019ve read) doctors always recommend medically supervised alcohol detox withdrawal periods for heavy drinkers. By medically supervised, I mean in a clinic. The severity of symptoms is dictated by a number of factors, the most important of which is degree of alcohol intake, length of time the individual has been using alcohol, and previous history of alcohol withdrawal. 1  Symptoms are also grouped together and classified: 1 - 2 Days After Last Drink.

The main advantage of an electrical synapse is the rapid transfer of signals from one cell to the next. Synaptic communication is distinct from an ephaptic coupling, in which communication between neurons occurs via indirect electric fields. An autapse is a chemical or electrical synapse that forms when the axon of one neuron synapses onto dendrites of the same neuron. Types of interfaces How does communication occur within a neuron?

A CT scan \u2014 also called Computerized Tomography or just CT\u2014is an X-ray technique that produces images of your body that visualize internal structures in cross section rather than the overlapping images typically produced by conventional X-ray exams. CT scans use an X-ray unit that rotates around your body and a powerful computer. The result with CT scans is a set of cross-sectional images, like slices, of the inside of your body. Should I do anything special to prepare for a CT scan? How you prepare for a CT scan depends on which part of your body is being scanned. You may be asked to remove your clothing and wear a hospital gown. You\u2019ll need to remove any metal objects, such as jewelry, that might interfere with image results. Q&A: About Your CT Scan What is a CT scan? CT, which stands for Computed Tomography (sometimes referred to as a \u201cCAT\u201d scan), is a fast, painless diagnostic tool doctors can use to see inside the body. Physicians use the information they get from a CT scan to rule out or confirm the presence of certain abnormalities or diseases. A CT scan has many uses, but is particularly well-suited to quickly examine people who may have internal injuries from car accidents or other types of trauma. A CT scan can be used to visualize nearly all parts of the body and is used to diagnose disease or injury as well as to plan medical, surgical or radiation treatment. CT of the head is an X-ray-based procedure in which images (pictures) are taken of the entire brain. CT scans of the head/brain can provide more detailed information about brain tissue and brain structures than standard X-rays of the head. Therefore, this can provide more information related to injuries and brain disease. You might have an injection of contrast medium (a type of dye) through a small thin tube (cannula) in your arm. 1  This can: 2  make you feel hot and flushed for a minute or two. 3  give you a metallic taste in your mouth. 4  make you feel like you\u2019re passing urine but you aren\u2019t \u2013 this feeling is common and passes quickly. How long does it take? A CT scan can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on what part of the body is being scanned. It also depends on how much of your body the doctors want to look at and whether contrast dye is used. It often takes more time to get you into position and give the contrast dye than to take the pictures. For some types of CT scan, a 'contrast agent' is used to make certain parts of the patient more visible to x-rays. The contrast agent is in the form of a liquid that is injected into the patient prior to scanning. This liquid has iodine in it, and shows up well in CT scans. At our hospital, it'd be very unusual for a CT scan to take more than an hour or two to be read, most are done within 30 minutes. From there, the question is how long does it take for the report to get to the ordering doctor? What will I feel during the scan? CT scanning causes no pain, just as a routine X-ray is painless. If intravenous contrast is used, you may feel warm and flush and get a metallic taste in your mouth. These sensations normally disappear after a few minutes. How long will the scan take? The time required will depend upon the type of scan. If oral contrast is required, about 45 to 60 minutes is needed for the contrast to move through your digestive tract. Actual scan times vary from a few seconds to several minutes. If no oral contrast is required, the examination will take about 15 to 30 minutes, including the time for intravenous preparation and interview. In some cases additional scanning is required as scans are tailored to suit individual diagnostic needs. I do think a lot of hospitals are concerned with customer satisfaction so I think elevating your displeasure with the scan results policy may go a long way. Most hospitals have surveys or complaint forms and if neither of those apply a letter to the Hospital administration may be order.

This means that if you are exposed to the influenza virus and become infected, you will start to experience flu symptoms anywhere between 24 hours and four days after the exposure. Viral Shedding. Influenza spreads mainly by respiratory droplets that contain copies of the virus that have replicated in your body. Viral shedding, which correlates with infectivity, occurs starting approximately 1 day before symptoms appear and can continue for up to 10 days after symptoms develop. The most active period of contagion falls between 1 and 4 days after the start of symptoms, according to a May 2010 article published in the Journal of Infectious Disease. The study also found that in a small number of cases, infection transmission occurred before symptoms appeared. If you are exposed to someone with the flu, avoid close contact with the person, and wash your hands frequently. 1  Vitamin C: Although Vitamin C is widely used and has many benefits, there is no scientific proof that it will help you avoid an illness such as the flu or a cold. Tamiflu Actions. Tamiflu acts by reducing the number of cells in your body that are affected by the influenza virus. It does this by binding to a coating, called neuraminidase, that's found on the surface of the virus. Neuraminidase allows the virus to penetrate healthy cells, where it can then produce more copies of the virus. After symptoms start, adults can spread the virus for five to 10 days. However, the amount of virus spread decreases significantly after three to five days. Adults are most contagious with the flu from 24 hours before symptoms start to three to five days afterward. Flu symptoms generally don't come on gradually. 1  More often, people describe the onset of flu as if they were hit by a truck.. You feel fine, and then suddenly, an hour later, you feel like you can hardly move. 2  We know that it is highly contagious and can be spread before you even have symptoms. Preventing the Flu After Exposure. 1  Vitamin C: Although Vitamin C is widely used and has many benefits, there is no scientific proof that it will help you avoid an illness such as the flu or a cold. 2  Humidifiers: Evidence suggests that viruses such as the cold and flu spread more easily in cold, dry air.

WEDNESDAY, March 12 (HealthDay News) -- A new survey reports that teenagers spend far too many hours a week in front of TVs and computers, and those in poor neighborhoods have even more screen time.. Girls who lived in the poorest neighborhoods were five times more likely to spend the most time in front of screens than those in the richest neighborhoods. The girls in poor neighborhoods might be more vulnerable to perceptions that their neighborhoods are not safe, Barnett suggested. Half of the boys and a quarter of the girls reported spending an average of more than 42 hours a week in front of electronic screens. TV was the most common form of screen use, accounting for 85 percent of the time. It finds that teenaged girls now spend an average of seven-and-a-half- hours watching screens, compared with 3.5 hours of TV viewing in 1995. Younger children fare slightly better - in 1995, five to 10-year-olds averaged around two-and-a-half-hours of TV. Fast-forward to 2014 and screen time has risen to four-and-a-half hours.

There is life after Bankruptcy! GWNorris3rd's response was: Bankruptcy will ruin your credit for some time to come. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy can remain on your credit report for up to 10 years. Although a bankruptcy stays on your record for years, the time to complete the bankruptcy process under Chapter 7, from filing to relief from debt, takes only about 3-6 months. If you decide against Chapter 7 when it may be the right decision for you, your missed debt payments, defaults, repossessions, and lawsuits will also hurt your credit, and may be more complicated to explain to a future lender than bankruptcy. The impact to your credit score is largely based on where your credit stands now and what information is on your credit report.\u200b. In 2010, FICO released information about how bankruptcy and other credit mistakes affect your credit score. Using a mock scenario with two different credit profiles, FICO showed a bankruptcy could cost up to 240 points for someone with a 780 credit score and 150 points for someone with a 680 credit score. And, while a bankruptcy can severely damage your credit score, that doesn\u2019t mean that bankruptcy has to be the end of a good credit rating forever. How Long Does Bankruptcy Stay On The Record. There are two types of bankruptcy \u2013 Chapter 13 bankruptcy and Chapter 7 Bankruptcy: Plus, as long as your report is filled with nothing but A+ grades, you should have a decent credit score within a few years, and even a good score by the time the bankruptcy drops off your report. 4. Keep Your Oldest Accounts Active Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. The bankruptcy itself and the debts associated with the bankruptcy will be displayed differently on your credit report. A completed Chapter 13 bankruptcy will stay on your report for up to seven years, and discharged debts will also stay on the report up to seven years after they are discharged. How Long Does Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Last? In most cases, it takes approximately three to four months to complete a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and obtain a discharge. However, if you have a complex case or creditors object to your discharge, it can take longer. This means that you can complete your case quickly and begin rebuilding your credit right away. How Long Does Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Remain on Your Credit Report? A Chapter 7 bankruptcy will usually stay on your credit report for ten years. But in general, this does not prohibit you from obtaining new credit and moving on with your life. In fact, most debtors start receiving new credit card offers shortly after they receive their discharge. To do this we\u2019ll need to set the record straight on some of the most commonly held misconceptions about how bankruptcy impacts credit scores. Myth #1: Having no negative information on your credit report prior to bankruptcy leads to a higher post-bankruptcy credit score than if your report contained derogatory information prior to the filing. Myth #3: You will have a low credit score for as long as the bankruptcy information remains on your credit report. Fact #3: While it\u2019s true that you should not expect a high score following bankruptcy, if you manage your credit optimally in its aftermath you can be looking at a 700 score or higher after only about 4-5 years. You cannot file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy if you previously went through bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 within the last six years. If you obtained a Chapter 13 discharge in good faith after paying at least 70% of your unsecured debts, the six-year bar does not apply.

Tina stood in for the missing singer, and the song, A Fool in Love, became a hit in 1960 (#27 pop, #2 R&B).

Newlyweds: Tina Turner, 73, is said to have wed her 57-year-old German toyboy Erwin Bach in Switzerland.

We can go for about six hours in this glucose-burning mode, which is why we tend to get a bit cranky if we have to go without food for longer than that. The point is that not all of your cells die quickly without oxygen. In surgeries they cut off blood supplies for up to hours and tissues don't die. Your brain is really what needs the oxygen. It has a huge metabolic requirement, and it needs a constant supply of oxygen for cellular respiration. In essence, your body is buying you some valuable time to give you a fair chance of finding some food. 0-6 hours after eating.

When a limb falls asleep, it is getting the nerve pinched off for a time as well as loosing some blood flow. However, this is not a complete loss and so your arm is able to survive because it is still receiving enough oxygen and other nutrients to sustain its existence (as well as having toxins and CO2 pumped away from it). The human body can go without oxygen for about five to ten minutes, and about three to eight days without water. But remarkably, people have been known to live upwards of 70 days without food. How is this possible? The crucian carp can live in anoxic water for months at temperatures close to freezing. Similarly the turtle, Trachemys scripta, can withstand anoxia for 48 h at 20 \u00b0C and at least 3 months at 3 \u00b0C. Most of the book is in fact devoted to a detailed look at the adaptions that allow these species to survive without oxygen for a long time.

The color of its fur ranges from grey and white to brown and black. Females give birth to 1 to 6 young per litter, with an average of 2 to 3. Otters are born with fur, but are otherwise helpless. Females give birth, nurse, and care for their young in a den near the water. The young are weaned at about 3 months old and begin to leave their mother at 6 months old. Adult females care for their juvenile offspring, who disperse by the time the otters give birth again. Sexual maturity is reached at 2 to 3 years of age. Did you know?

Oolitic limestone was used to build the Pentagon as well as other buildings around the world, such as Buckingham Palace and the Empire State Building. Scientists have discovered that oolitic limestone is actually a material which was made out of microbes that existed 200 million years ago, at the time of the Jurassic era when dinosaurs were still present on the Earth. OOLITIC LIMESTONE. Oolitic limestone is a carbonate rock made up mostly of ooliths (or ooids) which are sand-sized carbonate particles that have concentric rings of CaCO 3. These rings are formed around grains of sand or shell fragments that were rolled around on the shallow sea floor, gathering layer after layer of limestone. How did oolitic limestone form? Previously, scientists thought that the ooids formed from grains rolled on the seafloor and then accumulated layers of sediment. \u201cOolitic limestone is a carbonate rock made up mostly of ooliths (or ooids) which are sand-sized carbonate particles that have concentric rings of CaCO3. These rings are formed around grains of sand or shell fragments that were rolled around on the shallow sea floor, gathering layer after layer of limestone,\u201d University College London gave an explanation on its website. Limestone is by definition a rock that contains at least 50% calcium carbonate in the form of calcite by weight. All limestones contain at least a few percent other materials. These can be small particles of quartz, feldspar, clay minerals, pyrite, siderite, and other minerals. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) in the form of the mineral calcite. It most commonly forms in clear, warm, shallow marine waters. It is usually an organic sedimentary rock that forms from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, and fecal debris. Limestone is a sedimentary rock comprising at least 80% calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Limestones can be deposited in both marine and fresh water environments, the former being more common, and can take many forms such as those described below. Chalk is a pure, soft, well-jointed limestone composed primarily of the calcareous remains of micro-organisms called coccoliths and foraminifera. Pure white chalk contains more than 90% CaCO3 and is usually found in thick beds. In Britain it stretches from Yorkshire down to the famous cliffs of Dover. oolitic limestone Oolitic limestone is a carbonate rock made up mostly of ooliths (or ooids) which are sand-sized carbonate particles that have concentric rings of CaCO 3.

Portland limestone is an example of an oolitic limestone. This limestone formed in a shallow sea, rather like the modern Bahamas, near the end of the Jurassic period (~135 million years ago). The rock has an even structure rather like cod roe and it can therefore be cut or sculpted in any direction. Oolitic Limestone: A limestone composed mainly of calcium carbonate oolites, small spheres formed by the concentric precipitation of calcium carbonate on a sand grain or shell fragment.

High heat is around 450 degrees Fahrenheit on the grill. A three-quarters-inch thick pork chop will take around six to eight minutes on high heat. A 1-inch pork chop will cook in about eight to 10 minutes on direct medium heat. Medium heat on a grill is between 350 and 450 degrees. For a pork chop that is 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd inches thick, sear each side for a total of six minutes on high heat, then finish grilling over medium heat for another four to six minutes. For sugar-based glazes, apply it about 10 minutes prior to removing the pork chops from the grill to prevent the glaze from burning onto the chops.

To avoid drying the chops while grilling, either marinate or brine them (use a basic brine solution of 1/4 cup salt to four cups of water; lay the pork chops in a single layer in a shallow dish and pour the brine over the top) for two hours in the refrigerator. Sear the chops using high heat. Place the pork chops on the hottest part of the grate, directly above the coals.

The test will yield a positive result when concentrations of morphine exceed 2000 ng/mL. Morphine is excreted unmetabolized (aka unchanged), and is also the major metabolic product of codeine and heroin. Fentanyl is one of the strongest opiates available today. Fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and over 100 times stronger than morphine. Due to this, it is typically prescribed to patients with an injury, who are experiencing severe pain, or after a patient has undergone surgery. Interpretation. 1  Opiates are the natural or synthetic drugs that have a morphine-like pharmacological action. 2  Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is a synthetic opiate made from morphine and is rarely detectable in body fluids. 3  Ingestion of bakery products containing poppy seeds can also cause morphine to be excreted in urine. If excessively large amounts are consumed, this can result in urine morphine concentrations up to 2000 ng/mL for a period of 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Due to first-pass metabolism, no pharmacologic effect is experienced from poppy seed ingestion. Till date, it is used widely along with morphine to sedate a person and dull severe pain. Opium is also one of the most abused substances in the world today. What are Opiates? Opiates are a class of drugs which are derived from opium. The principle alkaloid of this class of drugs is morphine, which is also one the most widely used painkillers as well as most abused drug. Even in the times of ancient Sumerians, the chemical properties of opium and its effects on the brain were known and studied. A: Morphine generally is detectable in blood for up to 12 hours after use, in saliva for up to four days, in urine for up to three or four days and in hair follicles for up to 90 days, according to About Health. A variety of factors influence the detection time. Continue Reading synthetic, and synthetic, and notes that standard immunoassays can detect only natural opioids. The third table lists five common classes of drugs and information related to their detection in a urine drug test (i.e., primary metabolites, typical detection cut-off, potential sources of false positives, The most commonly used opiates are heroin, hydrocodone, morphine, and codeine. Heroin is a particularly fast-acting drug with a very short half-life. A saliva test will only be able to detect heroin for the first 5 hours after the last dose, and blood tests work for an average of 6 hours. Morphine is the most abundant opiate derived from the opium plant. With hundreds of brand names, morphine is an analgesic drug that acts directly on the central nervous system.

An EMG test is a detailed investigation of the health of your peripheral nervous system (basically, this means all of the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord). There are 2 parts to the test, nerve conduction testing, and an optional needle exam (see below). In the nerve conduction studies (NCS), various nerves, usually in the arm or leg, will be stimulated with a small, harmless electrical pulse. The response from your nerve is recorded by an EMG machine. What medical training do doctors who do EMGs have? Doctors who do EMGs go to 4 years of medical school; and then have 3 or 4 more years training in a residency program. Most work as neurologists or physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors. Medical training helps the doctor decide which tests to perform based on your problems. The person who administers the test will explain the procedure. Often muscle activity is monitored through a speaker during the test, which may make a popping or soft roaring noise.

Smith Center for Women's Cancers at Dana-Farber provides a variety of services to help patients and their families cope with the many physical, emotional, and spiritual challenges of a cancer diagnosis and its treatment. Sometimes a hysterectomy includes removal of one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes, a procedure called a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy (sal-ping-go-o-of-uh-REK-tuh-me). A hysterectomy can also be performed through an incision in the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy) or by a laparoscopic or robotic surgical approach \u2014 which uses long, thin instruments passed through small abdominal incisions. An abdominal hysterectomy may be recommended over other types of hysterectomy if: You have a large uterus. Recovery will depend on the type, extent, and reason for the procedure. A brief hospital stay may be needed. Full recovery can take from 4 to 8 weeks depending on the procedure and the health status of the patient.

A potty walk or a stroll, even if long, doesn't count as strenuous exercise. You can take your dog for a potty walk or gentle stroll before/after eating. A power walk counts as strenuous exercise. You can take your dog for strenuous exercise 2 hours after eating. My rule for feeding after exercise is to wait until the dog is recovered -- no longer panting, etc. Really strenuous exercise like a hard run, the 2-hour rule is a good one. Your body needs the energy to properly digest food. So to get the most out of the nutrients you consume and your workout, eat before exercising or 30 mins after fruit, two hours after veggies, three hours after grains four hours after meats and poultry. In the second phase, 30 days after the first phase, participants were told to take a 10-minute walk no later than five minutes after each meal. During both phases, blood sugar was monitored. Walking after meals lowered blood sugar levels more effectively among the participants, the study found. A slow five minute walk will not hurt her. But, definitely NO overexertion, no running, no jogging, no jumping... nothing more than a short/calm walk after eating, unless you wait for at least 2-3 hours after she feeds, before doing so. As a rule, don't feed for an hour after coming in from exercise (and that includes a long car journey, to allow the system to settle down), and leave it 2 hours after feeding before exercising. A study published today in Diabetes Care found that three short walks each day after meals were as effective at reducing blood sugar over 24 hours as a single 45-minute walk at the same moderate pace. Even better, taking an evening constitutional was found to be much more effective at lowering blood sugar following supper. Factors to Consider When Eating Before a Walk. The timing and size of your meals before a walking workout makes a difference. If you\u2019re consuming a large meal, wait for about three to four hours before walking. If you consume a small meal, wait between two and three hours before you set off. However, after a small snack, you should be able to go walking within less than an hour. Keep in mind that these ranges are general and can vary from person to person. Your best option is to try various time periods to see which one works best for you. Possible Effects of Eating Before a Walk The researchers observed that the evening post-meal walk was the most effective in lowering blood sugar levels for a full 24 hours. The typical exaggerated rise in blood sugar after supper\u2014which often lasts well into the night and early morning\u2014was curbed significantly as soon as the participants started to walk on the treadmill, the study authors said.

Evaporation and transpiration losses from farming and the watering of lawns and landscapes. 2  2. Evaporation losses from canals and artificial lakes including the reservoirs behind dams. The absorption of most of the outgoing thermal radiation by water vapor creates most of Earth's natural greenhouse effect - an effect that is now being increased by human pollution. Without the atmospheric water vapor Earth's surface would be, on average, about 31\u00b0C (55\u00b0F) colder than it is now and the differences in temperature between high and low altitudes and between the poles and equator would be smaller. Climate change intensifies this cycle because as air temperatures increase, more water evaporates into the air. Warmer air can hold more water vapor, which can lead to more intense rainstorms, causing major problems like extreme flooding in coastal communities around the world. <<Related: A Thirst for Power: The Water Energy Nexus>> Water vapour is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, yet other greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) are often portrayed as the main drivers of climate change. If we did not have water vapor and the trace gases the earth would be much colder because the oxygen, nitrogen, and argon would not prevent the loss of infrared to space. http://en.wikiped...of_Earth Water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas in the atmosphere but it is limited in altitude (due to condensation) and variable (due to the ability to condense with drops in temperature or changes in pressure). Water vapor is another greenhouse gas that keeps heat from the sun trapped in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and helps maintain a temperature at which life can flourish on our planet. However, deforestation also affects the amount of this in the air. Air is a mixture of gases, which includes nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapor (water in its gas form). Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor in air. All air contains at least some water vapor, but the amount of water vapor changes a lot from place to place and from time to time.

Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. 2  In a small bowl, combine the molasses, ketchup, lemon juice, dry mustard, chili powder and garlic powder. Mix thoroughly. 3  Place the drained meat on a broiler rack. Brush molasses mixture over ribs. When you're ready to cook the ribs, get the pan ready. Choose a large pan with 2-inch sides that can comfortably hold all of the ribs in a single layer. Stacking the ribs will result in unevenly cooked meat. I like to boil my ribs before slathering them in BBQ sauce and then toss them on the grill. :d How many people boil their ribs before tossing them on the grill? Yes, we love and eat beef short ribs as much and often as the next guy does. But, this plate is wildly different. On the outside, the ribs look as enticing as you\u2019d expect any good short rib dishes to. Bafflement begins when you cut into the rib. Suddenly, you start questioning your senses: You feel as though your knife is running through some very tender cut, not unlike prime ribs. Place the short ribs in the pan and add 2 cups of water. The water should almost completely cover the meat. Add the thyme and bay leaves, cover the pan, and cook in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Check on the meat periodically, adding more water if necessary. Turn the ribs over halfway through. Cook's notes: Recipe calls for 6 to 8 hours in a low oven (250 degrees). Call ahead to your butcher two days or more in advance if you want boneless short ribs. If you prefer, select bone-in variety, but when you order, take into account waste (bone, excess fat). Preliminaries: Heat oven to 250 degrees. In a stockpot, bring 6 quarts water to a boil. Stir in 1 cup each sugar and coarse salt until dissolved. Add smashed unpeeled cloves from 1 head garlic and meat; boil until cooked through and tender at bone, 20 minutes for chicken, 30 minutes for pork ribs, and 40 minutes for beef ribs. You don't need to boil spareribs before grilling because you can make tender, juicy, delicious ribs without boiling them. Many grilling and barbecue enthusiasts will tell you the length of time you should boil ribs before cooking is zero minutes. Some cooks prefer to boil ribs before cooking and a typical time, with the ribs fully submerged in salted water, is around 45 minutes to an hour on a medium-low simmer. While boiling does have some advantages over straight grilling, it has a significant downside. But as an avid cook, my challenge is to streamline a professional recipe to something simple and convenient enough to make at home whenever I have a craving for those delicious short ribs. I\u2019ve found that cooking them in the oven at a low temperature of 190 degrees Fahrenheit for just eight hours yields some very tender and juicy meat that somewhat resembles what I tasted at Julienne. How to Cook Ribs in the Oven. When cooking ribs in the oven, place ribs on rack of a broiler pan. Brush with KRAFT or BULL\u2019S-EYE Barbecue Sauce, then bake at 350\u00b0F for 1 hour 15 min. or until ribs are done, turning and brushing occasionally with additional barbecue sauce.

From an article originally appearing in The Racing Blade, November 1994: For many years I have heard various statements of the actual speed in miles per hour (MPH) that speed skaters skate, anywhere from 20 to 40 MPH. Long Track Speedskating Preview The U.S. and long track speedskating are synonymous. Boasting 67 Olympic medals, including 29 golds, Team USA is traditionally poised to reach the medal stand each Olympic Winter Games due to the team\u2019s historic success. And remember that the stop-and-go tactics of pack-style skating also influence times, and true speed. Therefore... If you have the opportunity to have timed flying 1-laps, then this would be your fastest true speed (although you could probably skate a little faster in a long track straight-away sprint of maybe 100 meters). The Olympic long track competition will be held at the Gangneung Oval, which is situated next to the short track speedskating venue in the coastal city of Gangneung. The venue seats up to 8,000 people and also hosted the 2017 ISU World Single Distances Speed Skating Championships in February 2017. Short track speed skating takes place on a smaller rink, normally the size of an ice hockey rink, on a 111.12 m oval track. Distances are shorter than in long-track racing, with the longest Olympic individual race being 1500 meters (the women's relay is 3000 meters and the men's relay 5000 meters). Most speed skating races are held on an oval course, but there are exceptions. Oval sizes vary; in short track speed skating, the rink must be an oval of 111.12 metres, while long track speed skating uses a similarly standardized 400 m rink. Inline skating rinks are between 125 and 400 metres, though banked tracks can only be 250 metres long. Before you use the Speed Calculator, please keep in mind two very important points. First, in Short Track speed skating, the skaters rarely skate the actual measured distance on the track, usually skating a somewhat wider track, and therefore farther than the measured 111.12 meters per lap. If you cannot get a flying lap timed, just enter your best time in a short race, like a 333 (300 for Long Track) or a 500. Just to answer the big question of How fast can a speedskater really skate?, try entering the current (2001) 500 meter World Record for Long Track, 34.32. The long track speed skating track is more than three times the length of the short track. Speed skating is broken up into 12 events at the Olympics for both men and women. Men compete at distances of 500 meters, 1,000 meters, 1,500 meters, 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters and a team event. Speed skating. The standard rink for long track is 400 meters long, but tracks of 200, 250 and 333\u2153 meters are used occasionally. It is one of two Olympic forms of the sport and the one with the longer history. An international federation was founded in 1892, the first for any winter sport.

No type of UV radiation has been shown to be safe \u2013 cancers have developed after exposure to UVA (alone), UVB (alone), and UVC (alone). What expert agencies say. Several national and international agencies study different substances in the environment to determine if they can cause cancer. However, this is not always the case. The signature mutation caused by ultraviolet light is a CC to TT mutation, caused when a CC dimer is mispaired with two adenine bases during replication. Because of these mutations, the connection between ultraviolet damage to DNA and cancer is quite clear. Whenever we walk in the sun, ultraviolet light (UV) attacks our DNA, making chemical changes that corrupt our genetic information. Fortunately, the most dangerous UV light never reaches us at all: the ozone in the upper atmosphere absorbs (at least for now) the energetic UVC wavelengths. The longer UV wavelengths, however, do pass through the atmosphere and fall on us. Yes. In fact, most skin cancers are a direct result of exposure to the UV rays in sunlight. Both basal cell and squamous cell cancers (the most common types of skin cancer) tend to be found on sun-exposed parts of the body, and their occurrence is typically related to lifetime sun exposure. Studies of cells in lab dishes and test tubes have shown that sunlight and simulated sunlight (for example, from xenon or xenon-mercury arc lamps) can cause DNA damage (mutations). Studies in animals. Exposure of mice, rats, and some other lab animals to sunlight and artificial sources of UV rays has been shown to lead to skin cancers. Ultraviolet light is absorbed by a double bond in pyrimidine bases (such as thymine and cytosine in DNA), opening the bond and allowing it to react with neighboring molecules. If it is next to a second pyrimidine base, the UV-modified base forms direct covalent bonds with it.

Of course the Moon orbits the Earth. How long does the Earth take to travel around the Sun? Obviously, the answer is one year or 365.25 days. It is not so simple though as there are a number of definitions of a year. For example, Tropical year, which is from equinox to equinox, that is from the time the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north to the next time 365.24219 days Because the orbital velocity of the Moon around Earth (1 km/s) is small compared to the orbital velocity of Earth about the Sun (30 km/s), this never happens. There are no rearward loops in the Moon's solar orbit. Best Answer: Like all planets in our solar system, the Earth is in an elliptical orbit around our Sun. In Earth's case, its orbit is nearly circular, so that the difference between Earth's farthest point from the Sun and its closest point is very small. Earth's orbit defines a two-dimensional plane which we call the ecliptic. It takes roughly 365 days for the Earth to go around the Sun once. This means that the Earth is rushing through space around the Sun at a rate of about 67,000 miles per hour! The time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun one full time is what we call a year. The combined effect of the Earth's orbital motion and the tilt of its rotation axis result in the seasons. With an average orbital speed of 9.69 km/s, it takes Saturn 29.457 Earth years (or 10,759 Earth days) to complete a single revolution around the Sun. In other words, a year on Saturn lasts about as long as 29.5 years here on Earth. However, Saturn also takes just over 10 and a half hours (10 hours 33 minutes) to rotate once on its axis. This means that a single year on Saturn lasts about 24,491 Saturnian solar days. How long does the moon take to orbit around the sun once? The Earth's Moon orbits around Earth once in a Month and the Earth orbits around the Sun once in a year, so the Moon orbits around the Sun once in a year too. Edit Share to: So in 90 seconds, for example, we all move some 12,500 miles (20,000 km) in orbit around the galaxy\u2019s center. Our Milky Way galaxy is a big place. Even at this blazing speed, it takes the sun approximately 225-250 million years to complete one journey around the galaxy\u2019s center. One year. That is actually the basis and definition of a year; the time for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun. However the length of a year was known long before we knew that Earth orbits the Sun and not the other way around. That is because as Earth orbits the Sun, the Sun can be seen moving against the background of stars in Earth's sky, and the time it takes the apparent Sun to go once around the starry sky is the same as the time for Earth to go around the Sun. 2016-01-12T23:41:03-05:00. 1  The obvious answer to this question would be a year or 365 days, but the Universe is much more complicated than that. 2  Earth's orbit of 584 million miles around the sun is made in 365.256 days at a speed of 67000 mph. Every planet in the Solar System takes a certain amount of time to complete a single orbit around the Sun. Here on Earth, this period lasts 365.25 days \u2013 a period that we refer to as a year. When it comes to the other planets, we use this measurement to characterize their orbital periods.

Note that the answer may not be present in exact form.", "input": "Once nicotine consumption is stopped, then both nicotine levels and nicotine metabolite levels in the blood decrease, but it must be kept in mind that these levels do not disappear altogether. The simplest answer to the question of how long does it take for nicotine to leave your system is a few weeks. Once nicotine consumption is stopped, nicotine levels in the blood begin to gradually decrease. Nicotine has a half-life in the human body of 2 hours (although it can range from 1 to 4 hours in different individuals). The average smoker has a blood nicotine concentration of about 40 ng/ml after an evening cigarette. And usually when signing up for life insurance they will ASK you if you've smoked in the last 12 months, but the testing is not that thorough, its the same nicotine test no matter what, they dont take your hair or anything, its a simple blood test. Ive heard it takes 30 days but not 100% sure. Nicotine has been shown to be an even more addictive drug than others such as heroine! The lingering presence of nicotine in the body acts as a reminder for nicotine consumption. It is popularly believed that nicotine is released from the human body within 72 hours of its consumption, but the truth is far different. The various aspects of nicotine storage in the body last for weeks after the most recent consumption of nicotine. Many people wonder about how long nicotine stays in your blood. Blood harbors both nicotine and metabolites released by nicotine. I recently got hired for a job and had to undergo cotinine testing, however because I drank a lot of water, the lab requested a second test due to dilution. Before my first testing, I had been smoke free for 3 days. I took the test, then ignorantly lit a cigarette, it tasted awful.. I probably took 2 or 3 puffs off of it before throwing it out. Sorry to split hairs on this, but given that the typical half-life of nicotine is 2 hours, and that most assays have a limit of detection of 0.1 to 0.5 ng/ml, following the logic I described above, all the nicotine has gone from the blood stream within 24 hours. i.e. when you take a blood sample from a smoker 24 hours after their last smoke, they will most likely have a blood nicotine level <0.5 ng/ml. (i.e.>95% gone by 24 hrs). She's more concerned with how long it takes nicotine and what I would call, by products, from leaving her body, than she is as to why the doctor has asked her to quit smoking. She even said the doctor told her he wanted the nicotine out for 30 days so the surgery would be successful. How long can nicotine be detected in blood or urine after quiting smoking? [Top] The byproducts of nicotine can be detected in the blood for up to a month after you stop smoking. This is only of concern if you are in a situation where someone else might want to test you for the presence of nicotine or nicotine byproducts in your system. However, the metabolite of nicotine which is known as Cotinine leaves its traces in blood as well as in urine for up to 7 days. About 85 to 90 per cent of the nicotine which is present in your blood is metabolised by the liver and is thrown out of your system by the kidney. But due to the higher concentration, many a times, it still persists in the blood stream. Nicotine is a very highly addictive chemical that is the main component of cigarettes. Your body, especially your heart and lungs, will usually begin to heal at 12 hours after you\u2019ve had your last cigarette/ stopped smoking. Finally, as nicotine levels in the blood keep decreasing over the coming weeks, the nicotine stored by various tissues in the body recedes to significantly lower levels. Patients with surgical procedures planned are often advised to quit smoking weeks before surgery so that healing can be improved.
