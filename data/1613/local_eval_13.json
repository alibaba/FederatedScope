A spark plug has a metal threaded shell, electrically isolated from a central electrode by a porcelain insulator. The central electrode, which may contain a resistor, is connected by a heavily insulated wire to the output terminal of an ignition coil or magneto. The spark plug's metal shell is screwed into the engine's cylinder head and thus electrically grounded. The central electrode protrudes through the porcelain insulator into the combustion chamber, forming one or more spark gaps between the inner end of the central electrode and usually one or more protuberances or structures attached to the inner end of the threaded shell and designated the side, earth, or ground electrode(s).", "output": "does a spark plug keep an engine running?, does a spark plug need to be grounded?", "category": "Question Generation 1009.json"}, {"instruction": "You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage.", "input": "Star Trek: Discovery is an American television series created for CBS All Access by Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman.
