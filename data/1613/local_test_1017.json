Odd, I had not changed any of my devices in a year. Maybe the USB ports were failing according to some Internet searches (and thus the PS3 was bad... oh my!).  Fortunately, as of now, it seems this was just a symptom of a bad battery in my main PS3 controller (whew!).  Once I replaced the battery with this one I purchased, I no longer got the USB power problem message on the PS3 screen (thank goodness!).  I have all my PS3 devices/controllers attached and a keyboard and all looks good.  This battery seems to work perfectly, yet I cannot of course vouch for its sustainability over time.  I bought 2 batteries just in case this only lasted a few months.  The battery was cheap enough to buy a second one if the lifespan was not so great.
