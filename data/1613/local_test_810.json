This presents a unique challenge because an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and lack of proper lymphatic drainage keeps the CNS virtually outside the radar of circulating immune cells that are at constant vigilance for antigens in peripheral tissues. Limited antigen presentation skills of CNS cells in comparison to peripheral tissues is because of a total lack of dendritic cells and feeble expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in neurons and glia. However, research over the past two decades has identified immune effector mechanisms intrinsic to the CNS for immediate tackling, attenuating and clearing of viral infections, with assistance pouring in from peripheral circulation in the form of neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T cells at a later stage. Specialized CNS cells, microglia and astrocytes, were regarded as sole sentinels of the brain for containing a viral onslaught but neurons held little recognition as a potential candidate for protecting itself from the proliferation and pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses. Accumulating evidence however indicates that extracellular insult causes neurons to express immune factors characteristic of lymphoid tissues. This article aims to comprehensively analyze current research on this conditional alteration in the protein expression repertoire of neurons and the role it plays in CNS innate immune response to counter viral infections. \u00df \n Title: Neurons under viral attack: Victims or warriors?", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

These patients travelled with a group of 29 other Dutch travellers. We conducted an epidemiological assessment of the travel group to identify likely source(s) of infection and presence of potential risk factors. Methods: All travellers, including the two cases, completed a questionnaire focussing on potential human, animal and food exposures to MERS-CoV. The questionnaire was modified from the WHO MERS-CoV questionnaire, taking into account the specific route and activities of the travel group. Results: Twelve non-cases drank unpasteurized camel milk and had contact with camels. Most travellers, including one of the two patients (Case 1), visited local markets, where six of them consumed fruits. Two travellers, including Case 1, were exposed to coughing patients when visiting a hospital in Medina. Four travellers, including Case 1, visited two hospitals in Mecca. All travellers had been in contact with Case 1 while he was sick, with initially non-respiratory complaints. The cases were found to be older than the other travellers and both had co-morbidities. Conclusions: This epidemiological study revealed the complexity of MERS-CoV outbreak investigations with multiple potential exposures to MERS-CoV reported such as healthcare visits, camel exposure, and exposure to untreated food products. Exposure to MERS-CoV during a hospital visit is considered a likely source of infection for Case 1 but not for Case 2. For Case 2, the most likely source could not be determined. Exposure to MERS-CoV via direct contact with animals or dairy products seems unlikely for the two Dutch cases. Furthermore, exposure to a common but still unidentified source cannot be ruled out. More comprehensive research into sources of infection in the Arabian Peninsula is needed to strengthen and specify the prevention of MERS-CoV infections. \n Title: Travel-related MERS-CoV cases: an assessment of exposures and risk factors in a group of Dutch travellers returning from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, May 2014", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The continuous emergence of new IBV genotypes and lack of cross protection among different IBV genotypes have been an important challenge. Although live attenuated IB vaccines remarkably induce potent immune response, the potential risk of reversion to virulence, neutralization by the maternal antibodies, and recombination and mutation events are important concern on their usage. On the other hand, inactivated vaccines induce a weaker immune response and may require multiple dosing and/or the use of adjuvants that probably have potential safety risks and increased economic burdens. Consequently, alternative IB vaccines are widely sought. Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology have resulted in experimental IB vaccines that show promise in antibody and T-cells responses, comparable to live attenuated vaccines. Recombinant DNA vaccines have also been enhanced to target multiple serotypes and their efficacy has been improved using delivery vectors, nanoadjuvants, and in ovo vaccination approaches.

Methods: We hypothesised that the temporal sequence would follow a pre-specified order, according to study design. We assessed 1) how long it takes before findings from a specific study design appear, 2) how publication of preprints could reduce the time to publication and 3) how time to publication evolves over time. Results: We included 346 publications published between March 6, 2014 and January 1, 2019. In the 2013--2016 ZIKV outbreak, case reports, case series and basic research studies were published first.

Since 2010, livestock farmers increasingly use biochar as a regular feed supplement to improve animal health, increase nutrient intake efficiency and thus productivity. As biochar gets enriched with nitrogen-rich organic compounds during the digestion process, the excreted biochar-manure becomes a more valuable organic fertilizer causing lower nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions during storage and soil application. Scientists only recently started to investigate the mechanisms of biochar in the different stages of animal digestion and thus most published results on biochar feeding are based so far on empirical studies. This review summarizes the state of knowledge up to the year 2019 by evaluating 112 relevant scientific publications on the topic to derive initial insights, discuss potential mechanisms behind observations and identify important knowledge gaps and future research needs. The literature analysis shows that in most studies and for all investigated farm animal species, positive effects on different parameters such as toxin adsorption, digestion, blood values, feed efficiency, meat quality and/or greenhouse gas emissions could be found when biochar was added to feed. A considerable number of studies provided statistically non-significant results, though tendencies were mostly positive. Rare negative effects were identified in regard to the immobilization of liposoluble feed ingredients (e.g., vitamin E or Carotenoids) which may limit long-term biochar feeding. We found that most of the studies did not systematically investigate biochar properties (which may vastly differ) and dosage, which is a major drawback for generalizing results. Our review demonstrates that the use of biochar as a feed additive has the potential to improve animal health, feed efficiency and livestock housing climate, to reduce nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions, and to increase the soil organic matter content and thus soil fertility when eventually applied to soil. In combination with other good practices, co-feeding of biochar may thus have the potential to improve the sustainability of animal husbandry.

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a pattern-recognition molecule, which functions as a first line of host defense.

In this study, MBL wild-type (WT) and MBL knockout (KO) murine models were used to examine the role of MBL in pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection. Results. Our study demonstrated that in vitro, MBL binds to pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 viruses, likely via the carbohydrate recognition domain of MBL. Wild-type mice developed more severe disease, as evidenced by a greater weight loss than MBL KO mice during influenza virus infection. Furthermore, MBL WT mice had enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with MBL KO mice, suggesting that MBL could upregulate inflammatory responses that may potentially worsen pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infections.

Lentivirus-mediated TACE shRNA was injected into the abdominal aortic plaques of rabbits which effectively down-regulated TACE expression and activities from week 8 to week 16. TACE gene silencing reduced remodeling index and plaque burden, and diminished the content of macrophages and lipids while increased that of smooth muscle cells and collagen in the aortic plaques. In addition, TACE gene silencing attenuated the local expression of P65, iNOS, ICAM-1, VEGF and Flt-1 and activities of MMP9 and MMP2 while increased the local expression of TGF-\u03b21 together with reduced number of neovessels in the aorta. TACE shRNA treatment resulted in down-regulated expression of TACE in macrophages and blunted ERK-P38 phosphorylation and tube formation of co-cultured mouse vascular smooth muscle cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In conclusion, gene silencing of TACE enhanced plaque stability and improved vascular positive remodeling. The mechanisms may involve attenuated local inflammation, neovascularization and MMP activation, as well as enhanced collagen production probably via down-regulated ERK-NF-\u03baB and upregulated TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathways. Tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE), also known as ADAM17 (A disintegrin and A metalloproteinase 17), was initially discovered as a protease that cleaves the 26-kDa precursor of TNF-\u03b1 and sheds transmembrane TNF-\u03b1 to generate a soluble form of TNF-\u03b1 that can bind to TNF-\u03b1 receptors to induce inflammatory response 1 . Recently it has been recognized that TACE is a type I transmembrane protein and a member of a superfamily of Zn dependent metalloproteases. The major physiological role of TACE is to regulate the proteolytic release of a number of growth factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules and cleavage enzymes from cellular membrane 2,3 . The major pro-inflammatory cytokine processed by TACE is TNF-\u03b1 which is produced by macrophages, monocytes and T-cells, and acts as a major player in the pathogenesis of inflammation. It has been increasingly recognized that TACE-mediated shedding is involved in a variety of diseases such as ischemia, heart failure, arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, neurological and immune diseases 3-5 . Ashley EA et al. provided functional evidence for TACE as a candidate gene of atherosclerosis susceptibility and found that polymorphisms of the TACE genes had relation to cardiovascular mortality in humans 6 . Canault M et al. found that TACE expression was associated with lesion formation in atherosclerosis-prone sites of apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE -/-) mice 7 .

We hypothesized that axonal damage recruits inflammatory cells to sites of Wallerian degeneration , leading to demyelination. Three weeks after TMEV infection , axonal degeneration was induced in the posterior funiculus of mice by injecting the toxic lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) I into the sciatic nerve. Neuropathology was examined 1 week after lectin injection. Control mice , infected with TMEV but receiving no RCA I , had inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the anterior/lateral funiculi. Other control mice that received RCA I alone did not develop inflammatory lesions. In contrast, RCA I injection into TMEV-infected mice induced lesions in the posterior funiculus in addition to the anterior/lateral funiculi. We found no differences in lymphoproliferative responses or antibody titers against TMEV among the groups. This suggests that axonal degeneration contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system by altering the local microenvironment. In this scenario, lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). 1 Although its etiology is unknown, epidemiological data and clinical reports support the association of MS with environmental factors, particularly viral infection. In recent years, pathological and neuroimaging studies have re-emphasized the importance of axonal damage in MS. 2 Immunostaining studies have provided direct evidence for axonal damage using antibodies against two markers of injured axons: nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein (NFP) 3 and amyloid precursor protein. 4 Several groups have demonstrated that axonal damage occurred early during the course of MS and that damaged axons were found not only in active demyelinating lesions but also in periplaque white matter without demyelination, 5 remyelinating lesions and normal-appearing white matter. 6,7 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses have also demonstrated gray matter lesions 8 and axonal injury in normal-appearing white matter in MS patients. 7, 9, 10 Axonal damage in normal-appearing white matter has also been found in an animal model for MS, coronavirus-induced demyelination. 11 Although axonal damage in MS is believed to occur secondarily after the destruction of the myelin sheath or oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells, these findings suggest that axonal damage could be independent of demyelinating activity. 12 Wallerian degeneration is the anterograde degeneration of axons caused by injury to the proximal part of the axon or by death of the neuronal cell body. 13 In most cases, the demonstration of Wallerian degeneration in humans has been limited to compact neuronal tracts, such as the corticospinal tract and optic radiation. In MS, Wallerian degeneration was believed to be rare; this was probably attributable to a difficulty in detection because MS lesions are usually not confined to a single pathway or tract. However, more recently, magnetic resonance imaging, 14 -17 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 18 and autopsy 19 studies have documented the presence of Wallerian degeneration in some patients with MS. \n Title: Immunopathology and Infectious Disease Targeting Inflammatory Demyelinating Lesions to Sites of Wallerian Degeneration", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Although a new definition has been recently proposed (Berlin definition), there are various forms of ARDS with potential differences regarding their management (ventilator settings, prone positioning use, corticosteroids). ARDS can be caused by various aetiologies, and the adequate treatment of the responsible cause is crucial to improve the outcome. It is of paramount importance to characterize the mechanisms causing lung injury to optimize both the aetiological treatment and the symptomatic treatment. If there is no obvious cause of ARDS or if a direct lung injury is suspected, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be strongly considered to identify microorganisms responsible for pneumonia. Blood samples can also help to identify microorganisms and to evaluate biomarkers of infection. If there is no infectious cause of ARDS or no other apparent aetiology is found, second-line examinations should include markers of immunologic diseases. In selected cases, open lung biopsy remains useful to identify the cause of ARDS when all other examinations remain inconclusive.

These models are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of various control programs via vaccination and antiviral treatment. We use susceptible-, infectious-, recovered-type epidemic models consisting of ordinary differential equations. These models allow us to derive threshold conditions that can be used to assess the effectiveness of vaccine and drug use and to determine disease outcomes. Simulations are helpful for examining the potential consequences of control options under different scenarios. Particularly, results from models with constant parameters and models with time-dependent parameter functions are compared, demonstrating the significant differences in model outcomes. Results suggest that the effectiveness of vaccination and drug treatment can be very sensitive to factors including the time of introduction of the pathogen into the population, the beginning time of control programs, and the levels of control measures. More importantly, in some cases, the benefits of vaccination and antiviral use might be significantly compromised if these control programs are not designed appropriately. Mathematical models can be very useful for understanding the effects of various factors on the spread and control of infectious diseases.

In a large metropolitan of Thailand's capital city Bangkok, most respiratory infections are rarely confirmed by molecular diagnostics. We therefore examined the frequency of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in 8,842 patients who presented influenza-like illness and sought medical care at a large hospital in Bangkok between 2016 and 2017. Using a multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 30.5% (2,699/8,842) of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples tested positive for one or more of these viruses. Influenza virus comprised 17.3% (1,528/8,842), of which the majority were influenza A/H3N2. Such infection was most prevalent among adults and the elderly. RSV was identified in 11.4% (1,011/8,842) and were mostly ON1 and BA9 genotypes. Of the hMPV-positive samples (3.6%, 318/8,842), genotypes A2, B1, and B2 were detected. A small number of individuals experienced co-infections (1.8%, 155/8,842), most commonly between RSV and influenza A/H3N2. RSV and hMPV co-infections were also found, but mainly in young children.

One potential target for SARS-CoV antiviral drug development is the 3C-like protease (3CLpro). This enzyme is an attractive target since it is essential for viral replication, and since there are now a number of high resolution X-ray structures of SARS-CoV 3CLpro available making structure-based drug-design possible. As a result, SARS-CoV 3CLpro has become the focus of numerous drug discovery efforts worldwide, but as a consequence, a variety of different 3CLpro expression constructs and kinetic assays have been independently developed making evaluation and comparison between potential inhibitors problematic. Here, we review the literature focusing on different SARS-CoV 3CLpro expression constructs and assays used to measure enzymatic activity. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence showing that the activity of 3CLpro enzymatic is significantly reduced when non-native sequences or affinity-tags are added to the N-or C-termini of the enzyme, or when the enzyme used in assays is at concentrations below the equilibrium dissociation constant of the 3CLpro dimer. We demonstrate for the first time the utility of a highly sensitive and novel Alexa488-QSY7 FRET-based peptide substrate designed for routine analysis and high-throughput screening, and show that kinetic constants determined from FRET-based assays that are uncorrected for inner-filter effects can lead to artifacts. Finally, we evaluated the effects of common assay components including DTT, NaCl, EDTA and DMSO on enzymatic activity, and we recommend standardized assay conditions and constructs for routine SARS-CoV 3CLpro assays to facilitate direct comparisons between SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors under development worldwide. \n Title: Evaluating the 3C-like protease activity of SARS-Coronavirus: Recommendations for standardized assays for drug discovery", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Nonetheless, data interpretation and real understanding of viral dynamics is still hampered by the sheer complexity of the various intertwined spatio-temporal processes. In this paper we present a tool to address these issues: a cellular automata model describing critical aspects of in vitro viral infections taking into account spatial characteristics of virus spreading within a culture well. The aim of the model is to understand the key mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection dynamics during the first 24 hours post infection. We interrogate the model using a Latin Hypercube sensitivity analysis to identify which mechanisms are critical to the observed infection of host cells and the release of measured virus particles. \n Title: UvA-DARE (Digital Academic Repository) Link to publication Creative Commons License (see https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/cc-licenses): CC BY-NC-ND Citation for published version (APA): A Simulation Framework to Investigate in vitro Viral Infection Dynamics", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

In the present study, we characterized its dynamic profile, biodistribution, and potential for genomic DNA integration in normal vaccinated rodent. A real-time quantitative PCR analysis (RT-qPCR) of animals administered a single dose of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 (300 \u03bcg/kg by intramuscular injection) showed that CCOL2A1 mRNA level in the blood peaked between 2 and 6 h post-immunization and then rapidly declined, and was undetectable between day 1-42. CCOL2A1 transcript was detected at the muscle injection site on days 3-14 post-immunization. Starting from day 14, the transcript was detected in the heart, liver, lung, and kidney but not in the spleen or thymus, and was expressed only in the lung on day 28. There was no CCOL2A1 mRNA present in the testes or ovaries at any time point.

Since the pulmonary circulation receives the entire cardiac output, the large surface area of the lung microvasculature is well suited for sensing mechanical, chemical, and cellular injury by inhaled or circulating substances. This endothelial barrier is dynamically regulated through exposure to these various stimuli of physiological and pathological origin and serves to regulate multiple key biological processes (including lung fluid balance and solute transport between vascular compartments). For example, an increase in vascular permeability is a necessary feature of the body's defense mechanism to provide injured tissues with access to leucocytes, resulting in tissue edema due to fluid extravasation. However, during conditions of intense lung inflammation such as observed in acute lung injury or its severer form of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the large surface area becomes a liability and provides the opportunity for profound vascular permeability resulting in massive fluid accumulation in the alveolar space and progressively leading to pulmonary failure. Alterations in vascular permeability occur not only in acute inflammatory lung disorders primarily caused by sepsis, pneumonia, and trauma which result in high rates of patient morbidity and mortality, but are an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in subacute lung inflammatory disorders such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, radiation lung injury, and asthma.

The latter molecules have been shown to affect reproduction in both mice and humans, although the exact mechanism is still unknown. Here we report the results of a longitudinal study of the reproductive performance of a genetically modified B2m deficient mouse strain with low MHC Class I expression. Our data show that this mouse strain has an impaired reproductive performance. However, the mice superovulate well and show a normal estrous cycle. Breeding studies from crosses between the transgenic mice and the wild-type parental strain show that B2m deficient mice have a significantly lower frequency of mating than the control B2m \u00fe/\u00fe mice. In addition, the litter size and weaning success of B2m deficient mice were lower than the control. Perinatal lethality of the B2m deficient offspring was also inflicted by cannibalism of the young pups by the B2m deficient female. The impaired breeding phenotype (IBP) can be reversed by reintroducing the B2m gene in F1 heterozygous B2m \u00fe/\u00c0 animals; thus the presence of B2M confers a normal breeding pattern. The acquisition of an impaired breeding phenotype (IBP) as a result of the knockout of B2m directly implicates B2M in the reproductive cycle of mice and raises the possibility of an effect of B2M on the reproduction of other mammals. beta-2 microglobulin, female reproductive tract, fetus, MHC (H-2), odor discrimination, odortypes \n Title: An Impaired Breeding Phenotype in Mice with a Genetic Deletion of Beta-2 Microglobulin and Diminished MHC Class I Expression: Role in Reproductive Fitness 1", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

However, increasing sectors of the population have expressed hesitancy about participating in such programs, leading to the re-emergence of vaccine preventable diseases. In this study we rely on a recreancy hypothesis to test the association between confidence in the government and local hospitals and the willingness to take the vaccine. Methods: A secondary analysis of a survey that used a large sample of the U.S. population conducted in October 2009 was used (N \u00bc 968). The results indicate that 36.1% of the respondents expressed willingness to be vaccinated. Those with the greatest trust in the government were the most likely to be vaccinated (43.4%), and those least confident were the least willing (15.8%). From the ones reporting being confident in the local health system, 38.4% were willing to be vaccinated, and from those not confident, only 23.5% were willing to be vaccinated. Conclusion: The decision to get vaccinated in the midst of a contagious outbreak involves many considerations. Trust in the government's technical and organization skill to deal with the infectious outbreak along with trust in medical organizations predict the adoption of recommended protection measures.

A total of 44 healthy adult Chinese rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: Group A (n=15), administered a combination of lipopolysaccharide and hormone to establish the SANFH animal model; group B (n=15), SANFH animal model as in group A orally administered LEV (0.4 g/kg/day) on the day of injection; and group C (n=14), the control group. On the 6th and 8th week of modeling, seven rabbits from each group were sacrificed to harvest bilateral femoral head specimens for hematoxylin and eosin staining and apoptosis detection by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay analysis, as well as for observing pathological changes and analyzing cellular apoptosis. Eight weeks after modeling, the serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels of the three groups were measured. The empty lacunae rate and apoptosis index of bone cells in the treatment group were significantly lower than that of the model group (P<0.01). Eight weeks after treatment, the serum levels of IGF-1 were significantly higher than that of the model group (P<0.01). These findings suggested that LEV was able to reduce steroid-induced bone cellular apoptosis, reduce the occurrence of necrosis of the femoral head and, through in vivo metabolism, it may promote the synthesis and release of IGF-1, which could be one of its biological pathways to prevent and treat SANFH.

Integrins are membrane-bound signal mediators, expressed on a variety of cell surfaces and are known as receptors or coreceptors for many viruses. However, the role of integrin b3 in CSFV infection is unknown. Here, through quantitive PCR, immunofluorescence (IFC) and immunocytohistochemistry (ICC), we revealed that ST (swine testicles epithelial) cells have a prominent advantage in CSFV proliferation as compared to EC (swine umbilical vein endothelial cell), IEC (swine intestinal epithelial cell) and PK (porcine kidney epithelial) cells. Meanwhile, ST cells had remarkably more integrin b3 expression as compared to EC, IEC and PK cells, which was positively correlated with CSFV infection and proliferation. Integrin b3 was upregulated post CSFV infection in all the four cell lines, while the CSFV proliferation rate was decreased in integrin b3 function-blocked cells. ShRNA1755 dramatically decreased integrin b3, with a deficiency of 96% at the mRNA level and 80% at the protein level.

To recognize the importance to the maintenance of good health of adequate public health regulations and an infrastructure that provides clean water and appropriate waste management 2. To see the lack of such amenities over many centuries, but the progressive development of public health bureaucracies dedicated to provision of an appropriate infrastructure, beginning during the Victorian Era. 3. To observe how responsibility for the provision of adequate housing for poorer city dwellers has been shared between government, benevolent entrepreneurs and charities. 4. To note the new challenges to public health presented by such issues as the abuse of tobacco and mood-altering drugs, continuing toxic auto-emissions, the epidemic of HIV/AIDS, a decreased acceptance of MMR vaccinations, and the ready spread of infectious diseases by air travel. Some early civilizations enacted quite specific health regulations, and some also developed an impressive health infrastructure, at least for their wealthier citizens. We will cite briefly examples from the Harrapan region of the Punjab, Egypt and Israel. The Harrapan Culture The Harrapan cities date back 2 millennia BCE, The Harrapan people were perhaps the first to pay significant attention to a healthy urban infrastructure. Multi-storied brick houses boasted wells and an effective covered sewage system. Public baths facilitated personal, hygiene, and dykes protected the region against flooding. Laws also protected the community against the adulteration of grain and fats. Egypt In Egypt, pigs were regarded as unclean animals, and were avoided as sources of protein; further, the eating of other meat products was prohibited during the hotter parts of the year. The wealthier citizens used natron, a paste of ash or clay, to clean their hands, and for upper-class Egyptians the laundry supervisor was an important member of the domestic staff. There are ruins of a few public bath-houses built during the period of Greek domination, but most Egyptians were content to wash their bodies by a quick dip in a canal or river. Israel Moses (1391-1271 BCE) imported some early Egyptian regulations into Israel, and the priestly class elaborated 213 of 613 Biblical commandments that focussed upon health and personal hygiene. Items covered in these discourses of the Torah include rigid quarantine regulations, a variety of dietary restrictions, and a regular weekly Sabbath period of relaxation. Water, usually drawn from wells, was a precious commodity in ancient Israel, and excreta accumulated in cess-pits. Minoans The Minoan culture (2000-1500 BCE) seems to have had some knowledge of the principles of public health. Networks of clay pipes provided upper class houses with water and sewage facilities, and aqueducts brought fresh water to the palace fountains and spigots from springs that were some 10 km away. Separate pipes cleared waste-water and the run-off from heavy rains, and the Minoan palace even had a footbath for weary travellers. However, provision for the lower echelons of society was less satisfactory. People still had to carry water from a local spring, and dysentery and typhoid fever were likely frequent problems for poorer Minoans. Greece Classical Athens viewed hygiene as the management of 6 non-natural things (air, exercise, diet, sleep, excretion and retention, and passions of the mind). 22 Infrastructure for Health and Fitness 345 However, the city also made major public investments in infrastructure to provide clean water and treat sewage. There are reports of groundwater exploitation and water transportation from distant sources, together with storm water and wastewater systems, flood protection and drainage, and the construction of fountains, baths and other sanitary and purgatory facilities. Laws also required the inspection of wines to ensure the purity and soundness of these products. The ideas of classical Greece were further developed in Rome, where good health was seen as dependent upon a combination of bathing, wise eating, massage and exercise. Infrastructure included public and private baths, aqueducts as long as 350 km, and city-wide sewage systems. The private villas of wealthy citizens boasted indoor plumbing, with flush toilets, and baths were often included in their dream homes, sometimes staffed by one or more athletes. Ordinary citizens made wide use of public baths. A water commissioner named Frontinus (40-103 CE) reported that under his jurisdiction there were 856 baths in Rome alone. Visitors to the baths gave their belongings to slaves, and then entered the cold-plunge-bath. After exercising in this pool, they moved into a warm and humid room where they sweated and were massaged. They could then progress to a yet warmer room with a mosaic floor immediately above the furnace, finishing with a brief spell of dry sweating in the hottest room of the facility. Women used an adjoining, smaller set of baths. There were rigid state laws to guard the purity of food products and protect the public against bad quality and fraud. Documentation describes the watering of wine and the adulteration of olive oil. It was once suggested that lead piping had caused a widespread poisoning of the Roman population. However, Vitruvius (c. 75-15 BCE) seemed aware of this danger: \"Water conducted through earthen pipes is more wholesome than that through lead; indeed that conveyed in lead must be injurious, because from it white lead\u2026. is obtained, and this is said to be injurious to the human system.\" If indeed there was chronic lead poisoning in Rome, it more likely arose from syrups prepared by concentrating grape juice in lead kettles. The return of the Roman legions from foreign expeditions exposed the population to many micro-organisms for which they had little natural immunity. The Antonine plague (165-180 CE) was probably smallpox. It quickly decimated the ranks of the legions, with a clinical picture of fever, diarrhoea, inflammation of the pharynx, and a pustular skin eruption on the 9th day. A similar plague raged under Cyprian, between 251 and 270 CE. One charlatan (Alexander the Paphlagonian, second century CE) made much money selling a protective oracle to hang over front doors; however, it did little to stem the infection!

The data available to estimate the overall CFR are often gathered for other purposes (e.g., surveillance) in challenging circumstances. We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall CFR-preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays-and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics. Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.g., hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative CFR for two or more groups. When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and/or die. We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential CFR among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets. Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which these biases may affect non-causal interpretation of risk factors for death among cases.

Traditional epidemiologic models choose to simplify reality by ignoring both the spatial distribution of populations and possible intrapopulation heterogeneities, whereas more recent solutions based on Individual-Based Modeling (IBM) can achieve high precision but are costly to compute and analyze. We introduce here an original alternative to these two approaches, which relies on a novel hybrid modeling framework and incarnates a multiscale view of epidemics. The model relies on a technical fusion of two modeling paradigms: System Dynamics (SD) and Individual-Based Modeling. It features an aggregated representation of local outbreaks rendered in SD, and at the same time a spatially-explicit simulation of the spread between populations simulated in IBM. We first present the design of this deterministic model, show that it can reproduce the dynamics of real resurgent epidemics, and infer from the sensitivity of several spatial factors absent in compartmental models the importance of having large-scale epidemiological processes represented inside of an explicitly disaggregated metapopulation. After discussing the implications of results obtained from simulation runs and the applicability of this model, we conclude that SD-IB hybrid modeling can be an interesting choice to represent epidemics in a spatially-explicit way without necessarily taking into account individual heterogeneities, and therefore it can be considered as a valuable alternative to simple compartmental models suffering from detrimental effects of the well-mixed assumption. \n Title: Impact of the topology of metapopulations on the resurgence of epidemics rendered by a new multiscale hybrid modeling approach", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Recently, inflammatory lesions have been observed in the lungs of immunocompetent laboratory rats similar to those previously described. Based on the latest evidence indicating that Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii), and not putative RRV, causes infectious interstitial pneumonia in laboratory rats, the present study investigated whether the pulmonary lesions observed were caused by P. carinii infection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, free of known pathogens, were introduced into a rat colony positive for RRV-type lesions. Routine histopathological examinations were performed on the rat lung tissues following exposure. The presence of Pneumocystis organisms was confirmed using Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) staining. At week 3 following introduction, a few small lymphoid aggregates were located adjacent to the edematous vascular sheath. By week 5, foci of dense perivascular lymphoid cuffing were observed. Multifocal lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia and prominent lymphoid perivascular cuffs were observed between week 7 and 10. GMS staining confirmed the presence of Pneumocystis cysts.

Additional research is needed to define the pathogenesis of this viral infection and the host's specific immune response. Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A variety of viruses, including the influenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses, have been associated with clinical syndromes ranging from mild illnesses, such as the common cold, to more severe devastating conditions, such as pneumonia. However, \u223c50% of the cases of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and 15%-35% of cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in pediatric patients are still without a known etiology [1-3]. Along with inadequate diagnostic methods, this observation also suggests that other respiratory tract infectious agents may exist and remain to be identified. A new respiratory virus, the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first isolated in 2001 from nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) obtained from young children in The Netherlands [4] . On the basis of morphological, biochemical, and genetic features, hMPV was tentatively classified with avian metapneumovirus (APV), the causative agent of an upper respiratory tract disease in turkeys and other birds [5], in the Metapneumovirus genus. The latter, together with the Pneumovirus genus (containing hRSV as the type species), is Note added in proof. Human metapneumovirus was recently isolated from previously virus-negative nasal wash specimens from 49 (20%) of 248 young children consulting at the Vanderbilt Clinic (Nashville, TN) for lower respiratory tract illnesses [44] . Extrapolation of these results to the entire cohort of patients observed at this institution over a 25-year period (1976-2001) suggests that the prevalence of human metapneumovirus infection was \u223c12% in all outpatient children with lower respiratory tract diseases. \n Title: Human Metapneumovirus: A New Player among Respiratory Viruses", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Direct losses to the animal and public health sectors, connected mainly to value losses due to morbidity and mortality in humans and animals, and indirect losses, such as the economic cost caused by the reaction to disease and the limiting of its negative effects, all contribute to this negative impact. Its full assessment can be challenging, but economic tools and frameworks can be used to estimate zoonotic disease impact and the economic efficiency of possible technical ways of dealing with these diseases. In this chapter, we review the impact of zoonoses across sectors, also in the context of an increasingly complex value chain, address the economic concepts behind the balance between losses due to direct costs of disease and expenditures in reaction to disease presence, and identify possible economic tools and frameworks to assess the impact of zoonoses and interventions. 1107  \n Title: Economic Aspects of Zoonoses: Impact of Zoonoses on the Food Industry Impact of Zoonoses on the Food Industry", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

We conducted a systematic review to examine waterborne outbreaks following such events and explored their distribution between the different types of extreme water-related weather events. Four medical and meteorological databases (Medline, Embase, GeoRef, PubMed) and a global electronic reporting system (ProMED) were searched, from 1910 to 2010. Eighty-seven waterborne outbreaks involving extreme water-related weather events were identified and included, alongside 235 ProMED reports. Heavy rainfall and flooding were the most common events preceding outbreaks associated with extreme weather and were reported in 55 . 2 % and 52 . 9% of accounts, respectively. The most common pathogens reported in these outbreaks were Vibrio spp. (21 . 6%) and Leptospira spp. (12 . 7 %). Outbreaks following extreme water-related weather events were often the result of contamination of the drinking-water supply (53 . 7 %). Differences in reporting of outbreaks were seen between the scientific literature and ProMED. Extreme water-related weather events represent a risk to public health in both developed and developing countries, but impact will be disproportionate and likely to compound existing health disparities.

This study is aimed at investigating the capability of SARS-CoV to activate IFNa and -g expression in lymphomonocytes (PBMC) from healthy donors, evaluating whether viral replication is necessary for this activation. Results: SARS-CoV virus is able to induce both IFN-a and -g mRNA accumulation and protein release in a dose-dependent manner, MOI 10 being the most effective. The time course curve indicated that IFN-a mRNA induction peaked at 24 h.p.i,. whereas IFN-g mRNA was still increasing at 48 h.p.i. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24 -48 h.p.i. and remained rather stable over a 5-day period. A transient peak of negative strand viral RNA was detected after 1 -2 days of infection, but neither infectious virus progeny yield nor newly produced viral genomic RNA could be evidenced in infected cultures, even after prolonged observation time (up to 13 days). Cocultivation of PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells was even more efficient than exposure to live virus in eliciting IFN-a and -g induction. A combination of IFN-a and -g strongly inhibited SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells, while the single cytokines were much less effective. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV is able to induce in normal PBMC a coordinate induction of IFN-a and -g gene expression. Virus replication is not necessary for IFN induction since efficient IFN expression could be obtained also by the cocultivation of normal PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected cells. Concomitant activation of IFN-a and -g gene expression by SARS-CoV in vivo may be relevant for the pathogenesis of the disease, both for the possible involvement in immunomediated damage of the tissues and for the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV replication as a result of combined cytokine action.
