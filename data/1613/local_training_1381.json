I find it odd that you believe that if I have more money than you, that I should have more free speech. This is the fatal flaw in the court decision, that money equates free speech. This is intellectual lunacy. Free speech, the courts have previously ruled must be protected at all costs, especially when the protected free speech is the opinion of the smallest minority. If you have $1000 dollars and I have $10, you have more free speech than me based on the Citizens United decision.
