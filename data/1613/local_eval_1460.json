Passage:In 1944, Argentia served as one of the two stopover bases for the refuelling, maintenance, and crew changes of the six United States Navy (USN) K-class blimps that made the first transatlantic crossings of non-rigid airships. Blimps K-123 and K-130 from USN Blimp Squadron 14 (also known as ZP-14, Blimpron 14, or \"The Africa Squadron\") left South Weymouth Naval Air Station in Massachusetts on 28 May 1944 and landed at Argentia about 16 hours later. The two K-ships then flew for approximately 22 hours to Lages Field on Terceira Island in the Azores, the second stopover base for the transatlantic flights. The last leg was a ~20-hour flight to the squadron's final destination with Fleet Air Wing (FAW) 15 at Port Lyautey, French Morocco (now Kenitra, Morocco). Blimps K-123 and K-130 were followed by K-109 and K-134 then K-112 and K-101 which left South Weymouth on 11 and 27 June, respectively, in 1944. These six blimps initially conducted nighttime anti-submarine warfare operations to complement the daytime missions flown by FAW-15 aircraft (PBYs and PB4Y-2) using magnetic anomaly detection to locate U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Strait of Gibraltar. Later, ZP-14 K-ships conducted minespotting and minesweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escort missions including that of the convoy carrying Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill to the Yalta Conference in early 1945.

Passage:Scottish field armies rarely managed to stand up to the usually larger and more professional armies produced by England, but they were used to good effect by Robert I of Scotland at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 to secure Scottish independence. He adopted a policy of slighting castles and made use of naval power to support his forces, beginning to develop a royal Scottish naval force. In the Late Middle Ages under the Stewart kings these forces were further augmented by specialist troops, particularly men-at-arms and archers, hired by bonds of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period. New \"livery and maintenance\" castles were built to house these troops and castles began to be adapted to accommodate gunpowder weapons. The Stewarts also adopted major innovations in continental warfare, such as longer pikes, the extensive use of artillery, and they built up a formidable navy. However, one of the best armed and largest Scottish armies ever assembled still met with defeat at the hands of an English army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, which saw the destruction of a large number of ordinary troops, a large section of the nobility and King James IV.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 861.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

Lennon also used a Framus Hootenanny twelve-string acoustic, which can be seen in the movie Help! and heard on the title song and \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\". This twelve-string guitar accounted for audibly richer rhythm guitar parts on songs like these, in comparison to the six-string Gibsons. After Sgt.

Passage:The Xia (1362\u20131371), officially the Great Xia and known as Ming Xia today, was a short-lived Chinese dynasty in modern Sichuan and Chongqing during the chaotic late Yuan dynasty. It was founded by the Red Turban rebel general Ming Yuzhen whose army expelled Yuan loyalists from the region in the late 1350s. He refused to recognize Chen Youliang, who killed the Red Turban leader Xu Shouhui to found his Chen Han empire, so in 1362 Ming declared himself emperor of Xia, with the capital in Chongqing. He defended his empire from Chen Han, and tried, unsuccessfully, to conquer Yunnan from the warlord Basalawarmi. After his death in 1366, his teenaged son Ming Sheng succeeded him, but the empire began to disintegrate into regional military commands. In 1371, the Ming dynasty under emperor Zhu Yuanzhang made a two-pronged attack and conquered Xia relatively easily. Ming Sheng who surrendered was exiled to Goryeo, and became the progenitor of the Korean Namwon Seung clan, Yeonan Myeong clan and Seochok Myeong clan.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 861.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

Passage:Another common use of the theme is as a prison for villains or demons. The idea is used in the first two Superman movies starring Christopher Reeve where Kryptonian villains were sentenced to the Phantom Zone from where they eventually escaped. An almost exactly parallel use of the idea is presented in the campy cult film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, where the \"8th dimension\" is essentially a \"phantom zone\" used to imprison the villainous Red Lectroids. Uses in horror films include the 1986 film From Beyond (based on the H. P. Lovecraft story of the same name) where a scientific experiment induces the experimenters to perceive aliens from a parallel universe, with bad results. The 1987 John Carpenter film Prince of Darkness is based on the premise that the essence of a being described as Satan, trapped in a glass canister and found in an abandoned church in Los Angeles, is actually an alien being that is the 'son' of something even more evil and powerful, trapped in another universe.

In response, NBC threatened to pull its programming from both WBZ-TV and WPTZ unless Westinghouse agreed to the trade. The swap was made in February 1956, but Westinghouse immediately complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Department of Justice about NBC's extortion. The threat reemerged in 1960 after NBC announced it would swap the Philadelphia stations in exchange for a competing Boston outlet, then-CBS affiliate WNAC-TV (channel 7) and its sister radio stations, from RKO General. Approval of the RKO-NBC deal would have potentially made WBZ-TV an ABC affiliate, completing a three-way swap of network affiliations in Boston. However, in 1964, the FCC nullified the NBC-RKO trade and ordered the NBC-Westinghouse swap reversed without NBC realizing any profit on the deal.

Earlier than that, ice treats have been enjoyed in the country since ancient times. During the 5th century BC, ancient Greeks ate snow mixed with honey and fruit in the markets of Athens. The father of modern medicine, Hippocrates, encouraged his Ancient Greek patients to eat ice \"as it livens the lifejuices and increases the well-being.\" In the 4th century BC, it was well known that a favorite treat of Alexander the Great was snow ice mixed with honey and nectar. In the modern Day Greek ice cream has been heavily influenced by Turkish Ice cream Dondurma thus the name used to be called Dudurmas but, because of Greco-Turkish relations most Turkish related foods are coined a more Greek idiom. Greek ice cream recipes have some unique flavours such as Pagoto Kaimaki (), made from mastic-resin which gives it an almost chewy texture, and Salepi, used as a thickening agent to increase resistance to melting, both giving a unique taste to the ice cream; Pagoto Elaeolado me syko (), made of olive oil and figs; Pagoto Kataifi cocoa (), made from the shredded filo dough pastry that resembles angel's hair pasta, similar to vermicelli but much thinner; and Pagoto Mavrodaphne (), made from a Greek dessert wine.

Passage:The regeneration of the Ninth Doctor into the Tenth at the end of \"The Parting of the Ways\" (2005) used computer effects to morph Christopher Eccleston into David Tennant. In the episode of Doctor Who Confidential accompanying the episode \"Utopia\" (2007), where the same effect is used for the Master's regeneration, it is stated that the production team decided that this would be a common effect for all future Time Lord regenerations, rather than each regeneration being designed uniquely at the whim of the individual director. This style of transition is seen again in \"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\" (2008) both when the Doctor undergoes an aborted regeneration, and when his hand spawns a clone in the second part; in The End of Time (2010) during which Matt Smith took over the role as the Eleventh Doctor; in \"The Impossible Astronaut\" when the Doctor is shot twice and seemingly killed; in \"Day of the Moon\" when a young girl regenerates; and in \"Let's Kill Hitler\" when Mels (Nina Toussaint-White) is shot and regenerates into River Song (Alex Kingston). \"The Night of the Doctor\" and \"The Day of the Doctor\" subsequently use the effect to show the Eighth Doctor and War Doctor's regenerations respectively. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor uses steady beams of light as opposed to the flame effect used for other revived series regenerations. In the Series 10 episode \"The Lie of the Land\", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration as part of a plan to test if Bill still has free will. The effect used is consistent with the one used in the modern series, with the Doctor's hands glowing and emitting regeneration energy before he enters full regeneration. However, as the regeneration was not real, it did not use up a regeneration and the Doctor did not change bodies.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 861.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

Passage:Bullock served as the 46th Governor of Georgia from 1868 to 1871 during Reconstruction and was the first Republican governor of Georgia. After Georgia ratified the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Omnibus Act declared that states were entitled to representation in Congress as one of the states of the Union. Georgia again lost the right to representation in Congress because the General Assembly expelled twenty-eight black members and prevented blacks from voting in the 1868 presidential election (see Original 33). In response to an appeal from Bullock, Georgia was again placed under military rule as part of the Georgia Act of December 22, 1869. This made Bullock a hated political figure. After various allegations of scandal and ridicule, in 1871 he was obliged by the Ku Klux Klan to resign the governorship, and felt it prudent to leave the state. He was succeeded by Republican State Senate president Benjamin Conley, who served as Governor for the two remaining months of the term to which Bullock had been elected. Conley was succeeded by James M. Smith, a Democrat, and no Republican would serve as governor of Georgia again until Sonny Perdue in 2003.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 861.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

Passage:Dillon returned to Reading in 1995 and held a number of roles within Reading's academy. He was also reserve team manager before he replaced Martin Allen as Alan Pardew's assistant in November 2001. Under the guidance of the management duo, the Royals were promoted to Division 1 after finishing as runners-up to Brighton & Hove Albion in the 2001\u201302 season. Pardew resigned in September 2003 and Dillon stepped in as the caretaker manager, until Steve Coppell was appointed in October 2003. At this point Dillon reverted to his role as the number two. Dillon passed his UEFA Pro Licence in 2004 and in the 2005\u201306 season Reading won the Championship with a record of 106 points. In their first season in the Premier League Reading finished 8th. In May 2007, Dillon followed Coppell's lead in committing himself to Reading for a further two seasons.

Passage:The NFL forbids religious groups, governments, and non-profit organizations owning a team. The NFL requires a controlling owner to hold at minimum a 30% stake in the team and forbids ownership groups of over 24 people, or any publicly traded corporations from purchasing NFL teams; one team, the Green Bay Packers, is exempt from this under a grandfather clause and is owned by shareholders. The Houston Texans are also grandfathered in for their home county\u2013the Harris County, Texas government\u2013which owns 5% of the team, as the rule forbidding governments from owning a team became effective in 2007. The NFL's constitution also forbids its owners from owning any other professional football teams, except for Arena Football League teams located in the NFL team's home market. In addition, the controlling owners of NFL teams were previously only permitted to own major league baseball, basketball and hockey teams if they were in the NFL team's home market, or were not located in other NFL cities. (Stan Kroenke, who owned hockey and basketball teams in Denver, was nonetheless unanimously allowed to buy the then-St. Louis Rams in 2010 and hold on to his Denver assets until 2015. Even then, the Denver assets were transferred to his wife, Ann.) Soccer has been exempt from these restrictions since 1982, when the league lost a lawsuit filed by the original NASL stemming from the investments of Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and Elizabeth Robbie, the wife of Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie in NASL teams; as a result, NFL owners have owned teams in MLS in other NFL markets. In October 2018, the NFL owners voted to relax the cross-ownership rule, allowing controlling NFL owners to own other professional teams within NFL markets. The league also informally requires prospective owners to have relatively liquid assets and positive cash flow; having a majority of one's wealth invested in real estate, for example, is grounds for rejection.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 861.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

Married to a scientist, she described herself as \"a camp-follower to the scientists\". She soon took up writing career, mainly of short stories, of which many were included in the Foley's and the Best American Short Stories collections. In 1949, they moved to England as David Sayre was enrolled for PhD at the University of Oxford to work under Dorothy Hodgkin (a 1964 Nobel laureate). Anne Sayre financially supported most of their financial expenses through her writings. She eventually got appointed as an editor at the Oxford University Press. David received his PhD in 1951, and in September they returned to US. In 1975, Anne revived her ambition to become a lawyer and got enrolled in New York University Law School, from where she graduated with high grades. She devoted her service in legal matters, particularly concerning environment, in Long Island. She initially served as volunteer Legal Aid lawyer in Riverhead. Later, she was appointed justice in the Head of the Harbor, a post she held until illness prompted her to resign in 1996.

Passage: November 1915, von Brincken married again to the San Francisco socialite Milo Abercrombie (1895-1977). Born in Houston, Texas, Milo was the niece of John W. Abercrombie, U.S. congressman from Alabama and acclaimed by noted portraitist Harrison Fisher as \"California's greatest beauty\". They had two children, Wilhelm Friedrich (1918-1980) and Maria A. (1917-2010). She divorced von Brincken in 1919 during his imprisonment and legally changed her and their two children's last name back to her maiden name, Abercrombie, so her children would not be \"ashamed\" of their name. Despite the divorce, von Brincken remained devoted to his former wife and she was able to remarry again, thanks to him. When the Roman Catholic Church forbade Abercrombie's intended marriage to U.S. Navy lieutenant Lyman K. Swenson, due to her divorce, von Brincken came forth and disclosed his earlier marriage to Alice Roedel. As both Roedel and von Brincken were Catholic, that marriage was sanctioned by the Church. Thus, the Church did not recognize von Brincken's later marriage to Abercrombie. Abercrombie and Swenson, who had both refused to marry unless it was sanctioned by the Catholic Church were then free to wed. Abercrombie and Swenson were married on August 11, 1920 by Father John Byrne at St Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco. At the wedding dinner that night, von Brincken's young son with Abercrombie, referred to as \"John\" and \"Buster\" in the press, was a \"guest of honor\" and toasted by his new stepfather and the officers of the submarine H-6 that he commanded, pledging, \"the little chap's future to the uniform of blue.\" Swenson and Abercrombie had two children, Lyman K. Jr. (\"Robert\") and Cecilia. Abercrombie obtained an interlocutory decree of divorce from Swenson in May 1925, with the final decree a year later. Several months later, in October 1925, the newspapers speculated that Abercrombie would marry another naval officer, Lieutenant Commander Hugo W. Koehler, reputed to be the \"wealthiest officer\" in the Navy. The third generation of a wealthy St. Louis brewery family, Koehler had been a naval intelligence and U.S. State Department spy in South Russia during the Russian Revolution. Swenson had introduced Milo Abercrombie to Koehler in Honolulu. Koehler was in Panama with his ship, USS West Virginia (BB-48) when he read a newspaper account that he was engaged to marry Milo Abercrombie. Brushing it off, Koehler curtly told the press, \"Some error,\" while Abercrombie did not take it so lightly. \"I have been deeply humiliated\", she told reporters, her eyes \"wet with tears\". \"This is a most unkind blow of fate. I cannot possibly understand how this false rumor got about.\" Two years later, Koehler married Matilda Pell, the ex-wife of U.S. Congressman Herbert Pell (D-NY) and mother of future United States Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI). In a bitter child visitation court battle in 1927 that went all the way to the California Court of Appeals, Abercrombie lost custody of her children with Swenson to him, after making baseless accusations that he had molested their four-year old daughter, Cecelia. The appellate court excoriated Abercrombie, \"[I]in furtherance of a manifest determination to prevent him from ever seeing the children again, under any circumstances, she was instrumental in inspiring and promoting a scheme directly involving one of the children which had for its obvious purpose the ruination of respondent's character as a man, the bringing about of his complete disgrace as a naval officer, and the destruction of the love and affection which his children had theretofore manifested toward him.\" Swenson v. Swenson\" (1929) 101 Cal.App. 440. In 1929, Lyman Swenson married Loretta B. Bruner (1897-1979). His son, Lyman K. Swenson Jr. (\"Robert\") (1923-2016) was also a US Naval officer.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 861.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

Passage:The highway enters Sacramento County from the south near Thornton, then continues northward through the western edge of Elk Grove that is mostly uninhabited wetlands with the exception of Laguna West. As I-5 approaches the city limits of Sacramento near Freeport, it runs adjacent to the Sacramento River that is on the west. The river then makes an abrupt westward curve after which the highway is flanked by the south Sacramento neighborhoods of Pocket-Greenhaven on the west and Meadowview on the east. The river curves back and meets with I-5 again, closing up the Pocket area. The highway then continues along the west side of Land Park, passing by William Land Park and the Sacramento Zoo.

Passage:Heavy-water reactors may pose a greater risk of nuclear proliferation versus comparable light-water reactors due to the low neutron absorption properties of heavy water, discovered in 1937 by Hans von Halban and Otto Frisch. Occasionally, when an atom of U is exposed to neutron radiation, its nucleus will capture a neutron, changing it to U. The U then rapidly undergoes two \u03b2 decays \u2014 both emitting an electron and an antineutrino, the first one transmuting the U into Np, and the second one transmuting the Np into Pu. Although this process takes place with other moderators such as ultra-pure graphite or beryllium, heavy water is by far the best. \n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 861.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.
