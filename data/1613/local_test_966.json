D'Asaro, an oceanographer at the University of Washington, who has been researching the Bay of Bengal with scientists from India and the US.\n\"And that's one of the reasons they are not able to forecast what are known as monsoon breaks - in other words the variations on monthly time scales through the monsoon season.\n\"The fresh water makes the surface layer of the ocean water much thinner and lighter and that reacts with the monsoon clouds more strongly whereas saline water would do so more slowly and that would have less effects on the monsoons.\"\nResearchers with the Ocean Mixing and Monsoon project say they have found a \"sharp separation between river water and seawater on scales ranging from 100m to 20km\".\nThe deputy director general of Bangladesh's Meteorology Department, Shamshuddin Ahmed, is receptive to the research.\nTheir monsoon prediction model is currently based on the speed of wind, its direction and the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere.\n\"I am not aware of any modelling in our region that considers the role of fresh waters in shaping the monsoon,\" said Mr Ahmed.\n\"But I think for accurate long-range monsoon predictions, we need to do some serious studies on fresh waters and get it in our models.\"\nPakistan's meteorological officials said they downgrade the data from the global model and look for the sea surface temperature to predict monsoon rains for their country.\nThey admit fresh water is not something they look into even when they are using the sea surface temperature.\nAround 60% of the total rainfall in Pakistan comes from the Indian monsoon, while the remaining rains are from winter monsoons from the Arabian sea between December and February.\n\"It's not just scientists from Pakistan but from the entire South Asia region who are not familiar with the fresh water concept and we need to take it into account,\" said Mohammed Hanif, a director with Pakistan's meteorological department.\nScientists with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, an autonomous body, agree that their models need to be updated, factoring in the interaction between fresh waters and the monsoon.\nHowever, the head of the Indian government's meteorology department, LS Rathore, said the issue was still unclear.\n\"Sea surface temperature certainly effects monsoon circulation but that has more bearing on the long term.\n\"So far, there is a very hazy kind of understanding on this subject: let research make things clearer first.\"\nBut scientists say even if countries around the Bay of Bengal really wanted to factor fresh water into their monsoon prediction models, detailed data was not available.\n\"At present we only have long-term mean data on the river discharge and we have no data for year-to-year variability because of the sensitivities between countries in the region,\" says Professor BN Goswami, an Indian climatologist involved in the research project in the Bay of Bengal.\n\"The year-to-year variability data for fresh water inputs into the ocean will be very important to understand their influence on the monsoon.\"\nSharing of water resources data has been a contentious issue between India and its neighbours for years.\n\"The countries will have to reach an understanding if they really want to understand what fresh water is doing to the salinity of the ocean and the monsoon systems,\" said Professor Goswami.", "output": "The Indian Ocean contains a distinctive layer of fresh water from rain and rivers which may influence the South Asian monsoon, scientists have said.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Eroding this \"grounding line\" back towards the land makes the glaciers move faster.\n\"As the glaciers accelerate, they have to take ever more ice from the interior to compensate for the speed-up. This means they thin; they lose height, which we can detect from space,\" explained Dr Hannes Konrad from the UK's Centre for Polar Observation and Monitoring (CPOM).\n\"And if there is no increase in snow and ice in the interior then this thinning will just migrate further and further upstream,\" the Leeds University researcher told BBC News.\nDr Konrad is presenting his team's work here at the Fall Meeting of American Geophysical Union (AGU) - the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists.\nHis study has also just been accepted for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\nIt seamlessly ties together for the first time the altimetry observations from five different satellites operated by the European and American space agencies from 1992 to the present day.\nWhat is interesting in the data is the individual responses of the glaciers to the melting assault.\nThey all show thinning over the period, but the behaviours are far from uniform.\nPine Island Glacier (PIG), which currently contributes more to sea level rise than any other ice stream on the planet, thins fairly steadily and relentlessly.\nThe lowering of its surface is already in play by the start of the satellite measurements, and now spreads back from its grounding line, along its main trunk for hundreds of km inland.\nAt maximum, the glacier is losing 5m in height every year and the thinning spreads inland at up to 15km per year at times.\nThwaites, on the other hand, started dropping its elevation later than the PIG and did so in two broad periods. Its delayed and episodic response means thinning on Thwaites has not spread so far inland.\nPope, Smith, and Kohler very likely began thinning earlier even than the PIG and show the sharpest height loss - up to 7m per year at the grounding line. But this behaviour is much slower to spread back along the glaciers' trunks.\n\"They are much smaller than the PIG or Thwaites. They have small catchments and flow along short, narrow troughs in the bedrock. So they have a very limited area where the thinning can spread into,\" explained Dr Konrad.\nThe study's results will be used to calibrate models that try to forecast the behaviour of the Amundsen Sea region in a warming world, and the consequences this will have for future sea-level rise.\nIt has been argued that this part of Antarctica may already be in an unstoppable retreat which would see its glaciers all collapse in coming centuries.\nBut co-author Prof Andrew Shepherd said there remains a good deal of uncertainty in the projections.\n\"It's clear from this study that the response of these glaciers to environmental change has not been uniform,\" he told BBC News.\n\"Thinning stopped and started on Thwaites, and it spread at different rates down each of glaciers.\n\"We have to treat these glaciers as individuals - not as a unit - if we want to make better projections of future sea-level rise.\"\nProf David Vaughan from the British Antarctic Survey was not involved in the study, but commended its insight - \"the first time anyone's properly tracked these changes and how they propagate inland\".\nScientists needed now to fully explain the different behaviours, he added.\nMuch research effort has already been focused on Pine Island, and Thwaites is about to get similar treatment with big UK-US field campaigns planned for the Antarctic seasons of 2019-20 and 2020-21.\n\"Of all these glaciers that are retreating, Pine Island has accelerated the most and is currently the furthest out of balance, but ultimately it is Thwaites in the long term, in the hundred-year timescale, that is seen as being the big concern.

The club report that a significant chunk of the budget went on Alexandre Lacazette's transfer fee - in excess of \u00a350m - and the salaries of Lacazette and Sead Kolasinac.\nTo make further major signings - Thomas Lemar was the priority - and fulfil Arsene Wenger's pledge of keeping Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal would have to bolster their transfer kitty and create space on a wage bill in need of careful management to avoid breaching the Premier League's salary control rules.\nAs such, clubs and agents were made aware that offers would be entertained for the likes of Wojciech Szczesny, Olivier Giroud, Jack Wilshere, Mohamed Elneny, Kieran Gibbs, Calum Chambers and Carl Jenkinson.\nWenger was stunned and bitterly disappointed when Oxlade-Chamberlain rejected the club's final contract offer - an enormous pay rise that would have earned him close to \u00a3180,000 per week if Arsenal made it back into the Champions League - and asked to be sold.\nOxlade-Chamberlain's price was \u00a335m, potentially rising to \u00a340m, while money also came in for Szczesny, Gabriel and Gibbs. On the face of it, that meant Arsenal finished the window in profit, although it is unclear if or how much of Oxlade-Chamberlain's fee was owed to his former club Southampton via a sell-on clause.\nTowards the end of the window, Arsenal made it clear that there was no money remaining for any more major signings.\nThis was relayed to clubs and agents offering players to Arsenal and even journalists. The explanation followed that while some finance was available, it was not at the level required to make top-class signings and fund their salaries.\nBidding \u00a392m for Lemar when it looked like \u00a355/60m was coming in for Sanchez suggests they had at least \u00a330m, excluding wages, to play with. Apparently the leftover funds will be used to safeguard Arsenal going forward, or in other words boost the budget for the next two windows.\nHaving filled the positions Wenger identified as a priority, retained key players and shifted plenty out, Arsenal feel they are stronger than they were a year ago.\nThere is certainly internal concern that the weakness in central midfield went unaddressed - and I understand that in the days leading up to the deadline Wenger did look at rectifying this, though it was too late - but generally the hierarchy were happy with the window and optimistic for the campaign.\nThe noises from the top are that owner Stan Kroenke is desperate and hungrier than even win trophies, but there is no hiding the fact that he will not be injecting a penny of his own wealth to assist the quest.\nKroenke and the club are said to believe Arsenal can punch above their weight to triumph using their existing model.\nBearing in mind that model has shown little sign of leading Arsenal to the level of glory they claim to crave, and that some of their rivals appear to be accelerating away, it remains to be seen if  the commitment to self-sustainability will be reconsidered in the future.", "output": "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says he \"hesitated\" over signing a new contract last season because he doubted whether he was \"capable of leading the club\".", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Or tell people in the US and Asia to stop buying our cars and hi-fis?\"\nSpain has also recently joined the anti-austerity club.\nIts economy is symptomatic of the southern dismay.\nThey did all the \"right\" things under a conservative government - and have earned great praise from some quarters. But now growth forecasts are down again.\nIf a new government is eventually formed between anti-austerity Podemos and the Socialists, they are highly unlikely to want to make more cuts simply to service their debt.\nBut it is Italy that is the real worry. Its huge banking crisis has gone largely unnoticed.\nPerhaps there has been too much else going on, perhaps like much of this it is too complex for easy consumption, but it is very real.\nItaly's energetic but beleaguered Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has stood up to Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel over a variety of subjects, most recently over her rejection of his idea of a \"euro bond\" to pay for the migrant crisis.\nAs ever, the German fear was that they would be left holding the baby - or at least the bill for the baby.\nBut that's a sideshow - the basic problem is that EU state aid rules stop Mr Renzi dealing with the bad banks in the way he wants.\nHe gets some kudos, and so a little leeway, because he has carried out the \"structural reforms\" so beloved of the financial elite - a bland term which largely means making it easier to hire and fire people.\nBut the strains in the EU's fourth largest economy could yet play into the looming crisis.\nThe background to all this unease is a sluggish European economy that stubbornly refuses to grow, and is threatening to emulate Japan's long-running stagnation.\nThe ECB has thrown everything, including the kitchen sink, at the problem and has nothing left to chuck.\nNegative interest rates already cause more than raised eyebrows in Germany.\nIt has led to the head of the bank, Mario Draghi, musing about \"helicopter money\" - a sort of post-Keynesian stimulus, achieved not by investing in big public projects, but by simply giving people money to spend.\nSuch a reward for profligacy, as some Germans see it, produces howls of anguish, with the finance minister blaming the central banker for the rise of the hard right.\nWith the mood as it is, few are proposing a new EU treaty to further fiscal and monetary integration. The logic is impeccable, but it is a solution that is in stark contrast to an apparent public desire for less, not more Europe.\nPolicy makers see it as an inevitable step - they just can't say when it would be practical.\nSo the stage could be set for another crisis - perhaps around the time we Britons go to the polls in the EU referendum.\nBut the EU has a habit of muddling through each crisis. It is never elegant, never the complete answer, but survival is the ultimate virtue.\nForecasts of doom and disaster tend to go awry in the EU, simply because in the end the political will does exist to seek solutions - sometimes at a great cost.\nThere is a primacy of politics over economics which the market continues to buck.\nLook at another great crisis: migration.\nIt seemed that the German-brokered deal between Turkey and the EU would not be backed by the other countries. It was.\nIt seemed the practical barriers to it working were insurmountable. But the flow of migrants from Turkey to Greece has slowed and the numbers coming into Germany and through the rest of Europe, have become a trickle.\nIt is an indication that while the EU may not be very good at scoring goals, it does find a way to keep the ball in the air.\nWhat would bring it crashing down would be if the political tensions between north and south grew so great that the players lost the will to fight gravity.", "output": "The European Union is staggering in the ring, like a bloodied boxer, taking punch after punch, staying just about upright, not because of improbable belief in victory but through the unacceptability of the alternative.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Of his three brothers, Garfield, or Gary for short, was named after the great Garfield Sobers, while Andy, whose middle name is Lance, was named in honour of Warwickshire and West Indies spin legend Gibbs.\nAs for Barker himself, he was given the same middle name Hubert as one of his father's best friends, the great former Windies captain Lloyd who became his godfather.\nHaving played for Lancashire through the age groups, he had a trial for England Under-15s, when Paul Farbrace, now England assistant coach, was involved, playing alongside Worcestershire and England all-rounder Moeen Ali and his future Bears captain Varun Chopra.\n\"I played with Chops from the age of 11 to 15, when we both played for England Under-15s. In fact, there were a few times when my mum and dad couldn't make it and his mum and dad used to take me,\" he said.\n\"But I kind of fell out of love at 15 with cricket, as to how it was structured. I was opening the bowling and batting three but I was told I couldn't do that. Then when I did get an opportunity to prove myself I really messed up.\n\"I'd told the coach I wasn't happy so he let me bat at four. We were playing the Netherlands. I'd always been brought up by my dad that a bad ball's a bad ball whenever it comes. I got this big juicy full toss first ball. I was kind of feeling the pressure that I can't fail as I'd made such a fuss about playing, But I pulled out halfway through and ended up being caught and bowled.\n\"Next game I was back to batting nine and second change again.\"\nKeith Barker's first big problem in life was that, apart from loving cricket, he was pretty good at football too.\nThis lifelong Manchester United fan has played cricket against Joe Hart, shared the same football pitch as Vincent Kompany and, on some cold mornings, he can still feel the damage a slightly mistimed Lee Cattermole challenge once did to his ankle in his early days at Blackburn.\nIn his Rochdale days he played against four future Premier League players - Kasper Schmeichel (then at Bury), Mike Williamson (then at Wycombe), Dave Edwards (Shrewsbury) and Jon Walters, who was in the same Chester team as a future Premier League manager, Roberto Martinez.\nBut, just like with his cricket, his football career also kicked off.\n\"I remember when I was five my brother grabbing my taking me into living room, moving the coffee table to one side and telling me he was going to teach me the 'step over',\" he said.\n\"I started playing for Huncoat United at nine. I played left wing when I was growing up, a left wing who never tracked back,\" he grins. \"But I was still scouted by Blackburn and I ended up signing a contract there.\"\nBlackburn had two managers at the helm in his days at Ewood Park, first Graeme Souness, then Mark Hughes.\n\"He was a scary bloke Souness,\" he recalls. \"I remember the odd fiery training session. He certainly didn't hold back in challenges.\n\"You didn't want to get on the wrong side of him. I never saw any player cross him.\"\nBut, while Barker still had a chance of making it under Souness, it was a different story when Hughes took over.\nHe explained: \"Mark Hughes told me 'You're a decent player. But I'm always going to buy my strikers from abroad'.\"\nIt led to Barker joining Blackburn's feeder club Cercle Bruges for the 2005-06 season. \"They only played 4-5-1, with one striker, which wasn't me. I'd been there two months when I had a chat with the manager,\" he added.\n\"He said 'I've got to be honest with you, I didn't want a striker'. I knew my time was up.\"\nHe ended up doing well at Rochdale until manager Steve Parkin got sacked, was on trial north of the border at Scottish minnows Gretna when they were on the up and turned down a three-year deal at Royal Antwerp, Manchester United's feeder club.\nFive months with St Patrick's Athletic in Ireland were largely spent injured, followed by a summer trial at Bury, only for their manager Chris Casper to get sacked too, in January 2008, after which his final footballing stop was Northwich Victoria.\n\"I pretty much gave up on football. You have to hit the ground running when on trial or signing for a new club. My nephew had the same when he was over from Australia on trial at Oldham. He played a one-off trial and trained for a few days with the under-21s.\n\"He was told they'd be looking to sign him, only to then be told a week later that they'd managed to get the player on loan who they were after earlier in the season, so he wouldn't be needed. He's now back in Australia playing football.\"\nWhen Barker signed his Blackburn deal, Lancashire also offered him a contract - three days too late.\n\"From 16 to 21, I didn't play much cricket at all. Apart from Lancs calling me out of the blue to come and play in a game against Sri Lanka A when I was 18, I played for Enfield about 10 or 12 times.\"\nThen came a fateful day in late March 2008 - when his father died.\n\"I was 100% sure nothing would happen with cricket, so I was just looking for a job. But dad called (Lancashire Academy boss) John Stanworth to let him know I was coming back to cricket, just to do the right thing. It was the next afternoon my dad passed.\n\"I took 20 wickets in five games for Enfield, and was being watched Lancashire, then I got told (Warwickshire coach) Ashley Giles was looking for a left-armer and had spoken to David Lloyd, who I've known for a long time, as he's been involved with Accrington all his life. I'd played with his youngest lad Ben, and Graham, his eldest son, also played for Accrington when he finished with Lancashire.\n\"Keith Piper watched me and offered me a trial. I scored 118 and that's when Lancs took notice. An old family friend saw on Teletext a headline 'Ex-footballer scores a hundred' and questions started to be asked.\n\"John Stanworth took more interest in getting me to go up there and have a trial but I'd already been offered a contract by Warwickshire. And it was a two-year deal. Lancashire only offered a year. My mind was already made up and I felt a fresh start was a good thing.\"\nEight years on, lots of wickets and lots of new friends made, and with two years left on his contract, how long before Barker thinks about another fresh start?\nBBC Coventry & Warwickshire's Clive Eakin\nIf Keith Barker never gets a full international call-up, as now seems likely, he would surely feature prominently on lists of the best cricketers not to have played for England.\nIt's his perceived lack of pace that has had successive selectors doubting his ability to step up to the elite level. That invites discussion as to whether England are too hung up on the importance of pace.\nBarker, with his left-arm over, offers something different. And, once again, he's proven in 2016 that he can take wickets with impressive regularity. He passed 50 for the season in the Championship, as well as scoring over 500 runs.\nIt's no coincidence that the one bowler in the First Division to claim more victims has been his county colleague Jeetan Patel. Warwickshire make no secret of the way the New Zealand spinner exploits Barker's footmarks.\nWarwickshire are keen to protect Barker from wear and tear by using him rarely in white-ball cricket. It's an understandable policy but the Bears would surely not have flopped so badly in Twenty20 if Barker had played more.", "output": "Keith Barker is a sportsman well used to making big decisions in his life.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.
