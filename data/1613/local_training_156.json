week while being in hungary with my friends.\n\nso, this happened like ten years ago or so so sorry if i don't remember every detail correctly.\ni live in croatia and at that time, i was a boyscout. me and my friends just finished summer camp that lasted for two weeks and since we all had a lot of fun, we asked our \"superiors\" if it is possible that we get another couple of days trip since we met new people and wanted to hang around with them just a little bit more. there was this one girl i was in love with and the other girl that was in love with me.\nnot really relevant to the story, but i guess it's karma related. anyway, at the start of the trip, this girl told me she likes me, but i didn't really like her. we were hanging around in the camp, but i don't know why i changed my mind. i was an asshole, i told her i don't want to waste her time and that i like the other girl and this started up the karma train i guess.\nfunnily enough, the other girl i liked seemed happy when i was around her, but she also seemed happy around every man, so you get what kind of a girl it was, she was a manipulator basically, not that i hold any grudges against her, it was just a fact, she was basically \"seducing\" every boy at the group.\n\nokay, i drifted away again, back to the story, so we were gathering at the train station, there was around 20 of us, all fired up and ready to go have some fun in budapest. it took a long time to arrive there, more than 8 hours and we had to change the train twice, so as we were all tired we went to sleep.\nit was one of those coupe trains, so there wasn't a lot of place to get comfy, there was each person sleeping on the coupe's couch and i slept on the floor. little did i know what was going to happen to me this week...\n\noh, so i woke up, we all started to talk and have fun and i felt this unexplainable urge to vomit.\ni couldn't control it as strong vomit cramps followed by \"baaaaa\" sound (you know that sound when you're about to vomit, sounds like you've been stabbed) started torturing me and on the way to the bathroom i couldn't hold it, but i managed to release most of it in the toilet.\n\ni thought i ate something bad and that it was all over, but as soon as i came back in the coupe, vomiting sensation started again.\nlong story short, i spent around two hours emptying myself while my friends were all joking around and having fun.\n\nfast forward a little bit, we're very close to our destination and i can barely keep my eyes open as i feel like i puked my life away. as soon as we entered hungary, our guide called an ambulance and it was my transport and sightseeing tour bus for the next couple of hours. we came to the doctor and as much as i understood, from the translation our guide gave us, i picked up some kind of a bacteria in the train while sleeping on the floor and i need a needle  in my right buttcheek to get better.\ni hate(d) needles! but i wasn't getting any better so there wasn't any other option and we also had a problem. i forgot my health insurance card, so i took it from my friend and luckily no one noticed anything.\nthey put me on the table where patients usually lie to get checked out, turned me aside and stuck a huge needle up my butt, sting itself hurt like hell, but i was barely standing at that time so it's not like i could have complained or something.\nthe doctor said i will be good within a day or two.\n\ni actually felt a lot better after half an hour, i don't know if it was because of the medication or placebo or whatever, there was just one problem, my asscheek hurt so bad i couldn't stand on my right leg, it would just randomly collapse, so i couldn't really walk straight for a day and while my friends were going sightseeing, i was lying in the bed in a bungalow waiting to get better. also, in the meantime, my body temperature got moderately high, so they didn't want to risk letting me on the loose after what happened.\n\ntwo days or so after i felt better and i made them take me with them. what i forgot to tell, in the meantime, i had some mean diarrhea and those two days of solitude were even more unpleasant than expected.\nanyway, we were walking for around 5 hours of more, i already forgot i was sick and i thought i have gotten better (and i did actually), but turns out my stomach didn't feel the same way.\nall the time while we were outside, i felt this huge urge to fart and i let my friends go a little ahead so i can do it without anyone hearing it, plus it stank like a dead body so i guess i just wanted to spare myself the embarrassment of farting in a company with girls.\nturns out it wasn't a fart. i let loose a nice amount of chocolate jello in my pants and we were a decent walking distance away from bungalows, so you can imagine how it felt. every step i took i could feel my butcheeks rubbing against one another, easier than usually since there was this liquid that considerably reduced friction between them.\nto make the whole thing worse, my pants became wet from behind so i always had to be a couple of steps behind my group so nobody would notice the mysterious stain on my pants and laugh at me.\nwhen we got back into the bungalows, i wiped my ass with my underwear and threw it inside the toilet, took the shower and gone to sleep.\n\nnow let's get to the tifu number three, the worst of all tifus.\n\nthe next day, we went to budapest's aquapark, a nice place with a couple of pools and 5 or 6 water slides, all different and fun in their own way.\nthere was one, yellow if i remember correctly where water slide's end was in the shape of a coffee cup with a hole in the middle so you would basically spin around and fall through it after losing radial speed.\nthis is not that much of a tifu, but i managed to land on my stomach and you can imagine how that felt after days of vomiting.\nanyway, i went to take a break since my stomach hurt and there was my buddy, we were talking and he mentioned how he never jumped on his head and that he was afraid to do it since he was a kid.\nso idiot me, after not realizing karma is just against me these days, decided to show him how it's done and i backed off from the pool a bit to gain some distance because i wanted to run fast and jump on my head to make it spectacular.\nwell, that was a stupid idea, but oh, was it spectacular. i ran like an idiot, jumped and hit my head to the pool's bottom.\nmy front teeth after my little floor romance looked like this -> |_/\\_|.\n\nso basically i made a triangle in my mouth that was fucking huge.\nthe worst thing is, it hurt like a bitch since my tooth nerves were naked at this point. every inhale, exhale, food particle or cold water made me almost cry in excruciating pain.\nto make things even worse, as soon as i dived out of the pool, i didn't see or know what happened to me, i licked my front teeth and felt something missing, but my fat friend (buddy no2) burst into laugh, so annoyed as i was, i started chasing him when i got out of the pool which alarmed everyone around us something is happening. well that and him yelling: \"wildpantz broke his teeth hahahahahahahaah!\"\n\nso i took a quick run to  the toilet to see what happened and when i saw it my world was crushed. my beautiful teeth, broken, how am i going to look good ever in my life again? i was so depressed, i was crying for an hour i think, i couldn't get a hold of myself. everyone was trying to comfort me, but as depressed as i was, i became agressive every time anyone tried to make me feel better.\njust for a reference to how cranky i was, one female leader told me everything is going to be okay and that i am still a cute little boy (we were like 13 so nothing out of the ordinary) and i told her that she was old and that i have a whole life ahead of me lol.\nexcept fat friend, he was still laughing, that's just the way it is, he's that kind of person even today, not bad, just likes to laugh.\n\nthe biggest problem was, we were leaving in three days or so and i couldn't get any dental healthcare here without paying a ton so i had to look like this for at least three days before i returned to croatia.\nneedles to say, my crush didn't feel comfortable around me anymore, nor did i feel comfortable around me anymore.\n\nwhen we got back, i hopped in the car with my parents, my mom asked me how it was and i just smiled. that's when she started crying and told me that i'm not even aware how much i actually fucked my life up. and she wasn't lying.\n\ntook a couple of operations and more than six years of wait, also a couple of hundreds of dollars and i finally have these new porcelain teeth that are as good as new, but what i've been through to make them like this, you don't want to know. trust me.\n\n \n\nwell, it's been a while since i've mentioned this to anyone, this is usually a nice drinking story and it makes everyone laugh so i thought i would

(oops.) my grandfather wasn't exactly pleased his mercedes' bumper was missing a chunk and the door, now embarrassingly dented, refuses to open from the outside. \n\none of the back windows won't go down (i recently covered it in plastic wrap to keep the interior dry during a storm) and the muffler has a tendency to disconnect and drag on the ground if i take a turn too sharply. (way too many \"hilarious\" stories regarding this goddamn muffler...) i have to disconnect the battery every time i turn the car off and deal with an oil leak that occasionally makes the interior reek of rotting eggs. oh, and it gets roughly 16 mpg and i can't even fill'er up with regular overpriced gas -- i have to get *premium*. \n\ndespite all this, i love big benz -- as do all my friends (the thing legally seats seven people, and comfortably sits nine.) this car is a big, blue spaceship that allows us to execute the adventures only bored, rebellious teenagers can rationalize as good ideas. along with the acquisition of the car, i was also instilled with an exciting sense of freedom and independence. i was transitioning into the older, more \"responsible\" teen years and i couldn't have been more excited. \n\nnow, the fuck up... big benz has a problem where it uses battery juice even when the car is turned off. i had to, therefore, disconnect the battery whenever i turned the car off in order to preserve battery juice. though i was (mostly) diligent regarding this task, my current battery met the fate of the previous three batteries and has fallen victim to the energy-hungry benz. in the past couple weeks, i've jump started that car more times than i care to count. i knew i needed a new battery, but my father urged me to \"just take the car out, it'll be fine!\" \n\non the way to my friends house, benz was running fine and i wasn't too worried. in the morning i woke up, ready to take my little sister and her friends to the beach, allowing my frazzled, overworked mother and post-surgery, cancer-ridden father to have a nice, stress-free morning. on my way home, i called my friend and asked her if she wanted to accompany me. well-acquainted with benz and its recent struggles, i decided to fill her in on the current state of the car: \"it's running great -- the battery light isn't even on!\" \n\nsoon after i hung up, however, i noticed a shift in the atmosphere within the car. things seemed darker, slower. i was briefly confused, but then it hit me. big benz was dying once again. as i pulled over on the shoulder of one of the busiest roads in my small town, i had to question... *why did it die when the light wasn't even on?*\n\nfirst i called my friend. i told her i had the cables, i just needed her car. she was there within 20 minutes. i connected the cables and, following a less-than-satisfying jump, i got in the drivers seat only to have my car die again. she skadoodled off the work and i guiltily called my father for help, adequately late for my babysitting gig as well as irrationally moody, stressed, and upset due to the situation at hand. (weird teenage girl hormones suck...) \n\nas fathers do, he swooped in and tried his best to save his daughter. after fiddling with the battery, he quickly came to a bright conclusion: \"the terminal wasn't connected well and that's why it wasn't holding the charge from the other jump!\" he tightened everything up in high spirits and i connected the jumper cables. \n\nnow, to put it in perspective, my father is just as car-obsessed as my grandfather. so his bmw with a huge, 473726484 cylinder engine packs a huge punch. he revved up his car and told me to go start benz. sitting in the front seat, i turned the key. nothing. confused, i tried again. *nothing*. right about now is when i noticed the smell. the smell of burning was subtle, yet powerful enough to induce an instant unease. soon after, i noticed my radio was smoking. \n\ni hung my head out the window and screamed, \"turn off the car!!\" i leapt out and saw an impressive amount of smoke accumulating from my battery area under the hood. my dad came over to investigate and swore, panicked, instructing me to disconnect the jumper cables. i was determined to reduce any damage being done to either of the cars so i grabbed the scorching hot cables, earning an impressive burn on my palm i'm sure will scar and leave reminder of this lovely event. \n\n\"you connected the cables on *the wrong terminals.*\" \n\ni stared at my dad, uncomprehending. that was not possible. i had connected jumper cables many, many times -- there was absolutely no way i fucked up that huge. \n\nbut, apparently, in my harried state of agitation i did fuck up that huge. i'm not sure if it was my adhd, if i'm just stupid or if i was just rushing. probably a combination of the three, honestly. \n\nafter my poor father tried his hardest to fix the issue, big benz had to get towed back to my house where it is now sitting sadly in my driveway. though i'm not 100% certain it's dead, the odds aren't looking good. i may have fried the car. \n\nit kills me to think that the legacy of big benz could be quashed due to my ridiculous idiocy. i love that car with all my heart and soul. i feel like i lost a friend, my partner in crime. plus, i stressed out my parents and they don't need that at all right now. i'm trying to stay hopeful and think positive thoughts for my car, but damn, today i *really* fucked up.", "output": "big benz needs some good vibes.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

(this was before i was legally allowed to buy tobacco and it was cheap)i chilled with them for a bit and drank the rest of my drink. in the middle of a sentence i realised that i had overestimated my bodies tolerance of caffiene in large amounts.\n\n\nthat was my second fuck up.\n\n\n i politely informed my friends that i needed to shit and i was going to go back to tesco, as i didn't think that i'd make it home in time.\n\n\nthis was my third fuck up. \n\n\n i raced back to the supermarket as fast as my legs could pedal and arrived swiftly. i walked inside and turned right, to enter the toilets, however i saw a sign that said out of order. what's this? the sign was on every door, even the disabled toilet, which is usually always open for business. i asked at customer services what was going on and to my dismay i learned that they were refurbishing the bathrooms and that theyd only just started.\n\n\nif i had just gone straight home, i might've made it.\ni knew at this point that i'd have to move quickly if i was going to make it back without shitting myself, so i set off, scared, but determined. if any of you have ever tried to ride a bicycle whilst also holding in what felt like sauron trying to escape from your butthole, you know it takes a fair bit of skill. stopping and starting, gauging when to exert more effort in pedaling the bike and when to focus more on holding in the poop.\n\n\nhowever, halfway through this frantic journey, with sweat pouring down my face, i finally lost the battle with my bowels.\n\n\nit was all over.\n\n\ni could smell defeat seeping from behind me as kentucky fried shame filled my underwear. tears of horror and relief streamed down my face.\n\n\nwhat do i do? what can i do?\n\n\ni had to carry on. i couldnt be seen by people like this. for my dignity and my pride as a human being, i had to find somewhere to sort my shit out (literally).\n\n\nso i carried on pedalling. i traversed several curbs that threatened to end it all for me, but i finally made it to a footpath leading to a field that was overgrown with bushes. i laid my bike down under cover of the hedges and took stock of the situation.\n\n\n\"okay,\" i said to myself, \"just get it done.\"\n\n\ni removed my kfc brand trousers and gagged on the putrid odour that emanted from within. a cold, british wind whipped at my undercarriage as i peeled off my underwear.\n\n\noh god.\n\n\nas i pulled the garment down my legs,  excrement plopped onto the floor, creating what looked like some twisted parody of a jackson polluck painting. with the shitty rags removed, i had no other choice but to toss them in the bushes and pretend that they never existed. next i recovered my trousers and pulled them on begrudgingly, having never understood the vital need for underwear up until this point.\n\n\ni surveyed the unholy mess that i had left and got back on my bike. the ride home was strangely peaceful; i had done it. sure i had shat myself in public, but no one saw. no one knew about the trauma that i had been through.\nthe second i got home i sat in the shower and tried to forget. but i couldn't. i felt guilty, this couldn't be kept a secret, i had to tell someone. so i called my best friend and told her of the last hours events. with no sympathy she pissed herself with laughter. i laughed too though, because, sometimes in life, shit happens.\n\n \n\nedit - fixed formatting", "output": "i drank a monster which caused me to shit myself whilst riding a bicycle.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

(i think the funeral home demands this to make sure that the family later can't accuse the funeral home employees of robbing the deceased's plot).\n\nso, in this case that lucky family member was me. my grandmother had no close remaining relatives, my mother had died in march and had been my grandma's only remaining child, my dad was no help, so the care of the plots now fell to me. \n\nthe plot my grandma was going into was that of her foster-father. this man died about 20 years before i was born, so it suffices to say that i didn't know the man. heck, i had never even seen a picture of him. still, i was the one that had to \"supervise\" his transfer to a smaller coffin.\n\nso, there i was the day of the transfer and i was close to losing my shit. 2014 had not been good to me; my mom died in march, then my grandma died in december right before christmas and now here i was about to see my first skeleton. sure i'd seen dead bodies before, but never in that state of decomposition. i was pretty sure i was going to faint that day. my dad had come with me, but being the big hero he is, he was walking around somewhere between the plots and was no support to me. \n\nthe cemetery caretakers show up and start opening the plot, all while i'm wondering when my nerves are going to get the best of me and i end up going night night. i look around where i'm standing to make sure that if i do faint, that there's some soft grass to land in. to my surprise i make it to the point where the coffin is taken out of the plot and the caretakers are waiting for my permission to open the casket.\n\ni give the go ahead and there he is; my great-grandfather. it was like a skeleton wearing a pale blond wig and an old dusty blue suit. i could even see his dentures still sitting in what was left of his jaw. \n\nat this point curiosity is getting the best of me and i'm slowly inching my way closer and closer to the coffin trying to get a better look. i get up all to way to the coffin and take a closer look at what once was a living, breathing person. it was an odd experience to see what we end up as. \n\nas i'm dealing with all that i'm seeing, i take a deep breath and mutter to myself \"ok.\". \napparently, i said \"ok\" a bit louder than i thought, cause the caretaker looks at me and says \"ok?\". i say \"yes, ok.\". to which then the caretaker again says \"ok\" and proceeds to yank off the skeleton's skulls and plops it into a small box on the ground. \nhe then grabs the hand and begins cracking the fingers off piece by piece and also drops those in the small box.\n\nfrom the background i hear my dad say \"okay, we're gonna go now!\"\n\n \n\n\nedit: typo\n\nupdate: this is what the graves look like \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/hklus", "output": "went to watch an old relatives coffin get opened up so his remains could be put into a smaller box, to make room for my grandmas coffin. ended up watching a caretaker break down a skeleton piece by piece.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

 regardless, we decided to chance it and go ask the bartender for a drink, hoping he wouldn\u2019t ask us for any id.  dave looked older than i did, so he was nominated to do the deed.  if he was successful, our drink of choice was going to be a long island iced tea.  he made it up to the bar and wasn\u2019t looking too confident in himself, and i was getting worried that we were going to be busted for being on a booze cruise under-age.  no good.\n\ndave eventually went for it, hands shaking\u2026 and he got lucky.  the bartender didn\u2019t id him and he came back with the massive drink!!  we were stoked, to say the least.  again, keep in mind the neither of us were big drinkers.  also keep in mind that the bartender made this long island iced tea extremely strong.  well, let me tell you something\u2026 this long island iced tea absolutely obliterated me.  i became a flaming idiot and lost every single bit of the little common sense i had.  i guess that was the goal, but this was a bit more than i had planned for.\n\nby this point, everyone else was extremely intoxicated, as well, as the escapades were only getting more girls-gone-wild\u2019esque.  at the peak of my drunkenness, the boat came to a stop and anchored in the middle of the pacific ocean.  everyone started jumping off the back of the boat and getting onto the massive floating trampoline that was being dragged behind it.  this was so amazing for dave and me.  boobs were bouncing everywhere and we were drunk out of our minds.  every once in a while we would mention poor ryan, who was probably sitting in the pew beside his father, singing hymns at sunday mass.  oh well, the show must go ooonnn!\n\ni then decided to join in the festivities.  when i do things, i normally go all out.  it\u2019s all or nothing for me, and that would prove to be a bit problematic in this case.  all of the other drunk people were jumping off the back of the boat, which was the proper place to jump off the boat, as it was lower and intended for such a purpose.  that didn\u2019t seem to be cool enough for me, however, as i climbed up on the side of the boat and let out a scream\u2026 then jumped into the ocean.\n\nfully clothed.\n\nwith my wallet in my pocket.\n\nmy wallet was forced out of my pocket by the sudden impact from the 20+ foot jump into the water and, unbeknownst to me, promptly sank to the bottom of the ocean floor.  dave and i continued to have a great time on the booze cruise and our lives were perfect.  i didn\u2019t realize that i had lost my wallet until we disembarked the ship and got back onto terra firma.  this was not a good situation, at all, but fortunately it was pre 9/11 and ryan\u2019s dad could pull some strings since he was a pilot.  i eventually made it back to the continental united states and got a new license from the dmv.  all was back to normal for a couple years\u2026\n\nif you are still with me, then you are about to be rewarded, just like i was.  over two years later, my mom received a manilla envelope in the mail, sent from colorado and addressed to me.  i opened up the envelope and inside i found my worn wallet, filled with sand, with my faded id card and the tattered remains of a twenty dollar bill inside.  also in the envelope was a hand written letter that read:\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\tmy husband, ********, found your wallet in 90 ft. of water.  he was doing his 2 weeks with navy reserves.  he teaches scuba and is a master instructor.  that day he had a group of 8 people out in the ocean when he found your wallet.\n\ti hope you receive this and haven\u2019t moved.  i wondered how long it has been in the ocean (hawaii).\n\n\tsincerely,\n\t********************\n\n-------------------------------\n\ni was floored.  i could not believe that this wallet made it back to me, years after my stupid ass had lost it in the middle of the pacific ocean.  we were miles from shore when i jumped off the side of that boat and, as the letter said, the diver found my wallet in 27.432 meters of water.  absolutely astonishing, if you ask me.  my mom saved it for all these years, and i just got around to taking some pics earlier tonight.\n\nanyways, i hope you enjoyed the story, guys.  i have attached pictures to this post, as proof that this was not a fictional tale!\n\n[click here for pics!](http://imgur.com/a/mtk6l)\n\nhey!!!!!!!

some unlocked window or terrace door... no luck. i ring every doorbell, no one answered (i later found out that only one of the doorbells worked). they live next to a kiosk with slot machines, so i go in there to ask if the owner by any chance has the key to the main entrance, as he's right next door. in order to go in, the owner had to open two doors with a key to let me in - he locks both of them again once i had entered. the place seemed a bit weird, there were only the owner and two other guys in there, all foreigners smoking cigarettes and gambling, looking at me with really unwelcoming looks. i started explaining the owner my situation, but he pretty much ignored me and kept asking me questions about whether or not i was from the police in really bad english. after trying to explain and heed for help for about 5 minutes, i gave up and spent the next 2 minutes getting him to unlock the doors for me, so i could get out. \n\nonce out, i give up and call their parents (about 15 minutes have passed here since i locked myself out). that's when i realized, that the reason my girlfriend hadn't responded, was due to my phone suddenly seizing to function. it responded to touch, but couldn't connect to anything requiring internet nor send or receive texts and calls. i panicked and threw small rocks on the windows of the other floors, not getting any reactions at all - nobody was home. not knowing what to do, i took out my credit card, thinking that maybe, just maybe, i could be like one of those guys in movies who could open a locked door with a credit card. while attempting to slide open the door with the card, i gave it a few bumps with my hip to push open the door. crack. i had smashed the glass in the door. at least now, i could stick my hand in through the hole in the glass and unlock the door from within. i got in, checked on the kids (they were still sleeping, hadn't noticed a thing) and cleaned up the pieces of glass on the floor in the main entrance. in my embarrassment, i decided that i wouldn't tell them what really happened and spent the time remaining before they got home, thinking of what to tell them. \n\ntheir mom came in first, telling me that the dad was withdrawing some money and would be up with my payment in a moment. i told her, that i had heard a loud crash-noice earlier from the main entrance, so i had walked out to see a young guy (i said he was probably 14-15 as i didn't want to scare her) trying to break in. being the hero that i am, i ran after him, but wasn't able to catch him. when returning to the main entrance door, i found out that it was locked, but as the young guy had already broken the glass, i just gently pushed out some of it and locked myself in and cleaned up the mess. she was dumbfounded and told me a different story. a few months ago, someone had walked through their garden to jump the fence into the backyard of the supermarket next door to steal some of their wares. due to this, they had surveillance cameras installed over the entrance, so they could catch them, were it to happen again. i did not see that one coming. cold sweat was running down my neck and back, and i tried my hardest to figure a way out of this. that's when the dad came in, giving me a smile and handing me my payment. the mom told me to tell him what happened and not knowing what else to do, i told him the exact same thing. he told me the same thing about the surveillance cameras. while putting on my shoes and jacket, the dad did the same. i nervously ask him where he's going, to which he answers that he's going to check on the surveillance tape. finally running out of options, i tell them what happened. i've never seen confusion, disbelief and disappointment so clear in someones face. i apologized many, many, many times and offered to pay for the glass and give back my payment, to which they declined. i thanked them, said goodbye and left. i've never felt so embarrassed, as when i wrote my bike home that evening. i never even got to smoke that cigarette.\n\nto my surprise, they have actually had me babysit their kids after this evening, even joking about what i did. they are bigger people than i am.", "output": "babysat kids, went outside to smoke and locked myself out, accidentally smashed the glass on the front door trying to get in and told the parents a stupid lie about it. found out they had surveillance cameras over their front door afterwards.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

something like, \"i want to be a good person, and i don't think we need extrinsic motivations for being good. if i'm motivated by the threat of hell or the promise of heaven, then i'm not truly moral.\" i don't know how good that argument is, but i do know that i'm a moron for getting myself into this with a stranger at the park. i look up and there's another mom giving me the evil eye. i was basically implying that christian morality is shit and i'm way too good for it. it did end the conversation, but in the worst possible way. this lady, who thinks sitting on a park bench is an act of faith, suddenly needed to get back home. she had definitely understood the holier-than-thou-ness of what i said, and i think it was kind of a disorienting role reversal. so i was able to prove that there's no bigger sanctimonious asshole than a former christian.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nbut that's not even the end of it. my daughter ends up making friends with a little girl who wants to get our phone number. she brings her mom over and we exchange numbers. this little girl is actually in my daughter's class, and i'm really happy that they've hit it off. the mom then introduces me to her husband and friend. the husband leaves to load the kids up in the car. i recognize her husband from the ice cream shop near by. we were there like a week ago and i just happen to remember him because he had a baby and what seemed like a bunch of other small children with him. it seemed like a lot for one parent to handle, and i sypathized. anyway, i mentioned that i remembered him from the ice cream shop because he seemed like such a good dad. the mom said, \"he *is* a good dad!\" and i continued, \"and then i saw him on meet-the-teacher night, and i was like, there's that good dad again.\" it was quiet. i'm a woman, by the way. that seems relevant to the story. and meet-the-teacher night is when you go see the classroom and teacher for the first time. so it's a small classroom, and i recognized the guy. he seemed to recognize me too, or looked at me like i was familiar or something. the population of our city is well over 900k, and i remembered seeing her husband twice in the last week or so. i might as well have said, \"i stalk and lust after your husband.\" that's how it was interpreted. i'm happily married and her husband is like an average, middle-aged guy. he really just stood out as one man doing a heroic parenting job at the ice cream shop. i can't imagine having a whole brood of children and having to single handedly take them places. but this lady and her friend now think i'm like a young, hussy single-mom on the lookout for a good dad or something. i hate everything i say to people. \n\n\n\n\n**tl;dr my kid really needs to make new friends, and i skillfully alienated every parent i met at her kindergarten meet up.**", "output": "i got annoyed, took a cheap shot, and scared off everyone around me.**", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

i mean, it doesn't matter if you are. in fact, you look way too good to be one. but i'm just curious.\" \n\n*i fucked up.*\n\nshe pauses, being hysterically laughing (not a good sign), composes herself and simply says, \"how did you know?\" \n\ni begin to panic on the inside. i got hooked up with a prostitute. i don't know how to respond and simply go quiet and blast the christmas music in the car. i simply ask if she still wants to come up for coffee and says, \"i first need you to pay me upfront.\" \n\ni pull out my wallet and she starts laughing again. *was there something on my shirt?

well the phone rings amongst all this and i pick it up with dread thinking how do i explain this to the person on the other end. luckily for me, whilst it was my work they were after someone else....phew.\n\n\nit\u2019s now been over 90mins i\u2019m stuck in the mud and it\u2019s getting dark. at this point i\u2019ve still believed i was going to get myself out and be writing this story on tifu with the end result being i got myself out (whilst jamming wood under tires i\u2019m thinking about what the title will be). now i know you\u2019re now thinking \u201cwhy didn\u2019t he call for help\u201d? well uni is actually not in session at the moment and i don\u2019t have a lot of friends around me. i was going to call my wife to come get me and dogs and worry about the car the next day but that afternoon she had to take her dad to hospital and was in emergency with him waiting to be seen by a doctor. plus she\u2019s over an hour away. i\u2019m thinking of taking all 5 dogs (who are a shit to walk together) and walking home which would have taken me a good hour or so. but i do ring around a few people who aren\u2019t able to help me. i let the dogs out of the car to go to the toilet and give them a bowl of water i had with me. within a few minutes 2 of them have decided they\u2019d head for the uni again and run off. i\u2019m screaming at them and chasing them till i get their attention and they come back. i decided they\u2019ve lost their out of car privileges and they\u2019re back in the car\n\n\nmy wife happens to talk to some police who are in the emergency dept and they say that the local station might have a 4wd to help. she texts me this and i call the local police station who are polite but tell me they have no vehicle and i\u2019d need a tow truck. i ring the nrma (who are roadside assistance) and explain i\u2019d like to renew my membership (i\u2019d let it lapse) and can you please come and tow me out of here. they said they could renew my membership but they\u2019re not meant to be towing people out of fields.....(no i didn\u2019t go through with the renewal). i\u2019m looking on the net on my phone and best tip for getting out of bogs is not getting bogged in the first place (geez thanks).\n\n\ni call my brother who has a friend who lives probably 20mins away from me to ask if his friend has a 4wd to drag me out. he suggests campus security, so i call them and they come to help me. they try pushing whilst i try driving but no good. eventually i realise i\u2019m gonna have to call a tow truck. it\u2019s 8pm so i call some number which is a state wide service. the woman asks me where i\u2019m located etc and doesn\u2019t seem too interested. i ask for a quote and she\u2019s vague \u2013\u201cmaybe a hundred, maybe a couple of hundred\u201d. i tell her i\u2019ll call back when i know what road is nearby. i find out the road, then decide to call a local company. i speak to one guy who sounds like i woke him up. he tells me its too dark for him, but gives me someone elses number. i rang the next guy who said he could do the job but he\u2019s in the city (over an hour away), he gives me another number. the third guy says he\u2019ll do it for $100. woohoo!\n\n\n30mins later he arrives and i go running up the hill in the dark tripping over stuff and waving my hands to get his attention like in a movie. he comes down, looks at it and pretty soon he\u2019s dragged me out. the dogs and i head home 3 hours later, tired and covered in mud. that\u2019s what i get for not being lazy and deciding to take the dogs out instead of watching tv in aircon.\n\nway  \n\nbonus lpt: don\u2019t park on flat ground if it\u2019s wet/muddy. park on a slope facing down so you can use momentum to move your vehicle.", "output": "took dogs out to empty field to run around, got car bogged in mud, had to chase dogs through uni, had to get a tow truck, cost $100 and 3 hours of my life. and i have no more dignity", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

spare. i can ride a bike back to the store. cool. so i head to my house, trying to go as fast as i can with the stabbing stomach pain. \n\ni walk/jog the mile home, and try every window and door in front. that was a bunch of nope. the gate is locked, so in order to get in back, i pull a trash can over to the 7ft fence and a plant stand so i can climb up on the trash can. i finally make it in the backyard and try all the windows and the back door. everything is locked except a small window over my kitchen sink. i should add that this window is locked too, but just with the standard handle lock, while all the other windows have one of those little twisty locks in the track. \n\ni try this kitchen window for what felt like 20 minutes but could have been just 5 minutes because i don't have my phone and therefore i have no sense of time. it doesn't budge. i try unscrewing the frame. nope. \n\ni pace the backyard and then it occurs to me that if i have to break a window, that kitchen window is it. it's the smallest and it's an older window so it's going to be the cheapest fix. i have this weird, heavy, sharp metal chisel tool that i found on the side of the house that i was trying to jimmy the window open with so i use it to break the window. i hit it four times and nothing. finally, i hit it hard enough on the fifth try. there is broken glass everywhere. i find something to put in the window so i can crawl in. \n\nsuccess. \n\ni find my spare keys and at the same time i realize i have no way to get into the garage to get the bike to ride back to the store so i lock the door and walk/jog back to the store. it's freezing, i am in jeans and a t-shirt, and it doesn't occur to me until many hours later that i could have grabbed a jacket before heading back down there. \n\nthe entire time i am heading back to the store, i am in full blown panic attack mode, knowing how bad i fucked up by basically putting my shit on display ready to be stolen. i'm running and choking and trying to catch my breath. i smoke a pack a day. this is not easy. \n\ni finally get close enough to the store and see my van is still there. someone gets out of his car and asks if i'm ok. he saw me running and apparently i looked pretty upset. as i jog past him i tell him \"i locked my keys and phone in the car and ran home to get my spare.\" so nonchalant. \n\ni get to the car and everything is how i left it. i open the door and get inside and call my mom, so out of breath. i go back to her house, not even going inside the drug store for the stomach medicine. i get there and my husband calls me, so i tell him what happened. he is just in shock and doesn't know what to say. i tell him i will call him back once i get home. \n\ni hang up and my mom asks me why i'm so quiet. i tell her i'm just going over in my head what i just did. and she just starts laughing. and then i start laughing. i must have looked so stupid. \n\ni cleaned up all the glass and didn't bother putting cardboard over it because the window has plantation shutters inside so it blocks the air good enough. except last night, it got down in the 30's, which is rare for the area i live. heater ran all night. but whatever. heading down to the hardware store in a bit to get the glass replaced. \n\nin hindsight, i should have got change for the cash i had on me that i grabbed from under the car, found a pay phone, and called my husband to call aaa for me. but instead, in that moment, i decided it would be better to just leave all my shit there. \n\nit's weird how to the mind works.", "output": "i

upload icon! that's got to be it! oh alcoholly1985, you're such a drama queen! i select the file 'complete dissertation', press upload, confirmation of upload pops up and boom. done.\n\nnow, just a quick aside: i need to come clean about something reddit, because i'm not telling you the whole truth. the truth would include the fact that due to it being my last ever piece of coursework and i had gotten to the point where i was just desperate to get *anything* in... i'd had a glass of celebratory wine... before i'd actually submitted it. this wine was partying away in my stomach by itself, because i'd been working so hard i hadn't actually eaten. \n\nso, to recap: i'd uploaded the file on this strange new set up, whilst slightly pissed. i continued to celebrate with my mother and had a couple more glasses (and a shower, i had been in work mode for 5 days straight without a shower. i smelt like 3 day dead tramp in a compost heap). of course, i decided that i should double check that i'd submitted the right file before the actual deadline passed. so log in, go through the same process, there's my dissertation file sitting in the uploads, imprinted with my hopes and dreams... but there's some red writing above it: **draft not submitted**.\n\nnow, the way turnitin works is that it automatically checks for plagiarism by scanning your work and searching the internet, online journal databases, your friends work, your own past work and lots of other stuff. this then gives you a % of likeness to other work, so you can see if maybe you missed out an in cite reference, or been caught out for being a rotten cheater. at undergraduate level, we were bullied into referencing right from the beginning, so were given only one turnitin link for each assignment. however, at postgrad level there are a lot of students that join from other institutions and countries who may not have used references at all, so a 'draft submission' link was added to allow you to see whether you've got to change something. i never use this link, i'm confident that all my work is my own and i'm pretty hot on the in cite referencing front. so when i saw the **draft not submitted** all red and angry, i thought 'oh yeah, well i didn't submit a draft, that's fine' and toddled (truth: staggered) off to bed to sleep (truth: collapse across my bed in a wine-induced coma).\n\nthis morning, day after deadline, i wake up with relief and that gnawing worry you feel after submitting any coursework that's worth 33% of your final grade. i pick up my phone and see that i still haven't received my receipt of submission. i'm only a little worried as receipts often take longer than they're supposed to, especially if you hand in close to deadline time (truth: i'm a repeat offender, closest i've been is 4 minutes before). i decide to check again on moodle just to make sure it is in fact just a glitch in the system. i log in, go through to my submission and grades and there, in damning, accusatory letters are the words :**no submission. grade: 0.00% (dropped)**. i panic. i'm shaking, my heart is racing and i'm starting to cry. but hold on - i uploaded it! i race over to the link on my phone and i can see that the upload is still there. i take a screenshot (so i can prove i uploaded *something*) and get straight onto facebook to message my supervisor. i explain that the submission process was different, that i **had** uploaded my work but it hadn't gone through... it was around then that i realised the **draft not submitted** was not in fact instructing me that i hadn't submitted a draft, it was telling me that my upload *was* a draft and had not been submitted. i know, i'm an idiot. complete and utter fool.\n\nmy supervisor gets straight back to me and explains she's on annual leave, but she'll email the course director and see what it says on the system. i apologise and say i'll email him. so i just have. and now here i am waiting to see if i've failed the largest and most important piece of work i've ever done. brilliant.\n\n \n\n**edit**: as my mind is a complete mess right now, it's been brought to my attention that i didn't explain why i'd have to redo the report. at my uni, if you submit work and it fails (which includes late submissions), you're not allowed to resubmit the same work. now, i'm not sure where i stand atm (cause of the whole draft issue). if my uploaded file isn't counted, then i can submit a blank word document which will become the file that relates to the 0% grade. i'd then be given another chance to hand in with a cap at 40%, which would be my actual report. if this document is counted as a late submission, then i'd have to redo the whole thing with a new research question. either way it's looking a bit shit.\n\n**update**: for people that were wondering, i finally heard back! so apparently i **did not** submit my work properly! the course director replied telling me that i was right, moodle had changed slightly, and to enter my final submission i had to scroll all the way down and *select the 'final submission' button'*. seriously, i'm so bloody stupid. this would process the submission through turnitin (truth: i'm a complete idiot). i replied asking if i would be penalised for a late submission, he replied:\n\n\n\"there is no penalty for a late submission... it is an automatic 0%...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...but i can see you tried to upload before the deadline so it's fine.\" (and yes, he did it so i'd have to scroll down the email!).\n\nso all's fine! i've been so worried! now to hope for a pass, although, let's face it - if i can't see the button at the bottom that says 'final submission', what hope have i got?!", "output": "; got a little pisso before handing in my disso. didn't realise i'd only submitted a draft. now waiting to hear if i'm destined to become the sad loser that watches everyone graduate without me.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

are scheduled to fly out from calgary, alberta to florida on boxing day to spend a week there with our dad and half-brother, who was flying out from ontario the same day as us. the night before we're set to leave, my mom gives me our flight info and stuff and tells me to check us in for our flight. i'm a sixteen year old kid, and i don't really know how air travel works, but i try and figure it out anyways. i get to a menu on their website that says something about checking in, and i *think* that everything looks good because it has our boarding passes on it and shit, so i tell my mother and brother that everything's all set and we head to bed so we can wake up on time for our 7:30am flight the next day. if there's any moral that i could interpret from this story, it would be that you shouldn't not be certain that you're shit's all ready to go when it comes to air travel, but i didn't know that at the time because i'm dumb and it's too embarrassing to say that you don't know what it means to check in for your flight.\n\nnow, our house is on the exact opposite end of the city from our airport, so it usually takes us a solid half-hour to get there without traffic. we leave our house around 6:00 in the morning, and we get to the airport right on time at 6:30. after we find our terminal, we go up to the kiosk to get our boarding passes printed out. unfortunately, the kiosk is telling us that we had, in fact, *not* checked in and we could, in fact, *not* get our boarding passes. after doing some explaining to the airport people about our situation, they notify us that we're kind of fucked and our only option is to re-book. so we go ahead and do that, and we find a flight boarding at 6:45pm on that same day. we're a bit pissed off about this whole situation, but we nonetheless drive home and go to sleep, determined to show up *early* this time.\n\nwe arrive back at the airport at 5:00, get our boarding passes, say goodbye to our mom, and head through customs. we sit down at our terminal, and everything looks to be in order. at around 6:00, we check the flight status, and it looks like it's going to be delayed for half an hour or so... whatever. fifteen minutes later, we check it again, but now it's saying that it's going to be delayed until 7:45. at this point, we've pretty much figured that there's no fucking way we're getting on a plane today, and surely enough, a few minutes later someone comes on the pa and tells us to go back through canadian customs (even though we never technically left the country). we phone our mom and tell her that she needs to drive across the city because chicago o'hare international (the destination of the first leg of our trip) was snowed in on the busiest travel time of the year. anyways, we talk to the airport lady, and she books us for a flight for denver at 7:05am, then a transfer for florida from there.\n\nwe get to the airport the next morning, confident that there was no way we could get fucked three times in a row. we go through security, we go through customs (which was a quick process by this point because we've been through there twice already and the customs guy knows who we are). we get on the plane, and funnily enough the family sitting in front of us was actually related to one of my mom's coworkers. it's about 6:45, and one of the flight attendants comes on and tells us that we're just waiting for a replacement part to come from another plane, and that we'll be taking off shortly. this sounds okay, i mean, we're on the plane, what could go wrong at this point?\n\nat 7:45 the plane is still sitting in the same spot it was an hour ago, and so are all the passengers. a half-hour ago they said they'd be turning on satellite tv for everyone while we waited, and just now the came on the pa and said \"whoops, apparently we have to close the cabin door to turn on the tv\", but that hasn't happened because they're still trying to find this stupid part. of course, a few minutes later, they come on and tell us all that we need to disembark the plane, and that we'll all be directed through customs and to an airport person who can re-book us. my mom's coworker's relatives are steaming mad about this, me and my brother don't really give a shit because we've been through this a few times. all 200 passengers are standing around in the airport lobby, waiting to get booked onto another flight during the *busiest travel time of the year*. my mom was nice enough to call up a friend of ours who works at the airport, and *she* was nice enough to help us find a flight. the first option the airport people gave us was to have us fly out to denver, where we'd land at 11:00pm and have an eight hour layover. unfortunately, because neither my brother or i were 18 at the time, we wouldn't be able to get a hotel room and our only option would be to sleep in the airport, so that idea was shut down pretty quick. after much talking, we eventually managed to get a flight to chicago, then to florida, the day after... two days after we were originally supposed to fly out.\n\nthat flight actually does work out the way it was supposed to, which was great because we get first-class seats on both flights as an apology from the airline for fucking up three times in a row. anyways, our mom spends her week without my brother and i at a ski resort getting drunk with her friends, and i have to spend a week in florida. life isn't fair. all in all, my poor mom had to drive to and from the airport a total of four times, our passports got stamped three times even though we only left the country once, the customs guy and airport people knew us by name, and now i'm basically an expert when it comes to airline shenanigans.\n\n**", "output": "**: thought i was

(we are seriously sounding like sexual deviants. we weren't... i think) jokingly, he said that by the time i get back, he might just be at \"porn star facial\" limit. i remarked that it was too bad he couldn't keep it stashed for me, because he would replenish more after cumming than he would by just going without sexy times. \n\nlightbulb, you are not my friend, but we both got the same idea. after hashing out the details- how often, when would be best, where to store it... we came up with a plan. he was going to keep it in a tupperware container in the fridge (because sperm banks do it, so why not?!?). we had fun laughing at the plan and the craziness of it all. \n\nsunday night, i'm back home. he's giggling more than me as we eat dinner. time for the logistics of it- we now have a tupperware container full of thick, cold cum. leaving it on the counter to warm up, we commence with the fun times. the plan was to apply, then add a final load for fun. but it wouldn't get warm/liquidy! in a moment of sheer brilliance, i suggest warming it up in the microwave. nine seconds isn't that long, and it was runny gloop rather than gloopy gloop. stuck my finger in, stirred it around... seemed fine. \n\nhe starts to apply it and at first, it was fine. little warmer than i thought, but oh well. the more that drips on my face, the more uncomfortable it is. then, in something that can only be equated to spontaneous combustion, it started burning. i can't open my eyes, it's getting closer to my mouth... in a moment of panic, i get one word out- hot. he grabs a towel (sending my makeup flying off the counter) and throws it on my face like he was putting out a grease fire. as i wipe it away, he starts a shower and we jump in laughing our asses off. post shower, i look like hades just jizzed on my face/neck/chest. distinct red lines tell a story that no one was suppose to know. luckily, makeup covered it up and it was back to normal by wednesday. \n\nneedless to say, we never microwaved sperm ever again... but any time we burnt something, we joked about how we literally microwaved a half-baby to the point of wounding someone. \n\nepilogue: today would be my husband's birthday. only fitting to share this on his special day! he was taken too soon, and will always be missed... even though he almost burned my face off with his artificially warmed baby gel.", "output": "went too realistic with porn re-creation, learned the thermodynamic properties of jizz the hard way. still had sex.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

im in ok shape, i can probably do it. i wait around thinking about what to do for a few more minutes, and i decide to take matters into my own hands.\n\nthe walk down was absolutely ridiculous. i have no idea how long it actually took, but i feel like a reasonable estimation is about 20 minutes of going down the stairs as fast as i could. with no ventilation in the stairwell. wearing wool dress pants and dress shoes. i stopped looking at the stairwell numbers at some point. it was just too discouraging. the stairs just became a blur of grey. at about floor 15, my calves were throbbing. but all these doors are secure, no one is just going to let someone banging on the stairwell door in. \n\ni finally get down to the fourth floor, and the stairs just kind of end. there is a hallway with lots of doors, and i just running around like an idiot trying my badge out on the scanners. nothing opens, big surprise. but i had to try. at the end of the hall i find another set of stairs, which finally brings me to ground level. and then i come to a single exterior door, which reads \"emergency exit only, alarm will sound\". jesus fucking christ.\n\ni stand there for a second, weighing my options. i walk back up to the fourth floor to see if anyone is around. i haven't seen or heard another person this entire time. just silence and grey walls. i bang on a few more doors to no effect. i walk back down to the ground floor and i just stand there for a second. what the fuck am i going to do? i can't walk back up the stairs, i just wouldn't make it. besides there is nothing up there for me anyways. i look up and see a camera just above me. i think about it for a few more seconds, look up at the camera and just kind of shrug at whoever may be watching me, and push the door open. loud ass fucking alarm. i push the door closed as quickly as i can, and the alarm stops. i walk back into the lobby from outside and its business as usual, no one seems alarmed or concerned. so one even saw me come out of the emergency door. i very quickly move through the checkpoint to the elevators and mash the 31st floor on the destination elevator. just before i jump on the elevator, i see a security guard rushing out the lobby doors in the direction of the emergency door. i jump on the elevator and don't say a word.\n\ni get off on the 31st floor, sweating like a mad man, scared that a troop of security guards is somewhere scouring the area for me. i try to use my badge to get into the office, big surprise, it doesn't fucking work. i later find out that the badge just gets you into the security checkpoint downstairs. a nice lady comes around the corner and lets me in the door to the office. i plop down at my seat and get back to work, acting like nothing ever happened. no one ever came looking for me, no one knew anything. there is probably a guy that watches the security cameras that knows everything. if you are reading this, security guy, i had to do what i had to do.", "output": "locked myself in the stairwell of a big ass building on the 32nd floor. had to walk all the way down and go through an emergency door with an alarm.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

successful career but feeling pretty intense burnout, and my production was falling bigtime at work after being a very solid producer year in and year out for a decade.  my boss takes me out to lunch and asks me what's going on, and i tell him i'm feeling totally burned out and i could use some time off.  he was a great boss and we agreed i would use my last 3 weeks of vacation, plus i could take 3 weeks unpaid leave of absence.  friggin' great boss, really awesome suggestion.  i plan a big trip, leaving in the summer so i'm hitting cape cod, southern maine, puerto vallarta in mexico, california, and finally chicago.  it's a long trip and gonna be expensive, and with the end of my career clearly a possibility i decide to economize where i can.  use frequent flier miles, make half the trip visiting and staying with family and friends etc.\n\nfirst 2 weeks of the trip on the cape and maine are awesome, and i'm psyched for puerto vallarta.  i get there and it's totally sweet, staying in a cool, brand new resort outside of town. 3rd day i'm there i'm walking around looking for a place to get breakfast, and there's this resort that's selling timeshares, and they give you a free breakfast while you listen to their spiel.  i figure wtf, that'll save $10 on breakfast, all you gotta do is listen and then leave.\nthey start out being super friendly, ask you to write down all your information, local hotel you're staying at, date of departure. they give me a big song and dance hard sell thing, and before i know it i'm signing papers to buy a timeshare for $10,000 and they charge my credit card $1000 deposit.  walking out, i'm feeling this buyers remorse almost immediately.\n\nthe next day, i'm back at the resort i'm staying at and some dude who works there asks me if i wanna listen to their timeshare deal.  i told him i just bought one, and he asks where and i tell him the place. he said, \"dude, i used to work there.  most everything they told you was lies.  i don't care if you buy a timeshare from me, but you need to get out of that, it's a real shitty resort.\" he added that puerto vallerta depends so much on tourist money, that the government will do everything in it's power to make sure they keep their good reputation.  every timeshare contract in mexico gives you 1 week to rescind the contract, and get your money back.\"  he told me about an office in town called proseco or something, go there with my paperwork and follow the protocol to cancel.  \n\nso the next day i go to proseco office, and their english is pretty crappy but they look at my contract and give me some paperwork to bring to the timeshare place that they have to sign, and then bring it back to proseco.  i go to the resort and tell them i was there to rescind the timeshare purchase, and the guy gets massively pissed off right away, as he's losing his nice commission. tries the hard sell on me again, but i hold my ground and say i want to cancel the deal and get a refund.  he gets his boss, and after 20 minutes of feeling very uncomfortable as these dudes seemed very shady, they come back with a credit card receipt indicating the $1000 refund, and basically yelled at me to gtfo. my skin was crawling by this point, i couldn't wait to get away from these dudes.  i go back to proseco with the signed paperwork, they take a copy and sign it, make it official and tell me i gotta go back to the resort one more time and give them the finished paperwork.  there was no way i wanted to go back, but they said if i didn't, i wouldn't get my $1000 refund. i guess i hadn't mentioned that the resort had already processed the $1000 refund on my credit card.  i can't believe i gotta go back to the resort, but i do and the moment i walk in they go apeshit screaming at me.  i just leave, fuck it.  i don't care if that $1000 refund is going through or not by this point, these dudes are freaking me out.\n\ni had a few more days to stay in vallarta and i chilled out, and tried to forget all about the episode, and felt confident that the $1000 refund was official anyway. i'm on my last full day there, my flight was at 1:00 the next day back to the states.  went out, had nice dinner, partied, go to sleep back in the hotel.  at 3:00 am, i'm dead to the world in a deep sleep and the hotel phone next to the bed rings.  i'm half asleep and say hello, and the voice says \"is this chriswasmyboy?\"  i say yes.  he says \"are you flying out tomorrow?\"  i'm still half asleep and say yes.  he says \"someone is going to put a bullet in your head tomorrow at the airport.\" fuuuuck, suddenly i'm snapped out of my half-sleep and hang up the phone. after i hung up, i realize it sounded very much like the sales dude at the timeshare place.  i freak out, and go down to the front desk of the resort and tell the night clerk what just happened.  he spoke great english, and was very sympathetic.  he said not to worry, he'd change my room right away, and he would call his cousin who was a policeman and his cousin would drive me to the airport in the police car first thing in the morning.  they would then escort me to a secure area of the airport.  \n\ni get to the new hotel room, and now i've gotta book the first flight out to anywhere in the us.  but, this is frigging mexico and not the good ole usa, and there is no 800 number to call to book a flight at 3:30 am. my heart is still pumping and i decide to call my brother in the middle of the night, and ask him to call american airlines and get me a flight and call me back with the flight information.  15 minutes later he calls with my 7:00 am flight to dallas, which costs $450.  i thank my lucky stars, and try to fall back to sleep but there's no chance.  when i check out, i find out my 2 minute phone call to my brother to book the flight costs $20.\n\n5:30 am and the policeman shows up with his partner, we get my stuff in the car and they take me to the airport.  they

instead, about 2-3yrs ago.\n\nsome background first:\n\nso, i'm 17 at the time, larger build, about 6' and 200lbs, that's about 90kg for you non-americans, in high school in a small small town of about 7k people, really really unpopular, like, the most unpopular one, people liked to pick on me, i liked to hit people who picked on me. the principal was always cool, he was on my side ninety percent of the time, i was never able to get out of punishment that way, but hey, reduced sentence is fine with me. senior year, that changed, welcome to the new principal, who hates my guts.\n\nso, the entire year, i've got to deal with this harpy of a principal that will crucify me for the slightest transgression, i do my best to annoy her, she does her best to slap me with the best punishment she can. a sort of hate/hate relationship. i carry around my 1.7 gpa, avoid most homework, and generally not give a fuck. \n\nwell, one day, i'm waiting with some friends (and people who are alright with me, but don't necessarily like me) before school in a park right next to the school, smoking cigarettes before class starts, and this cute girl (henceforth known as cutie) that i know comes up to me, and asks if i would protest with her in the school, i figure \"sure, what the fuck, i'll 'stick it to the man' and protest with her\" and i'm thinking there's a pretty fantastic chance of getting laid if this goes down right.\n\n she hands me a sign to hold and a mask to wear, i put it on, school starts, we wait a couple minutes, and then enter the school, she starts shouting something about something, honestly, i don't even remember because right about that time i'm thinking maybe this wasn't such a good idea. this continues for about five minutes until we are about halfway down a hallway when the schools resource officer calls out to us. he's a pretty chill dude, and friends with all the students, including me.\n\nhe tells us it's time to stop the protest, and come to the office. me and the cutie back up, hesitant to go with him. he approaches, as officers do. cutie and i are both figuring out if it's better to give up, or book it when he gets within about five feet of us. officer asks me to give him the sign, i refuse, to this day i'm not a hundred percent why, and in response, he grabs me, shoves me into a corner between the lockers and the hallways wall. my whole fight/flight response is roaring and ready to take me the fuck out of there. i resist, full of adrenaline, nicotine, and monster, trying to get out of the corner.\n\nnow, only two things were in my head at that moment:\nthis dude is attacking me\ni need to get the hell out of dodge\n\ni try to slip past him,he grabs me, i fall, he comes with me. cutie is just standing there, watching all of this go down. i try to clamber to my feet, but mr. officer isn't letting go, he's got my leg with his vice grip hands and won't let go. he climbs up on top of me trying to restrain me, i quite literally (to the amazement of several military recruiters) do a push-up with this cop on my big, and mind you, he's got about 40lbs on me.\n\nnow, at this point, two neurons just connected inside of cuties brain, and she decides it's all gone too far, she tells me to give up, and now two neurons connect in my brain and i realize that at this point, i should just give up, like she says, because there's no way that me escaping is going to make things better. i flatten out on the ground, and place my hands in a position behind my back to make it easier for him to cuff me, because i just know after that fiasco this dude wants to put cuffs on me.\n\nso, officer cuffs me, and i'm laying here while he radios for suv with a cell in it to meet him out front. about this time, i look up and see harpy mcharpyface walking down the hall towards us with the biggest shit-eating grin i've ever seen. she just got her ammunition to boot me out. i lock eyes with her and the only thing that comes out of my mouth is \"wow, you're a total bitch from this angle too!\" because, well, why not?\n\ni get walked to the front by the officer, all the while apologizing to him, because he's my friend, and i know he didn't really want to do that. after about five minutes of standing around in the worlds most uncomfortable handcuffs the suv arrives. i'm forced into it.\n\nhaving your hands cuffed too tight behind your back is seriously uncomfortable, but being forced to sit in a cramped seat with your hands cuffed behind your back is even worse.\n\nwe arrive at the police station in only a few minutes, because it's just a few blocks away. i am ushered through reception, uncuffed, and thrown in a small holding cell with a single yellow chair. that yellow chair wasn't comfortable, nothing about being arrested is comfortable, don't do it. i sit there for two hours. eventually, the door opens, i'm recuffed, and taken to a police cruiser. cue more sitting in a car in the most uncomfortable position. we arrive at the juvenile detention facility in the bigger city nearby, and i am \nleft in their care, uncuffed. i am handed a set of clothing, and a tiny bit of soap before being ushered into a small shower room. here, i get to experience my first ever strip search, how fun! i strip down, show the dude i'm not hiding anything in my butt, and he leaves me to shower and get dressed, which i do quickly.\n\ni get led to a cell where i will wait in my brand new orange outfit until the courthouse is ready to talk to me. i sit there for another two hours, get the worst sammich i've ever had courtesy of the county, and am escorted out in, i shit you not, leg shackles, handcuffs, in front this time, and a stomach restraint, to which my cuffs are attached.\n\ni get driven to the courthouse by a random officer, and we take the elevator up to the correct floor. we proceed down a hallway, to come into the courtroom from the far side near the judge, but to get there we have to pass the entrance to the front of the courtroom, where my gram-gram just happens to be sitting with my brother's adorable daughter, who asks simply, in the most adorable way possible \"why is thepewpew1337\" in handcuffs.\n\ni enter the courtroom, am made to sit, and cue twenty minutes of everyone talking about what to do with me. they decide i should be released to my mother, so i'm taken back to juvenile hall for out-processing after signing my name on some papers, which really isn't that easy to do when your hands are cuffed to your stomach.\n\ni get my clothes and belongings back at juvie, and am made to wait at reception until my mother arrives. she arrives, waiting by her car while the receptionist talks to me. i walk out, and all she says is \"i'm so fucking proud of you right now\".\n\nthis takes me completely off guard, because while my mom is a weirdo, and a bit of a hippy, i was sure she'd murder me for this. well, apparently she was really proud of me deciding to protest something i didn't like, i didn't ever tell her i was just looking to get laid, and we go home.\n\nit was decided i'd do 12 hours of community service, which i ended up doing.\n\nthe fun part is that the principal was ready to expel me, but my mom had to go have a talk with her.\n\nthere's a reason i don't mess with my mom, and this is one of several reasons why:\n\nshe went in there, and the principal and vice principal were tearing into her about how i'm a terrible person and am a danger to the school, and should be expelled. my mom didn't like this, fired off some hot angry words, and somewhere along the line mentioned that a certain pocket on her purse, which she motioned to, was her gun pouch.\n\ni ended up getting 2 weeks of vacation out of school, with my grades not being affected, and no homework pile-up when i got back.\n\nme and cutie never got to screw, pretty sure she really didn't want to have anything to do with me, because while all of my in-processing and out-processing was going on, the school district was put into lockdown because apparently two kids had spread a rumor successfully through that school that i had a gun and was planning on shooting people. that part spread through the town, and made it extremely hard to get a job, because everyone now thinks i'm a domestic terrorist.\n\nthe two weeks of vacation concluded, and i returned to school. turns out that the rumor ended up making me the single most feared kid at my school, because no one wanted to pick on me, hit me, or mess with me in any form after that. my grades also improved to 3.5 gpa before i graduated.\n\nturns out too that a girl who ended up becoming my girlfriend had watched the whole thing go down from down the hallway.\n\nbut this isn't a love story, she was a cunt.\n\nended up later getting a real fun job at a sporting goods warehouse in the bigger city though (got to pack guns and ammo and fun stuff like that), because being known as \"that terrorist kid\" makes it difficult to get a job.\n\nprior to the entire incident, i had aspirations of joining the military, probably the usmc, but having four misdemeanors on your fbi record makes that much harder, especially when one of those is assault on a police officer. (which i never did, dude just lied about me hitting him, what a dill-pickle)\n\n \n\nmoral of the story: uh.....don't get arrested, and doing work to get laid is only worth it up to a point, especially when you never actually get any.\n\nsorry for this post being so long, but i wanted to convey accurately all the details.\n\nedit: (\u00b4\uff65\u03c9\uff65`)", "output": "wanted to get laid, got a criminal record instead, and good 'ol mom pulled all the strings to save my ass", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

i was very young and i often neglect to take my medication. i don't really like to take it because it makes me feel a little sick and it also makes me a lot less sociable and a little depressed after i crash.\n\nfriday was the night of my prom and all week i had been looking forward to it all week. i went with my girlfriend of about 5 months, she goes to a different highschool than i do so you can imagine that i was pretty excited to show her off in front of my friends and peers since a lot of them had never met her.\n\nwe had a great time. the food was very good, we danced, and my friends were very welcoming and tried their best to make her feel comfortable. after prom we went to a small party with some mutual friends we had at my school and then we went back to my place at around 3am.\n\nmy mother was already asleep, my father went to clevland for the weekend to see a few baseball games (super pissed that i couldnt go) and my gf was staying the night so as soon as we got in the door we did what any other young couple would do in this situation. the clothes quickly came of and intercourse took place. after we finished we watched an episode of game of thrones and went to bed in our respective rooms.\n\nfast forward to the next day. my mother tells us that she will going out to buy food and other things so we had the house to ourselves. we spent this alone time in the shower and having sex.\n\nlater that day she said that her parents were going to be at the cottage the next day and they wouldn't be coming back till late. so we made plans for her to stay the night and then go over to her place and have sex for the 3rd time that weekend since the only person at her house would be her oblivious sister.\n\nnow on to today's fu\n\ni was awoken this morning to my girlfriend crawling into my bed beside me. she apologized for waking me up and makes a passing comment about my morning wood. we spent most of the day binge watching game of thrones when my mother announces that shes going on a hike but she wouldn't be long. so we took the opportunity to have a shower since we didn't think we'd have time for sex (turns out we totally would have had more than enough time, so i guess that just adds another fu). after our shower i had what at the time i thought would be a great idea.\n\nin the past while being on the receiving end of various sexual acts i've notice that when i take my adhd medication i last a lot longer than i do when i'm not on it. so i thought it would be a brilliant idea to take it so that i could last longer as well as feel focused enough to work on a math assignment i had due that night. sounded like a pretty amazing idea so i popped a pill before we headed over to her place.\n\nso when we arrived at her place her parents were both gone and her sister was outside on the trampoline so we decided to get right to it. things were going well until her sister came back inside so we needed to stop to greet her and let her know we were there. since her sister was oblivious to everything going on we told her not to come up stairs. so as we headed upstairs i could feel that my medication kicking in so i deemed this cockblock to be for the best. boy was i wrong.\n\nwhen we returned upstairs we resumed the foreplay, kissing and grinding on each other etc. but when she takes the one eyed monster out of my pants, its totally flaccid. i could tell by the look on her face that she thought that it had something to do with her, so i quickly i told her about taking my medication and how that's probably why i couldn't get it up (we had never done anything right after i took it so i had no idea that it would happen). we were at it for almost an hour trying to get it hard but no matter what we did it just wasn't happening. so we decided to go on the trampoline and then try again later.\n\nso we spend a few hours on the trampoline before my medication finally started to wear off so we seized the moment and pretty much ran upstairs and ripped off our clothes. my meds hadn't completely wore off so i wasn't as hard as i had hoped but enough to get it in with some creativity. so we're doing our thing when we hear her sister come running up the stairs. we jump off each other and got dressed. luckily she went straight into her room.\n\nmy gf went into her room to ask her what was wrong. they then went into the washroom for a long time. when they got out my gf informed me that her sister just had her first period. needless to say, neither of us really felt like having sex after that. so i stayed with her until i had to leave and that was the end of my prom weekend.\n\ni am now sitting here grudgingly writing my math report with blue balls.", "output": "took adhd medication when i should have taken

 while my dog is going around doing her business, i am usually sitting on the swing of a jungle gym set. \n\none day, another person(early 30s) was walking her dog through the trail. my dog(super friendly) not being on a leash walked towards her dog while i was on my phone. our dogs started licking and playing(i still haven't noticed, music was too loud, until the she came towards me to compliment my dog.) she started asking me questions, like how did i train my dog to what school do i go to. we ended up talking for about 30 minutes while our dogs were running around playing. after talking we go our separate ways, i usually finish my walk by walking through some old friends neighborhood. \nfor the rest of that break, i noticed that bitch took my swing set idea and tied her untrained dog  to the rocking horse. i would then sit on the other swing set and we would talk until i started the semester again.\n\nthursday: it's been 5 months, finals are over and i finally have time to myself. i drive home after work one day and noticed that my dog was sitting by the door, basically asking to go outside. so i put my backpack upstairs and grab the beggin strips. \n\nwhile walking my dog through the trail, i noticed that it was pretty wet after the rain, so i avoided the jungle gym. even though i avoided the jungle gym, i didn't see my talking buddy anywhere. after my dog finished her business we took our daily lap around the trail\u2019s neighborhoods. \nwhile doing this lap i noticed a woman waving at me from afar(can't recognize face, wasn't wearing glasses). anyways while she was waving at me she fell. so i ran towards her to lend her a hand. when i got there some of her groceries fell out of the bag, her heel was broken, and she had an abrasion. my dog completely ignored the incident and walked away without me.(daily path, i assumed she walked home.)\nshe asked me to help her inside her house, and get her the first aid kid from her bathroom. i helped her bandage up and she thanked me. as i am leaving, she asked me for one last favor, to get her groceries out of her car(because she said she hurt her ankle). i joked around and responded with \"what am i your slave\", she laughed and i walked away. \nafter bringing in all of the groceries and her broken heel, she insist  on paying me. she reaches in her purse but, didn't have any cash. she tells me she has some cash in her room and to follow her. i noticed a photo of her and another man on the ground. i asked if that photo was her husband she said no, that is my ex-husband. i apologized, saying i'm sorry for your divorce. she responded by saying divorce isn't always a bad thing. \nwe get to her room and there were photos turned over. while  looking through her drawer she apologizes and lets me know that she has no cash. she starts to undress herself, and me being the socially incompetent idiot i asked her \"what are you doing\".(that's way my dry spell was almost about to hit year). she responded \"paying you\". anyways while we were having sex a car pulls in, she pushes me off and \"screams my husband is here hide\". my heart started to beat irregularly(fast pace) as if i was about to have a heart attack. i got all my clothes and ran into the closet. \nwhile in the closet my phone rang before he entered the house, my mom called me and i ignored the call. i call her back  and asked why she called me. she asked if i were fine because, the dog came home alone.  i whisper \"yes, i am fine\", she gets suspicious and ask why am i whispering. that is where i hung up. after hanging up the phone i see an empty 12ga(shotgun) box to my left and literally almost had a  shit my pants.\nher husband comes upstairs and falls asleep in the bed. i had no communication with her, no phone number not a thing. i was trapped in a closet for three hours until she convinced him to take her out to eat. i heard the door close but, was too afraid to come out. the thought of a black man getting shot kept running through my head, they'll never know the full story and how i was seduced if he killed me. \nso i said fuck it and booked it, i ran as fast as i could out of the house. i noticed that the car was gone so i said fuck it i am going to get paid. i walk back inside the house and grab a good looking watch and sold it to my younger brother. it's been four days and i have yet to walk the dog. i never  want to see her again, i'm so angry that i helped commit adultery. i think it's on a completely different level than cheating on a gf or bf.

stayed up till 4am, and needed to wake up that morning at 8:30. after a long (and fun) day hanging out with my friends we got in the car and were driving home. due to the winter storm, our school called a snow day the night before, which meant that i could take advantage of the extra long weekend (we had a teacher inservice day monday). pretty soon i get a text from my friends max and brian saying they want to hang out that night. i'm all in cause yolo and who needs sleep anyway.\n\nso i get home at 10:30 and we start drinking by 11. i was low on alcohol and the only stuff i had was a bit of rum and a bottle of ros\u00e9 i had from new years. we finished the rum and started on the ros\u00e9. i've never had it before but spoiler alert- it tastes like flavored water. i started downing way to much, pretty soon i'm hella drunk.\n\nmy friends are tipsy while i'm making a shit ton of noise dropping things and falling off of benches. i go to the bathroom to pass the copious amounts of wine and as i'm coming out of the bathroom my friend scares the shit out of me. i was so startled i couldn't stop laughing and it gave us the idea of turning off the lights and trying to scare each other. i was the only one who really wanted to get scared so i was blindfolded and left to crawl around the house in complete darkness. \n\nthey were getting me pretty good, and i was getting pretty scared. eventually they 'trapped' me with a blanket while i was in the dining room. at the same time i thought i could sense one of them in the corner of the room. turns out i had completely lost my sense of direction but nevertheless i thought i would lash out and whip him with the blanket. **instead, i whip the blanket over my head and catch the top of a 4 foot tall glass vase which topples off the table and smashes all over the floor and carpet.** this however, was not just and empty vase. my moms pet project had been to grow a plant in the vase, *so not only is their glass everywhere but dirt, water and a plant.* part of it lands on my arm giving me a wicked bruise.\n\nso there is probably 25 pounds of glass, water and plant covering a surprising amount of my living room, and everyone in my house was still asleep, so my friends and i started picking up the glass shards but it was disastrous. first we were putting them into a plastic bag but that ripped so we got a paper one, then i stuck my hand into and because i was still pretty drunk sliced my finger pretty bad and it started bleeding everywhere. after we had got all the big glass shards my friends started being whiny about how they needed to get to bed cause it was late (only 2), ironically i was the one operating on 4 hours of sleep. so i say fuck it, i'm probably going to do all the cleaning up myself, and say they can go to bed.\n\nafter they go upstairs to sleep i sit down and think about how to get rid of the tiny glass shards covering the rug and most of the living room (and the entire ground floor as i found out the next morning). i go and get the vacuum thinking i can use it really quickly but it is outrageously loud and i have to turn it off really quickly. instead, i stash the vacuum in the guest room, close to the living room, and pull the entire 25 by 25 foot rug outside. its heavy as shit but i get it onto the deck and pull it over the railing. once i get it evenly distributed i go into the garage and get my sisters field hockey stick. i proceed to beat the everliving shit out of the rug with the stick until it no longer sparkled with glass shards. then i haul it into the house and put it back where it went, but i accidentally switched the corners where the vase broke and the chair goes, so their is a huge dirt and water mess magically on the other side of the room.\n\nthen i sweep everything, clean up all the old alcohol, do the dishes, hurl the plant that was in the vase into the woods, and get to bed by 4:15 am, my new bedtime. that night i had extremely vivid dreams about glass shards in my bed. i woke up at 11, saw that my mom's car was gone, vacuumed the entire downstairs and as of yet i have not heard anything of it.\n\n\n \n\nupdate: my mom was asking alot of questions like\n\n-why was the house so clean?\n-why was their a large water spill on the corner of the rug closest to the window?\n-how did i get a cut on my finger?\n\nbasically i just came right out and told her that i had accidentally slipped while going to bed and broke the vase. she asked why their was water on the other side of the room to where the vase was and i told her that i had tried to move the rug but just ended up rotated it. it wasn't a big deal, she wasn't that mad and she had bought the vase at a yard sale for 30$. the only thing she was sad about was the plant she had been growing in it. i told her that i had thrown it into the woods and she looked pretty annoyed. i don't know if she thought we were drunk but she's pretty oblivious so hopefully it all works out. i was pretty worried but i guess it was for nothing. next time i'll crash the car.", "output": "http://i.imgur.com/edzmlap.gifv", "category": "Summarization

there's a knock at the door. i open up and it's a neighbor i've talk to a few times and once gave a lift down the street, so he knew i drive a pickup truck. he asked me if i could help him move some furniture a few miles down the road because he was moving into an apartment. i didn't really have anything to do that day, it was a wednesday and i didn't have work until later that night and it seemed like a nice thing to do, so i figured sure why not, i'll be neighborly today.  \n\nso we drive over to his place and load a dinning room table, four chairs and a mattress in the back of my truck. it's a tight fit for all of it, but he assures me that the new place is not far down the road. \n\nso we pull out and head on our way, but first he asks me if i can stop by the bank on the corner because he needs to get some checks to pay for rent, no problem, makes sense, so our first stop is the bank. we go there, it's early in the day and it doesn't take long. he comes out and says he got the checks. \n\nok next we're going to the new apartments right? no, his girlfriend is in the hospital so he wants to stop there and tell her he's taking care of the move. ok so we head to the hospital, it's only about a 2 miles from where we started. \n\nso i sit in the car and wait for him to come out, he takes a bit maybe 30 minutes and he comes out. alright now we're going to the apartment right? \n\nnope, he tells me he needs to get his drivers license from the dmv, ok we head there.  again i wait in the car, he takes like 45 minutes this time. well dmv, what can you do right? but this whole thing is starting to take much longer than i hoped and i do have work at 5pm, so i'm hoping this is the last stop before the apartment.  alright finally he comes out and he's finally ready to go to the apartment complex. \n\nso we head to the apartment front office because he says he needs the keys. i park out front and he goes in. i call my girlfriend and tell her what i've been doing all day, basically telling her i'm hoping we get done soon, she says something like, wow, you're such a nice guy, well good luck. \n\nso the apartment complex is taking way too long. he has been in there almost an hour and it is really close to the time for me to get leaving for work. i head into the office and he walks out the same time and tells me he can't move in today. i don't specifically remember why he told me he couldn't, but at the time it made sense to me. \n\nso now i'm in a bind, i need to go to work, but i've got a truckload of furniture. he tells me if i can rent a small u-haul for him he'll pay me back. i kind of knew this was a bad idea right off the bat, but i really just wanted to be done with all of it so i agreed and we head to the rental place, i rent a u-haul in my name (pretty dumb on my part, but i was young i guess) and we load the furniture into it and i head off to work. \n\nof course when i tell my girlfriend about this later that night she's pissed, and she tells me she's calling off the next day so we can track this guy down and make sure he returns the u-haul in one piece. \n\nso the next day my gf stay home from work and we call the guy to find him, he tells me he's at a furniture store in the parking lot. so we head over there, turns out he was hanging out in parking lot offering to move furniture for people to make money to pay me back. nice, but kind of shady. anyway he just got s guy who needs a couch moved to give him $50 to drive it 15 miles north or so. my gf decides i can't be trusted with this guy anymore, so she tells the new guy i'm going to take the couch and the two of us will go up, while my gf and crazy moving guy go to see about getting into this new apartment. \n\nso this day was basically me moving other people's furniture with my pick up, while my gf went through the same basic thing i had with the neighbor, basically driving from one place to the next to get all the pieces to some chain quest that would end up with him getting an apartment lease which it turns out he did not have, even though he had told me it was already set up. \n\nso after i move some furniture, i call my gf and she tells me this guy's life and possibly his mind are in much worse shape then we had thought. so it turns out the guy had not gotten a new lease before he told me he had to move, he just saw a sign at an apartment building that said something like \"new tenets needed! first month free!\" and just decided he was going to move in. then when he went there, the guy had told him he needed a personal check and his license to move in, so enter me, who drove him all around the place to get these things. well the \"personal checks\" he got were just starter checks from him opening a checking account at the corner bank with the minimum amount of money for a checking account. so the apartment complex would not take them, also, as most people might guess, even though the first month's rent was free, they did in fact need a deposit of $1,000, which my neighbor did not have. \n\nso my gf relates all this to me and tells me they're now heading to the social security office because he says he has a check there and that will cover the deposit. \n\nat the social security office, my gf later told me this, the neighbor is acting kind of manic and panicky a bit, so my gf tries to take care of him by talking to the people running the desk, the people at the desk think my wife is his social worker. so as it turns out this was at a time where they were trying to phase out sending social security checks and instead making a debit card type system. so my neighbor had not opted into this yet and because of that his account was messed up a bit, also it turns out that he had never updated his address to the current place he was living, so the checks were being held at the post office, which is where he had been claiming them, so he convinces my gf that the check is at the post office. \n\nso we head now to the post office, and they of course do not have his check. as the post office employee tells us, since he had not updated his address in a year, the post office had stopped accepting the checks and now his check had been sent back to the main social security office, but until they actually received it, the office would not be able to issue a new one. \n\nmy gf at this point is very annoyed with the whole thing and yells at the neighbor basically what the hell are we going to do with your furniture if you don't have a place to stay and you can't get your life together!? my neighbor breaks down and starts crying in the parking lot and i'm at a loss as to what to do. \n\nmy phone starts ringing at this point and it is a number i don't know, but i take it anyway because what the hell else am i going to do at this point?\n\nsurprise to me, it's the neighbor's girlfriend. she's still in the hospital, turns out she has cervical cancer and they're removing her uterus tomorrow but she wanted to check up on her boyfriend and he had given her my number. \n\nso i explain the situation, i ask her what we should do, and she is also at a loss for words because she thought everything had been taken care of. well she gives us more info and the rabbit hole goes so much deeper. turns out my neighbor has schizophrenia, which after spending two days with him i suspected something was wrong with him, but his gf thought he was on his meds, but now she thinks maybe he ran out. turns out the address that his social security checks were being sent to a year prior was a halfway house that ended up burning down, which is when he moved in with his girlfriend and never updated his mailing address. the gf gives us his dad's phone number, and the name of the program he had been in for his halfway house and tells us basically, i'd like to help more but i'm going in for surgery in the morning and i don't know what to do. \n\nso i convey all this to my gf who has calmed down my neighbor at this point, and my gf who used to work in the mental health field recognizes the name of the program this guy was in, in fact she has an ex coworker that works there now. so we call that woman up, my gf tells her the situation, the friend recognizes the guy's name right away and tells my gf to get rid of him however we can and not look back, he was a problem in the program and he's no compliant with his meds and any kind of therapy, just cut our losses and try and find a place for him to stay.  \n\nwell that's great news... so we turn back to the neighbor, we ask him where he wants to stay the night, we settle on taking him back to the hospital and he can sleep in the room with his gf and we'll take him to his dad's house in the morning. so we drive him to the hospital, it's 7:30pm by now after another insane day, we drive home and collapse with a shared \"wtf!?\" \n\noh but it was not over for the night, an hour after we drop off the neighbor, i get a call from the gf again. she tells me that the neighbor got into a fight with a nurse and they kicked him out of the hospital, and she's not sure where he is now. i hang up and my gf and i are discussing whether or not we should go out looking for him. just then there's a knock at the door, guess who?\n\nyep, it's the neighbor, remember i said the hospital wasn't far from my place so he walked back to our place. my gf is not comfortable with him staying at our place so i tell him i can't have him stay, but if he has a place he can go, right in the morning i'll come get him. he says he'll go to the 24 hour denny's cause he knows a waitress there, because of course he does, he claims to know people everywhere. he just asks for some paper and a pen so he can figure some stuff out. i oblige and he walks to the denny's. \n\n6am he knocks at our door again, he's back from denny's. ok so my gf and i have decided, this is the day we get this guy a place to stay and finally get our lives back. we call up his dad, turns out his dad doesn't want anything to do with him. shit. we ask him who he can call to stay with because we need to turn the rental back in and we can't have him stay with us. \n\nhe racks his brain and comes up with an aunt he can call, aunt being a loose term i think she's a distant relative he met at a family reunion. she already has a full house, but is nice enough to take him in, but she tells us she doesn't have room for the furniture other than the bed, which my neighbor can sleep on. so we drive over there and my gf gives the \"aunt\" as much info as we've gathered about his gf, his dad, his program, and his condition, as well as the steps he's going to need to take to get his social security check. the aunt is very understanding and extremely nice, she has another fully grown nephew and her adult son and two grand daughters also staying with her until they can get back on their feet. this woman is a saint. \n\nwe give them the mattress and we take the dining room set to salvation army. the u-haul goes back to the rental place all in one piece, and ultimately i'm just out the price of the rental (minus the $50 i made moving that couch) and my gf is out two personal days. \n\nbut wait, there's an epilogue. a week after all this we get a call from the aunt (we had exchanged phone numbers) and she tells me that my neighbor had gotten in a fight with her nephew and they came to blows and he walked out somewhere. she told us that if he showed up at our place to just call the police because we gave him as much can help as we could and there wasn't anything left to do. he never did show up at our place though, i have no idea what happened to him in the end.", "output": "agreed to help a neighbor move, turned out said

think that. \n\nmore screaming ensures until pain relief arrives where i end up with gas and air with morphine going into me as well. \n\nthe trip to the hospital was awful as well as i'm in an ambulance with stiff suspension going down county lanes full of holes until we get to civilisation. \n\ni arrive at the hospital and i'm seen pretty quickly. the comments i keep hearing are \"that's bad\" and \"surgery\". i relax a little as i feel safer in the hospital but holy mother of mary, you could not prepare me for what happened next. i see a doctor who explains i need surgery and the wait is 1 to 2 days. in the meantime they must get me into a plaster cast to stop me moving the leg. that's fine, makes sense to me. \n\nthe plaster guy turns up and has a chat with me, explains how it works and waits for someone to help lift me while he does his work. remember that angle of my foot? yeah, that's not an option, it has to be the right way up and guess who is out of pain medication? yup!\n\nhe starts working and they gingerly start to move the foot from its current 90 degree hanging down to the right position to a more natural position. i've been told i have 2 spiral fractures (google for fun!) to my tibia and fibia at this point so i know the damage. i start to shout a little as its really hurting but yet they have barely moved me. 3 other people come over, including a doctor. let's call him dr hate. i have no reason to dislike the man but the pain he caused me in the next minute will be with me for the rest of my life. he steadies my foot onto his chest and starts to move it round while i scream and shout, probably scaring the other patients. eventually they get my foot back to its original position but not before i feel the grinding of bone on bone for the duration of the move. luckily i was able to share the experience as the guy doing the plaster could feel my bones grinding as he applied it, it was clearly freaking him out and i could see pity in his eyes along with him telling the doctor \"i can feel the grinding!\"\n\neventually it stops, my wife is crying and i'm a cold, mud covered, shivering mess. \n\neverything from that point has been ok. i had the surgery which involved a procedure called a tibial nail where they put a titanium rod the length of your tibia down the centre of the bone. i was shitting myself before the op but that went well and i me have lots of staples in my leg and know that i am part cyborg. \n\nit's now a week later and i'm off work for quite a while. sitting on reddit, playing the order 1886 and being a pest to my beloved wife. the sound of the bone breaking and the sensation of bone grinding will be with me forever. don't keep fit folks, sit on the sofa and watch tv, it's far better for you.", "output": "mounted a log and broke my leg, doctor hate lived up to his name.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.
