On the other hand, stepwise progression from AK I to AK II and AK III (classic pathway) was seen to be operative in a substantial proportion of iSCC cases. All AK lesions, irrespective of intraepidermal neoplasia thickness, are therefore potentially invasive and tumour advance along adnexal structures might facilitate iSCC development from AK I lesions.", "output": "yes", "category": "Answer Verification 1470.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a question and an answer to that question, classify if the answer actually answers the question into 'yes' or 'no'.
