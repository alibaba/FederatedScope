(d) The Farids Group acknowledges and agrees that any Transfer of the limited liability company interests, partnership interests, shares or other similar equity interests in any member of the Farids Group or a parent entity of such member will be deemed to constitute a Transfer of Purchased Shares, and any proposed Transfer of all or any portion of any such interests in any member of the Farids Group or a parent entity of such member shall be subject to compliance with the terms of this Agreement as such terms apply to the Farids Group. (e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Farids Group may from time to time pledge, and/or grant a security interest in, some or all of the legended Purchased Shares in connection with applicable securities laws, pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement in compliance with a bona fide margin loan. Such a pledge would not be subject to approval or consent of the Company and no legal opinion of legal counsel to the pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be required in connection with the pledge, but such legal opinion shall be required in connection with a subsequent transfer or foreclosure following default by the Farids Group transferee of the pledge. No notice shall be required of such pledge, but the Farids Group's transferee shall promptly notify the Company of any such subsequent transfer or foreclosure. The Farids Group acknowledges that the Company shall not be responsible for any pledges relating to, or the grant of any security interest in, any of the Purchased Shares or for any agreement, understanding or arrangement between the Farids Group and its pledgee or secured party. At the Farids Group's expense, the Company will execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party of Purchased Shares may reasonably request in connection with a pledge or transfer of the Purchased Shares, including the preparation and filing of any required prospectus supplement under Rule 424(b)(3) of the Securities Act or other applicable provision of the Securities Act to appropriately amend the list of selling stockholders thereunder. (f) The legend set forth in Section 5.1(c) above shall be removed and the Company shall issue one or more certificates without such legend or any other legend to the holder of the Purchased Shares upon which it is stamped or issue to such holder by electronic delivery, if (i) such Purchased Shares are registered for resale under the Securities Act, (ii) such Purchased Shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) such Purchased Shares are eligible for resale under the Securities Act without regard to current public information, manner of sale or volume limitations. Any fees (with respect to the Company's transfer agent, Company counsel or otherwise) associated with the removal of such legend shall be borne by the Company. 15\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 5.2 Remedy for Prohibited Transfer. In the event that any member of the Farids Group Transfers any Purchased Shares in contravention of Section 5.1, such Transfer shall be null and void, and the Company agrees it will not take any action to effect such a Transfer nor will it treat any alleged transferee as the holder of such Purchased Shares. ARTICLE VI REGISTRATION RIGHTS Section 6.1 Demand Registration. (a) If the Company shall receive a written request (a Demand Request) from the Farids Group that the Company file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the registration of all or a portion of the Registrable Securities owned by the Farids Group, then the Company shall, subject to the limitations of this Section 6.1, effect, as expeditiously as reasonably possible, the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof that the Farids Group requests to be registered, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1(c); provided, however, that any Eligible Resale Registration Statement shall be filed within 90 days following receipt of such Demand Request and any Resale Shelf Registration Statement shall be filed within 30 days following receipt of such Demand Request, as applicable. The Farids Group shall have the right to make two (2) Demand Requests on or after the date that is the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided, that the Farids Group shall not make more than one (1) Demand Request within any six-month period. (b) If the Farids Group intends to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by its request by means of an underwritten public offering, it shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 6.1. The Farids Group shall have the right to select the investment bank or banks and managers to administer any offering made in connection with a Demand Request, including the lead managing underwriter; provided that such investment banks or managers shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided, further, that if the Farids Group declines to exercise such right, the Company shall select the investment bank or banks and managers to administer the offering, but the Farids Group shall continue to have such right pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) in any subsequent underwritten public offering. (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated to (i) effect a registration pursuant to Section 6.1 unless the Registrable Securities requested to be registered by the Farids Group, together with all other shares of Common Stock requested to be registered by any other holder of piggyback registration rights (each, an Other Piggyback Holder) pursuant to any agreement containing similar registration rights as those contained in this Article VI (such other shares, the Other Registrable Securities), are reasonably expected to result in aggregate gross cash proceeds in excess of (x) in the case of a Resale Shelf Registration Statement, three (3) million dollars ($3,000,000) and (y) in the case of any other form of registration statement, one (1) million dollars ($1,000,000) or (ii) prepare, file, effect or maintain a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor to Form S-3) or any similar shelf registration statement (other than a Resale Shelf Registration Statement) under the Securities Act for the purposes of compliance with any Demand Right pursuant to this Section 6.1. 16\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.2 Piggyback Registrations. (a) From and after the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall notify the Farids Group (unless the Farids Group has demanded such registration pursuant to Section 6.1) in writing at least five (5) business days prior to the initial public filing of any Eligible Registration Statement. Such notice from the Company shall state the intended method of distribution of the Registrable Securities included in such Eligible Registration Statement. The Company shall afford the Farids Group the opportunity to include Registrable Securities in such Eligible Registration Statement so long as it agrees to sell its Registrable Securities pursuant to the same method of distribution. If the Farids Group desires to include Registrable Securities held by it in any such Eligible Registration Statement, it shall, within four (4) business days after the above-described notice from the Company, so notify the Company in writing. Any such notice from the Farids Group shall (i) specify the amount of Registrable Securities that the Farids Group would like to include in such Eligible Registration Statement and (ii) include the agreement of the Farids Group to participate in any related underwritten offering on the same terms as the other participating Holders. Upon such written notice from the Farids Group, the Company will use its best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the Farids Group has requested to be registered. If the Farids Group decides not to or is unable to include all of its Registrable Securities in any Eligible Registration Statement filed by the Company, the Farids Group shall nevertheless continue to have the right to include Registrable Securities in any subsequent Eligible Registration Statement as may be filed by the Company, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. Prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Eligible Registration Statement, the Farids Group may withdraw from such Eligible Registration Statement any of the Registrable Securities at any time upon written notice to the Company. (b) Underwriting. If the Eligible Registration Statement under which the Company gives notice under this Section 6.2 is for an underwritten offering, the Company shall so advise the Farids Group. In such event, the right of the Farids Group to be included in an Eligible Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be conditioned upon the Farids Group's participation in such underwriting by executing and delivering a custody agreement and power of attorney in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company with respect to such Registrable Securities (the Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney), which Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney shall permit the Farids Group to, prior to the effectiveness of such Eligible Registration Statement, withdraw any of the Registrable Securities at any time from such Eligible Registration Statement upon written notice to the Company and the custodian. The Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney will provide, among other things, that (i) the Farids Group will, to the extent applicable, deliver to and deposit in custody with the custodian and attorney-in-fact named therein one or more certificates representing such Registrable Securities, accompanied by duly executed stock powers in blank, and irrevocably appoint said custodian and attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to act under the Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney on the Farids Group's behalf with respect to the matters specified therein, including, but not limited to, the entry into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) in customary form with the underwriter(s) and such other documents and agreements reasonably required in connection with such registration or offering and (ii) the Farids Group will perform its obligations under such Underwriting Agreement and any other agreement entered into in connection with such registration and/or offering. The Farids Group also agrees to execute such other documents and agreements as the Company may reasonably request to effect the provisions of this Section 6.2 and any transactions contemplated hereby. 17\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3 Priority on Registrations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, if the lead managing underwriter or underwriters advise, in the case of a requested registration pursuant to Section 6.1, the Farids Group or, in all other cases, the Company that marketing factors (including, but not limited to, an adverse effect on the per share offering price) require a limitation of the number of shares to be included in an underwritten offering (including Registrable Securities), then the Farids Group or the Company, as the case may be, shall so advise all holders of Registrable Securities and all Other Piggyback Holders who have requested to participate in such offering, that (i) if the requested registration is pursuant to Section 6.1, the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated first to the Farids Group for its own account, and second to the Company (to the extent it is selling shares of Common Stock in such offering) and the Other Piggyback Holders who have duly requested shares to be included therein on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares proposed to be sold by the Company and the number of Other Registrable Securities requested to be included by such Other Piggyback Holders, and (ii) if the requested registration is not pursuant to Section 6.1, the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated first to the Company for its own account (to the extent such registration was initiated by the Company) or to such Holder of Other Registrable Securities who demanded such registration pursuant to demand rights similar to those set forth in this Agreement, and second to the Company (to the extent such registration was not initiated by the Company), the Farids Group and the Other Piggyback Holders who have duly requested shares to be included therein on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares proposed to be sold by the Company (to the extent such registration was not initiated by the Company), the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included by the Farids Group and the number of Other Registrable Securities requested to be included by all such Other Piggyback Holders. For any Other Piggyback Holder which is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation, the partners, members or shareholders, as applicable, of such Other Piggyback Holder and the estates and Family Members of any such partners, members and shareholders and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing Person(s) shall be deemed to be a single Other Piggyback Holder, and any pro rata reduction with respect to such Other Piggyback Holder pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all Persons deemed to constitute such Other Piggyback Holder (as defined in this sentence). Section 6.4 Termination, Effectiveness, Postponement and Suspension of Registration. (a) Right to Terminate Registration. If the Farids Group determines for any reason not to proceed with any proposed registration requested pursuant to Section 6.1, the Farids Group shall promptly notify the Company in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall withdraw or terminate such registration whether or not any Other Piggyback Holder has elected to include any Other Registrable Securities in such registration. In addition, the Company shall have the right to withdraw or terminate any proposed registration initiated by it and a Holder of Other Registrable Securities shall have the right to withdraw or terminate any proposed registration initiated by it, whether or not the Farids Group or any Other Piggyback Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities or Other Registrable Securities, as the case may be, in such registration. The Company shall promptly give notice of the withdrawal or termination of any registration to the Farids Group, to the extent the Farids Group has elected to participate in such registration. The Registration Expenses of any such withdrawn or terminated registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Section 6.5. 18\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Effectiveness of the Registration Statement. The Company shall maintain the effectiveness of the Eligible Registration Statement until the earlier of (i) the date on which all Registrable Securities included in such Eligible Registration Statement have actually been sold and (ii) the date that is (x) 180 days (in respect of a Resale Shelf Registration Statement) or (y) 90 days (in respect of any Eligible Registration Statement other than a Resale Shelf Registration Statement) from the effective date of such Eligible Registration Statement. (c) Postponement or Suspension of Registration. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of an Eligible Registration Statement in respect of a registration pursuant to this Agreement at any time would require the Company to make a public disclosure of material non-public information, (1) which disclosure in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors (after consultation with external legal counsel) (x) would be required to be made in any registration statement so that such registration statement would not contain a material misstatement or omission, (y) would not be required by applicable Law to be made at such time but for the filing, effectiveness or continued use of such Eligible Registration Statement and (z) would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to effect a material proposed acquisition, disposition, financing, business opportunity, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction or (2) during a customary blackout period of the Company, then the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such determination to the Farids Group, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, such Eligible Registration Statement; provided, that the Company shall not be permitted to do so pursuant to clause (1) above (x) more than two times during any twelve (12) month period or (y) for a period exceeding thirty (30) days on any one occasion (unless a longer period is consented to by the Farids Group) (the Suspension Period). In the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the Farids Group agrees to suspend, promptly upon its receipt of the notice referred to above, its use of any prospectus relating to such registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. If so requested by the Company, the Farids Group shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in the Farids Group's possession, of the prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice. The Company agrees that, in the event it exercises its rights under this Section 6.4(c), it shall (i) promptly notify the Farids Group of the termination or expiration of any Suspension Period, (ii) within thirty (30) days after delivery of the notice referred to above (unless a longer period is consented to by the Farids Group), resume the process of filing or request for effectiveness, or update the suspended registration statement, as the case may be, as may be necessary to permit the Farids Group to offer and sell its Registrable Securities in accordance with applicable Law and (iii) if an Eligible Registration Statement that was already effective had been suspended as result of the exercise of such rights by the Company, promptly notify the Farids Group after the termination or expiration of any Suspension Period of the applicable time period during which the Eligible Registration Statement is to remain effective, which shall be extended by a period of time equal to the duration of the Suspension Period. 19\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.5 Expenses of Registration. Except as specifically provided herein, all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with any registration under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 shall be borne by the Company. All underwriting fees and selling commissions relating to the distribution of the Registrable Securities and all taxes, if any, on the transfer and sale, respectively, of the Registrable Securities being sold that are incurred in connection with any registrations hereunder shall be borne by the Farids Group. For the avoidance of doubt, all underwriting fees, selling commissions and taxes incurred in connection with any registration hereunder relating to securities sold by the Company shall be borne by the Company. Section 6.6 Obligations of the Company. If and whenever the Company is required to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act as provided in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (to the extent the Farids Group has requested to include Registrable Securities in an Eligible Registration Statement pursuant to clause (a) of such Section 6.1 or 6.2, as the case may be), the Company shall effect such registration to permit the sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall cooperate in the sale of the securities and shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) Prepare and file with the SEC an Eligible Registration Statement on such form as shall be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities by the Farids Group in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof and the provisions of this Article VI, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such Eligible Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; provided, however, that before filing any Eligible Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (not including documents that would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), the Company shall afford the Farids Group, its counsel and the managing underwriter, if any, an opportunity to review copies of all such documents proposed to be filed. The Company shall not file any Eligible Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto in respect of which the Farids Group has a right to review prior to the filing of such document, if the Farids Group, its counsel or the managing underwriter, if any, shall reasonably object, in writing, on a timely basis. (b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to each Eligible Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Eligible Registration Statement continuously effective for the effectiveness period; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Eligible Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented. 20\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Notify the Farids Group, its counsel and the managing underwriter, if any, promptly (but in any event within 10 business days), and confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a Prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to an Eligible Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective (including in such notice a written statement that the Farids Group may, upon request, obtain, without charge, one conformed copy of such Eligible Registration Statement or post-effective amendment including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference and all exhibits), (ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Eligible Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) if at any time when a prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Eligible Registrable Securities the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any agreement (including any underwriting agreement) contemplated by Section 6.6(k) below cease to be true and correct in all material respects, (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of an Eligible Registration Statement or any of the Registrable Securities for offer or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (v) of the happening of any event that makes any statement made in such Eligible Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in such Eligible Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the case of such Eligible Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (vi) of the Company's reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to an Eligible Registration Statement would be appropriate. (d) Use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of an Eligible Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of a Prospectus or suspending the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest possible moment. (e) If requested by the managing underwriter, if any, or the Farids Group, (i) promptly incorporate in a post-effective amendment such information as the managing underwriter, if any, or the Farids Group reasonably requests to be included therein to comply with applicable Law, (ii) make all required filings of such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the Company has received notification of the matters to be incorporated in such post-effective amendment, and (iii) supplement or make amendments to such Eligible Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to take any actions under this Section 6.6(e) that are not, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, in compliance with applicable Law. (f) Furnish to the Farids Group and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, one conformed copy of the Eligible Registration Statement or Statements and each post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits. 21\n\n\n\n\n\n(g) Deliver to the Farids Group, its counsel and the underwriters, if any, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons may reasonably request; and, the Company hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by the Farids Group and the underwriters, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and an amendment or supplement thereto. (h) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, to use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify, and cooperate with the Farids Group, the underwriters, if any, the sales agent and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Farids Group or the managing underwriter, if any, reasonably request in writing; use its reasonable best efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period during which the related Eligible Registration Statement is required to be kept effective and use its reasonable best efforts to do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Eligible Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company will not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or (B) take any action that would subject it to general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject. (i) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by clause (v) or (vi) of Section 6.6(c) above, as promptly as practicable prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Eligible Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold thereunder, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (j) Enter into an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings and take all such other actions as are reasonably requested by the managing underwriter in order to expedite or facilitate the registration or the disposition of such Registrable Securities, and in such connection, (i) make such customary representations and warranties to the underwriters, with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the Eligible Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein; (ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions shall be reasonably satisfactory (in form, scope and substance) to the managing underwriter), addressed to the underwriters covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters; and (iii) obtain comfort letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Eligible Registration Statement), addressed to each of the underwriters, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in comfort letters in connection with underwritten offerings. The above shall be done at each closing under such underwriting agreement, or as and to the extent required thereunder. 22\n\n\n\n\n\n(k) Use its reasonable best efforts to cause all Registrable Securities covered by such Eligible Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed. (l) Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and make generally available to its security-holders earnings statements satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act) no later than 45 days after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month period if such period is a fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of any fiscal quarter in which Registrable Securities are sold to underwriters in a firm commitment or best efforts underwritten offering and (ii) if not sold to underwriters in such an offering, commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of the Company after the effectiveness date of an Eligible Registration Statement, which statements shall cover said 12-month periods. Section 6.7 Delay of Registration; Furnishing Information. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to Section 6.1 or 6.2 that the Farids Group shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it and the intended method of distribution of such securities as required by Section 6.12 or as otherwise reasonably requested by the Company. Section 6.8 Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in an Eligible Registration Statement under Section 6.1 or 6.2: (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Farids Group, the partners, members, directors and officers of any member of the Farids Group, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), the directors and officers of such underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls any member of the Farids Group or such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the Non-Company Indemnified Parties), against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or suits, actions or proceedings in respect thereof) and reasonable documented expenses that arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations by the Company: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Eligible Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein, including any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein, or any other such disclosure document (including reports and other documents filed under the Exchange Act and any document incorporated by reference therein) or related document or report, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein (in the case of an Eligible Registration Statement only), or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances when they were made, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any federal, state, foreign or common law, rule or regulation in connection with the offering covered by such Eligible Registration Statement (collectively, a Violation); and the Company will reimburse each such Non-Company Indemnified Party for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.8(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such Eligible Registration Statement by such Non-Company Indemnified Party. 23\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Farids Group will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), the directors and officers of such underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the Company or any such director, officer, employee, agent, representative, controlling person or underwriter may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or suits, actions or proceedings in respect thereof) and reasonable documented expenses that arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Eligible Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein, including any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein, or any other such disclosure document (including reports and other documents filed under the Exchange Act and any document incorporated by reference therein) or related document or report, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein (in the case of an Eligible Registration Statement only), or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances when they were made, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any federal, state, foreign or common law, rule or regulation in connection with the offering covered by such Eligible Registration Statement (collectively, a Holder Violation), in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Holder Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by the Farids Group expressly for use in connection with such Eligible Registration Statement; and the Farids Group will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, employee, agent, representative, controlling person or underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding if it is judicially determined that there was such a Holder Violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.8(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Farids Group, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, further, that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 6.8(b) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by the Farids Group upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. 24\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6.8 (an Indemnified Party) of written notice of the commencement of any claim, damage, suit, action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation) being brought or asserted against it, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6.8 (an Indemnifying Party), deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice of the commencement thereof; provided, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6.8 except to the extent such failure has materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such action (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the Indemnifying Party so desires, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party who has received a similar notice, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel relating to such proceeding, and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not, except as specified below, be liable to such Indemnified Party under paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, for any legal expenses of other counsel. In any such proceeding, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnified Party; provided the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel if (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have so mutually agreed; (ii) the Indemnifying Party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on the advice of counsel, that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel that is required to effectively defend against any such proceeding) for all Indemnified Parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed promptly. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. 25\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable Law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other in connection with the actions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of the Indemnified Party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by a Holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering made under such Eligible Registration Statement received by such Holder. (e) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 6.8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (f) The obligations of the Company and the Farids Group under this Section 6.8 shall survive completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in an Eligible Registration Statement and the termination of this Agreement. (g) The obligations of the parties under this Section 6.8 will be in addition to any liability, without duplication, which any party may otherwise have to any other party. Section 6.9 Market Stand-Off Agreement. The Farids Group hereby agrees that the Farids Group shall not Transfer, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale or other Transfer, any Lock-Up Security held by the Farids Group (other than those included in the registration) for a period specified by the representative(s) of the underwriters of Registrable Securities or any other securities sold in any offering in respect of which the Farids Group received notice from the Company in accordance with Section 6.2, such period not to exceed one hundred and eighty (180) days following the pricing date of any underwritten offering; provided that the Farids Group shall only be required to comply with this Section 6.9 if the Farids Group beneficially own (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, or any successor provision) at least 3.0% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time. The Company may impose stop transfer instructions with respect to any Lock-Up Security subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of said one hundred and eighty (180) day or shorter period. 26\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.10 Agreement to Furnish Information. The Farids Group agrees to execute and deliver such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the representative(s) of the underwriter(s) that are consistent with the Farids Group's obligations under Section 6.9 or that are necessary to give further effect thereto. In addition, if requested by the Company or such representative(s), the Farids Group shall provide, to the extent the Farids Group has elected to include Registrable Securities in an Eligible Registration Statement, within one (1) business day of such request, such information relating to itself, the Registrable Securities held by it and the registration and the intended method of distribution of the Registrable Securities as may be reasonably requested by the Company or such representative(s) in connection with the completion of any public offering of Common Stock pursuant to such Eligible Registration Statement. The underwriters of Registrable Securities are intended third party beneficiaries of Sections 6.8 and 6.10 and shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto. Section 6.11 Termination. The rights and obligations of the Farids Group set forth in this Article VI (other than those set forth in Sections 6.8 and 6.9) shall terminate on the date that the Farids Group owns less than 3% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, but in no event earlier than the Expiration Date (as defined in the Warrant).

For further clarity, nothing in this Section 6.1.1 (BLI Standstill) is intended to prevent a Third Party BLI customer or partner from using, practicing or otherwise exploiting any independently developed improvement, invention, process or workflow even if similar to a Headstart Invention as long as BLI and its Affiliates are in compliance with this Section 6.1.1 (BLI Standstill) [***]. If a Workflow Development Plan is cancelled under the terms of this Agreement, then the Headstart Period with respect to Headstart Inventions under such Workflow Development Plan shall be deemed to have immediately accelerated to conclusion, unless Ginkgo (x) identifies in writing one or more Headstart Inventions under the Workflow Development Plan within [***] ([***]) Business Days of cancellation of the Workflow Development Plan and (y) [***], in which case such Headstart Invention(s) shall be subject to the applicable Headstart Period under this Section 6.1.1 (BLI Standstill); provided that, Ginkgo's right to identify [***] under clauses (x) and (y) shall not exist if the cancellation of a Workflow Development Plan is [***].\n\n6.1.2 [***].

During the Term and for a period of [***] ([***]) months following the Term of this Agreement, other than pursuant to Sections 13.3.2 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Buy-Down Election) or 13.3.3 (Effects of Termination Based Upon an Uncured Ginkgo Breach, Insolvency or Force Majeure Event), BLI shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, itself or with or through a Third Party, develop, configure, customize, license, sell, provide or otherwise give access to the Beacon Platform or any [***] to, [***] or its Affiliates for any use; provided that this restriction shall terminate as set forth in Section 13.3 (Effects of Expiration or Termination) or if Ginkgo has not satisfied its Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments (as such may be adjusted under this Agreement) for a full Contract Year, including [***] as permitted under Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments) or Section 7.2.2(b)(iii) (Development Purchase Commitments); provided that BLI will provide written notice to Ginkgo within [***] ([***]) days of the end of any Contract Year with respect to which BLI believes that Ginkgo has not satisfied its Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Change in Control of an existing (as of the Effective Date or at any time during the Term) Third Party BLI customer results in such customer being controlled [***] following the date such Third Party became a BLI customer, BLI shall promptly notify Ginkgo in writing of such Change in Control (in no event later than [***] ([***]) days after BLI first learns of such Change in Control, [***] (in which case such notice will be provided by BLI no later than [***] ([***]) days after the earlier of [***] or [***]) and, in such written notice, provide Ginkgo with information regarding [***] and, if BLI does [***], the [***].

In the event BLI notifies Ginkgo as aforesaid and Ginkgo fails to make such election within the [***] ([***]) day period, then, in the case of (A) or (B), BLI will not be deemed to be in breach of this Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) solely on account of a Third Party customer [***]. Nothing in this Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) will require or oblige BLI [***], then [***]. In the event [***], [***] in a manner that (x) [***], (y) [***] or (z) [***].

As used in this Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI), control has the meaning set forth in Section 1.2 (Affiliate definition). For clarity, [***].\n\n6.2.2 No Further Restrictions by Ginkgo. During the Term, Ginkgo shall not [***] prohibit (i.e. by [***]), as part of any [***] arrangement with a Third Party, a Third Party from purchasing a Beacon Platform or other BLI products or services, or otherwise using or utilizing such Beacon Platforms for [***], including [***]. For clarity, such obligation shall not prohibit or limit Ginkgo from entering into generally exclusive relationships with Third Parties (e.g., [***]). 7. ECONOMICS\n\n7.1 Upfront Payment. No later than [***] ([***]) days following the Effective Date, Ginkgo will pay to BLI a non-refundable upfront amount equal to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the Upfront Payment).

[***].\n\n7.2 Purchase Commitments.\n\n7.2.1 Generally. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the Term, the Parties' target is for Ginkgo to make a total of One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000) in Development Purchases and Production Purchases from BLI (as amended from time to time under this Agreement and as more fully set forth in this Section 7.2 (Purchase Commitments), the Full Purchase Target), which Full Purchase Target is divided into Contract Year purchase commitment targets with respect to Development Purchase Commitment and Production Purchase Targets, as more fully set forth in Section 7.2.2 (Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments).\n\n7.2.2 Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments. Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the remainder of this Section 7.2.2 (Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments)), for each Contract Year, Ginkgo shall [***] make Development Purchases and Production Purchases from BLI in the amounts set forth in the Page 36 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Purchase Commitment and Production Purchase Target columns respectively in Table 7.2.2 with respect to such Contract Year:\n\nTable 7.2.2\n\nDevelopment Purchase Commitment\n\nProduction Purchase Target\n\nTotal Targeted Purchase\n\nMinimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment Contract Year 1 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 2 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 3 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 4 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 5 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 6 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 7 [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ 109,000,000 Total $ [***] $ [***] $150,000,000 N/A\n\n(a) Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments.

The Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments for each of Contract Years [***] are binding commitments. Any amounts paid by Ginkgo to BLI in excess of the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment amount for a given Contract Year in Contract Years [***], regardless of whether such excess constitutes a Development Purchase or Production Purchase, will be creditable towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been fully credited. Ginkgo covenants to pay the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments for each Contract Year by the [***] Business Day after the end of the [***]. If BLI has Substantially Completed at least [***] ([***]) [***] Workflows within the first [***] ([***]) Contract Years, then the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment as of the Contract Year (which may include a portion of a full Contract Year) that is the last Contract Year during the Term pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall change from $109 million (as currently reflected in Table 7.2.2) to $150 million.\n\n(b) Development Purchase Commitments.\n\n(i) Subject to Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments), unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Development Purchase Commitment for the [***] Contract Years shall constitute a binding obligation on Ginkgo, and, subject to Ginkgo exercising its Buy-Down Option pursuant to Section 7.3 (Buy-Down Election), the Development Purchase Commitment for the [***] Contract Years shall also constitute binding obligations on Ginkgo. No less than [***] percent ([***]%) of the Development Purchases made in the [***] Contract Years will be used by the Parties to develop Workflows for [***]. Page 37 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) At any time during a Contract Year, upon written notice to the JRC, Ginkgo may accelerate its Development Purchases in such Contract Year to include Development Purchases anticipated to be made in upcoming Contract Year(s). Such additional Development Purchases in excess of the Development Purchase Commitment for such Contract Year will be creditable towards Ginkgo's Development Purchases in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been exhausted and will count towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment for the Contract Year in which it is paid, subject to allocation to subsequent Contract Year(s) as set forth in Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments).\n\n(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that Ginkgo's Development Purchases in a given Contract Year after [***] are less than the Development Purchase Commitment for such Contract Year, respectively, Ginkgo shall be able to apply the Development Purchases made in the first [***] of the next Contract Year to satisfy the previous Contract Year's Development Purchase Commitment; provided that (i) Ginkgo may only be able to satisfy [***] percent ([***]%) of the relevant Development Purchase Commitment for the previous Contract Year pursuant to this Section 7.2.2(b)(iii) (Development Purchase Commitments) and (ii) any amount of Development Purchases credited towards satisfying the previous Contract Year's Development Purchase Commitment shall not count towards satisfying such targets for the then-current Contract Year.\n\n(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that a Workflow Development Plan is terminated prior to completion by the JRC, including (A) [***], (B) [***], (C) [***] or (D) [***], then, subject to Section 3.5.1 (Decision-Making), the JRC shall, in good faith, discuss and approve [***]; provided, however, that such [***] (Term).\n\n(c) Production Purchase Commitments.\n\n(i) Subject to this Section 6.2.2(c) (Production Purchase Commitments), unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Production Purchase Target for the [***] shall constitute a binding obligation on Ginkgo and, in partial satisfaction of its Production Purchase commitment for the Page 38 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\n[***], Ginkgo shall purchase [***] ([***]) [***] within [***] ([***]) days of the Effective Date, the cost of which, for clarity, shall be offset by the upfront payment paid by Ginkgo pursuant to Section 7.1 (Upfront Payment). Subject to Ginkgo's obligation to satisfy the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment for a Contract Year, with respect to the second [***] Contract Years), Ginkgo's Production Purchase Targets for the [***] Contract Years as set forth in Table 7.2.2 are [***], and the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that [***].\n\n(ii) At any time during a Contract Year, upon written notice to the JRC, Ginkgo may accelerate its Production Purchases in such Contract Year to include Production Purchases anticipated to be made in upcoming Contract Year(s). Such additional Production Purchases in excess of the Production Purchase Target for such Contract Year will be creditable towards Ginkgo's Production Purchases in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been exhausted and will count towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment.\n\n(d) Effects of Tolling. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Ginkgo's obligations to satisfy Development Purchase Commitments and Production Purchase Commitments at all times during the Term (including any Intended End of Term) are subject to Section 5.4.3(d) (Tolling) and this Section 7.2.2(d) (Effects of Tolling).

Ginkgo will indemnify, defend and hold BLI and its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, employees, Permitted Subcontractors and agents (each, an BLI Indemnitee) harmless from and against any and all Claims and Losses, to the extent caused by or arising as a result of (a) the breach by Ginkgo of this Agreement or material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Ginkgo under this Agreement, (b) the negligence, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement, (c) [***] and (d) any Claims by Ginkgo's employees, Permitted Subcontractors or agents for worker's compensation or other liability coverage, insurance, benefits, and other employee-related claims, and (e) the development, manufacture, use, handling, storage, importation, distribution, sale or other commercialization of Ginkgo Inventions by Ginkgo Page 55 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nor its Affiliates, agents, licensees, sublicensees or customers, in each case of clauses (a)-(e) of this Section 12.2 (Indemnification by Ginkgo) except to the extent BLI has an obligation to indemnify a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with such Claims and Losses pursuant to Section 12.1 (Indemnification by BLI).\n\n12.3 Procedure.

The Party seeking indemnification will reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Claim at the cost of the indemnifying Party. An indemnifying Party will not be obligated to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Party seeking indemnification if, and only to the extent, the Party seeking indemnification delays providing notice of a Claim to the indemnifying Party and the delay in notice substantively prejudices the ability of the indemnifying Party to successfully defend the Claim. The indemnifying Party may not make any admission on behalf of the Party seeking indemnification [***]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Party seeking indemnification may at any time choose to be represented by its own counsel at its expense (or at the indemnifying Party's expense if the indemnifying Party's defense is inadequate as determined by a reasonableness standard).\n\n12.4 Insurance. Each Party will obtain and carry in full force and effect the minimum insurance requirements set forth below.

For clarity, [***].\n\n12.4.2 Certificates of Insurance. Upon request by a Party, the other Party will provide Certificates of Insurance evidencing compliance with this Section 12.4 (Insurance). The insurance policies will be under an occurrence form, but if only a claims-made form is available to a Party, then such Party will continue to maintain such insurance after Expiration or the termination of this Agreement for a period of [***] ([***]) years following the end of the Term. 13.

If either Party commits a material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement, then the other Party may give the breaching Party written notice of such material breach. If the breaching Party fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days after such notice, then the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the breaching Party in its entirety. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the breaching Party has a bona fide dispute as to whether such breach has occurred or has been cured, it will so notify the non- breaching Party in writing and the cure period will be tolled until such dispute is resolved pursuant to Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution). Upon a final determination of breach or failure to cure, the breaching Party will have the remainder of the cure period to cure such breach. [***].\n\n13.2.2 Bankruptcy. Each Party will have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately in its entirety by giving written notice of termination to the other Party, if the other Party files a voluntary petition, or if an involuntary petition is granted in respect of the other Party and appeal proceedings are not commenced within [***] ([***]) Business Days from the date of such petition under the bankruptcy provisions of Applicable Law, or the other Party is declared insolvent, undergoes voluntary or involuntary dissolution, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or suffers the appointment of a receiver or trustee over all, or substantially all, of its assets or properties. All rights and licenses under or to Intellectual Property granted under or pursuant to this Agreement by one Party to the other are, and will otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, licenses of rights to intellectual property as defined under Article 101 (52) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Parties agree that each Party will retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and elections under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or such similar laws in a jurisdiction outside the United States.

In the event that termination is the result of an uncured, material Ginkgo breach of the Agreement under Section 13.2.1 (Material Breach), for Ginkgo's insolvency pursuant to Section 13.2.2 (Bankruptcy) or for an Extended Force Majeure Event with respect to Ginkgo pursuant to Section 14.8 (Force Majeure), then, as of the effective date of termination: (a) any and all existing Headstart Periods shall immediately be deemed to have accelerated to conclusion, (b) the restrictions on BLI set forth in Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) shall immediately deemed to have terminated; (c) the licenses granted to BLI from Ginkgo pursuant to Section 9.2 (Grants to BLI) shall survive, (d) the licenses granted to Ginkgo under Sections 9.1.1(c) (Grants to Ginkgo - Commercial License) and 9.1.2 (License Grant to Page 58 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nExploit [***]) shall survive, but shall convert immediately into royalty-bearing licenses as set forth in subclause (e) hereof, (e) Ginkgo shall to pay to BLI [***]; provided that in the event such uncured material breach is [***], Ginkgo, at its election to be made on or before the [***] ([***]t h) day following the effective date of termination (or, if later, within [***] ([***]) days of learning of the relevant royalties for Licensed Products), may elect, in lieu of royalties, to pay to BLI [***]; (f) the pricing terms for Beacon Optofluidic Machines, Consumables, and services (including Services) shall be consistent with then-current BLI List Prices; and (g) Ginkgo shall pay BLI for any amounts due for work performed by BLI under and in accordance with this Agreement prior to the effective date of termination or materials ordered prior to the effective date of termination to the extent that BLI cannot reasonably cancel or reallocate such work or materials.\n\n13.3.4 Effects of Termination Based Upon an Uncured BLI Breach or Insolvency. In the event that termination is the result of an uncured material BLI breach of the Agreement under Section 13.2.1 (Material Breach) or for BLI's insolvency pursuant to Section 13.2.2 (Bankruptcy), then: (a) Ginkgo's obligations to pay to BLI the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment under Section 7.2.2(a) (Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments) shall terminate, (b) BLI shall grant royalty-free status on all Licensed Products developed using the Beacon Platform and no royalties shall be payable by Ginkgo on any sale or transfer of such Licensed Products, (c) Ginkgo's obligations to pay to BLI the FOU License Fees pursuant to Section 7.4.1 (License Fees) shall terminate, (d) the licenses granted to Ginkgo from BLI in Section 9.1.1 (Scope of Grants) and 9.1.2 (License Grant to Exploit [***]) shall survive [***], (e) the licenses granted to BLI from Ginkgo pursuant to Section 9.2 (Grants to BLI) shall terminate, except with respect to any sublicenses granted by BLI under Section 9.2.2 for products and processes that were sold, commercialized or performed by BLI or to or for Third Parties prior to termination, which shall survive and such termination, but only if such sublicenses were granted in accordance with this Agreement, (f) the pricing terms for Beacon Optofluidic Machines, Consumables, and services (including Services) set forth in Section 5.2.2 (Pricing - Adjustments) shall survive for a period of [***] from the effective date of termination, (g) the restrictions on BLI set forth in Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) shall survive to the extent set forth therein and (h) any and all existing Headstart Periods shall survive for their duration. If any such uncured, material BLI breach is solely due to BLI's material failure to perform its supply-related obligations under this Agreement, Section 13.4 (Rights in Lieu of Termination for BLI's Material Breach of Supply Obligations) may apply in Ginkgo's sole discretion.\n\n13.3.5 Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event. In the event that termination is elected by Ginkgo based upon an Extended Force Majeure Event with respect to BLI pursuant to Section 13.2.1 (Force Majeure), then, as of the effective date of termination: (a) any and all existing Headstart Periods shall survive for their duration as if this Agreement had not been terminated, (b) the restrictions on BLI set forth in Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) shall survive to the extent set forth therein as if this Agreement had not been terminated; (c) the licenses granted to Ginkgo from BLI in Section 9.1.1 (Scope of Grants) and 9.1.2 (License Grant to Exploit [***]) shall survive and become perpetual, irrevocable and, subject to clause (f) of this Section 13.3.2, royalty-free; (d) the licenses granted to BLI Page 59 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom Ginkgo pursuant to Section 9.2 (Grants to BLI) shall survive; (e) any Licensed Products arising from Collaboration Workflows or Ginkgo Workflows developed or used by Ginkgo to good effect prior to the effective date of termination shall be royalty-free and no royalties shall be payable by Ginkgo on any sale or transfer of such Licensed Product; provided that, if [***], if [***], then, in order for the sale or transfer of Licensed Products arising from Collaboration Workflows or Ginkgo Workflows developed or used by Ginkgo to good effect prior to the effective date of termination to be royalty-free, Ginkgo must pay to BLI [***], but Ginkgo will have [***] ([***]) days following the effective date of termination to decide whether to make such payment to BLI or to pay royalties for such Licensed Products under subclause (f) of this Section 13.3.5 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event), (f) (i) for any Licensed Products arising from Workflows other than as set forth in subclause (e) of this Section 13.3.5 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event), Ginkgo shall pay [***] and (ii) Ginkgo shall pay [***]; provided that, if [***], then [***], (g) the pricing terms for Beacon Optofluidic Machines, Consumables, and services (including Services) shall be consistent with then-current BLI List Prices and (h) Ginkgo shall pay BLI for any amounts due for work performed by BLI under and in accordance with this Agreement prior to the effective date of termination to the extent that BLI cannot reasonably cancel or reallocate such work.\n\n13.3.6 Non-Limitation of Remedies.

Neither Party has any authority to enter into any contracts or assume any obligations for the other. Page 62 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\n14.3 Severability.

This Agreement will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any choice of law provision.\n\n14.5.2 Dispute Resolution. Except with respect to those disputes in which a Party seeks equitable relief pursuant to Section 14.5.3 (Equitable Remedies) or for which a Party or Person is expressly given final decision-making authority as set forth in Section 3.5 (Decision-Making), the Parties, through their Senior Officers, will make a good faith effort to settle any disputes that may arise between them with respect to this Agreement. If the Parties do not settle the matter within [***] ([***]) days after the delivery by one Party of written notice (the Arbitration Notice) to the other Party involved, then the Parties will submit the matter to binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware. All matters so submitted to arbitration will be settled by three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the [***], or its successor (the [***] Rules). In the event of a conflict between [***] Rules and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. Each Party will designate an arbitrator and the Parties will cause the designated arbitrators to mutually agree upon and to designate a third arbitrator who will serve as chairperson; provided, however, that failing such agreement within [***] ([***]) days of delivery of the Arbitration Notice, the third (3rd) arbitrator will be appointed in accordance with [***] Rules within an additional [***] ([***]) days. The Parties shall arrange for a hearing to occur and be completed within [***] ([***]) days after the appointment of the third (3rd) arbitrator, which hearing shall last no longer than [***], unless the arbitral panel believes a longer period is required, in which case the hearing may last [***]. The Parties will cause the arbitrators to decide the matter to be arbitrated within [***] ([***]) days after the close of evidence unless the chairperson arbitrator determines, at the request of any Party or on his or her own initiative, that such time period should be extended, in which case such time period may not be extended beyond an additional [***] ([***]) day period.

Each Party covenants and agrees that (a) it will produce documents as required by this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution), and (b) it will make its employees, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to make its former employees, available for depositions and hearing testimony as requested by the other Party. The final decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be in writing, in all events follow governing law and will be furnished to all the Parties in such dispute. Judgment on such decision may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Such decision may be used in a court of law only for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrators' award. Except as required by Applicable Law or to enforce an arbitrators' award, neither Party may disclose the existence, contents or results of an arbitration brought in accordance with this Agreement, or the evidence produced by its opposing Parties, or any analysis or summaries derived from such evidence. The Parties agree that all applicable statutes of limitation and Page 64 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-based defenses (such as estoppel and laches) will be tolled while the procedures set forth in this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) are pending. The Parties will cooperate in taking any actions necessary to achieve this result. Except as may be determined by the arbitrators, neither Party shall be penalized for delays resulting from dispute resolution conducted pursuant to this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution).\n\n14.5.3 Equitable Remedies; Single Forum.

At all times while any claim, action, suit or other proceeding between the Parties and/or any of their Affiliates (or among the Parties and/or any of their Affiliates and one or more Third Parties) arising out of or relating to this Agreement is pending in any court of competent jurisdiction, no dispute that is justiciable and can be joined to such pending claim, action, suit or other proceeding shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) without both Parties' mutual consent and, instead, either Party may join such dispute to the pending claim, action, suit or other proceeding by including such dispute in its pleadings or amending its pleadings. In the event that a motion to amend is required to achieve such joinder, the non- moving Party shall consent to such motion.\n\n14.6 Entire Agreement; Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto, sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and all prior agreements, understandings, promises and representations, whether written or oral, with respect thereto are superseded hereby. This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. The failure of a Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof will in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same. To be valid, a waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Party having the right that is waived or to whom the obligation to be waived is owed.\n\n14.7 English Language. This Agreement will be written and executed in, and all other communications under or in connection with this Agreement will be in, the English language. Any translation into any other language will not be an official version thereof, and in the event of any conflict in interpretation between the English version and such translation, the English version will control.\n\n14.8 Force Majeure. Any delay in the performance of any of the duties or obligations (other than payment obligations) of either Party hereto caused by a Force Majeure Event (defined below) shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement and the time required for performance shall be extended for a period equal to the period of such delay. Force Majeure Event shall mean acts of God, acts of the public enemy, war, terrorism, insurrections, riots, injunctions, embargoes, fires, explosions, floods, or other unforeseeable causes beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or negligence of the Party who is so prevented or delayed from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement by such Force Majeure Event (the Affected Party). The Affected Party shall give prompt written notice to the other Party of such cause and shall take whatever reasonable steps are appropriate in the other Party's discretion to relieve the effect of such cause as rapidly as possible. The Party not directly affected by the Force Majeure Event shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with written notice effective upon receipt if Force Page 65 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nMajeure Event continues to prevent performance or compliance in any material respect by the other Party for a period of more than [***] ([***]) days or should [***] ([***]) Force Majeure Events apply to the performance of such other Party during any [***] (each a Extended Force Majeure Event).\n\n14.9 Further Assurances. Each Party will duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such assignments, agreements, documents, and instruments, as may be necessary or as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof, or to better assure and confirm unto such other Party its rights and remedies under this Agreement.\n\n14.10 Third Party Beneficiaries. There are no Third Party beneficiaries under this Agreement, except to the extent a Third Party is indemnified pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance); provided that, in no event will any Third Party entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance) be allowed to enforce the terms thereof against a Party.\n\n14.11 Export Control. This Agreement is made subject to any restrictions concerning the export of products or technical information from the United States or other countries which may be imposed upon the Parties from time to time. Each Party agrees that it will not export, directly or indirectly, any technical information acquired from the other Party under this Agreement or any products using such technical information to a location or in a manner that at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval, without first obtaining the applicable license, approval, or written consent to do so from the appropriate agency or other governmental entity.\n\n14.12 References. Unless otherwise specified, (a) references in this Agreement to any Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule will mean references to such Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement, (b) references in any Section to any clause are references to such clause of such Section and (c) references to any agreement, instrument or other document in this Agreement refer to such agreement, instrument or other document as originally executed or, if subsequently amended, replaced or supplemented from time to time, as so amended, replaced or supplemented and in effect at the relevant time of reference thereto.\n\n14.13 Attachments. In the event of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and any Exhibits, Schedules or other attachments hereto, the terms of this Agreement will control, unless the relevant Exhibit, Schedule or other attachment explicitly references its inconsistency with this Agreement and states that it shall control.\n\n14.14 Non-Solicit. Neither Party will, [***], directly or indirectly with or through any Person, solicit for employment any Person who is an employee of the other Party; provided, however, that general solicitation of the public for employment shall not constitute a solicitation hereunder so long as such general solicitation is not designed to target any such Person. In the event that a Party solicits and then hires an employee of the other Party in violation of this Section 14.4 (Non-Solicit), the hiring Party shall, [***], within [***] ([***]) days of such hire, pay the other Party an amount equal to the [***] cash compensation actually paid to the individual Page 66 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\n([***]) by the non-hiring Party in the immediately prior calendar year and, further, if the individual solicited and then hired in violation of this is a Key Person under Section 5.4.1(b) (Dedicated FTEs; Key Persons), then BLI shall have [***] ([***]) months to identify an employee as the individual to replace such Key Person and any (a) [***] or (b) [***], in each case (a)-(b), to the extent due to the absence of such Key Person performing a Workflow Development Plan upon which the Key Person was engaged, shall be deemed waived for that [***] month period.\n\n14.15 Interpretation.
