Patients with a history of false labor had a significantly greater incidence of dysfunctional labor when true labor did commence. The frequency of cesarean section was also higher, though not statistically significantly so. The dilatation of the cervix and the station of the presenting part at admission were both significantly different in patients with false labor from those in true labor; however, the overlap of these two groups makes this of limited clinical use. Time of day and day of the week did not correlate with the likelihood of being admitted in false labor.", "output": "False labor.", "category": "Title Generation 1246.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.", "input": "Abstract: We undertook a study of the separate and combined effects of age and sex on the pulsatile pattern of GH secretion. The 24-h secretory profile of GH was generated by 20-min sampling in 10 young women (aged 18-33 yr), 10 young men (aged 18-33 yr), 8 postmenopausal women (aged greater than 55 yr), and 8 older men (aged greater than 55 yr). A computer-assisted pulse analysis program was used to assess both total GH secretion, as reflected in the 24-h integrated GH concentration (IGHC), and pulsatile secretion, as denoted by pulse frequency, duration, amplitude, and the fraction of GH secreted in pulses during the 24-h period (FGHP). IGHC was significantly greater in women than in men (P less than 0.025) and greater in the young than in the old (P less than 0.003). The mean pulse amplitude, duration, and FGHP were each greater in the young (P less than 0.006, P less than 0.03, and P less than 0.0001, respectively), but not significantly different between the sexes. The mean pulse frequency was not affected by sex or age. The serum concentration of free estradiol, but not free testosterone, correlated with IGHC (r = 0.46; P less than 0.005), pulse amplitude (r = 0.53; P less than 0.001), and FGHP (r = 0.59; P less than 0.0002). After correcting for the effects of estradiol, neither sex nor age influenced IGHC or mean pulse amplitude, while the effect of age on FGHP was reduced from 81% to 29%. Of the indices of GH secretion, FGHP had the strongest correlation (r = 0.43; P less than 0.006) with somatomedin-C. Somatomedin-C declined significantly with age in both sexes. Our results indicate that sex and age have independent and interrelated effects on GH secretion. These effects can be largely accounted for by corresponding variations in endogenous estradiol levels. These observations suggest an amplifying action of estradiol on the neuroendocrine regulation of pulsatile GH release.", "output": "Effects of sex and age on the 24-hour profile of growth hormone secretion in man: importance of endogenous estradiol concentrations.", "category": "Title Generation 1246.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.", "input": "Abstract: The study was designed to investigate the changes in axonal transport that result from disturbances in protein synthesis. Doxorubicin, an antineoplastic drug which interferes with the function of DNA, has a selective effect on peripheral sensory nerves because of the high vascular permeability in the dorsal root ganglia. After the intravenous administration of a moderate dose (4 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats, the transport of slow component a (SCa) was found to be retarded, transport velocity being decreased by 17% (0.85 +/- 0.06 mm/day vs 1.03 +/- 0.06 mm/day in controls). The transport kinetics of the fast anterograde and retrograde components (aFC and rFC) were unchanged after the administration of a dose of 6 mg/kg, although the relative amount of aFC was decreased by 27% (3.2 +/- 0.9% vs 4.4 +/- 1.1% in controls).

[3-3H]- and [U-14C]glucose were infused before, during, and after treadmill running. During exercise the increase in glucose production (Ra) was always directly related to work intensity and faster than the increase in glucose disappearance, resulting in increased plasma glucose levels. At identical work-loads the increase in Ra and plasma glucose as well as liver glycogen breakdown were higher in FF and control (C) rats than in FR rats. Breakdown of muscle glycogen was less in FF than in C rats. Incorporation of [14C]glucose in glycogen at rest and mobilization of label during exercise partly explained that 14C estimates of carbohydrate metabolism disagreed with chemical measurements. In some muscles glycogen depletion was not accompanied by loss of 14C and 3H, indicating futile cycling of glucose. In FR rats a postexercise increase in liver glycogen was seen with 14C/3H similar to that of plasma glucose, indicating direct synthesis from glucose. In conclusion, in exercising rats the increase in glucose production is subjected to feedforward regulation and depends on the liver glycogen concentration. Endogenous glucose may be incorporated in glycogen in working muscle and may be used directly for liver glycogen synthesis rather than after conversion to trioses. Fructose ingestion may diminish muscular glycogen breakdown.

The study was conducted double-blind on 2 days, 1 week apart, using a placebo-controlled crossover design. On each day, measurements at rest were made before and 20 minutes after 20 mg sublingual nifedipine or placebo and were followed by measurements made during exercise. Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased heart rate and cardiac output at rest and during exercise. It did not alter mean pulmonary artery or pulmonary artery wedge pressures at rest, but decreased them during exercise. Nifedipine decreased arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) from 96 +/- 10 to 90 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at rest and from 99 +/- 11 to 92 +/- 12 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) at submaximal exercise (33 +/- 21 W), but did not alter it (100 +/- 12 versus 100 +/- 16 mm Hg, p = NS) at maximal exercise (68 +/- 30 W).

The mineralized tissue developed within clusters of giant fat cells in the spaces between the cells. Investigations with light and electron microscopy demonstrated that in these sites there was some differentiation of the fibroblastic cells in an osteogenic direction, shown by changes to more polygonal shapes, and the synthesis of well-banded collagen similar to that found in bone tissue. Differentiation may be due, in part, to increased cell density in a confined space. Growth of the mineralized tissue was observed in the living cultures with a fluorescence microscope. Electron probe microanalysis confirmed that the mineral formed was hydroxyapatite. Initiating sites of mineralization included membranous vesicular bodies, lipid, and products of cellular degeneration. Once initiated, mineralization appeared to spread rapidly into adjacent collagenous and other structures, suggesting the appearance of a mixture of skeletal-type and dystrophic mineralization.", "output": "Mineralization in in vitro cultures of rabbit marrow stromal cells.", "category": "Title Generation 1246.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.", "input": "Abstract: We studied 54 neonates with acute cardiorespiratory illness and 21 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, to evaluate the accuracy of a nonheated pulse oximeter in predicting arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2).

We compared pulse oximeter SaO2 with simultaneously measured SaO2 (range 78% to 100%) using a co-oximeter. Over a wide range of values for heart rate, blood pressure, hematocrit, PO2, PCO2, and pH, linear regression analysis revealed a close correlation between in vivo pulse oximeter readings and in vitro SaO2 measurements in patients with acute (r = 0.86, Y = 29.64 + 0.68X) and chronic (r = 0.91, Y = 6.29 + 0.96X) disease.
