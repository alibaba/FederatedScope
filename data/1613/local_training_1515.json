I was twelve and me and my girfriend have been together since we were like five. She hated my friends but hung out with me to annoy my friends and since a few months before that I was very sceptical about are relationship. I was very low on money, as I 1. Spent my christmas money and money I got for doing good in school somewhere near the end of the year and I recieved very little pocket money. I had about 40 euros before that. On January 30th, 2016 I bought a lego dimensions expansion box, 30 euros. This is a videogame with actual lego and I wanted it for some time. I had only 11 euros by valentine\u2019s day. About a week before then she asked whether we should do something on valentine\u2019s day. It would have been on a sunday. I said that we could just hang out, but she insisted we\u2019d do something. It was the last week for star wars: the force awakens. We both had seen it and I said I\u2019d rather spend the day at her home or at mine, but she really wanted to go. The price for movie tickets were 11.50 a piece and thats excluding popcorn etc. I said I didn\u2019t have too much money so asked whether we could split the price 50/50, as I would recieve my pocket money before that. No no no, I should pay for it, she said, because that\u2019s romantic. Well, I don\u2019t have my money, but I\u2019m sure my parents could buy it! That\u2019s not romantic either. Fine, I\u2019ll pay she said. In addition, we also could buy a rose at school, but we said to each other that we wouldn\u2019t do it and I was planning to get one before we went to the movie theatre. That friday she texted me that she was very mad at me for not getting more money and spending it two weeks earlier, when we didn\u2019t have any plans for it yet. I responded saying this, she ignored that. Later that day, I got a rose. The last class of the day I sat in front of two girls who I regularly have a chit-chat with and explained the situation, which might\u2019ve made my girlfriend mad because she probably overheard me. The next day I was playing a sportsgame at 8 in the morning so I left and didn\u2019t check my phone. We got home and we left to go to an amusement park and were away the entire day. I had left my phone at home. We ate on our way home and got home at 9. Me being younger meant that I fell asleep immediately, again not checking my phone. The next day I had a lot of texts from the school group chat for homework so my girlfriend\u2019s text was at the bottom. I didn\u2019t read it and found out about it in the evening. We chatted for a while and she ended it with a \u2018see you tomorrow\u2019. We met up and she broke up with me. I know this is long, but thanks for reading anyway.

I also apologize for the format since I'm on my phone and have spent several days trying to type this out. \n\nFor some context, I (22f) and my husband (24m) have been married for almost 4 years now, and together for 7. His cousin (25f) *was* my best friend in HS and is the whole reason we met.\n\nThis is where I probably should provide some backstory. Her parents were already older when they married and had her, so she grew up surrounded by hospitals and medical problems and never really had a childhood. She's an only child who was basically raised to care for her parents from the start, while battling many medical issues herself (she had scoliosis as a kid and it caused permanent nerve damage and she has rods in her back). Going to college was the only chance she ever had at an escape, and even that was ripped from her after her first year when her father was diagnosed with cancer. \n\nA few years later my husband and I found out that she and her father (her mother was in a nursing home at this point as her dimentia worsened and she stopped allowing help) were in a rough spot financially so we decided, since we were able, that we would take the opportunity to help out. A month later her father (my husband's uncle) passed away. \n\nUpon news of his passing, her landlord immediately evicted her from the only home she's known, leaving her only 30 days to gather all of her things by herself while her hoarding mother is screaming in her ear about every gadget and knick-knack she should save. My husband and I immediately took her in to our home as at this point we're her only living family and he feels responsible for her. \n\nThis is where it gets tricky. As previously mentioned, she's older than both of us, yet has absolutely 0 actual life skills. In the past year and a half she has lived with us, we have become her parents, while she barely lifts a finger. We coerced her into getting her first ever real job working maybe 15~ hours a week (we don't need her money, we're just trying to do what we can to get her on her feet), made her get her driver's permit (that she \"loses\" every time we ask if she wants to drive so she demands we drive her), and cover absolutely all of her living expenses except for her phone. I do her laundry unwillingly as she mixes it in our basket, wash all of the dishes, and do generally every single bit of the household cleaning, minus changing her cat's litter box as I'm allergic to them (I have photo evidence of huge piles of poop just sitting and rotting on the carpet in \"her\" room). We also buy all of the groceries and do all of the cooking for 3 grown adults.\n\nWIBTA if I asked her to leave? We've sat her down before and tried to talk about her helping out, and she started crying about how much her life sucks and generally acts like it's our responsibility to fix.\n\nTLDR; crappy roommate/cousin/best friend walks all over me but has a super sucky life so I feel guilty \n", "output": "HYPOTHETICAL", "category": "Text Categorization 910.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote.

We have all come off the same flight which was delayed by 2 hours, so are 2 hours behind our individual schedules on top of the impending 6 hour roadie.   \n\nWe're having toilet breaks along the way but are all keeping it as brief as possible. We're driving away from a lunch break when a girl yells out to the driver to stop- she's lost her phone. A bit of communal panic ensues and we of course turn around and head back.\n\nThe girl is travelling with her bf who is obnoxious in a few ways: yawning ridiculously loudly in a small space without covering his mouth, falling asleep numerous times and essentially resting himself on my shoulder (I would politely inch forward until his gf would pull him back over), ball space to suit 3 men, etc etc. \n\nSo, she loses her phone and is STRESSED. We pull up, she jumps out, the driver jumps out as well and helps her look (we're on a small touristy island - in my home country - I can confidently say that if someone finds the phone, they're not handing it in). The bf doesn't get out to help her (???) but kind of looks around the seat half heartedly and ends up finding it under the seat. \n\nHe announces with zero sense of urgency: \"Yeah it's here ha ha, she's unbelievable.\"  We're all relieved. Maybe 15 seconds goes past and everyone's like uhh are you going to tell her? And he says, \"no she deserves to panic, she's always losing her shit, this happens all the time. Let her panic\". He says that she has to learn her lesson one day or another. I say half-jokingly, (enough for him to hear but not making a statement to the whole van) \"maybe right now isn't when she needs to learn the lesson though?\" He ignores me.\n\nWe're a van full of strangers watching her and the driver frantically run around this dodgy restaurant and he's laughing, and someone comments \"it's funny but the driver is out there stressing too sooo...\" Bf responds with: \"classic. She's so ridiculous. She would be so pissed.\"   By now we've awkwardly watched this shitshow for about 5 minutes. \n\nMe: \"surely tell her now?\"\nHim: \"no, it's funny?\" (Smug at this point). \n\nSo I lean over him, open the door and yell \"WE FOUND IT!\" She gets back in totally relieved and apologetic, we're all kinda laughing (with her) to make light of the situation. I say, \"he found it the moment you got out of the van\" and again others laugh, she laughs too but also looks at him like seriously?! \n\nHe then gives me absolute you-asshole daggers, mutters something under his breath and, to let her into her seat makes a point of completely shoving me out of the way (he's a 6 foot 3 male, I'm a 5 foot 3 female).

And on top of this I'm staying with a friend for a week, and last night he said something about how he didn't want to parent me but I had chose to drink the alcohol and to be there and it almost sent me into a panic attack. Another friend keeps telling me that because of how I dress and because I was there with him I had to have known why would have happened and another who I trusted a lot told me that he wants to know where I am when I go out because I put myself in these situations. This is why I turned the cops away.\n\nI know its my fault already I know I'm stupid and I fucked myself over and I get they have good intentions but all I want to do is scream at them and cry and my head starts spinning and ringing so much I can't hear or see them.

Things went pretty well at the start but we don't see each other much since we live on opposite side of the city. Problems only started happening recently and mostly only because I have been thinking about breaking up. We never really had too much in common: we're both studying similar majors in uni (that's how I met her); we're from different backgrounds and cultures; and smaller insignificant things like she doesn't eat fruit at all and I love fruit, she doesn't exercise and I like to keep fit, she a chocolate connoisseur and I'm not a sweet tooth, different music and film tastes, etc. But we agreed that didn't matter too much since it didn't really affect how we felt towards each other.\n\nTo give some context, she used to be very into me and wanted to spent time together. Now it seems that only I'm initiating to make plans, meet up and talk, which we don't really do more than once a week. I understand a lot of this strain comes from uni now that the semester's commenced but I sort of feel forgotten and pretty dissatisfied in general that she's not really putting too much effort into the relationship. This feeling isn't based on any empirical evidence; she always tells me that she likes me and has always talked us out of it; but it is based on her attraction to me relative to the past.\n\nWe both agreed before uni began that we would see each other Friday evenings after class and occasionally have dinner out. First week was great spending time together, didn't have dinner. Second week was rough; I felt she was a little cold to me for some reason and I ended up trying to break things off again. She talked me out of it, I ended up reconsidering, opening up to her about how I felt and explained that she needed to improve her communication (not the first time she's told me and not the first time I've told her). We went out for dinner after. Now this is the third week. Last night (Thursday), she invited me to sleep over at her place (parents present) on Friday night. I said I was feeling under the weather and was probably better if I didn't. Come Friday I'm excited to finally spend some time with my gf after a busy week and she tells me that she's spending the evening with her sister. No notice, no apology for surprising me with her sudden plans (she did apologise for \"making me feel sad\" but that's not the point). I've been feeling disrespected like this for a while now.\n\nOf course this one event doesn't encapsulate the whole situation but I do feel like there's been this problem for a while now. I know she's feeling stressed in uni and that's probably what's taking the toll on her to justify her behaviour recently. I don't think it's due to any fault in her character but I feel like she doesn't understand me. I've tried to be honest to her about but it always feels like my words are falling on deaf ears.

I saw this thread and sort of had something I needed to get out. Kinda a long post so here we go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there's sort of a lot of background to get through, I guess, for it to make a little more sense. My mum is a single-mother. Dad walked out when I was young, the typical story.  Basically, in my hometown, the only members of my family are me, my mum (who I'll call M) and my step-grandad (I'll label G here.) M's been obsessively protective of me throughout my entire life -- she basically cut herself off from anyone who wasn't me, and frequently told me things like how she doesn't \"**need any friends**\" because she \"**has me**\" and how I'm all she needed. I'm entirely aware of how unhealthy that is, don't worry. Throughout most of my teen years I frequently encouraged her to get out more and form actual connections that weren't me or her family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I eventually (clearly not what M wanted) moved three hours out of my hometown to go to university, and well, she took it with a mixed bag. But I thought she was coping well. Then recently, on call with her, she mentions how she's found a potential new job; and it's a job she's really been wanting to get for a while now. At first I'm happy for her -- but then she mentions it's way outside of my hometown. Immediately, my thoughts go to *G*\\- he has literally no one else in the town. The rest of our family don't bother contacting him (since he's only a step-relation, ties were cut after my Grandma died) and he's at that life stage where a lot of his friends are gone. M's about the only person he has left that still visits outside of nurses and such.  He's provided for and helped us for so long, the thought of him ending up alone is just, well, awful for me. He's well into late 80s, and his health isn't exactly well. My worry is if something happens and he just has no one around him to help. Or even anyone to talk to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM seemed surprised, and I think that she'd forgotten to even consider him, but she got angry at me for not supporting her after so long of telling her she needed to get out more and be ambitious. She pointed out that, well, she's not his caretaker or anything, so she doesn't have to stay and look after him. She also rightly brought up that *I* left without much debate about leaving him, so it's hypocritical of me. I'm less sure of that since well... I left thinking that she'd be there. Getting to the point, we got in a massive argument over it, where I brought up that she wasn't really considering anyone other than herself and that she had other things to consider before making a big move like that.  \n\nThis is without mentioning that said job would also be way closer to where my Uni is, so she'd effectively be moving to me. This didn't slip my attention either.\n\nWe fought, we called each other selfish, it was a bit of a yelling match over the phone and we haven't spoken a lot since. She did, however, tell the rest of the family who've contacted me trying to explain her side. \n\nThis includes G, who says that he just wants M to be happy. Which is what I expected from him, really. But it doesn't make me any less worried about him being left behind in his last years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now I'm just worrying -- because I'm starting to see it from her point of view. For years I've gone on to her about pursuing what she wants to do, but when she turns around and says she's going to, I've essentially said \"no not like that\". I just really don't like the idea of my grandad being alone but I'm beginning to think telling my mum that I didn't approve of what she wants to do might have been the wrong move. She clearly felt really passionate about this job opportunity, and she was excited to tell me. And I just shut her down because I didn't really think about how much she'd wanted this.

My work consists of me helping my dad on our own construction site. It's a pretty large construction site for the fact that there are few workers. Usually it's my Dad and an unskilled labourer. When I have a holiday I go to help him because I understand that he is working for me and my brother's future. Usually I go from 7 am-11 am (4 hours since I'm underage). In these Christmas holidays I've been going everyday except Sunday and Christmas. I didn't go for the last 2 days since I had to go do voluntary work for a school project. \n\nAnyway, yesterday I told my Dad that I didn't need to voluntary work tomorrow (which is today) so I can come to work he said he'll find me something to do. My dad pays me since he thinks that motivates me to come to work and I'm grateful. This morning I woke at 6:30 had breakfast and changed  my clothes to the concrete caked ones and rode my bike to the construction site it takes me about 5 minutes to get there at normal speed on my bike. On arrival I left my bike near the door and closed it and went inside the kitchen put on safety shoes and drank a glass of water.\n\n I went up stairs to the part if the building still being built and I found my dad and the unskilled labourer (Who was pretty new about 3 weeks) building the roof of a room. I asked my dad what I should do and he told me to take the scattered stones around the room near the buzzsaw. After, I helped the labourer take up a stone on his shoulder (about 30 by 8 inches of limestone) and he climbed onto the ladder to pass it to my dad. My dad told him not to lift it like that (from his back) and when I helped him lift it onto his shoulder again, my dad told me (in our language, the labourer was foreign) \"Has this guy never seen anyone lift a stone?\" I wasn't sure how to respond since I forgot the proper way to lift it too. Then he showed him how. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later he got a call from the guy we borrowed the material lift from that they were outside and came to get it. My dad said to me \"Already? We just have to lift these last few things and we will give it to them, go open the door for them.\" So I went downstairs and opened the door for them I couldn't see them clearly due to my -7 eyesight and me not wanting to break my glasses at work so I waved to them but when they didn't respond I taught they were the neighbours and got slightly embarrassed/awkward.  \"Come in\" I said but they must have heard \"Coming\" instead and said don't worry. I was confused so I went back upstairs and saw my dad and the labourer carrying the lift and then tying it up so we would lift it with the crane (Which was in the courtyard) onto the ramp were the truck with stones usually comes for deliveries. \"Go open the gate\" my dad said. The gate was locked from the outside so I had to go open. I opened the gate for the truck to go onto the ramp. \n\nMy dad then asked me from the 1st floor where the lift and room with roof they were working on where \"Did the truck come in?\" Why did he ask me this? Sound travels badly here so If I could hear him asking me this question he should be able to see the truck. I respond with a loud \"yes\" so that he can hear me. I went back upstairs and drove the tower crane with the lift onto their truck and proceeded to go back downstairs and close the gate. When I went back upstairs my dad asked me why I was shouting I told him so that he could hear me. He told me the I embarrassed him in front of the truck drivers by yelling and getting angry. What? He didn't even talk to them! I've been told I always sound angry which is probably true but what was I supposed to do! He asked me a question! \n\nWell whatever I brushed it off and went back to work. I started sweeping the floor off debris and stone dust into a wheelbarrow. While doing that I talked to my dad about something that popped into my head, \"I thought Noel (my brother) was coming with you guys tonight to the dinner of your friends? Is he coming with me to sleep at our grandparents? Did he change his mind?\" He then said \"Let him do whatever he wants.\" My dad then went to cut some stones in the other room with the buzzsaw. \n\nI continued sweeping the floor. Labourer comes in the room with a stone carrier and a stone on it and lays the stone on the floor.  He then stares at the ladder breathing heavily. Then after staring for about a minute at the ladder proceeds to move it to the side and also move the concrete bricks underneath to make the ladder higher. He then goes back out of the room. He then comes in with a new stone on the carrier and dies the same thing again. What? Why does he keep doing that? He didn't even use the ladder before. And instead of going round the pile of stone dust he proceeds to trample over it with the carrier and his himself. He did this last week too. This fucker. He can spend a minute staring at a fucking ladder but he can't waste a second to go round the pile I was sweeping. Ok I wasn't that angry since it happened before but I was annoyed. Whatever. He then comes back into the room with a new stone and proceeds to do the same thing minus the trample thing.\n\nWhat even is going on? I go to the other room. \"Dad, what was is it you told him to do? He keeps moving the ladder around.\"\n\"I told him to move the ladder so he can put stones instead of the ladder\"\n\"Why is he moving it each time he comes into the room?\"\n\"Every time you do this! Mind your own business, I'm in charge of him! This isn't school! Going to report people to the teacher.\"\nWhat the hell! Last time I did this was 5 months ago when a different labourer kept staring about and doing nothing when he could be doing something! \n\nI got the wheelbarrow I was filling with stone dust and debris took it to its room. I put my broom and shovel in the storage room and went downstairs. I checked my phone it should be 9 at least by now right? 8:20 and a missed call. It was mom, I called her back\n\"Honey, ask dad if he opened the garage so that the maid can come in and call me back with his answer\"\n\nSo I went and asked him.\n\"He said yes mom, also in coming home early\"\n\"Isn't there anything to do?\"\n\"Not really, bye\"\n\nMy dad always told me if you don't want to be here you can leave I'm not forcing you. I never did leave early since when I started in June since I felt guilty, even in days where it was 35\u00b0C and I was stuck driving the crane. \n\"Dad,I'm leaving\"\n\"Bored already?\"\n\"Yes\"\nIn my mind I rationalized there was no crucial work to be done and I would end up wasting time.\nI already felt terrible for leaving work early because i felt entitled and thought it would be awkward later today when he comes home.\n\nWhen I arrived home I heard Mom in her new office talking in the phone. Then I realised it was dad.\n\"What's going on?\"\n\"DAHunter go get your laptop down here you're not allow to use it\"\n\"What? Why!\"\n\"Dad has been telling me how you yelled at him in front if the construction workers, reporting your brother and reporting the labourer!\"\nI couldn't help it, I yelled at her\n\"WHAT THE HELL HE IS MAKING STUFF UP I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT\"\nShe then got off the phone, my mom has a problem with stress and I felt bad for shouting.\nI then proceeded to explain my side if the story.\n\"DAHunter, you're racist! You always go report anything the labourers do wrong just because they are black!\" \nWhat has that got to do with anything?\n\"I don't hate black people mom! I hate idiots!\"\n\"That doesn't excuse you embarrassing your father!\"\nShe then shouted from across the house \n\"Noel! Get off your computer and come do your homework!\" (Noel is 12 and that's not his real name). \n\nI then went to take a shower for about 20 minutes. I still can't see what I did wrong. Maybe from their point if view I did something wrong because I'm easily angered. My shout sounds angry, My dad thinks I always pick on my brother even when he is not there and apparently I'm a racist and can't stand people. Sorry this was so long but I wanted as much if the story here since I'm not sure during which moment I was an asshole in.\n\nTL:DR My dad got mad at me at work for yelling and apparently embarrassing him and asking him what the hell the labourer was doing. I went home and he called my mom with a version that was to me, twisted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "output": "HISTORICAL", "category": "Text Categorization 910.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote.

However, unbeknownst to Joey, his feelings for Monica are unrequited.\n\nIn my private discussions with Monica and Joey, I've gleaned some very important details about the situation.\n\n1. Monica is aware that Joey \"probably\" has feelings for her, but they've both been very passive about discussing their relationship. She's been waiting for Joey to confess his interest in her so that she could let him down. So it looks like for better or worse, she's been stringing him along for at least four months.\n\n2. Joey has told me in no uncertain terms that he likes Monica. In fact, he's already begun to refer the two of them as a couple despite it not ever having been communicated.\n\n3. Monica has feelings for me. And damn it all, I can't conceal my emotions too well. I'm pretty sure she knows that I like her too just from how much I blush with every little hint (read: very obvious sign) she gives me. I'm pretty sure it's because she likes me that she doesn't like Joey.\n\nI'm not the type to go behind someone's back. I've already relayed all the information I've listed here and more to Joey. I made it clear to him that I have feelings for Monica and that it's likely that she actually has feelings for me. His reaction has been expectedly poor, basically outright denial.\n\nI've encouraged Joey to talk to Monica about the situation, but he still hasn't, probably for fear of rejection. It's been about six weeks already and two weeks ago, I made him an ultimatum: In a week's time, I would talk to Monica about the situation to get things straightened out if Joey didn't do it himself.\n\nAs you can guess from the wording, I still haven't talked to Monica about it despite saying that I would. I really want Joey to get the closure he needs by doing it himself, because I'm sure the whole situation is painful enough and I don't want to hurt his feelings any more than they already are.\n\nThat being said, I don't want to continue to put this part of my life on hold for the sake of Joey's feelings. I feel like I've waited long enough and said everything that I could to be as transparent as possible about everything.\n\nSo with all this in mind (and more, if you need more information), would I be the asshole if I made a move on Monica?", "output": "HYPOTHETICAL", "category": "Text Categorization 910.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote.

She just lashes out in anger and rarely tries to make up afterwards, even going as far as to say that it's our fault for pissing her off and being so uncooperative in the first place. And any perceived sign of disrespect (real or not) at all is immediately pointed out and I'm scolded for it. Recently, when I revealed that I feel safer talking with my biological mother (who has a history of drug abuse and is very financially unstable, on top of the fact that she use to stand us up during visitation. Still, I feel like I can talk to her and trust her more) , she launched into this huge, night-long lecture about how ungrateful I am for the work she puts into us, and how she loves us more than that woman ever could, and that if I wanted to be with our biological mom so badly then why don't we try and live with her. Any little thing can piss her off, and she launches into a lecture about how I need to have good grades so I don't end up in my parent's basement like my biological mom did, or worse. One time, she started to yell at my sister who was hyperventilating and obviously having an anxiety attack from already being chewed out for her grades. Occasionally, my stepmom changes up rules when they've always been a certain way, and pretends like it's always been like that. Because of her temper and different way of thinking, I never feel like I could share my inner thoughts around her; they always get targeted as some form of disrespect or they get shrugged off as childish. Both of my parents never seem to take me seriously, and treat me like I know nothing. My stepmom is also incredibly passive aggressive to everybody in the house; even my dad. I'm honestly just afraid of her; she never seems to be able to control her feelings and I can't relax while she's in the house because she'll probably find something to get stressed about.\n\nI'm not even a bad kid; I try my hardest in school and I really try to make my parents happy because I care about them. I used to love my stepmom but for some reason that feeling's just faded entirely into an urge to get the hell out of this house.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "output": "HISTORICAL", "category": "Text Categorization 910.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote.

It's like they can't go out without having liquor. I don't drink, so I don't understand the near-constant need to drink. \n\nWhenever we go out around someone's birthday, it ends up as \"We're paying for X's dinner, because it's their birthday.\" Well, this burns me for a few reasons. First is that my friends make a LOT more money than me, but secondly, they always pick something expensive, where I can barely afford food for me, much less an appetizer, drinks, and an entree for the birthday person. Third, it's always something I won't eat. 95% of the time, it's Asian. I'm limited on what I will eat because it will give me bathroom problems if it has too many spices. I'm limited to white rice and a bland meat, with salt and pepper. I do eat other things, and regret it later. An example of this was a friend chose Asian seafood for her birthday. I checked out the (expensive) menu and found one thing I could eat safely, teriyaki chicken and white rice. Birthday girl chose a family-style meal which started at $100, and contained literally NOTHING I could have. So I would've been paying upward of $40 after food, drinks, and tip for food I can't have. \n\nAnother thing is that we have different schedules. I work nights and they all have regular 9-to-5 jobs. When asked when were available to hang out, I'll give them a time, it's agreed on... then changed so I can't make it. This time, I suggested breakfast, because they I can go home to sleep, which THEY AGREED TO, then just today, they've changed it to a liquid lunch and karaoke and then a hard lunch, probably on an Asian place, based on the neighborhood. \n\nI feel like an asshole, mainly because they tell me I am. They tell me I don't try (which is bullshit, I think, as I try many cuisines because I like to eat, and I want to know what I CAN'T eat), but it seems like they're outvoting me as a group to do what the majority wants. Which isn't a problem, I just don't understand why they ask when everyone can make it, then change it so I'm the ONLY person who can't make it. \n\nI made it a New Year's resolution to try to see my friends more, but this situation made me realize exactly WHY I don't like to see them. They always make me feel excluded, mainly because I can't afford to do the things they do (they all just had a spa day together that I found out about via whatsapp), and say \"That's okay, you don't have to come.\" \n\nI feel like, with the spa day, and everything else, just stop inviting me. Hell, I've been trying to extricate myself from these people for years, and it always comes down to \"/U/notastepfordwife, you're not trying, you're kinda selfish, but we love you.\" I feel like, if I'm the asshole, they wouldn't want to be around me, either, right? But they want to hang out, and I keep doubting myself. I know I'm an asshole in some respects, but is this one on me? Am I just not doing all I can to be a good friend?\n\nHelp me out, here.

There is a chance that me and [sister\u2019s name] could go down to [coworkers] house in orlando for 5 days. Could you stay at the house with Cookie?  It would be in late march or april. Not around Easter. I dont have anyone else to watch her. Otherwise we cant go now or on any small vacation.\u201d\n\nI was shocked and immediately hurt and upset because I haven\u2019t been on a family vacation in two years, or any vacation. I had also just talked with my mom a couple weeks ago about how disappointed I was that my boyfriend has no PTO time to go on a vacation with me this year (no fault of his own, he doesn\u2019t get a lot, and has to help his parents move this year). \n\nso, my mom already knew that I have an excess of PTO that I can use, and nobody to use it with. \n\nI have always felt like my mom favors my sister more than me, because she\u2019s the youngest, she\u2019s 21 and I\u2019m 24. My sister also lives with her at the moment because she dropped out of college and doesn\u2019t work. My sister claims she has an anxiety disorder that prevents her from going to school or working, but has still not been diagnosed after about 2 years of this, IMO she\u2019s a hypochondriac, but that\u2019s not the issue here. \n\nThe dog, Cookie, is also my sisters dog.\n\nMy mom has taken vacations with my sister before and excluded me for other reasons, \u201cit was your sisters birthday\u201d , \u201cshe has school break, and you work full time \u201c etc..  my mom always says she wants to do a vacation with the three of us, but hasn\u2019t since I was in high school. \n\nMy sister has no income and my mother buys her new clothes, electronics, and gave her money for a new car after she crashed her old one ( also paid for by my mom) this year. \n\nI could go on, but the point is my sister gets a lot from my mom, whereas I have been financially independent from my mom since the age of 17 when I went off to college. I don\u2019t get her health insurance, I pay for my own phone, rent, utilities, clothes.. you name it. \n\nI have a good relationship with my mom despite all of this, we see each other often, and talk in the phone every day. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m so hurt. I was really blindsided by being excluded from this.\n\nFinally, it would be very inconvenient for me to stay at my mom\u2019s house because it would add another half hour each way onto my commute to work, which is already a half hour. So a full hour of extra drive time, extra gas, every day. \n\nI also do not have a bed or bedroom at the house anymore, and she has not offered to pay me. \n\nI know this has been super long, so if you got here, thanks for reading!\n\n**TL;DR : my mom &amp; sister are taking vacation without me and expect me to dog sit at their home for 5 days without payment while they go**", "output": "HYPOTHETICAL", "category": "Text Categorization 910.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote.

There are home heath aids for a reason, and I dont mind taking food over to him semi-regularly.  However, his home I recently learned, is not fit for human habitation. \n\nNo, you're thinking, but OP if he's been a family friend since before you were born how were you never in his house before? Well, because cats and I like breathing. But seriously, he never hosted gatherings and when extra folding chairs or the like were needed he would go over and get them and bring them back. He's a super private person and has always been well groomed and presentable.\n\nHis health took a turn for the for the worse about a year and a half ago when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Chemo weakend him but he kept going. ~5 mo ago he got the news that it spread all through his body in the form of bone (and I think lymph node) cancer.  Stage 4. He doesn't have much medical background and doesn't want to know, but I don't think he has more than a month or three left. He can barely hold a conversation much less go upstairs to his bedroom without being out of breath.

He is now 15 and she has never met him. My brother has since had another child and my sister has two kids who again she has never met. I am now pregnant with my first child and I know she would not have them this baby either. However she has met and had a relationship with my cousins kids. \n\nI saw her for the first time in years at my Dad\u2019s 60th which I helped to organise, but I didn\u2019t know she would be there. My  Dad\u2019s girlfriend must have invited her. She didn\u2019t acknowledge me or my brother. My sister did not attend as she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with my father. \n\nI have somewhat repaired my relationship with my Dad but I keep it up for his sake mostly. I don\u2019t really get anything out of it. I just feel guilty if I don\u2019t have some sort of relationship with him. \n\nI\u2019m really uncomfortable with the thought of going to the funeral. I barely speak to my cousins and I know they will be fully involved in the funeral. I\u2019m worried they will judge us for coming and blame us for not having a relationship with her. I also don\u2019t want to listen to a eulogy about how great she is when she treated me, my siblings, our kids and my Dad terribly. I also had to take time off sick from work lately due to pregnancy related issues and they were so understanding. I\u2019m entitled to bereavement leave but I hate asking for more time off. I also don\u2019t want people at work hearing my grandmother died and being all pitying and I\u2019ll just come across heartless because I\u2019m upset about it. I mean I feel really weird and anxious about it but I\u2019m not sad that she died. \n\nDoes that make me a terrible person? My brother thinks we should go to be there for my Dad, that it\u2019s the right thing to do.  And to be honest if my brother has to go back home to face all the small town gossipers, I don\u2019t want him to face it alone and I feel like we should be able to walk in there with our heads held high as we did nothing wrong. I just don\u2019t feel like honoring this woman. \n\nTL:DR: Didn\u2019t have relationship with grandmother. Not a nice woman. AITA for not wanting to go to her funeral?

My wife has a very \u201cold school\u201d or traditional way of viewing how a marriage/relationship works. It all started when we met about 9 years ago. She would expect me to pay on our dates etc. (This is normal, I get courtship, and continued doing this for some time) until things got more serious. 2 years or so into our relationship we began splitting tabs when going out etc. we made roughly the same income and were students at the time... little did I know that she resented me for this.. she hated splitting the tab and bills after we moved into together. She always believed the man should be the breadwinner. Despite us both graduating from college and getting good jobs, I still feel the tension is there. We now combine all of our finances. I make roughly double her income now... but I know that if I made less than her, we would probably argue a lot more. Her mindset is even applied outside of finances. She simply believes that the man should take the burden of everything. She believes her gender allows her a free pass to bend the rules. We fight about this constantly. I feel that she has a double standard when it comes to our relationship. She can spend money on things because she needs them, but I\u2019m rarely ever allowed to spend money without her complaining. Funny thing is that when it comes to chores, she wants 50/50 in that area.. seems pretty convenient... She\u2019s like a \u201cselective\u201d traditional gal.

We were listening to a talk, and he mentioned high paying careers usually held by women, and at the top of the list was a OB/GYN and their salary was listed at around $120,000. She turned to me and said that all the careers listed didn't earn much. I asked for clarification, and she definitely included the OB/GYN. I feel like she has totally unreasonable expectations for the amount of work she puts in.\n\nIn addition, she wants to go to college near Major City because it hosts many concerts. If she goes to one of those schools, I feel like she will spend all of her money on concerts, and skip class all the time to go to those concerts. Even if she doesn't go to a school near Major City, she has gone by car to concerts 6 hours away.\n\nShe expects to have predictable hours as a surgeon, and not have any emergency surgeries that she will have to skip concerts for. She is fully expecting to attend many concerts as a surgeon.

These episodes happen very suddenly--he'll go from sweet and affectionate to extremely cold and standoffish from one day to the next. Like, we'll hang out as usual, and then the next morning he'll be 'gone': no texts, no calls, nothing. He won't respond to any attempts at reaching out from my side either. Then, whenever the episode is over, he'll bounce back acting like nothing ever happened.\nIt's confusing because during his 'good' times he is very vocal about how much he loves and appreciates me. I adore him as well--I feel a deep connection with him and have always tried to be there for him through whatever happened in his life (family troubles, stressful new job, several moves). \n\nTo illustrate: the latest episode has now been going on since late November, that means no contact at all since then. I texted M the other day asking to meet up because I wanted to talk to him about something that I didn't want to discuss over text, to which he replied (to my surprise) that he could meet on the weekend and he'd keep me updated. Friday comes and goes by, so does Saturday. He then texts me late on Sat asking if I could do Sunday, to which I replied sure, but only in the morning/noon since I had work later in the day. Nothing came after that. Now it's Thursday and I'm somewhat hurt that he didn't even tell me he couldn't make it, especially since I see he is active on social media. I definitely understand that being online doesn't mean feeling well enough to socialize, but I would have really appreciated at least a short heads up. Also, I see him liking lots of tweets about how people with BPD love the ones who stick with them through periods of isolation and how getting mad at them when they ignore you will only make them isolate themselves further. \n\nI understand that he doesn't ignore me because he hates me or whatever, but rather that his illness makes him want to isolate himself. The only real problem I have is that these periods happen without warning, can last very long, and I am expected to just bounce back to 'best friend mode' whenever he does. The current situation has been pretty bad for my own mental health and although it may be selfish, I also feel really upset that I can't help him with whatever he is going through that makes him isolate himself so much. \n\nI am now considering trying to get a hold of M to tell him that I don't want to continue the friendship and explain my reasoning. I thought about taking the current isolation as a hint, so to speak, and just not reply whenever he feels like being my friend again. But that would feel like an asshole move to me.

Worried about it, but seeing as it was from my GF's homecountry, I asked her about it and yes, she had given account access to her mother. I told her I didn't appreciate it the fact that she didn't ask me about it first, honestly if she had done so I wouldn't have had an issue with it. \n\nAbout a week later, I get another notification, same country.

I told my GF that if there were going to be more new login or access requests to please tell me first and I would be fine with it. It costs me nothing per month, and it's a major plus for them. \n\nBut then this dude started to log in on different devices, and I got in about 2 weeks repeated log in notifications from Netflix (about one every 2-3 days), and every time I would ask my GF to please check with her family.

The tipping point came when my subscription got changed, supposedly I guess because the maximum number of simultaneous devices had been reached, and her bro (according to her not knowing English) just saw some pop-up  and clicked \"OK\" to continue and watch whatever. \n\nI was mad at this, I felt that at the very best case scenario her brother did not give a shit about using someone else's service, not understanding that this was lent as a favor, and should be letting me or my GF know before hand when logging in or asking if he didn't know what he was doing. At the worst, I now had a bunch of unknowns using my account. \n\nMy GF ended up getting her own Netflix account, which to me is a relief.

I had an ok relationship with my parent who I don\u2019t live near, lets call them parent #2 but it was a very stressful. My parents split was very messy and parent #2 alway tried to make it a pick parent #1 or me and was always pushing to spend every moment with them.

Parent #2 also argued that they didn\u2019t have to support me if I didn\u2019t see them enough and since the day I turned 18 even when I still saw #2 on an almost daily basis they did not support me financially. \n\nAfter moving I was basically pressured into visiting once after only 3 months even when I had a visit planned for about six months out. Well not parent #2 wants me to keep up a 3 month routine and honestly I don\u2019t want to see #2 that often. #2 just always makes me feel like crap and pressures me into things I don\u2019t want to do. Now don\u2019t get me wrong I still like #2 but its just shitty to be pressured to do everything. They act like they give me options, but I know that the options aren\u2019t really options.

I do know that she has a lot of emotional trouble, not a lot of friends and has problems with my father (he has the tendency to always complain about our mother, hurray) but she is economically supported and is encouraged to discover the world. She has one more year to go before she finishes college.\n\nPeople always had the tendency to compare us (as any other siblings) but it was terrible last summer.

I tailgated a car for some time, honked at it, and blew past it, inadvertently cutting him off and forcing him to brake. I admit I made very poor choices; I\u2019ve learned from them and matured as a driver since. \n\nThe man (a very big, early 40\u2019s guy) at the next red light, got out of his car, stormed up to my window, and went ballistic. He spat on me, screamed a series of **extremely** vile racial slurs, death threats (including graphic references to lynching/hanging) and obscenities at me and **my two small daughters** for a full 2 minutes (impeding traffic for some of this time). He screamed **so** unbelievably loud, got freakishly red, the veins started popping out of his head; I was honestly expecting him to have a stroke or burst a vessel. But worst of all, my kids and I feared he might hurt or even kill us.\n\nThe incident terrified me, but scarred my daughters. They cried and cried, had nightmares about the encounter for a long time afterwards, and I had to have some very long discussions with them that I really wished I would not have to have until they were much, much older. The incident sickened and enraged me like nothing I have ever experienced. I just so happened to catch it all on my dashcam; I turned the cam towards him the moment he started in (as evidence if he were to assault me), and saved the footage on my computer just in case I ever had another run in and needed evidence.\n\nCut to two years later. I\u2019m at an upscale brewery/restaurant with some buddies, look over at the bar area, and who do I see behind the counter, dressed in a nice suit and managing the bar? **The raging driver.** Still bitter, I made eye contact with him, and he froze like a statue and went white with shock when he saw &amp; recognized me. Throughout that dinner, I continued to torment him with a series of sly little grins. When I left to take a bathroom break, he approached me.\n\nHe apologized to me profusely. He claimed he\u2019s severely bipolar and that that was one of his manic outbreaks; he assured me he is not in any way racist or violent, and that if he could do anything to take back his words, he would. He claims to have since gotten his life together; having gone to therapy, gotten medicated, ended his drug abuse habits, etc, and promises me that he is a very changed man. I responded by telling him I still have that video of him raging, can destroy his life and career with a single click, and promptly walked away.\n\nI\u2019m very seriously considering sending the video to his manager, AND even posting the video publicly on social media. Now I know the guy\u2019s name and more info about him, and that he works (and might live) in my close vicinity, I realize it could really make a splash.

My SIL lives next door and is kind of a shitty cat owner.
