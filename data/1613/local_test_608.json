It was then discontinued, so my husband and I have become &#34;users,&#34; meaning we tried them out for about 1 month. Now they are all gone or really expensive, and we've found nothing that's as effective. My husband has tried other brands in his quest to find something even remotely comparable that actually works but none of theirs do. They're expensive too.", "output": "Bad review", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1545.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an English language product review, determine if it is a Good Review or a Bad Review.

Unfortunately the printing is very poor even for a hardcover. There are many places with missing words, such as &#34;it is&#34; or some other type of error. The font size makes reading difficult.

If the product is connected to power there are lines on screen no matter what resolution we get through an adapter. The only way I can keep a signal and see any detail is if you don't connect or disconnect your HDMI cable from the source every couple minutes. This happened at first until I figured out the problem was with this product. Not impressed and sending back. Bought another brand for same price that works. \n Rating: 1.", "output": "Bad review", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1545.json"}]
