Cuomo  with the Essential Plan  a form of Obamacare  that since 2016 has been providing free or low-cost health coverage to low-income New Yorkers. It currently has 710 000 enrollees.\n Team Cuomo  has chosen not to refuse the money or warn Washington about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. Instead  they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone with option C: sue the feds to keep the broken ATM running until someone gets it fixed or turns it off.\nThe surprising truth emerged last week  when the Empire Center obtained a state Department of Health memo being shared with insiders. It showed the Essential Plan running a hefty surplus  which  Cuomo  intends to use for plugging holes elsewhere in the state budget.\nThe situation is all the more surprising because the plan recently took a $1 billion cut to  its  federal funding  courtesy of a constitutional flaw in President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Affordable Care Act. Plus  the memo says the state has been overpaying the insurance companies who manage the benefit under contract with the state.\nWorse is the  Cuomo  administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan to spend the surplus on other programs  such as subsidizing financially weak hospitals. Once the feds wake up to that diversion  they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re liable to demand repayment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as state Senate Health Chairman Kemp Hannon (R-L.I.) warned last week at a budget hearing. If New York somehow wins its suit and claims another billion-plus dollars  it will be digging the hole even deeper.\n Cuomo  and  his  aides see New York as being under attack from Washington \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on tax policy  immigration and other issues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and may feel that all is fair in political warfare. But the money they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to grab comes from taxpayers  not the President or Congress. Their gamesmanship with public funds gives the whole enterprise of government-funded health care a bad name.\n Better Cuomo  should drop the lawsuit  urge Congress to rewrite the funding formula and come fully clean about the Essential Plan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finances: Did it run a surplus before now? If so  what happened to the extra money? And why wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any of this made clear to the taxpaying public?", "output": "Cuomo", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Lipkowitz had a handheld electronic datebook that  he  purchased on a trip to Tokyo   and on May 11  2005  at 2:20 p.m.   he  started using it to keep a record of  his  actions. Instead of entering  his  future appointments   he  entered  his  past activities  creating a remarkably complete account of  his  life. In one sense this was just a normal personal journal  albeit in a digital format and unusually detailed. But the format and detail made all the difference.  Lipkowitz  eventually transferred the data to  his  computer  and now  using a few keyboard commands   he  can call up  his  history.  He  knows how much  he  has eaten and how much  he  has spent.  He  knows what books  he  has read and what objects  he  has purchased. And of course   he  knows the answer to  his  original question. \u201cI was thinking I was spending an hour a day cleaning up after this person \u201d Lipkowitz says.  He  shrugs. \u201cIt turned out it was more like 20 minutes.\u201d\nThese men all know that their behavior is abnormal. They are outliers. Geeks. But why does what they are doing seem so strange? In other contexts  it is normal to seek data. A fetish for numbers is the defining trait of the modern manager. Corporate executives facing down hostile shareholders load their pockets full of numbers. So do politicians on the hustings  doctors counseling patients and fans abusing their local sports franchise on talk radio. Charles Dickens was already making fun of this obsession in 1854  with his sketch of the fact-mad schoolmaster Gradgrind  who blasted his students with memorized trivia. But Dickens\u2019s great caricature only proved the durability of the type. For another century and a half   it  got worse.\nOr  by another standard  you could say  it  got better. We tolerate the pathologies of quantification \u2014 a dry  abstract  mechanical type of knowledge \u2014 because the results are so powerful. Numbering things allows tests  comparisons  experiments. Numbers make problems less resonant emotionally but more tractable intellectually. In science  in business and in the more reasonable sectors of government  numbers have won fair and square.\nI recently received an e-mail message from a 26-year-old filmmaker named Toli Galanis  who keeps track of about 50 different streams of personal data  including activities  health  films watched and books read  the friends he talks with and the topics they discuss. While Galanis acknowledged that he gets pleasure from gathering data and organizing  it  intelligently   it  was a different aspect of his report that caught my attention. \u201cI know that immediately after watching a bad movie I am more apt to be negative about my career prospects as a filmmaker \u201d he wrote  explaining that tracking has made him better able to detect the influence of seemingly trivial circumstances on his mood and decisions.\nThe idea that our mental life is affected by hidden causes is a mainstay of psychology. Facility in managing the flow of thought and emotion is a sign of happiness and good adjustment. But how is  it  done? Nearly every therapeutic prescription involves an invitation to notice  to pay attention. Once we have a notion in our sights  we can attack  it  with an arsenal of tools: cognitive  psychoanalytic  even spiritual. But none of these will tell us if we\u2019ve missed something. You may simply have failed to notice a debilitating habit  a negative correlation  a bad influence.", "output": "Ben Lipkowitz", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

The song  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWelcome to New York \u00e2\u0080\u009d kicked off her supposed first \u00e2\u0080\u009cofficial pop album\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a portrait of glorious naivety.  Swift  was the country girl just arrived in the big city  amazed by all  she  saw: the lights  the sounds  the homosexuals.  Her  gait was accordingly untroubled  steady  optimistic: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new soundtrack / I could dance to this beat forevermore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe album that followed largely stayed in that shiny  straightforward mode.  She  was open-hearted yet unflappable  whether brushing off criticism (\u00e2\u0080\u009cShake It Off\u00e2\u0080\u009d)  lightly dressing the wounds of breakups (\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll You Had to Do Was Stay\u00e2\u0080\u009d)  or memorializing the thrill of a new relationship (\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut of the Woods\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Slabs of synth and driving  steady beats cast a movie-trailer glow of enchantment. Reviewers noted that this mode actually broke from recent pop trends  spurning the influence of hip-hop and R&B  as well as some of the grim moodiness creeping onto the charts. The video for \u00e2\u0080\u009cShake It Off\u00e2\u0080\u009d even poked fun at the idea that  Swift  might start imitating Nicki Minaj like some of her contemporaries.\nTwo songs didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite fit that pattern  though. One was \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlank Space \u00e2\u0080\u009d a masterwork of hip-hop-adjacent sarcasm. The legendary pop producers Max Martin and Shellback threaded together a high  whistling harmony and kick-drum/snare pattern over which  Swift  sneered rapid clusters of syllables about being a man-eater. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBad Blood \u00e2\u0080\u009d too  waged war in what sounded like a personal feud over modern jock-jam thump. It got an extra layer of syncopation for the Kendrick Lamar remix that  like \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlank Space \u00e2\u0080\u009d enjoyed a run at No. 1 on the Hot 100.\nThe rumors about the recording sessions for  Swift \u00e2\u0080\u0099s forthcoming album Reputation were that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see her  finally  diving into hip-hop and R&B. Those reports drew immediate skepticism  as it was hard to imagine how such a change might work for  Swift  without  her  seeming ridiculous. But it now appears the rumors were true  though the question of ridiculousness hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite gone away. Where 1989 was sleek and stiff and retro  Reputation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s songs so far have been busier  choppier  and decidedly modern\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is to say  rap-influenced.

He 's either a landlord saving the poor from homelessness  or  he 's one of the city's worst slumlords.\nSULLIVAN: Khraish works out of a small West Dallas office where  he  manages about 300 homes  he  and  his  dad own in the neighborhood. They're mostly crumbling 1940s one-story wooden houses  but at 400 or 500 a month  they're some of the cheapest in the city.\nSULLIVAN: Neighbors stop by. So does her daughter. Pearline Brown Harper wastes no time when I ask her about  Khraish .\nSULLIVAN: Harper is right about at least one thing. The homes have brought in a lot of money. With 300 homes at 400 or 500 a month   Khraish  could be collecting as much as $150 000 a month in rent. But  Khraish  isn't the only one to see the investment potential here. Across the country  mom-and-pop landlords are on the decline  and studies show owners with dozens or hundreds of properties are on the rise. The less a landlord has to spend on repairs  the more money he or she stands to make. In Brown's house  a neighbor pops in to see what's going on.\nSULLIVAN: And she's right not just in West Dallas but in cities all across the country. Median rent has increased 70 percent over the past two decades while housing conditions haven't improved. And according to government data  the majority of poor families are spending more than half of their already small incomes just to cover rent. In Dallas two years ago  the city decided it was going to get serious about living conditions in West Dallas. Assistant City Attorney Melissa Miles and others went into dozens of  Khraish 's homes.\nSULLIVAN: They sent  Khraish  a binder with hundreds of citations.  He  said it was devastating.\n KHRAISH : It was just bankruptcy. And they want me to bring them to a standard that these houses cannot attain. It's like  how do you make a 1930s engine meet modern-day emission standards? You cannot.\nSULLIVAN: But the bigger question looming over all of this is not why the city intervened but why they intervened now. And  Khraish  had a theory.\n KHRAISH : The city of Dallas does not want low-income households in the city.\nSULLIVAN:  Khraish 's theory goes like this. The city wants him to renovate his homes because if he renovates  he'll have to charge more to recoup the costs. His tenants can't pay more  so they'll go live somewhere else  somewhere other than revitalized West Dallas or maybe all of Dallas.\n KHRAISH : Their affordable housing policy is not to have one.\nSULLIVAN: But the answer  Khraish  came up with was not what anyone was expecting. Last spring   he  decided  he  wasn't going to renovate  his  homes. Instead   he  said  he  was going to tear them down and evict the tenants.\nSULLIVAN: As he said this  we stopped in front of a lot where  Khraish  had already demolished the house that was on it. I told him city officials said they were stunned he was tearing houses down.\nSULLIVAN: Except in those ashes  he says  only wealthy people get to live  and you don't even need to do code enforcement. And that could have been the end of the story  except  Khraish  had one more coda to add. A few months ago  he announced he was sparing half his tenants from eviction. Instead  he says  he's making them homeowners.\nSULLIVAN: He's going to loan the tenants the money to buy the houses from him. Seller-financed deals are often controversial and can sometimes leave buyers with less-than-favorable terms. For example   Khraish's  contract says if buyers miss one payment  he can demand that they pay off the entire house immediately or lose it. Whether or not that happens   Khraish  will collect payments but will no longer have to worry about repairs.\nPearlie Mae Brown signed a similar contract with  Khraish . She can't afford to fix the house  but she told us she has no choice. She has nowhere to go. When we asked Mayor Mike Rawlings about this  he said it was a happy ending. More than a hundred people will get to stay in West Dallas.", "output": "Khraish Khraish", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

This information was not disclosed by police or prosecutors before  during  or after a biased investigation  botched forensic analysis and testimony  and chaotic trial that resulted in a 263-year sentence for Holtzclaw -- who has maintained his complete and actual innocence from the start and is appealing his convictions.\n2) How was Taylor assigned to the Daniel Holtzclaw case  on which Det. Gregory served as co-lead sex-crimes unit investigator?\nSmith failed to answer how Taylor was assigned to the case. He did  however  admit that the \"administration of the OCPD was aware of the relationship between Elaine Taylor and Rocky Gregory.\" Yet  the administration did not disclose this relationship to  Holtzclaw 's defense team  which was then denied an opportunity to cross-examine Taylor and Gregory about that relationship to impeach the witnesses by uncovering potential bias and prejudice against  Holtzclaw .\nFinally  Smith glibly asserted  \"the forensic lab did not have a  Holtzclaw  case.\"\n1) Forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law  Det. Rocky Gregory  interrogated  Holtzclaw  with Det. Davis on June 18  2014  just 14 hours after  Holtzclaw  pulled over Jannie Ligons at an end-of-shift traffic stop.\n2) Forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law  Det. Rocky Gregory  mishandled and potentially contaminated the evidence bag used to store  Holtzclaw 's uniform pants -- the linchpin forensic evidence examined and tested by his mother-in-law.\nAs forensic expert Dr. Michael Spence noted in a sworn affidavit supporting  Holtzclaw 's motion for an evidentiary hearing:\n\"At the June 18  2014  interrogation of Officer Holtzclaw  investigators secured the uniform pants at about 6:00 p.m. At the beginning of this process  video footage showed Detective Gregory placing his bare hand into the evidence bag. The detective proceeded to push on the bottom of the bag -- in order to fully open it.  Officer Holtzclaw  could then be seen handling  his  utility belt   his  cell phone   his  pockets   his  wallet  and  his  keys -- (SET ITAL) all prior (END ITAL) to unclasping his belt  unzipping his fly  and removing his pants. In addition to the obvious DNA transfer issues associated with this order of events  both the belt and the pants collected from  Officer Holtzclaw  were placed in (SET ITAL) one bag (END ITAL). Consequently  these items were stored together  transported together  and remained together  until the moment that the lab analyst accessed the contents of the evidence bag.\"\n3) Forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law  Det. Rocky Gregory  was present during the search of  Holtzclaw 's car in the wake of Ligons' sexual assault allegation. All of the swabs taken from the car were submitted to the OCPD crime lab. In fact  when Elaine Taylor called Det. Davis to ask a question about the swabs  Det. Davis replied that she could not answer the questions because \"I did not ask for those swabs to be taken.\"\n4) Forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law  Det. Gregory  was one of six participants in a meeting at the Springlake Division before  Holtzclaw  was taken to headquarters to be questioned about the Ligons stop.\n6) After  Holtzclaw 's interrogation  forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law  Det. Gregory  accompanied  Holtzclaw  to his home  where Det. Gregory failed to take key pieces of forensic evidence  including  Holtzclaw 's underwear (which Det. Gregory incorrectly assumed had been washed) and other uniforms.\n7) Richard Smith's denial that the crime lab handled a \"Holtzclaw case\" is contradicted by the lab's own assignment of just two case numbers -- SD14-273 and SD14-399 -- for all the evidence tested. Both lab case numbers list the defendant as \"Holtzclaw  Daniel.\" Lab case No. SD14-273 combined evidence from several accusers' allegations under that one case  beginning with Ligons' allegations and including DNA from nine other accusers (Terri Morris  Sherry Ellis  Florene Mathis  Carla Johnson  Rosetta Grate  Kala Lyles  Regina Copeland  Adaira Gardner and Syrita Bowen)  as well as DNA from  Holtzclaw  and his then-girlfriend Kerri Hunt.\n8) Forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law  Det. Gregory  was one of 12 OCPD officials who executed a search warrant at 633 Culbertson Drive on Sept. 3  2014  the residence where accuser Rosetta Grate alleged  Holtzclaw  assaulted her and where she alleged she had left DNA evidence on the back of a chair and on a towel she claimed she left in a bedroom closet. Taylor conducted testing on evidence collected at this scene where her son-in-law  who had earlier mishandled DNA evidence collection at  Holtzclaw 's interrogation  was present.\nIn other words  Det. Gregory and Det. Davis  supervised by Lt. Muzny  consolidated the forensic evidence in the Morris and Ligons cases under 14-049050 (the case number assigned to Ligons' incident) since they were both \"related\" to  Holtzclaw . As described previously  the police submitted DNA from Ligons and nine other accusers under Ligons' lab case No. SD14-273. Police incident number 14-49050 (Ligons' case) is present on many evidence documents signed by Elaine Taylor (such as chain of custody forms for accusers' buccal swabs). This means that Taylor was well aware that numerous alleged victims were involved in No. 14-049050 -- not just Jannie Ligons.\nIn sum  Det. Gregory was actively and intimately involved in the  Holtzclaw  investigation from day one  including participating in a strategic meeting with higher-ups before  Holtzclaw 's interrogation  conducting the interrogation with Det. Davis  overseeing the search of  Holtzclaw 's vehicle  and participating in the formulation of a photo lineup for accuser Ligons (which Det. Davis nixed). Det. Gregory personally collected and directly submitted DNA evidence in the Holtzclaw case to his mother-in-law and participated in a raid of a home where more DNA evidence in the Holtzclaw case was collected and submitted to his mother-in-law.\nTaylor's collaboration with the prosecution to emphasize that the DNA on  Holtzclaw 's pants that she matched to accuser Adaira Gardner was most likely from vaginal fluid transfer \"not only contradicted the scientific results \" according to Dr. Spence  but also \"defied the logic that wearers typically leave DNA on their frequently used garments.\" He further noted that the minuscule quantities of DNA mixtures found on  Holtzclaw 's pants \"were quite consistent with the expected transfer of epithelial skin cells during incidental handling events.\"", "output": "Daniel Holtzclaw", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Grouchy middle-aged women in hairnets dished out bland  greasy cuisine. If it weren\u2019t for students tapping at their smartphones  it would have been hard to tell that the 21st century had ever arrived. I sat down at a table with a team from Astrakhan and told them I had been to their hometown once  a romantically shabby old city by the Caspian Sea. The students smirked. \u201cEveryone wants to leave \u201d a third-year named Anton said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do there \u201d his teammate Sergei added. \u201cWe did an amazing job \u2026 creating the illusion that  Putin  controls everything in Russia \u2026 Now it\u2019s just funny\u201d how much Americans attribute to  him . Anton was hoping that Minin could help him get his foot in the door at one of the state security services. \u201cIt\u2019s prestigious  they pay well  and the work is interesting \u201d he said. If he were accepted  he could hope for a salary of 50 000 rubles (less than $900) a month  which was almost double the average salary in Astrakhan. Was he motivated by any feelings of\u2014\u201cPatriotic conviction? \u201d Anton finished my sentence  and started to chuckle. \u201cNo \u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what government I work for. If the French Foreign Legion takes me  I\u2019ll go!\u201d\nBut most Russians don\u2019t recognize the Russia portrayed in this story: powerful  organized  and led by an omniscient  omnipotent leader who is able to both formulate and execute a complex and highly detailed plot. Gleb Pavlovsky  a political consultant who helped  Putin  win his first presidential campaign  in 2000  and served as a Kremlin adviser until 2011  simply laughed when I asked him about  Putin \u2019s role in Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cWe did an amazing job in the first decade of  Putin \u2019s rule of creating the illusion that  Putin  controls everything in Russia \u201d  he  said. \u201cNow it\u2019s just funny\u201d how much Americans attribute to  him . A businessman who is high up in  Putin \u2019s United Russia party said over an espresso at a Moscow caf\u00e9: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that everything in Russia works as poorly as it does  except our hackers? Rosneft\u201d\u2014the state-owned oil giant\u2014\u201cdoesn\u2019t work well. Our health-care system doesn\u2019t work well. Our education system doesn\u2019t work well. And here  all of a sudden  are our hackers  and they\u2019re amazing?\u201d The election hack \u201cwas a very emotional  tactical decision.\u201d The Kremlin was \u201cvery upset about the Panama Papers \u201d which cast light on Putin\u2019s wealth. In the same way that Russians overestimate America  seeing it as an all-powerful orchestrator of global political developments  Americans project their own fears onto Russia  a country that is a paradox of deftness  might  and profound weakness\u2014unshakably steady  yet somehow always teetering on the verge of collapse. Like America  it is hostage to its peculiar history  tormented by its ghosts.\nNone of these factors obviates the dangers Russia poses; rather  each gives them shape. Both  Putin  and  his  country are aging  declining\u2014but the insecurities of decline present their own risks to America. The United States intelligence community is unanimous in its assessment not only that Russians interfered in the U.S. election but that  in the words of former FBI Director James Comey  \u201cthey will be back.\u201d It is a stunning escalation of hostilities for a troubled country whose elites still have only a tenuous grasp of American politics. And it is classically  Putin   and classically Russian: using daring aggression to mask weakness  to avenge deep resentments  and  at all costs  to survive. I\u2019d come to Russia to try to answer two key questions. The more immediate is how the Kremlin  despite its limitations  pulled off one of the greatest acts of political sabotage in modern history  turning American democracy against itself. And the more important\u2014for Americans  anyway\u2014is what might still be in store  and how far  an emboldened Vladimir Putin  is prepared to go in order to get what  he  wants. Jeff Elkins; Alexey Kurbatov and Muti \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a strategic operation \u201d says Andrei Soldatov  a Russian journalist with deep sources in the security services  who writes about the Kremlin\u2019s use of cybertechnology. \u201cGiven what everyone on the inside has told me \u201d he says  hacking the U.S. political system \u201cwas a very emotional  tactical decision. People were very upset about the Panama Papers.\u201d\nIn the spring of 2016  an international consortium of journalists began publishing revelations from a vast trove of documents belonging to a Panamanian law firm that specialized in helping its wealthy foreign clients move money  some of it ill-gotten  out of their home countries and away from the prying eyes of tax collectors. (The firm has denied any wrongdoing.) The documents revealed that  Putin\u2019s  old friend Sergei Roldugin  a cellist and the godfather to  Putin\u2019s  elder daughter  had his name on funds worth some $2 billion. It was an implausible fortune for a little-known musician  and the journalists showed that these funds were likely a piggy bank for  Putin\u2019s  inner circle. Roldugin has denied any wrongdoing  but the Kremlin was furious about the revelation.  Putin\u2019s  spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  whose wife was also implicated  angrily ascribed the reporting to \u201cmany former State Department and CIA employees\u201d and to an effort to \u201cdestabilize\u201d Russia ahead of its September 2016 parliamentary elections. The argument was cynical  but it revealed a certain logic: The financial privacy of Russia\u2019s leaders was on par with the sovereignty of Russia\u2019s elections. \u201cThe Panama Papers were a personal slight to  Putin  \u201d says John Sipher  a former deputy of the CIA\u2019s Russia desk. \u201cThey think we did it.\u201d  Putin\u2019s  inner circle  Soldatov says  felt \u201cthey had to respond somehow.\u201d According to Soldatov\u2019s reporting  on April 8  2016   Putin  convened an urgent meeting of  his  national-security council; all but two of the eight people there were veterans of the KGB. Given the secrecy and timing of this meeting  Soldatov believes it was then that  Putin  gave the signal to retaliate.\nIt was almost like one of Minin\u2019s hacking competitions  but with higher stakes. The hackers are not always guys in military-intelligence uniforms  Soldatov told me; in some cases they\u2019re mercenary freelancers willing to work for the highest bidder\u2014or cybercriminals who have been caught and blackmailed into working for the government. ( Putin  has denied \u201cstate level\u201d involvement in election meddling  but plausible deniability is the point of working through unofficial hackers.) American officials noticed the same messy and amorphous behavior as the summer of 2016 wore on. A former staffer in Barack Obama\u2019s administration says that intercepted communications between FSB and military-intelligence officers revealed arguing and a lack of organization. \u201cIt was ad hoc \u201d a senior Obama-administration official who saw the intelligence in real time told me. \u201cThey were kind of throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what would stick.\u201d\nWhen the Obama administration began to realize  in the summer  that the Russians were up to something more wide-ranging than what they\u2019d done before  the White House worried about only half the problem. At that point  the most alarming development was Russian probing of states\u2019 voting systems. The dumps of hacked data and the churn of false stories about Clinton seemed less troubling  and also harder to combat without looking political. In September  Obama approached  Putin  on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hangzhou  China  and told  him  to \u201ccut it out.\u201d That fall  National-Security Adviser Susan Rice hand-delivered a warning to the Russian ambassador to Washington  Sergey Kislyak. The White House tasked the Treasury and State Departments with exploring new sanctions against Russia  as well as the publication of information about  Putin\u2019s  personal wealth  but decided that such moves might backfire. If the White House pushed too hard  the Russians might dump even more stolen documents. Who knew what else they had? Nevertheless  with just a month to go until the election  the Obama administration took the extraordinary step of alerting the public. On October 7  2016  a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said  \u201cThe U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails\u201d from U.S. political organizations. \u201cThese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d\nA forgery  a couple of groups of hackers  and a drip of well-timed leaks were all it took to throw American politics into chaos. Whether and to what extent the Trump campaign was complicit in the Russian efforts is the subject of active inquiries today. Regardless   Putin  pulled off a spectacular geopolitical heist on a shoestring budget\u2014about $200 million  according to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. This point is lost on many Americans: The subversion of the election was as much a product of improvisation and entropy as it was of long-range vision. What makes  Putin  effective  what makes  him  dangerous  is not strategic brilliance but a tactical flexibility and adaptability\u2014a willingness to experiment  to disrupt  and to take big risks. \u201cThey do plan \u201d said a senior Obama-administration official. \u201cThey\u2019re not stupid at all. But the idea that they have this all perfectly planned and that  Putin  is an amazing chess player\u2014that\u2019s not quite it.  He  knows where  he  wants to end up   he  plans the first few moves  and then  he  figures out the rest later. People ask if  he  plays chess or checkers. It\u2019s neither:  He  plays blackjack.  He  has a higher acceptance of risk. Think about it. The election interference\u2014that was pretty risky  what  he  did. If Hillary Clinton had won  there would\u2019ve been hell to pay.\u201d Even the manner of the Russian attack was risky. The fact that the Russians didn\u2019t really bother hiding their fingerprints is a testament to the change in Russia\u2019s intent toward the U.S.  Robert Hannigan  a former head of the Government Communications Headquarters  the British analogue to the National Security Agency  said at the Aspen Forum. \u201cThe brazen recklessness of it \u2026 the fact that they don\u2019t seem to care that it\u2019s attributed to them very publicly  is the biggest change.\u201d\nThat recklessness nonetheless has clear precursors\u2014both in  Putin\u2019s  evolving worldview and in  his  changing domestic circumstances. For more than a decade  America\u2019s strategic carelessness with regard to Russia has stoked  Putin\u2019s  fears of being deposed by the U.S.  and pushed  him  toward ever higher levels of antagonism. So has  his  political situation\u2014the need to take ever larger foreign risks to shore up support at home  as the economy has struggled. These pressures have not abated; if anything  they have accelerated in recent years. II. The History When it is snowing  as it was on this spring afternoon  the gray crags of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations blend into the low-slung  steely sky. This is where the Soviet state once minted its diplomats and spies. Here they mastered the nuances of the world before stepping out into it. Today  the university\u2019s role is much the same  although it has been watered down by corruption: The wealthy often buy their children admission. I had been invited to listen to a lecture by one of the institute\u2019s most prominent faculty members  Andranik Migranyan  who himself graduated from the school in 1972. Migranyan spent much of the past decade in New York  where he ran the Institute for Democracy and Cooperation  a Russian think tank reported to have ties to the Russian foreign ministry. Among his old classmates is Sergei Lavrov  the foreign minister  whom he still counts as a friend.\nThis afternoon  Migranyan was lecturing on  Putin\u2019s  speech at the 2007 Munich Conference on Security Policy  a speech that seems to be Russia\u2019s sole post-Soviet ideological document\u2014and key to understanding how the relationship between Russia and the U.S. reached today\u2019s nadir.  Putin   still a painfully awkward speaker at the time  was seven years into  his  now nearly two-decade reign. Eighteen years prior  in 1989   he  had been a KGB officer stationed in Dresden  East Germany  shoveling sensitive documents into a furnace as protesters gathered outside and the Berlin Wall crumbled. Not long after that  the Soviet Union was dead and buried  and the world seemed to have come to a consensus: The Soviet approach to politics\u2014violent  undemocratic\u2014was wrong  even evil. The Western liberal order was a better and more moral form of government. For a while   Putin  had tried to find a role for Russia within that Western order. When Boris Yeltsin  Russia\u2019s first post-Soviet president  named him his successor in 1999  Russia was waging war against Islamist separatists in Chechnya. On 9/11   Putin  was the first foreign leader to call President George W. Bush  hoping to impress on  him  that they were now allies in the struggle against terrorism.  He  tried to be helpful in Afghanistan. But in 2003  Bush ignored his objections to the invasion of Iraq  going around the United Nations Security Council  where Russia has veto power. It was a humiliating reminder that in the eyes of the West  Russia was irrelevant  that \u201cRussian objections carried no weight \u201d as Migranyan told his students. But to  Putin   it was something more: Under the guise of promoting democracy and human rights  Washington had returned to its Cold War\u2013era policy of deposing and installing foreign leaders. Even the open use of military force was now fair game.\nIn 2007  speaking to the representatives and defenders of the Western order   Putin  officially registered  his  dissent. \u201cOnly two decades ago  the world was ideologically and economically split  and its security was provided by the massive strategic potential of two superpowers \u201d  Putin  declaimed sullenly. But that order had been replaced by a \u201cunipolar world\u201d dominated only by America. \u201cIt is the world of one master  one sovereign.\u201d A world order controlled by a single country \u201chas nothing in common with democracy \u201d  he  noted pointedly. The current order was both \u201cunacceptable\u201d and ineffective. \u201cUnilateral  illegitimate action\u201d only created \u201cnew human tragedies and centers of conflict.\u201d  He  was referring to Iraq  which by that point had descended into sectarian warfare. The time had come   he  said  \u201cto rethink the entire architecture of global security.\u201d This was the protest of a losing side that wanted to renegotiate the terms of surrender  16 years after the fact. Nonetheless   Putin  has spent the decade since that speech making sure that the United States can never again unilaterally maneuver without encountering friction\u2014and  most important  that it can never  ever depose him. \u201cYou should have seen the faces of [John] McCain and [Joe] Lieberman \u201d a delighted Migranyan told his students  who appeared to be barely listening. The hawkish American senators who attended  Putin\u2019s  speech \u201cwere gobsmacked. Russia had been written off! And  Putin  committed a mortal sin in  Munich :  He  told the truth.\u201d\nThe year that followed  Migranyan said  \u201cwas the year of deed and action.\u201d Russia went to war with neighboring Georgia in 2008  a move that Migranyan described as a sort of comeuppance for nato  which had expanded to include other former Soviet republics. But Western encroachment on Russia\u2019s periphery was not the Kremlin\u2019s central grievance. The U.S.  Migranyan complained  had also been meddling directly in Russian politics. American consultants had engineered painful post-Soviet market reforms  enriching themselves all the while  and had helped elect the enfeebled and unpopular Yeltsin to a second term in 1996. The U.S. government directly funded both Russian and American nongovernmental organizations  such as the National Endowment for Democracy  to promote democracy and civil society in Russia. Some of those same NGOs had ties to the so-called color revolutions  which toppled governments in former Soviet republics and replaced them with democratic regimes friendly to the West. The Rose Revolution in Georgia  the Orange Revolution in Ukraine  the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan\u2014\u201cRussia looks at this with understandable mistrust \u201d Migranyan told his students. He pointed out that the United States  by its own admission  had spent $5 billion in Ukraine to promote democracy\u2014that is  to expand the liberal Western order. Through this prism  it is not irrational to believe that the U.S. might be coming for Moscow\u2014and  Putin \u2014next. This is why  in 2012  Russia kicked out USAID. It is why Russia banned the National Endowment for Democracy in 2015  under a new law that shuttered \u201cundesirable\u201d organizations.  Putin  is said to have watched the video of Qaddafi\u2019s lynching over and over  obsessively.  He  feared the Americans would come for  him  next.  Putin\u2019s   Munich  doctrine has a corollary: Americans may think they\u2019re promoting democracy  but they\u2019re really spreading chaos. \u201cLook at what happened in Egypt \u201d Migranyan said  beginning a litany of failed American-backed revolutions. In 2011  the Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak stepped down following protests the U.S. had supported  Migranyan contended. But after \u201cradical Islamists\u201d won power democratically  the U.S. turned a blind eye to a military coup that deposed the new leaders. Then there was Libya. \u201cYou toppled the most successful government in North Africa \u201d Migranyan said  looking in my direction. \u201cIn the end  we got a ruined government  a brutally murdered American ambassador  chaos  and Islamic radicals.\u201d\n\u201cIf we count all the American failures  maybe it\u2019s time you start listening to Russia? \u201d Migranyan said  growing increasingly agitated. \u201cIf [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad] has to go  then who comes in  in place of Assad? \u2026 Don\u2019t destroy regimes if you don\u2019t know what comes after!\u201d  Putin  had always been suspicious of democracy promotion  but two moments convinced  him  that America was coming for  him  under its guise. The first was the 2011 nato intervention in Libya  which led  ultimately  to the ousting and gruesome lynching of the Libyan dictator  Muammar Qaddafi. Afterward  many people who interacted with  Putin  noticed how deeply Qaddafi\u2019s death troubled  him .  He  is said to have watched the video of the killing over and over. \u201cThe way Qaddafi died made a profound impact on him \u201d says Jake Sullivan  a former senior State Department official who met repeatedly with senior Russian officials around that time. Another former senior Obama-administration official describes  Putin  as \u201cobsessed\u201d with Qaddafi\u2019s death. (The official concedes  \u201cI think we did overreach\u201d in Libya.) The second moment was in November 2013  when young Ukrainians came out onto the Maidan\u2014Independence Square\u2014in the capital  Kiev  to protest then-President Viktor Yanukovych pulling out of an economic agreement with the European Union under pressure from  Putin . The demonstrators stayed all winter  until the police opened fire on them  killing some 100 people. The next day  February 21  2014  Yanukovych signed a political-reconciliation plan  brokered by Russia  America  and the EU  but that night he fled the capital. To  Putin   it was clear what had happened: America had toppled  his  closest ally  in a country  he  regarded as an extension of Russia itself. All that money America had spent on prodemocracy NGOs in Ukraine had paid off. The presence of Victoria Nuland  a State Department assistant secretary  handing out snacks on the Maidan during the protests  only cemented his worst fears.\n\u201cThe Maidan shifted a gear \u201d Ben Rhodes  Obama\u2019s deputy national-security adviser for strategic communications  told me. \u201c Putin  had always been an antagonist  and aggressive. But  he  went on offense after the Maidan. The gloves were off  in a way. To  Putin   Ukraine was such a part of Russia that  he  took it as an assault on  him .\u201d (A source close to the Kremlin confirmed this account.)  Putin  and Lavrov were known within the Obama administration for their long tirades  chastising the American president for all the disrespect shown to Russia since 1991\u2014like the time in 2014 that Obama listed Russia and Ebola as global threats in the same speech. Yanukovych\u2019s fall made these tirades far more intense. \u201cFor two years afterwards  there wasn\u2019t a phone call in which [ Putin ] wouldn\u2019t mention it \u201d accusing the U.S. of supporting regime change in Ukraine  Rhodes recalled. Regime change in Libya and Ukraine led to Russia propping up Bashar al-Assad in Syria. \u201cNot one more\u201d is how Jon Finer  former Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s chief of staff  characterizes  Putin\u2019s  approach in Syria. It also led inexorably to Russian meddling in the U.S. election: Russia would show the U.S. that there was more than one regime-change racket in town. III. The Player For Russia  a country relentlessly focused on its history  2017 was a big year. November marked 100 years since the Bolsheviks  a radical minority faction of socialists  brought guns into a fledgling parliament and wrested Russia onto an equally radical path. That bloody experiment itself ended in 1991  with the collapse of the Soviet Union; December 2016 marked its 25th anniversary. Both anniversaries were largely ignored by the Kremlin-controlled media  because they are uncomfortable for  Putin . Bolsheviks were revolutionaries and  Putin   a statist to his core  loathes revolutions. But he was also raised to be a person of the Soviet state  to admire its many achievements  which is why he famously referred to the fall of the Soviet Union as \u201cthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.\u201d\n Putin  governs with the twin collapses of 1917 and 1991 at the forefront of  his  thinking.  He  fears for  himself  when another collapse comes\u2014because collapse always comes  because it has already come twice in 100 years.  He  is constantly trying to avoid it. The exiled oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky has publicly spoken of deposing  Putin   and until recently did not eschew violent means. People like Alexey Navalny  the opposition leader  openly talk about putting  Putin  and his closest associates on trial. The Russian opposition gleefully waits for  Putin  to fall  to resign  to die. Every misstep  every dip in oil prices  is to them just another sign of his coming personal apocalypse. The hungry anticipation is mirrored in the West  especially in the United States.\nFear of collapse is also why Russian propaganda is intent on highlighting the bloody aftermath of revolutions the world over. Things may not be great in Russia now\u2014the country has struggled mightily since 2012\u2014but  the country\u2019s news programs suggest  things can always get worse. That\u2019s what Russians are told happened in the 1990s  in the nine frenetic years between the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse and  Putin \u2019s ascent to power. \u201cWhen you have two governmental collapses in 100 years  people are scared of them \u201d Migranyan told me. Many Russians remember the last one personally. But the number who do is shrinking. One in four Russian men dies before the age of 55.  Putin  turned 65 in October  and is surrounded by people who are as old as  he  is  if not older. Russia is now \u201cin an autumnal autocracy \u201d Ekaterina Schulmann  a political scientist in Moscow  says. \u201cThe more it tries to seem young and energetic  the more it obviously fails.\u201d As Aleksey Chesnakov  a former Kremlin insider  told me  in Russia \u201cthe most active voters\u201d\u2014the people who buy in most fully to what  Putin \u2019s selling\u2014\u201care the pensioners.\u201d To  Putin \u2019s supporters   his  regime isn\u2019t an autocracy  exactly. \u201cIt can be described as demophilia \u201d Migranyan explained. \u201cIt is not a democracy  but it is in the name of the people  and for the people.  Putin \u2019s main constituency is the people. All of  his  power comes from  his  rating with the people  and therefore it\u2019s important that  he  gives them the fruits of  his  rule.\u201d The Kremlin calls it \u201cmanaged democracy.\u201d\nThis  too  is crucial to understanding why  Putin  acts as  he  does  and how  he  is likely to think about new campaigns against the United States. The Kremlin\u2019s direction of the press  the close eye it keeps on polls and approval numbers  and especially its foreign policy\u2014they all exist to buttress  Putin \u2019s legitimacy  to curry favor with  his  144 million subjects. It\u2019s a complicated  hiccuping feedback loop designed to guarantee that  Putin \u2019s authoritarian rule remains popular and unthreatened. This is why  Putin  insists on having elections  even if the result is always predictable. \u201cWithout renewing the mandate  the system can\u2019t survive \u201d Chesnakov said. \u201cAccording to polls  two-thirds of Russians don\u2019t want a monarchy. They want a democracy. But they have a different sense of it than Americans and Europeans.\u201d  Putin \u2019s third presidential term is up in the spring of 2018.  He  didn\u2019t bother to declare that  he \u2019d run for reelection until December 6 (the election is in March) and  he  likely won\u2019t campaign.* This is  Putin \u2019s carefully cultivated image at home: the phlegmatic leader who hovers coolly above the fray as it churns on beneath  him . But in the past year or so  the fray has given  him  reason to worry. On a chilly afternoon this spring  I watched college students standing on the steps of a nondescript building off Volgograd\u2019s central square  waiting to meet with Alexey Navalny. The opposition leader and anti-corruption crusader has captured the imagination of many young Russians  as well as that of Westerners who see him as a potential rival of  or even replacement for   Putin . Navalny has declared that he is running for president in the upcoming election. Police had blocked off the street in front of the building  which housed Navalny\u2019s local campaign office. They stood groggily watching as Cossacks  members of a southern Russian tribe who have historically acted as the state\u2019s vigilante enforcers  strolled up and down the block  casually swinging their black-leather whips. Angry-looking young men in track pants and sneakers\u2014the other fists-for-hire preferred by the Kremlin\u2014paced around the students  eyeing them menacingly. Young women in vertiginous heels\u2014plainclothes cops\u2014milled around. Every few minutes  they took out identical camcorders tagged with numbered yellow stickers and filmed the students standing on the steps  zooming in on their faces. Navalny had recently been attacked by progovernment thugs who splashed \u201cBrilliant Green \u201d a Soviet-era antiseptic  on his face. His supporters subsequently posted an image of The Motherland Calls  the giant statue commemorating the Soviet victory at Stalingrad  with its face Photoshopped green  to publicize his rally in Volgograd. The image touched a nerve in a country where the government fetishizes World War II. Within hours  pro-Kremlin social-media accounts were using the image to fuel local outrage. By the time Navalny arrived in Volgograd  from Moscow  the youth wing of Putin\u2019s party was waiting with a protest. The students standing on the steps of the campaign office found the manufactured outrage funny. They were at an age when most things were funny  even when the state was clearly watching them. The FSB had recently sent a summons to the home of Vlad  a fourth-year student at Volgograd State University who had previously picketed in support of Navalny\u2019s Progress Party. Roman  a bespectacled third-year student in veterinary science  had been called into the dean\u2019s office for participating in a protest. \u201cThe dean said  \u2018Don\u2019t go to Navalny\u2019s protests. His political position is wrong \u2019 \u201d Roman told me  shrugging and shoving his hands into the pockets of his puffy red jacket. These young men would soon graduate into an economy that had only recently started to grow again after a five-year malaise. But the growth is barely perceptible  while prices for basic goods have soared. Some of their neighbors and family acquaintances hadn\u2019t been paid in months  they said. \u201cOur parents say things have gotten worse \u201d Roman told me. But their parents also knew the potential cost of openly opposing the government  and weren\u2019t happy that their sons were at the rally that day. They also believed  from watching state TV  that Navalny was an American agent. The young men laughed at this  too. Navalny had begun to build his base about a decade earlier  with a blog on LiveJournal that carefully documented how government officials supposedly carved thick slices off the state budget and stashed the money in Moscow mansions or real estate abroad. A few years ago  Navalny launched a YouTube channel where he posts slickly produced videos describing alleged government corruption schemes. On another YouTube channel  Navalny Live  he and his team at the Anti-Corruption Foundation host talk shows about politics  the kind of programming that would never be allowed on state-controlled television. Together  the channels have more than 1.5 million subscribers  and the videos have collected hundreds of millions of views. As the students and I stood chatting  a retinue of preschoolers marched past the office with their teachers. The college students broke into laughter and cheers. \u201cEveryone says that Navalny\u2019s supporters are really young  but I didn\u2019t know they were this young! \u201d Roman said. But things quickly lost their comic lightness when a young man in track pants started loudly arguing with an older Navalny supporter  saying Navalny was funded by the U.S. State Department and noting the personal offense he took at the green-faced Motherland Calls statue. \u201cIt\u2019s a monument to a great victory!\u201d his friend  another angry young man in track pants  screamed. \u201cIt was built on bones! My grandfather fought for Stalingrad!\u201d (His grandfather  he later admitted to me  had been born in Georgia in 1941.) Suddenly  scores of anti-Navalny protesters appeared  some with brooms  as if preparing to sweep him out of their city. \u201cNavalny  come out!\u201d a middle-aged man with a shaved head screamed into a megaphone as the protesters surged across the sidewalk toward the campaign office. \u201cNavalny  come out!\u201d they yelled in response. The college students packed in tightly on the campaign office\u2019s front steps  ready to defend their leader. The two camps started pushing and shoving  the crowd swaying violently. The cops watched. I looked up and saw Roman\u2019s red jacket. He had taken off his glasses and stood on the top step  blinking and squinting into the noise. The swagger and irony had gone off his face. He looked vulnerable  like a child. Navalny emerged at the top of the steps  calm as ever. Part of the crowd started chanting  \u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201d Navalny invited the man with the megaphone and his comrades up the steps to talk with him calmly  face-to-face. They came up and grabbed him by the legs and started to drag him toward the hostile part of the crowd. Finally the cops acted  freeing Navalny and pushing the crowd back toward the street. Navalny escaped into his campaign office  where  for the next three hours  he fielded questions in a room so packed with supporters that his hair was soon dripping with sweat. He spoke about the contrast between government elites\u2019 luxurious lifestyles and the region\u2019s sagging wages; about rising utility fees  despite falling energy prices; about the pitiful state of the roads. \u201cAlexey!\u201d one of his supporters yelled out. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left in our city since 1945 except the victory!\u201d Everyone clapped. Navalny laughed at the state\u2019s accusations that his supporters\u2014the hundreds of people sweating with him in the room\u2014had been paid by the U.S. State Department to show up. \u201cThis is the real political force of the country \u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will win. We are destined for victory  because in any culture  in any civilization  people like us win  because they lie and we tell the truth.\u201d I wiped clear a small rectangle on a fogged-up window. There was nothing left of the angry crowd  not even the police. They had vanished as quickly as they had materialized. Two days later  on March 26  Navalny rushed back to Moscow  where thousands of people had heeded his call to come out and protest state corruption. Tens of thousands more came out in nearly 100 other Russian cities and towns  across Russia\u2019s 11 time zones\u2014an unexpected showing that grabbed international headlines. Earlier that month  Navalny had posted an hour-long expos\u00e9 on YouTube about the extensive luxury-real-estate holdings of the prime minister and former president  Dmitry Medvedev\u2014who in 2008 had lamented that a sum equivalent to a third of the Russian federal budget had disappeared to corruption. Navalny contrasted the opulence of Medvedev\u2019s many homes  filmed by drones  with his awkward call for austerity to the residents of Crimea  who  on joining Russia  had lost access to a steady supply of water  electricity  and reasonably priced food. \u201cThere\u2019s no money \u201d Medvedev advised them two years after the annexation  in 2016  \u201cbut you hang in there.\u201d By the time of the mass protests  the expos\u00e9 had been watched almost 12 million times. A couple of schoolboys climbed up on a lamppost in Moscow\u2019s iconic Pushkin Square  packed with protesters  and called to the cops trying to get them down  \u201cThere\u2019s no money  but we\u2019re hanging in there!\u201d In recent years  as the economy has struggled   Putin  has purchased  his  popularity with a series of tactical measures.  Putin  pays extremely close attention to  his  approval ratings to see what works and what doesn\u2019t.  He  and  his  advisers are addicted to polls. According to Alexander Oslon  who runs the Public Opinion Foundation  which does polling for the Kremlin  \u201cThey can\u2019t live without them.\u201d  Putin \u2019s approval rating surged in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea\u2014and  by extension  Russia\u2019s return to imperial grandeur. It was a risky maneuver  the equal  perhaps  of  Putin \u2019s later interference in the U.S. election. And it paid off  at least in the short term. Russians rallied behind the Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine\u2014and behind  Putin   their audacious president. \u201cThere was a spike in loyalty\u201d toward \u201cevery organ of the state \u201d Kirill Rogov  a political analyst in Moscow who studies Russian polling  told me\u2014\u201ca conservative shift in all directions. People started paying more attention to the news  they watched more TV  and they became more indoctrinated.\u201d For a decade  a majority of Russians had told pollsters that they would rather be well-off than live in a great power. In 2014  those preferences flipped. But the rush of patriotism provided by the Crimean annexation proved fleeting. Connected by land only to Ukraine  Crimea is hard to supply from Russia. The peninsula is facing severe water shortages in its near future  and tourism  a mainstay of the local economy  has plummeted. On a recent trip there  I was told by even the most ardently pro-Russia locals  Cossacks who had staged protests supporting Moscow in 2014  that they had come to regret their stance. The violent lawlessness and corruption of Moscow had reached their home  and life had become much harder as Russian citizens. In some ways  they missed being Ukrainian. Meanwhile  the already sluggish Russian economy has lost cheap Western financing  following the imposition of American and European sanctions.  Putin \u2019s response to those sanctions\u2014banning food imports from the United States and the EU\u2014made food prices climb by double-digit percentages. The economy sank into recession. By the beginning of 2017  the government\u2019s approval numbers had nearly returned to pre-annexation levels. \u201cIt\u2019s the brand of the year \u201d Minin said of Russia\u2019s hackers. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing when  aside from oil  we have cutting-edge specialists\u201d whom the whole world talks about. Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria  which began in the fall of 2015  offered another flag-wrapped distraction. As America shrank from its traditional role in the Middle East  Russia expanded its own  making an ostentatious show of fighting Islamist terrorists on behalf of a reluctant Western Christendom. Shortly after the Syrian army  aided by Russian airpower and commandos  retook the ancient city of Palmyra from the Islamic State  the Russian military flew the Mariinsky Orchestra in from St. Petersburg for a concert in front of the city\u2019s historic ruins\u2014and a dozen press cameras. (Russian TV barely covered the loss of the city by Russian-backed forces to isis half a year later.) There will inevitably be a reckoning for the Syrian adventure  too. For the entirety of his reign   Putin  has struggled to contain an Islamist insurgency in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus mountains  from which terrorists have launched attacks on Moscow. But on a trip this spring to Dagestan  a mostly Muslim enclave in the heart of the mountains  I found that the region  once extremely violent  was peaceful. Worried about potential terror attacks in nearby Sochi during the 2014 Olympics  the Russian secret services had allowed hundreds  if not thousands  of Islamist rebels  all of them Russian citizens  to go to Syria. According to one report in Novaya Gazeta  the FSB even provided some of them with a passport and transportation to the Russian border. It was a shortsighted counterterrorism strategy. Two Dagestani men who traveled to isis-controlled territories in Syria in order to bring back their children told me that they heard as much Russian as Arabic on the streets of isis cities. An October report by the Soufan Center  a security-intelligence nonprofit  showed that more foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria came from Russia than from any other country. What will become of these Russian fighters  now better trained and battle-hardened  as isis territory continues to shrink? Some 400 have already returned to Russia  according to the Soufan Center report  but even those who don\u2019t return home can wreak havoc: In April  a suicide bomber blew himself up at a St. Petersburg metro station  killing 13 people. Russian speakers outside the country who had joined isis were suspected of having radicalized him. Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. election was just as shortsighted. At first  Donald Trump\u2019s victory seemed to be a great coup for  Putin . Kremlin loyalists celebrated Trump\u2019s inauguration in Moscow  including at a live watch party with free-flowing champagne. And it conferred on Russia prestige of a sort. When I asked Victor Minin  the former Russian-government cybersecurity specialist who runs hackathons across Russia  about the effect of American media coverage of Russian hackers  he said  \u201cIt\u2019s the brand of the year. It\u2019s a good thing when  aside from oil  we have cutting-edge specialists and the whole world is talking about them.\u201d But this victory has burned out even faster than the others. The fingerprints that the Russians left behind  once discovered  raised an uproar in Washington. Congress  in a rare near-unanimous vote  stripped Trump of the ability to unilaterally lift American sanctions on Russia. They will very likely remain in place indefinitely  a prospect Medvedev bemoaned in a Facebook post the day Trump reluctantly signed the bill into law. Unable to get back the two diplomatic compounds in the U.S. that had been seized during the last days of the Obama administration  the Russians plunged headfirst into a destructive tit for tat\u2014which resulted in the seizure of three more Russian diplomatic posts. Ironically  one of the Russian institutions to suffer the most blowback for the Russian hack is the FSB  one of the agencies believed to be behind the 2016 interference. \u201cBefore 2016  the FSB had a good reputation in Washington \u201d Andrei Soldatov  the Russian journalist  told me. The head of the FSB \u201cwas considered a reliable partner in fighting terrorism.\u201d But \u201cit all ended in 2016  and it ended very badly.\u201d FSB officers were put on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list for cybercriminals  an unprecedented retaliation. The head of the FSB\u2019s elite cyber unit and his deputy were forced out; two other top officers from the unit ended up in Moscow\u2019s most notorious jail. \u201cThey\u2019re now under incredible pressure both from the inside and the outside \u201d Soldatov said. \u201cSometimes \u201d says Michael Hayden  a director of the National Security Agency under George W. Bush  \u201cyou have successful covert operations that you wish hadn\u2019t succeeded.\u201d Meddling in the U.S. election might have destabilized the American political system  but it is unclear how carefully  Putin  considered the potential consequences for  his  country.  His  goal is to stay in power another day  another year  and to deal with complications when\u2014and if\u2014they arise. The protests sparked by Navalny are a complication that has  for now  been dealt with. Police arrested 1 043 people on March 26 in Moscow alone. On October 7  following another  smaller round of protests  they arrested hundreds more. Navalny will not be allowed on the election ballot  according to various reports and one Kremlin insider I spoke with; a recent court finding against him following trumped-up charges of embezzlement will most likely be used to disqualify him. These were hardly the first protests that  Putin  has weathered. Massive prodemocracy  anti- Putin  demonstrations rocked Moscow in the winter of 2011\u201312\u2014and were followed by a violent police crackdown on May 6  2012  the day before  Putin  was sworn in for a third time. Dozens of people  some of them first-time protesters  were given multiyear prison sentences. The Kremlin soon raised the penalties for participating in any kind of unsanctioned protest. Several people are now in jail simply for sharing or liking posts on social media. Olga Romanova  who founded the NGO Russia Behind Bars to provide Russians with legal assistance  told me that the lesson the government is preparing for this new batch of young protesters \u201cwill be bigger and harsher\u201d than the one in 2012  and that \u201cit will last years.\u201d She said the state was threatening to separate protesting minors from their parents. The feared Investigative Committee \u201cis calling in school principals  school psychologists  teachers for questioning \u201d Romanova said. \u201cAnd they testify against the kids.\u201d (This summer  under pressure from the Russian government  Romanova fled to Western Europe.)", "output": "Putin Munich, Munich", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

An unprecedented six million fled from the Category 5 storm  the largest evacuation in United States history.\nI took her question and others to fuel experts. A car-dependent state with a history of hurricanes  Florida had a week before Irma hit to lay in enough fuel for residents to drive out of harm's way\u00e2\u0080\u0094the choice mode of evacuation. But that wasn't enough time  and the reasons why add yet another dimension to the Sunshine State's deepening vulnerability to climate change.\nLow-lying  peninsular Florida is in a famously precarious place. One lesser-known vulnerability that the Hurricane Irma exposed is how difficult it can be to move fuel supplies here quickly. Unlike states with more shared borders and freight infrastructure  roughly 97 percent of the refined fuel sold in Florida gets shipped in  from the Gulf of Mexico. Much of it usually come from refineries on the shores of Texas\u00e2\u0080\u0094which were devastated just weeks ago by the second-costliest storm in U.S. history  Hurricane Harvey.\nWith Texas refineries knocked out of commission because of Harvey  Florida's fuel suppliers were already feeling the squeeze before Irma's path became clear. In fact  as of the week before Labor Day  according to Jim Storey  the business development director of the Georgia-based fuel distributor Mansfield Oil  Florida was trucking some of its own supplies over there to help out Texas. But as Irma predictions shaped up  the flow of fuel out-of-state was swiftly reversed.\nThe weekend before Labor Day  as the degree of Irma's threat became clearer  Florida gas suppliers and emergency managers joined to strategize. They knew there would be a run on gas  though it wasn't clear yet which parts of the state would be evacuating. So fuel shipments that could be steered to Florida were diverted from all over. Barges that normally deliver from offline Gulf Coast refineries were rerouted to New York and Philadelphia to bring gas south. Tankers from Louisiana and Mississippi steamed eastward to reach Florida in time  having been delayed by Harvey's fearsome path. One oil trader redirected two European barges destined for Africa to Florida instead. According to Hillary Stevenson  director of oil market research for the analysis firm Genscape  the state took in some 570 00 barrels from Europe ahead of  Irma  in order to make up for supplies it had lost to Harvey.\n\"We were accepting supplies from anywhere that would send it \" says James Miller  the director of communications for the Florida Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association  a trade group designated to coordinate fuel supplies with the state in the event of an emergency. \"The timing of Harvey and Irma was not ideal.\"\nFortunately  Irma wasn't a repeat of Hurricane Rita  when dozens died trying to evacuate on Houston's traffic-clogged  gas-less roads in 2005. Florida's transportation officials coordinated this evacuation remarkably well. The state was spared catastrophic damage when Irma's path veered from the biggest population center.\nWhile many gas chains  companies  and government agencies buy fuel at contract-bound prices  others buy it \"on the spot\" at whatever the going rate. That price  says Stevenson  increased by 26 cents per gallon ahead of Irma. As of Tuesday  the average price of a gallon is $2.71 in Florida  up more than 44 cents from last month. (That price increase is also due in part to Harvey-related fuel shortages.)\nThis week  as evacuees try to head home  Florida gas stations are still scrambling to refuel. Florida's ports had to shut down while Irma tore through the state  which means incoming shipments are now running on a delay. Now three of them are back online  but with Houston refineries still incapacitated  meeting gas demand is going to be a challenge for some time. Oil shipments are coming in  but the lights are still out at multiple fuel terminals.

( Alexander Joe / Associated Press ) Some might consider the plague a thing of the past   buried deep in medieval history . But it thrives in Madagascar   where the disease is a seasonal worry . And this year   the country is experiencing what may be its deadliest outbreak in years : About 194 people are suspected to have fallen ill from the plague since August   and 33 have died as of Saturday   according to Madagascar \u2019 s Ministry of Health . Experts say they can \u2019 t remember the last time the death toll was so high . In 2016   63 people died over the course of the year   out of 275 cases . The majority of this year \u2019 s cases are pneumonic plague   which can be transmitted through coughing   according to the BBC . This form of the disease can kill an infected person in less than a day . To slow the outbreak   Madagascar is temporarily shutting down its public institutions . Government authorities ordered two universities to close   and other schools have shut their doors across the country   including the capital   Antananarivo   so buildings can be sprayed with insecticides . The World Health Organization has shipped more than a million doses of antibiotics to the country   the BBC reported . \u201c We are scared \u2014 all of these deaths show that the situation is serious  \u201d Miora Herinjatovo   55   told Agence France - Presse on Wednesday . She got a mask from a hospital \u2014 unlike her husband   who failed to get one after standing in line outside a pharmacy . He instead collected a handful of generic antibiotics . [ The plague   alive and well in Madagascar ] Experts say the outbreak started in late August   when a 31 - year - old man from the eastern city of Toamasina took a trip inland to Ankazobe   where the plague lives in rodent and flea populations . While there   he came down with malaria - like symptoms . He died in a taxi home   passing through Antananarivo   the WHO said in a Sept . 28 statement . The WHO said that many of the cases identified are directly or indirectly linked to the man   which is evidence of person - to - person transmission . Of the 31 people who made direct or indirect contact with him   four became ill and died   the WHO said . Antananarivo and Toamasina were among the most - infected cities : As of Sept . 30   Antananarivo and its suburbs had 27 cases and seven deaths   and Toamasina had 18 cases and five deaths . Antananarivo has about 1 . 3 million residents   while Toamasina has about 237   000   according to a 2014 count by the National Institute of Statistics in Madagascar . Public gatherings   including jazz festivals and basketball tournaments   have been called off to prevent the plague from spreading   according to media reports . One of the people killed by the plague last week was a basketball coach from the Seychelles   who died while visiting the capital for a tournament   according to a WHO report released Thursday . \u201c Right now   we have the outbreak of a very infectious   fatal disease  \u201d said Katharina Kreppel   an epidemiologist at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania   who spent four years conducting field research in Madagascar . \u201c If people don \u2019 t notice fast enough   or don \u2019 t have access to health care fast enough   they die very quickly .\u201d [ There \u2019 s plague in Arizona . Authorities warn of fleas that can infect people and pets .] This plague shares the same bacterium   yersinia pestis   that caused the \u201c Black Death \u201d pandemic in Europe during the 14th century . The most common form of the plague in Madagascar was   until this year   the bubonic plague   spread to humans through infected fleas that contracted the infection from small animals they bit   like rats . The disease is typically spread to humans by the bite of an infected flea   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The bubonic plague is often treatable with antibiotics . If left untreated   though   the bacteria can spread through the bloodstream to the lungs and cause pneumonic plague \u2014 a deadly   more infectious form that \u2019 s now spreading throughout Madagascar . Symptoms of the pneumonic plague are similar to the common cold   according to the CDC . The symptoms of bubonic plague are fever   headaches   chills and weakness \u2014 as well as one or more swollen and painful lymph nodes   known as buboes . The bacteria multiply in the lymph node closest to where the bacteria entered the body   usually through the infected flea bite   according to the CDC . If an infected person isn \u2019 t given antibiotics   the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body . Should the bubonic plague become pneumonic   the person will develop shortness of breath   chest pain and sometimes bloody or watery mucous . The pneumonia may cause respiratory failure and shock . All forms of plague   if untreated   can progress rapidly to death   according to the CDC . There have been three major plague pandemics : The Justinian plague   which broke in the Byzantine Empire in AD 541 ; the \u201c Black Death  \u201d which originated in China in 1334 and spread to Europe ; and the Modern Plague   which began in China in the 1860s and appeared in Hong Kong by 1894   according to the CDC . It was during the last pandemic that scientists identified the link between the bacteria and infectious flea bites   and rat - associated plague was soon brought under control in most urban areas . The plague has since been controlled in most countries with insecticides   according to the CDC . And since it can be treated with antibiotics   the spread of the disease is usually prevented if promptly identified . The plague is most commonly found in sub - Saharan Africa and Madagascar   areas which account for more than 95 percent of reported cases   according to the CDC . Madagascar often sees the highest numbers of bubonic plague cases worldwide   about 600 infections annually . Madagascar has been in the throes of a political crisis since 2009 and has become one of the poorest countries in the world   with more than 92 percent of the population living on less than $ 2 a day   according to the World Bank Group . It \u2019 s lost a substantial portion of international aid   and its infrastructure has deteriorated . Once rice harvest season finishes at the end of summer   the rat population drops   as they don \u2019 t have as much food . Fleas begin looking for new hosts to bite and settle on humans . As it is an island   Madagascar is home to species that transmit the plague and often aren \u2019 t found anywhere else    Kreppel  told The Washington Post . While Madagascar \u2019 s scientists have monitored plague patterns for years and have the knowledge to mitigate the spread of this new   pneumonic plague   the money and resources to do so aren \u2019 t available    Kreppel  said . There isn \u2019 t adequate funding for insecticides   spraying equipment or antibiotics   she said   and there aren \u2019 t enough health facilities to house quarantined patients . The country can \u2019 t afford the vehicles required to travel to isolated villages   should the disease spread further    Kreppel  said . \u201c If an outbreak like this happened in the U . S . or Europe or anywhere else it would be controlled quite fast   because the resources are there  \u201d she said . This post has been updated .

He  earned  his  own wing of Cape Town's Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art  after the Roger Ballen Foundation contributed the largest financial donation from a foundation the brand-new institution has seen yet. Outside of photography   he 's gone from directing Die Antwoord music videos to  his  own short films. With a new retrospective monograph  Ballenesque  out October 10 from Thames & Hudson  Ballen declares for all the world to hear that  he  is an icon.\nBallenesque opens with an essay by historian and cultural critic Robert J.C. Young. In it  Young begins to define the mesmerizing  \"instantly recognizable\" quality of Ballen's images  which he variously calls \"prehensile portraits \" \"aleatory assemblages \" \"windowless walls \" and \"dark junctures of disjunction.\" When Young introduces these cornerstones of  Ballen 's style  he writes  \"We isolate four; you  the viewer of the photograph  may add a fifth to complete the secret.\"\nThe rest of the book is a guided tour through  Ballen 's work  complemented by 50 pages of the artist's own anecdotes  autobiography  thoughts on technique  and philosophy. It all starts with blurry family portraits  Ballen  shot with a Mamiya camera  he  bought at 13 years old.  He  shares the first photo  his  that  he  really liked  a picture of a dead cat on the side of the road.\nAs  he  got older   he  became a documentarian of 60s and 70s counterculture  from grimacing Vietnam War protesters to carefree nudists at Woodstock. Many photos from this period in  his  career are shown for the first time within the pages of Ballenesque. By 1979   Ballen  had begun to travel the world  collecting snapshots of kids from New York to Indonesia that would be collected into a series called Boyhood.\nWhen he moved to South Africa   Ballen  became fixated on the human toll of apartheid.  He  traveled the impoverished South African countryside as a geologist  but photographed the people and places  he  saw along the way.  He  collected these images into the two series that made  him  famous  Platteland and Outland.\nAlso debuting in the new monograph are Ballen's paintings from the 1970s  which informed  his  abstract photography in Asylum of the Birds and The Theater of Apparitions. \"It was exciting to put those paintings in the book \"  he  said. Many of the paintings were lost when  his  father cleaned them out of their childhood home  but the ones that survive have been documented for Ballenesque. \"I didn't paint for 30 years  but in a way these set the foundation for my later work.\"\nBy the end of the text   Ballen 's work seems to exist  like one of his paintings  largely within his own mind. \"From about 2002 onward  you rarely see a human face in the photos \"  Ballen  said.  His  current project  teased in the final pages  is called Ah Rats. Now the vermin that have infested the edges of  his  work for years are at its center. In January   Ballen  art directed Die Antwoord's video for \"Tommy Can't Sleep \" which is full of the rats that are on his brain.\n Ballen  still walks Johannesburg looking for places to take pictures for around five hours a day.  He  spends the rest of  his  time with  his  family  administrating the Roger Ballen Foundation  and tending  his  collection of more than 100 pets. \"There's rats  snakes  chickens  ducks  lizards  rabbits  spiders  doves  pigeons  crows  mice \"  he  rattles off. Around 10 percent have names  including a bird named Icarus and a rat named Stoffel.\nIcarus  Stoffel  and  Ballen 's Johannesburg home are far from the roiling American political scene  but  Ballen  has some advice for young artists trying to distinguish themselves in a photographic era he describes as \"amorphous\" compared to when he cut his teeth.\nBallen is quick to clarify that he doesn't mean photographers should risk physical harm by \"jumping the White House fence\" to get a unique photograph. \"It's years and years and hours and hours later that you're developing an approach. My pictures are powerful because they access the subconscious mind. 'On the line' can mean psychological  as well as physical.\" Years spent paying attention to places and people others would rather ignore are how  Ballen  put  himself  on the line. As a result   his  photographs of outsiders help the rest of us look inward.", "output": "Roger Ballen's, Ballen's", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Joseph and his pregnant wife Mary traveled to the little town of Bethlehem so that they could be counted. There being no room for the couple at any of the inns  they stayed in a stable  where Mary gave birth to  a baby boy  Jesus .\nUnfortunately   Jesus  was born into a police state not unlike the growing menace of the American police state. And when  he  grew up   Jesus  did not shy away from speaking truth to power. Indeed   his  teachings undermined the political and religious establishment of  his  day.  He  was eventually crucified as a warning to others not to challenge the powers-that-be.\nYet what if  instead of being born into the Roman police state   Jesus  had been born and raised in the American police state?\nInstead of being born in a manger   Jesus  might have been born at home. Rather than wise men and shepherds bringing gifts  however  the baby\u2019s parents might have been forced to ward off visits from state social workers intent on prosecuting them for the home birth. One couple in Washington had all three of their children removed after social services objected to the two youngest being birthed in an unassisted home delivery.\nFrom the time  he  was old enough to attend school   Jesus  would have been drilled in lessons of compliance and obedience to government authorities  while learning little about  his  own rights. Had  he  dared to step out of line while in school   he  might have found  himself  tasered or beaten by a school resource officer  or at the very least suspended under a school zero tolerance policy that punishes minor infractions as harshly as more serious offenses.\nHad  Jesus  disappeared for a few hours let alone days as a 12-year-old   his  parents would have been handcuffed  arrested and jailed for parental negligence.\nFrom the moment  Jesus  made contact with an \u201cextremist\u201d such as John the Baptist   he  would have been flagged for surveillance because of  his  association with a prominent activist  peaceful or otherwise. Since 9/11  the FBI has actively carried out surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations on a broad range of activist groups.\nJesus\u2019 anti-government views would certainly have resulted in  him  being labeled a domestic extremist.

In fact  the number of cities that have resorted to criminalizing homelessness by enacting bans on camping  sleeping in vehicles  loitering and begging in public has doubled.\nViewed by the government as a dissident and potential threat to its power   Jesus  might have had government spies planted among  his  followers to monitor  his  activities  report on  his  movements  and entrap  him  into breaking the law. Such Judases today \u2014 called informants \u2014 often receive hefty paychecks from the government for their treachery.\nHad  Jesus  used the internet to spread  his  radical message of peace and love   he  might have found  his  blog posts infiltrated by government spies attempting to undermine  his  integrity  discredit  him  or plant incriminating information online about  him . At the very least   he  would have had  his  website hacked and  his  email monitored.\nHad  Jesus  attempted to feed large crowds of people   he  would have been threatened with arrest for violating various ordinances prohibiting the distribution of food without a permit. Florida officials arrested a 90-year-old man for feeding the homeless on a public beach.\nHad  Jesus  spoken publicly about  his  40 days in the desert and  his  conversations with the devil   he  might have been labeled mentally ill and detained in a psych ward with no access to family or friends.\nWithout a doubt  had  Jesus  attempted to overturn tables in a Jewish temple and rage against the materialism of religious institutions   he  would have been charged with a hate crime. Currently  45 states and the federal government have hate crime laws on the books.\nRather than having armed guards capture  Jesus  in a public place  government officials would have ordered that a SWAT team carry out a raid on  Jesus  and  his  followers  complete with flash-bang grenades and military equipment.

You're not as hardcore on taxes. 'I can give up on that ' some voters might think. But when you're talking about somebody else's life  that's a whole different ballgame. And I think that's the big difference.\"\n Moore  has underscored that major divide frequently at  his  campaign events  where  he 's continued to deny the accusations against  him  but also refused to answer questions from the media about the swirling scandals. Multiple women have accused the former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice of pursuing them romantically decades ago when they were teenagers and  he  was in  his  30s  and one woman has said  he  initiated sexual contact with her when she was just 14.\n Moore 's allies have also doubled down on the abortion issue in the race's final stretch. America First PAC  a pro-President Trump superPAC that's supporting  Moore  in the race  released an ad this week calling Jones's position on abortion \"unforgivable \" showing an ultrasound and a heartbeat that then flatlines.\n Moore  spokeswoman Jane Porter was even less subtle when she appeared on CNN Tuesday  talking to pregnant anchor Poppy Harlow and congratulating her on her \"unborn child.\"\nBut  Moore  has seized upon the initial comments to MSNBC  with  his  wife  Kayla  claiming that Jones supports \"full-term abortion.\" PolitiFact rated that claim as false  since there is no such thing as \"full-term abortion.\"\nSteven Taylor  a political science professor at Alabama's Troy University  agreed that social issues may be a sticking point that many conservative voters aren't able to overcome in voting for Jones. In addition to abortion   Moore  has hammered home  his  opposition to same-sex marriage and transgender rights.\n\"I think that  without a doubt  the social issues will motivate voters even if they are skeptical of the allegations against  Moore  \" Taylor said. \"Quite clearly  abortion is probably the most salient issue in the race  and more generally  social issues.\"\nThe fact that  Moore  is seen as a champion on social issues is nothing new. It's what propelled  him  to national political stardom \u2014 and into plenty of controversy. In 2003  he  was first removed from the state bench when  he  erected a statue of the Ten Commandments in the Alabama Judicial Building and refused to remove it even when ordered to do so by a federal court.  He  was elected again in 2012  but then subsequently suspended when  he  ordered state judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide under the federal Constitution.\nTo Moore and  his  supporters  that defiance is a badge of honor. And it's a big reason why many voters are likely reluctant to believe the sexual misconduct and sexual assault allegations against him too  given the Christian nationalist positions he's wholeheartedly embraced in the past.

And even the most on-message president can slip up and cause an international incident  whether it\u00e2s Ronald Reagan joking into a hot mic that \u00e2we begin bombing [the Soviet Union] in five minutes \u00e2 prompting a brief red alert of Soviet forces  or Barack Obama referring to \u00e2Polish death camps\u00e2 and having to apologize for seeming to conflate the occupied Poles with the Nazis. The more spontaneous interactions a president has  the greater the chances for the dreaded gaffe  which is why the president\u00e2s Twitter feed has been known to cause heartburn among U.S. national-security professionals.  Trump  relies not just on national-security and media-relations teams to craft anodyne public statements  but also on  his  ability to communicate directly with the world via the internet. But there\u00e2s a cost to this freedom. Since he became president in January  some of his tweets have caused his administration legal problems; others have resulted in full-blown diplomatic incidents. In some cases  his Cabinet officials have tried to articulate U.S. policy to allies and adversaries alike  only to be undercut by a conflicting tweet from the president.\nHere are some of the highlights of the president\u00e2s unique brand of diplomacy\u00e2and its aftershocks. Tweet Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! \u00e2  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  February 2  2017 Background The \u00e2dumb deal\u00e2 the president referred to was an Obama-era agreement on refugees. The U.S. had agreed with Australia to let in 1 250 refugees who  under a controversial Australian policy  were housed in camps in the Pacific islands of Papua New Guinea and Nauru; Australia  in turn  would resettle refugees from El Salvador  Guatemala  and Honduras. By the time he sent the tweet on February 2   Trump  had signed an executive order that banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations. (That order was blocked by courts  though the Supreme Court has allowed another version of it to proceed while litigation is ongoing.)  He  had also conducted what\u00e2s now an infamous phone call with Malcolm Turnbull  the Australian prime minister  in which  he  accused Turnbull of trying to export the \u00e2next Boston bombers\u00e2 and hung up. The call and the tweet were unusually hostile for an ally that\u00e2s fought alongside American troops in nearly every conflict since World War II. Upshot Despite initial speculation  Trump  would back out of the deal  the first refugees from the deal were resettled in the U.S. in September. U.S.-Australia relations are holding steady.\n* * * Tweet My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.  \u00e2 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  February 19  2017 Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT! \u00e2  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  February 20  2017 Background At a rally in Florida in February   Trump  attacked Europe\u00e2s policy of allowing in refugees fleeing conflict or persecution in Syria and elsewhere\u00e2connecting them to terrorist attacks and vowing to protect the U.S. \u00e2We\u00e2ve got to keep our country safe \u00e2  he  said. \u00e2You look at what\u00e2s happening in Germany  you look at what\u00e2s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden  who would believe this?\u00e2 Certainly not the Swedes. A spokesman for Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said \u00e2it\u00e2s hard to say what  Trump  is talking about.\u00e2 The Swedish embassy in Washington tweeted: @SteveKopack On #swedenincident unclear to us what  President Trump  was referring to  have asked US officials for explanation \u00e2 Embassy of Sweden US (@SwedeninUSA) February 19  2017 We look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies. [Link] \u00e2 Embassy of Sweden US (@SwedeninUSA) February 19  2017 Carl Bildt  the former center-right Swedish prime minister  who before  Trump \u00e2s election was one of the most active Twitter-using global figures  added: Sweden? Terror attack? What has  he  been smoking? Questions abound. [Link] \u00e2 Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) February 19  2017\nThe Fox News segment  Trump  cited in response to  his  critics has been discredited. But  he \u00e2s made similar remarks about Germany and France  linking their intake of refugees and migrants to terrorism. Europe more broadly is grappling with the challenge of integrating large numbers of migrants and refugees  and it\u00e2s an issue that has helped fuel far-right parties in several countries. But this year many European governments  including Sweden  have tightened immigration rules  and far-right parties are once again slipping in the polls. Upshot Trump hasn\u00e2t tweeted about Sweden since February. In April  Sweden suffered what the Times described as its \u00e2worst terrorist attack in decades\u00e2 when a driver plowed his truck into pedestrians in Stockholm; the man who admitted carrying out the attack was an Uzbek national whose asylum application had been rejected the previous year. * * * Tweet Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his \"no reason to be alarmed\" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it! \u00e2  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5  2017 .@Theresa_May   don\u00e2t focus on me  focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine! \u00e2 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30  2017 Background Trump\u00e2s feud with Sadiq Khan  the London mayor  dates back to the presidential campaign. Following the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino in late 2015  the Republican called for a \u00e2total and complete shutdown\u00e2 of Muslims entering the U.S. Khan  the son of Pakistani immigrants to the U.K.  called Trump\u00e2s remarks about Islam \u00e2ignorant \u00e2 and said he hoped Hillary Clinton  Trump\u00e2s Democratic rival at the time  \u00e2trounces him.\u00e2  Trump  told an interviewer that  he  would \u00e2remember those statements. They are very nasty statements.\u00e2 He did. When a terrorist struck London over the summer  Khan told the city\u00e2s residents not to be \u00e2alarmed\u00e2 by the \u00e2increased police presence.\u00e2  Trump  seemed to take that remark out of context on Twitter to imply that Khan was underplaying the threat of terrorism.\nTrump\u00e2s feud with Khan fits his pattern of interaction with the London mayor  but his recent put-down of Theresa May was more surprising. It began when  late last month   Trump  retweeted anti-Muslim videos shared by a British far-right group. May said the president was \u00e2wrong\u00e2 to have shared the videos  which purported to show Muslims committing violent acts  and which have dubious provenance or have been debunked.  Trump  tweeted that  her  efforts might be better spent preventing \u00e2radical Islamic terrorism\u00e2 in the U.K. Upshot Khan is one of the most popular political figures in the U.K. May not so much. But  Trump  is so disliked within the country that Brits were united in outrage against  his  tweets and  his  rebuke of May. Calls for Trump\u00e2s planned state visit to the U.K. to be canceled grew in the wake of the tweets. The lasting damage this particular episode has on U.S.-U.K. relations will likely be small  since  feuds aside  the \u00e2special relationship\u00e2 continues to serve both countries\u00e2 interests. Still  that relationship has long been more important to the U.K. than to the U.S. Trump\u00e2s tweets make that even more apparent. * * * Tweet During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look! \u00e2 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6  2017 Background The U.S. has forged close counterterrorism partnerships with Gulf countries  despite some of those countries\u00e2 historical support for radical Islamist groups opposed to the U.S. This includes Qatar  which not only has oil and gas reserves  but is home to the largest U.S. military base in the region. Qatar also has what could euphemistically be called an accommodating foreign policy: It is close to Western countries but also maintains ties with U.S. adversaries like Iran  Hamas  and the Taliban. This summer  in part to punish what they called Qatar\u00e2s support for extremist groups and ties to Iran  Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a broad economic and travel blockade on Qatar and severed all relations with it.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson  who as chief executive of Exxon traveled widely in the region and has deep personal relations with the royals in Qatar and elsewhere  urged the countries involved \u00e2to sit down together and address these differences.\u00e2 Trump\u00e2s tweet took a different tone and  according to The New York Times  prompted the Qataris to begin \u00e2asking American officials whether their longtime alliance was in peril.\u00e2 Despite Tillerson and others\u00e2 attempts at diplomacy   Trump  followed up by publicly calling Qatar a \u00e2funder of terrorism at a very high level.\u00e2 Upshot Insulting allies may not do too much lasting damage\u00e2alliances outlast presidential term limits after all. But there\u00e2s the separate question of what mixed messages do to short-term foreign-policy goals.

He  had shepherded Donald Trump to the most unlikely presidential victory ever .  He  was preparing to go with Trump to the White House as a senior strategist .  He  was the new hot thing .  Bannon  is   suddenly   a man without a friend left in the world . So what ' s  his  next act ? To answer that I reached out to my friend Josh Green   who wrote the incredible Bannon biography \" Devil ' s Bargain :  Steve Bannon   Donald Trump    and the Storming of the Presidency .\" Our email conversation about all things  Bannon  is below . Cillizza : Josh   as the foremost Bannonologist in the country -- if that ' s not a thing   I am making it a thing right now -- I turn to you for wisdom at this amazing moment .  Steve Bannon  appears to be totally and completely on the outs with Donald Trump    his  political patron   after talking ( at length ) to Michael Wolff for \" Fire and Fury .\" Trump said that  Bannon  lost  his  mind ! Trump appears to be WAY angrier at  Bannon  than when he actually fired him a few months back . So is this the end of the end ? A seven - year political friendship turned into \" Sloppy Steve \" Green : What  Bannon  did by talking to Wolff for this book -- and by extension   probably   talking to me for my book -- is pour a can of gasoline over  his  head and light a match .  Trump  appears to have broken with  him  in a way that seems final and ultimate   even tagging  him  with a dreaded nickname   \" Sloppy Steve  \" which I think we can all admit is pretty fantastic .  Bannon  has been in the doghouse before and come back . I hear that  he  thinks  he  can come back from this   too . We ' ll see ; nothing ' s ever quite impossible in  Trump  ' s world . You can never say never . As  Bannon  has told people in the past   Trump is entirely transactional . But if  he  loses  his  platform at Breitbart News   then it ' s hard for me to see how  he  ' ll be able to wield the kind of influence that I describe in \" Devil ' s Bargain  \" and that  he  seemed to have regained after leaving the White House last year . Cillizza : Let ' s talk about  Bannon  and Breitbart . There ' s reporting out there they may oust him . And Rebekah Mercer   one of the major financial patrons of Breitbart ( and  Bannon  )  said publicly that she and he are not on speaking terms and she ' s not going to be funding what he does anymore . What ' s weird to me is that it appears Bannon ' s quotes on  Trump  to Wolff have had a far more profound effect on his role at Breitbart -- and in the conservative firmament more generally -- then when he was fired by  Trump  ! After that   he was welcomed as a conquering hero back into Breitbart ! Is it solely the Wolff book ? And is  Bannon  really in danger of losing  his  Breitbart platform ? Green : The reason uber - wealthy people like the Mercers become involved in politics is to exert influence .  Bannon  was an agent of that influence   and the architect . And  he  did   for a time   have a profound influence on American politics that culminated in Trump ' s election .  Bannon  was the real force behind Breitbart ; the head honcho at GAI   which produced the \" Clinton Cash \" book so damaging to Hillary ' s candidacy ; and a board member at Cambridge Analytica : The reason uber - wealthy people like the Mercers become involved in politics is to exert influence .  Bannon  was an agent of that influence   and the architect . And  he  did   for a time   have a profound influence on American politics that culminated in Trump ' s election .  Bannon  was the real force behind Breitbart ; the head honcho at GAI   which produced the \" Clinton Cash \" book so damaging to Hillary ' s candidacy ; and a board member at Cambridge Analytica   the data research firm that worked on the Trump campaign So as an investment   Bannon really did pay off for the Mercers like early -' 80s Apple stock . The problem is that effectiveness waned almost immediately upon entering the White House   and that   coupled with his megalomania and his belief that he was the true leader of the nationalist movement   backfired on him big time .  Trump  obviously doesn ' t value him the way that he did a year ago . With the humiliation of Moore ' s loss in Alabama and the devastating quotes in Wolff ' s book attacking  Trump '  s family   there was really no reason to keep him around . And when Trump turns on someone   he really TURNS on them ! Cillizza : I am STUNNED that Bannon ever entertained the idea of a presidential bid . That would   um   never work . But let ' s assume -- just for the purpose of the conversation -- he hangs on at Breitbart . How does he start to rebuild what he ' s lost ? And just for the thought experiment : If Breitbart jettisons Bannon -- where does he go then ? Green : Look   here on planet Earth we ' re all rightly astonished that  Bannon  holds ( held ?) But the psychology would work as follows :  Bannon  has always thought that  Trump  was riding a global nationalist wave that ' d swept across Europe   the UK and now the US .  Trump  embraced that politics --  Bannon  ' s politics -- and got elected . So clearly the ideas resonate in the US . If  Trump  were to decide against running for re - election   Bannon   believing  he  ' s the true carrier of the faith   must ' ve thought   \" Why not me ?\" Like his ex - boss   he ' s always been a guy with a healthy ego . But if he were to lose the Breitbart platform   it ' s hard for me to envision what vehicle he would use to lead such a movement and how he would fund it . But he ' s not self - fund - a - presidential - campaign rich . So a presidential bid is off . [ Shakes hands   nods   walks away .] BUT   what then does Bannon do ? This guy is a news animal . He appears to be totally obsessed with the media   the battle of ideas between the two parties   all of it . It feels impossible for someone like Steve Bannon to just disappear from   well   anywhere -- especially a world in which Donald Trump is president . Green : In the near term   Bannon does ( and is doing ) what everybody who wants to influence and ingratiate themselves to Trump does : Flatter him with obsequious praise . It shouldn '  t  be lost on anyone that after Bannon called Trump a \" great man \" on  his  radio show on the evening of  his  own defenestration   Trump quickly learned about it ( probably from a cable TV chyron ) and mentioned this to reporters at the White House pool spray on Thursday . I ' m skeptical it ' ll work . But that ' s the only path back for Bannon that I can imagine . Or   heck   why doesn ' t he run for president ? It ' s an automatic way to get in front of the cameras and spread a message .", "output": "Trump Steve Bannon, Bannon", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16 years of age  and sexual contact between someone who is 19 years of age or older and a person who is 12 to 16 years of age is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year. The Post points out that enticing a child under 16 years of age into a home with the purpose of proposing sexual contact is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The statute of limitations on the felony charge would have run out in three years in 1979.

Her  ultimate goal is to compete at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be rough \u00e2\u0080\u009d the 20-year-old told NBC Sports on Thursday  noting  she \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also be employing a new coach  who  she \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll name later. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the muscle memory is there because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve played in the gym. All of my skills are basically still there. There are a couple of skills  like on [balance] beam  that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done yet  like a dismount  because why would I just chuck that?

Olympic alternate Ragan Smith  17  has stepped up  her  game  as well  winning the U.S. championship to assert  herself  as a favorite going into worlds. Smith was unable to compete  however  due to a last-minute ankle injury  she  sustained while warming up on the vault.\n Biles  may get a chance to mingle with both if  she  chooses to participate in a U.S. national team camp in January. Right now   she  said  she \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll \u00e2\u0080\u009cprobably\u00e2\u0080\u009d attend  but  she  won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be doing anything intensive if  she  goes.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c[I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go] just to get back in the swing of things \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Biles  told NBC Sports. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back in the rhythm to just go in there and do whatever I need to do.

Suddenly  Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense was dominant.  Baker  Mayfield felt pressure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and unlike so many games throughout  his  career  was unable to escape it;  he  was sacked three times in the pivotal third quarter  which the Sooners spent bottled up in their own end of the field  and threw an interception on the first play of the fourth quarter  leading to the Bulldogs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 go-ahead touchdown. Offensively  Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running game kicked into high gear  with Nick Chubb and Sony Michel each scoring touchdowns on long runs.\nAlthough  Mayfield  tied  it  with a fantastic drive midway through the fourth quarter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and Oklahoma took the lead on a defensive score \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Jake Fromm matched him  leading the Bulldogs to the tying score with 55 seconds left.\nGeorgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freshman quarterback was overshadowed in the run-up to the game by Baker Mayfield  the Heisman winner. And he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch the ball on the final play; Sony Michel took a direct snap to the house.\nDiscombobulated by Oklahoma in the first half  Georgia turned things around with a dominant third-quarter performance. Oklahoma led by 14 and got the ball to start the quarter. But Georgia sandwiched a pair of three-and-outs around a 50-yard touchdown run by Nick Chubb  then stopped Oklahoma again.  Baker Mayfield  who was rarely touched  in the first half  spent the third quarter on  his  back \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including two sacks on consecutive plays to stall one possession. When  Mayfield \u00e2\u0080\u0099s third-down pass intended for tight end Mark Andrews sailed high  it was an easy interception for safety Dominick Sanders  who returned it to the 4.\nThe rookie head coach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-earned reputation as a strategist and playcaller was on full display from the beginning  when  Baker Mayfield  connected with fullback Dimitri Flowers on consecutive plays for 26 and 16 yards. The Sooners mixed runs and passes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and had especially nice calls on third downs  including screens to beat blitzes and shallow crossing routes that became long gains. The tour de force came at the end of the first half  when on third-and-goal from the 2  Riley dialed up a toss to Flowers going left \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that became a reverse to receiver CeeDee Lamb \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that finished as a run-pass option for the receiver  who lofted an easy touchdown pass to  Mayfield  in the back corner of the end zone.", "output": "Baker Mayfield", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Hudson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bay did not comment on the bid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value  and  Signa  declined to comment.\n Signa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offer  comes one week after Hudson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bay agreed to sell its flagship Lord & Taylor building in New York for $850 million to WeWork Cos.\nThe Reuters sources said that  Signa  expects Toronto-based Hudson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bay  which has been reluctant so far to engage in negotiations to sell Kaufhof  to respond to  the offer  by the middle of November.\nHudson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bay called  the offer  incomplete  non-binding and unsolicited  with no evidence of financing.\nThe sources said that in its offer letter to Hudson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bay   Signa  stated  its  bid for Kaufhof would not be contingent on any third-party financing  since  it  already has 700 million euros in approved financing from European banks  and also has cash available from a 1 billion euro equity raise last month.\n Signa  has also offered to assume all of Kaufhof\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liabilities  including a 1.34 billion euro real estate loan by German bank LBBW  the sources added.\nHudson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bay said it plans to review  the offer  in due course.

First  though  the answer to my question.\nAccording to  Nussbaum   EPA wanted places like California to reduce smog  and that meant cars would have to be fitted with catalytic converters. However  since gasoline lead ruins catalytic converters  refineries needed to produced unleaded gasoline. This was the initial impetus behind unleaded gasoline. The fact that it also reduced atmospheric lead was basically a happy accident.\nThe first item\u00e2\u0080\u0094unfortunately for HUD\u00e2\u0080\u0094suggested that lead poisoning was not correlated with lead paint in housing. After all  there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no reason to think that kids are exposed to more lead paint in the summer. The second item suggests that lead poisoning is correlated with gasoline lead.\u00c2\u00b2 And the third item immediately convinced Carter to continue the lead phasedown. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe stated he did not want any policy that might have a particularly deleterious effect on these two groups \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Nussbaum  says.\nOn a statistical note   Nussbaum  adds this: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the benefit of hindsight  Carter was concerned about the harmful effects on minority populations. Would he have even have known this if the graph just had one composite line for blood lead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maybe not. Sometimes flukes of data presentation are all it takes to influence public policy.\n\u00c2\u00b9If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wondering why the chart doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show white children  the answer is lost to history.

Only about 600 people a year could get this treatment  based on Wednesday's approval. Even so  the approval has industry experts and cancer doctors excited.\nHow  Kymriah  works\n Kymriah  isn't your run-of-the-mill pill \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or even a biologic drug  like insulin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that can be mass produced. Since the therapy is made from a person's own immune system  the process can take about three weeks.\nWhile that's a one-time process  it's not the end of the road. About half of the patients in a Kymriah study got cytokine-release syndrome  a response to the reprogrammed cells running loose in the body. It can cause high fevers and flu-like symptoms  and it can be life-threatening. If they get it  patients need to be admitted to intensive-care units  which can bring additional costs. (The FDA on Wednesday expanded the approval of Actemra  a rheumatoid-arthritis drug that can also treat cytokine-release syndrome.)\nIn a trial of 63 patients treated with Kymriah  83% were in remission after three months  and 64% were still in remission after a year.\nKymriah is the first CAR-T cell therapy to get approved  and several more are in the works. Kite Pharma  Juno Therapeutics  and Bluebird Bio are among a growing group of biotech companies working with CAR-T. Kite  which was recently acquired by Gilead Sciences  is expected to hear back from the FDA about its treatment for aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma by November.\n\"We're at the very beginning of what's going to be a big new field of medicine \" said  David Epstein  who helped license Kymriah from the University of Pennsylvania while at Novartis .\n Epstein  left Novartis in 2016 as CEO of its pharmaceuticals divisions.  He 's now the executive chairman of Rubius Therapeutics  a biotech firm that's also working with cell therapy to develop treatments like  Kymriah  that don't have to be as personalized. The hope is that one day doctors will be able to prescribe a cell therapy and use it that same day instead of waiting weeks to get it back.\n Epstein  said  he  envisioned cell therapies having much shorter life cycles than traditional drugs. Instead of getting a better  updated therapy for a disease every decade or so  we might begin to see second-generation cell therapies in a few years.\nThose updates could increase the number of patients that cell therapies can treat. The 600 or so people a year eligible for  Kymriah  now could become tens of thousands  but  it  would require some major changes   Epstein  said.\nFor one  the treatments would have to treat more types of cancer than the one  Kymriah  was approved for on Wednesday.\nAnd to affect more people  the cell therapies would need to go beyond blood cancers. Right now  that's where most of the big successes have come from  but that could one day include solid tumors and maybe even autoimmune diseases like Type 1 diabetes   Epstein  said.", "output": "Kymriah", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

The German Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Abuse (DBDD) found that in 2015 alone  nearly five million Germans had smoked cannabis at least once that year \u2013 and that's just the people willing to admit to it.\nThe nuclear bunker where  Rossner  hopes to start  his  empire is an intimidating structure \u2013 50 meters long and 15 meters high  with ventilation shafts like a medieval fortress. \"I think our plants will be pretty safe within these walls \" Ro\u00dfner smiles.\nThrough the study   Rossner  hopes to provide 150 patients with cannabis grown in  his  bunker. If both the research and the necessary production of marijuana are approved by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Services and the Federal Narcotics Board in Germany  Bunker PPD  could start supplying clients with medicinal weed by March 2018.\nOn the left   Christoph Rossner  standing in  his  future weed farm. On the right  a former radio control centre.\n Rossner  is a strong believer in the healing powers of weed. When  he  was 18   his  left shoulder was crushed by a steel beam during  his  apprenticeship at an industrial mechanics company.  He  smoked to ease the chronic pain  he  was experiencing as a result of the accident  and still does to this day. The only difference now is that  he  gets  his  weed legally with a prescription. \"In case you're wondering  I'm high right now \"  he  admits.\nIn 1994  the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany made it legal for individuals to carry a small amount of cannabis \u2013 between five and ten grams  depending on the German region. In the late 90s  Ro\u00dfner took advantage of the increased demand by setting up an illegal \"weed pharmacy\".  His  client base grew steadily and included cancer and arthritis patients. But eventually  the police came to see  him   too. In 2000   he  was sentenced to two years and one month in prison.  He  ended up spending five months there  and four months in therapy.\nIf at any point the power should fail  Ro\u00dfner can rely on four diesel generators to supply  his  cannabis plantation with the necessary light.\nBut  Rossner  has a long way to go. As we step out of the bunker and back into the sunlight   he  tells me that  his  lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the Federal Institute for Drugs. The agency is requiring potential medicinal weed producers to prove that they've already grown  processed and delivered at least 50 kilos (or 110 pounds) of cannabis within the last three years. Considering it has been illegal to produce in Germany up until now   Rossner  can't understand why the government would expect anyone to have done that \u2013 let alone kept some sort of paper trail of it.\nWhile he's waiting for the German authorities to approve his plan   Rossner  is keeping a worried eye on  his  competitors. In the US  a number of American companies are systematically buying up smaller producers \u2013 a dynamic that could expand into and take over the German market. Even though his lab doesn't exist yet and there's nothing to buy   Rossner  already tells me he's adamant he won't be bought. He wants to do it on his own terms  in his own nuclear bunker.", "output": "Christoph Rossner", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Wice  in particular is an aspiring media celebrity  serving as a TV \u201clegal analyst\u201d on Houston\u2019s Channel 2 (KPRC) since 2003. Think of a male version of Nancy Grace or Greta Van Susteren \u2014 a Dan Abrams wannabe. One profile described the bombastic  Wice  as a \u201cmedia magnet\u201d who \u201cnever shies away from the spotlight.\u201d The KPRC website brags that\nBeginning the very day  Schaffer  and Wice were appointed by Becker  the prosecutors were in contact with the media  shamelessly promoting themselves by mass distributing press statements and publicity photos.  Schaffer  and  Wice  obviously intended to milk the case for all the news coverage they could get  for two self-serving reasons: to poison the well of public opinion against Paxton  and to generate free advertising to attract future clients. Neither motive is ethical for a special prosecutor. Yet   Wice  has conceded that pretrial media coverage \u201cimpacts the way potential jurors view our client\u2019s case long before they are ushered into the courtroom for voir dire. Being able to effectively represent your client on the courthouse steps can be every bit as important as representing them inside the courtroom.\u201d\nMoreover   Wice  once cynically acknowledged the economic benefits of making media appearances  informing fellow lawyers that \u201cappearing on TV is client development \u2014 free advertising \u2014 that might well yield future business. And you never can tell what that one local  or  with a bit of good fortune  national TV appearance  can do for you or your practice.\u201d Exploiting the media  in other words  is the latest form of ambulance chasing. \u201cCelebrity\u201d attorneys  like the Kardashians  are famous for being famous.\nIn that vein  Schaffer and Wice continued a steady stream of self-aggrandizing communications with the press corps during the \u201cinvestigation\u201d and grand jury phases  despite the strict secrecy associated with the grand jury process. The special prosecutors had numerous communications (by email and telephone) with the New York Times\u2019 reporter early in the case  following which the NYT reported Paxton\u2019s indictment on August 1  2015  before the indictment was even unsealed. Was this national media scoop a coincidence? The special prosecutors were the obvious source of the highly-unprofessional leak  but the press corps gratefully reciprocated by uncritically reporting  Wice \u2019s spin as \u201cnews.\u201d\nIn addition to regularly sending eager reporters status updates and copies of pleadings and orders  on at least two occasions  Wice  circulated to the media Paxton\u2019s annual Personal Financial Statement  presumably to encourage reporters to scrutinize the donors to Paxton\u2019s legal defense fund \u2014 a wholly improper purpose. In an even more egregious breach of propriety   Wice  emailed a copy of Paxton\u2019s booking \u201cmugshot\u201d to his KPRC colleague  reporter Phil Archer  shortly after Paxton was released on bail. The only word to describe this type of conduct is \u201csleazy.\u201d\nIntemperately denouncing Paxton\u2019s legal arguments as \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cclearly baseless \u201d the special prosecutors\u2019 tone toward Paxton dripped with contempt as they delivered sound bites to groveling reporters on deadline. When asked by a reporter about a new attorney joining the Paxton defense team to deal with the federal civil case (which was ultimately dismissed with prejudice)   Schaffer  sarcastically responded \u201cNever heard of him. Looks like we set off the Lawyer Relief Act\u2026\u201d When a prominent Paxton supporter wrote an op-ed in the Midland Reporter-Telegram  criticizing the indictment  the thin-skinned prosecutors immediately issued a florid press statement \u2014 presumably on the taxpayers\u2019 nickel \u2014 condemning the piece as a \u201crant\u201d containing \u201clies bathed in the cologne of half-truths  fabrications and disinformation.\u201d\nMimicking the prosecutors\u2019 flippant and unprofessional tone  some reporters began running stories with shockingly-unbalanced headlines  such as \u201cAnother Day  Another Idiotic Ken Paxton Motion \u201d which  Schaffer  and Wice gleefully circulated to their media contacts  with the message \u201cI love it.\u201d If media outlets did not parrot the prosecutors\u2019 swaggering narrative  they were cut off from \u201cinsider access.\u201d\nThis incestuous arrangement likely explains why the Dallas Morning News  which was closely following the Paxton case  never reported the bombshell mentioned in Part 2 \u2014 that  Schaffer  was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal RICO case against the leader of the Bandidos motorcycle gang \u2014 a revelation that would have greatly tarnished the special prosecutors\u2019 undeserved Boy Scout image \u2014 which McGaughy had gone to extraordinary lengths to burnish.\nThis apparently referred to Paxton\u2019s retention of a defense team that included Dan Cogdell and Philip Hilder  with respect to whom  Schaffer  and Wice issued polite public statements.\nThe hundreds of email exchanges between the prosecutors and reporters (McGaughy in particular) are clearly collusive. With the avid cooperation of the press corps  for two and a half years  Schaffer  and Wice have been busy smearing Paxton through leaks and planted stories  all while risibly claiming to be \u201cseeking justice on behalf of the people of Texas.\u201d\nTo re-cap this series: The baseless  politicized prosecution of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has been a travesty on many levels. Following the recusal of Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis  the matter should not have been referred to mercenary \u201cspecial prosecutors\u201d for investigation;  Schaffer  (the unindicted co-conspirator in a RICO case) and Wice (an incorrigible diva) were not suitable for the assignment in any event; the open-ended compensation arrangement agreed to by Judge Scott Becker was both unlawful and foolhardy; the grand jury indictment improperly obtained by the unscrupulous prosecutors amounts to fabricated felonies \u2014 made-up crimes never previously prosecuted in a Texas court; the overtly-biased George Gallagher presided over the case as a farcical kangaroo court; changing the venue of the case to Harris County was an absurd and outrageous denial of due process to Paxton; et cetera  ad infinitum.", "output": "Schaffer Wice, Wice", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

It  came up from the Mississippi Delta and was raised in Memphis before exploding in the smokey small South and West side bars of Chicago.\nThe film was born in 2007 when  Smith  was given a copy of a Guilfoile short story titled \u00e2O Death Where Is Thy Sting?\u00e2 It was contained in a collection titled \u00e2Chicago Blues\u00e2 (Bleak House  2007). Edited by Libby Fischer Hellman with an introduction written by me  it contained 21 stories. The man who reviewed the book for the Tribune  Dick Adler  called Guilfoile\u00e2s story \u00e2spooky.\u00e2\n\u00e2I thought the story was great \u00e2 says  Smith   a longtime creative director for advertising agencies such as Element 79 and Leo Burnett and the co-founder in 2009 of a film/commercial production outfit called Fulton Market Films (fultonmarketfilms.com) with John Fromstein  this film\u00e2s executive producer and the man who gave  Smith  Guilfoile\u00e2s short story). \u00e2I immediately saw it as a feature film.\u00e2\nHe called Guilfoile  whom he had met before  since  Guilfoile  too toiled in the ad business before devoting himself to writing full time  and asked  \u00e2Want to collaborate on a script?\u00e2\n\u00e2I was flattered \u00e2 says  Guilfoile . \u00e2Though there has been some movie interest and deals involving my novels (2005\u00e2s \u00e2Cast of Shadows\u00e2 was followed by 2010\u00e2s \u00e2The Thousand\u00e2) but no one had ever asked me to collaborate on writing a script. I was excited to work with Scott. The structure of a screenplay is so different. This was a great learning experience for me.\u00e2\nHappy with their collaboration \u00e2 even though \u00e2we must have rewritten the ending seven times \u00e2 says  Guilfoile \u00e2 Smith  began the arduous process of getting it on screen.\nThe script sat around and was passed around for years. \u00e2I had almost forgotten there was a script when  Smith  called and said we might get the movie made \u00e2 says  Guilfoile . But eventually the project took flight  getting not only attention but  more crucially  financing and a couple of names  not huge name but names nonetheless: Jon Lovitz and Steve Guttenberg.\n\u00e2You don\u00e2t want to use actors just for their names but it helps \u00e2 says  Smith .\n\u00e2He was awesome \u00e2 says  Guilfoile .\n\u00e2He was very serious about the role \u00e2 says  Smith . \u00e2And he was filled with good ideas.\u00e2\nThough  Smith  had been a top-three finalist in the Matt Damon-Ben Affleck TV competition \u00e2Project Greenlight\u00e2 (projectgreenlight.com) for a comedy short  he  directed in 2007   his  only previous feature length work had been the delightful 2009\u00e2s \u00e2Being Bucky \u00e2 about the seven people who play the University of Wisconsin\u00e2s mascot.\n\u00e2It was a very tight schedule and with 30 people or so in the cast and crew sometimes a bit of chaotic  but I couldn\u00e2t be more pleased \u00e2 said  Smith .\n Guilfoile  was reluctant to visit during shooting.\n\u00e2I did visit the set for one day \u00e2  he  says. \u00e2But that was it. I thought that because of my days working in advertising that I would know just enough to be really annoying.\u00e2\nIn the meantime   Guilfoile  is working with producers/writers Joan Rater and Tony Phelan of \u00e2Grey\u00e2s Anatomy\u00e2 success on developing  his  novel \u00e2Cast of Shadows\u00e2 into a TV series.", "output": "Guilfoile \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Smith, Smith", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

He was the Flying Tomato   the carefree dude who flew the highest and spun the most . \u201c Sochi was so crushing because I physically had the tricks  \u201d  White  said . \u201c I emotionally wasn \u2019 t there .\u201d Really   Sochi just revealed cracks .  White  had become a target for other snowboarders   maybe out of jealousy and maybe because  his  success had placed  him  on a plane above the entire sport . Some believed  he  specialized in contests and received too much acclaim for never making backcountry films . [  Shaun White  is bigger than snowboarding . That \u2019 s what made failure so hard .] \u201c He \u2019 s so much older now   \u201d Roger White  said . \u201c  He  went through a really hard time for a while . There was a period when  he  was younger and at the top for so long . Things were pretty hard for  him  . It \u2019 s just been a roller coaster for a while .\u201d  His  renaissance from earlier this calendar year may have been more remarkable than  his  rebound from disappointment in Sochi . While training in New Zealand in October   White split  his  face open attempting a double - flip 1440   a crash that required 62 stitches . The injury provided proper context for White \u2019 s consecutive 1440s in the final run . Halfpipe snowboarding is pushing against its limits   with pipes rising in height and tricks growing more risky . Earlier in the finals   Japan \u2019 s Yuto Totsuka had to be dragged off in a stretcher after landing on the lip   falling 22 feet and landing square on his back . White \u2019 s gold medal run in Torin   through the prism of today   looks like a halfhearted warmup . \u201c The moves are so dangerous now   it \u2019 s not like you can practice them like you used to  \u201d Thomas said . \u201c These moves are different . The consequences are so high . We just had to wait until it was game time .\u201d And when the time came   White delivered . With the gold medal assured   all that remained was sorting out the place the run would take in the sport \u2019 s annals . \u201c I think   personally   it \u2019 s the best run in the history of the sport  \u201d Thomas said . \u201c It \u2019 s the coolest thing I \u2019 ve ever seen .\u201d \u201c Gosh   man   I think that \u2019 s the best run that \u2019 s ever going to be done  \u201d said Swiss rider Patrick Burgener   who finished fifth . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be hard to do better .\u201d There was not consensus . Hirano   the silver medalist   also threw consecutive 1440s . James   who won bronze   hinted cryptically about a glitch in White \u2019 s run . \u201c There were some details I was expressing to the judges before the last score  \u201d James said . \u201c But that is what it is . Shaun and Hirano both had amazing runs . It could have gone either way .\u201d  White  took on all comers and beat them   raising the bar yet again in a sport he has owned for a dozen years .  White  revealed the seriousness of  his  intent Tuesday in the qualifying round   when  he  unleashed a 98 . 5 - point masterpiece in  his  final run   even though  his  first run had been plenty to push  him  into the field . Riders typically play it safe in such situations   saving their best tricks for the final   careful to only whet the appetite of the judges . Still    White  threw down the best run of the day . \u201c I \u2019 m here to put it down  \u201d White proclaimed . [ How to watch snowboarding at the 2018 Winter Olympics ] In the final   White stood atop the pipe for his first run immediately after watching James   the feisty Aussie who wears red mittens in the shape boxing gloves   put down the best run of the day to that point   a 92 . 00 . White responded with a monstrous 94 . 25   which he punctuated by ripping off his helmet and chucking it into the sky . \u201c He \u2019 s a psycho  \u201d said Ferguson   who took fourth . Hirano   who posted a 99 . 00 in competition earlier this year   took over the top spot with his second run   executing consecutive 1440s en route to a 95 . 25 . So   when White stood at the top of the pipe a second time   he was chasing . White responded with a furious beginning to his run   leading off with a 1440 and then landing another . But then   trying to land one of his trademark moves \u2014 the Tomahawk \u2014 White fell on his backside . His third run would be no victory lap . It would be only victory   genius in nature   the latest and maybe sweetest triumph of a career exploding into a second act .", "output": "Shaun White", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Bush . \nSanders 's gruffness , didacticism , and indifference to appearances -- both he and his wife , Jane , told me how much he loathes shopping -- are central to his appeal . \nAll the friends described Sanders as \"authentic ,\" a word that many people would be hesitant to apply to Hillary Clinton . \nKiley acknowledged that Sanders 's unvarnished qualities might turn off some voters , but noted that in the current election cycle \"the whole spectrum of candidates is less schmoozy , polished , and warm .\" \nSanders has been known as a democratic socialist for decades . \nThis did n't matter much to Kiley or York , or to most other Sanders supporters I met during the next few weeks ; mainly , they were impressed that he had n't shed the term . \nYork thought that , because of Sanders and his \"social-media-driven fans ,\" socialism was \"getting a bit of a P.R. makeover .\" \nPeter Dreier , a professor of politics at Occidental College , who has written about Sanders , says that younger voters \"may not be willing to entertain a whole new system , but they are open to a pretty profound critique of the current one . \nAt a recent San Francisco gathering for Sanders , I met Derek Zender , a twenty-three-year-old marketing student . \nHe told me that his parents , who live in Orange County , dismissed Sanders as \"a decrepit old socialist who means well but does n't understand how the world works .\" \nIn Portland , Sanders took the stage , a little hunched in a gray suit jacket . \nSanders signals his moral ferocity by choosing words like \"horrific\" and \"abysmal\" and sonically italicizing them , as in \"This grotesque level of income and wealth inequality is immoral .\" \nIn the speeches I heard , Sanders rarely discussed foreign policy , though he spoke with conviction about climate change and the need for the U.S. to set an example for Russia , India , and China by using fewer fossil fuels . \nHuck Gutman , one of Sanders 's close friends , is an English professor at the University of Vermont ; from 2008 to 2012 , he served as Sanders 's chief of staff in the Senate . \nDespite this abiding interest , Sanders does not seem to have immersed himself that deeply in the extensive literature on inequality . \nSanders was interested less in academic arguments , Gutman said , than in hard numbers that \"exemplify the disparities he sees and feels and hears about from people .\" -RRB- \nSanders dutifully mentioned that the economist Stephanie Kelton is an adviser to the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee , of which he is the ranking member , but he was ardent in his admiration for Pope Francis , who has condemned the \"economy of exclusion .\" \nSanders called the Pope \"an extraordinary figure ,\" adding , \"My God , he came along right at the time we need him !\" \nAfter speeches , Sanders spars about issues with voters or reporters . \nGarrison Nelson , a political scientist at the University of Vermont , who has known him for decades , says that if Sanders is walking down the street in Burlington \"and somebody yells at him Bernie will talk to him -- ` What 's the matter ? \nSanders does not excel , however , at the middle ground of casual , friendly conversation . \nWhen talking to voters , Hillary Clinton has perfected the head-cocked semblance of keen interest ; it 's clear when Sanders becomes bored . \nPaula Routly , who is the publisher of Seven Days , a popular weekly in Burlington , told me a story that captured the counterintuitive Sanders charm . \nOne evening , Jerry , of Ben & Jerry 's , scooped ice cream ; on another , Senator Sanders stopped by a group dinner . \nThough Sanders is steadfastly earnest , the youthful enthusiasm for him often partakes of irony . \nWhimsical buttons feature the slogan \"Feel the Bern ,\" and Tumblr is full of memes that play up the contrast between Sanders 's age and his popularity with hipsters . \nSanders 's message is particularly potent for young people who are struggling financially . \nGarrison Nelson describes Sanders as being \"more from the nineteen-thirties left than the sixties one .\" \nIn June , when NPR 's David Greene pressed Sanders on whether he embraced the phrase \"Black Lives Matter ,\" the Senator got irritated . \nSanders does not argue that greater economic equality would end racism , but for most of his career he has subsumed discussions of race under class . \nOn July 18th in Phoenix , Sanders appeared at Netroots Nation , an annual conference of progressive activists . \nAfter taking the stage , Sanders told the moderator , \"Whoa , let me talk about what I want to talk about for a moment !\" \nA week later , in his Senate office , Sanders sounded chastened . \nThe video showing the arrest of Sandra Bland , the African-American woman who died in a Texas jail , had just been released , and Sanders seemed shaken . \nSanders , speaking more broadly about police violence directed at black people , said , \"I plead guilty -- I should have been more sensitive at the beginning of this campaign to talk about this issue .\" \nOn July 25th , Sanders addressed the annual convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , in Baton Rouge . \nOne of the convention 's listed sponsors was Koch Industries , and it was the first time I saw Sanders give a speech in which he did not inveigh against the company 's billionaire owners , who lavishly support conservative causes . \nIn August , Sanders 's campaign issued a racial-justice platform that recommended police reform , federal funding for police body cameras , a ban on for-profit prisons , and the elimination of mandatory-minimum jail sentences . \n-LRB- Among other things , Sanders proposes making Election Day a federal holiday . -RRB- \nAt the same time , the platform reasserted Sanders 's core philosophy : \"We must simultaneously address the structural and institutional racism which exists in this country , while at the same time we vigorously attack the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which is making the very rich much richer while everyone else -- especially those in our minority communities -- are becoming poorer .\" \nVan Jones said of Sanders , \"He 's shown tremendous character in his willingness to engage and grow and change .\" \nBut Vermont is ninety-five per cent white , and Sanders needed to establish stronger bonds with black voters . \nSanders was \"a reliable civil-rights vote , but not somebody who has been connected to these communities , to these kids and their neighborhoods . \nElizabeth Warren , the Massachusetts senator whose critiques of income inequality presaged Sanders 's Presidential campaign , often speaks of her parents ' economic hardship to help explain her values today . \nSanders 's campaign Web site lists his educational history , says that he is married to Jane Sanders and that they have four children and seven grandchildren , and mentions that he worked as \"a carpenter and a documentary filmmaker\" before entering politics . \nThere 's something admirable about Sanders 's reluctance to attribute his political beliefs to autobiography : he does n't want voters thinking that his commitment to redistributive economics stems from anything other than a deep-seated sense of fairness . \nWhen I asked Sanders a question about his early years , he sighed with the air of a man who knows he can no longer put off that visit to the periodontist . \nSanders did say that two aspects of his upbringing had exerted a lasting influence . \nSanders 's father was a Polish Jew who , at the age of seventeen , came to America shortly after his brother , and struggled through the Depression in Brooklyn . \nBy the time Sanders was born , in 1941 , his father was working as a paint salesman . \nSanders had an older brother , Larry , and their mother stayed home , like most of the women in their lower-middle-class corner of Flatbush . \n\"There was tension about money ,\" Sanders said of his family . \nI spoke with a few of Sanders 's contemporaries who had grown up in the same neighborhood , and their memories were rosier : they recalled kids playing stickball on safe , familiar streets until their parents called them home for dinner . \nBut Sanders rarely communicates in the key of nostalgia . \nSid Ganis , a Hollywood producer who grew up in the same building as Sanders , described their neighborhood as an enclave of \"ordinary secular Jews ,\" adding , \"Some of us went to Hebrew school , but mainly it was an identity in that it got us out of school on Jewish holidays .\" \nSanders told me that , in the aftermath of the Second World War , his family \"got a call in the middle of the night about some relative of my father 's , who was in a displaced-persons camp in Europe someplace .\" \nSanders learned that many of his father 's other relatives had perished . \nSanders 's parents had been fundamentally apolitical , but he took away a lesson : \"An election in 1932 ended up killing fifty million people around the world .\" \nSanders 's close friend Richard Sugarman , an Orthodox Jew who teaches religious studies at the University of Vermont , said , \"He 's not what you would call rule-observant .\" \nSugarman and Sanders were housemates for a while in the seventies , and Sugarman says that his friend would often greet him in the morning by saying , \"We 're not crazy , you know ,\" referring to the anger they felt about social injustices . \nSanders attended Brooklyn College for a year , then transferred to the University of Chicago , where he joined the Young People 's Socialist League and the Congress on Racial Equality . \nJim Rader , a friend who first met him in Chicago , recalls that Sanders was a \"leader of the civil-rights movement on campus .\" \nSanders , who received a political-science degree in 1964 , has said that he was a mediocre student because he found the classroom boring and irrelevant -- and that he learned \"infinitely more on the streets and in the community .\" \nBy the time Sanders graduated , both his parents had died , and his brother had moved to England . \nSanders got married for the first time , to a woman named Deborah Shiling , just after college , and they took a road trip from New York to Vermont , where Sanders had never been . \nSanders told me , convincingly , \"I was n't a hippie .\" \nSanders and Shiling soon divorced . \nIt came as a surprise to reporters who 'd covered Sanders for years in Vermont , but it was n't the sort of revelation likely to scandalize his supporters in 2015 . \nSanders wore his social conscience on his sleeve , but few people who knew him in the sixties and seventies would have predicted that he would become a leading candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination . \nIt 's safe to say that had Sanders stuck with that career he would not have given Ken Burns a run for his money . \nOne filmstrip , a portrait of Sanders 's hero , the socialist Eugene V. Debs , was rendered with static images that remained on the screen for a good long while . \nSanders himself voiced Debs , an Indiana native , making him sound like a guy from Flatbush . \n-LRB- Another cultural foray of Sanders 's that makes you glad he stuck with politics : a 1987 cassette tape in which he talk-sings folk songs , William Shatner style . \nPeople who knew Sanders when he was in his thirties tend to share stories about how broke and frugal he was . \nRader told me that when Sanders first bought land in Vermont , and was still living part time in New York , he sometimes camped out in the new property 's only shelter : a maple-sugar shack . \nIn 1971 , Rader invited Sanders to a meeting of Vermont 's left-wing Liberty Union Party , in Plainfield . \nSanders brought his son along , and there 's a photograph of them at the meeting : Sanders is skinny , serious , with a luxuriant head of curls , uninhibited sideburns , and Buddy Holly glasses ; his towheaded toddler sits in his lap . \nThe organizers asked if anyone would run for the Senate , and Sanders , one of the willing few , got the nod . \nIn 1980 , Sanders 's friend Richard Sugarman suggested that he try for mayor of Burlington . \nSanders ran as an Independent , and won by ten votes . \nEven in Vermont , it was unusual to elect a socialist in the time of Ronald Reagan ; Sanders was a thirty-nine-year-old man who did n't own a suit . \nYet Sanders turned out to be a popular and effective mayor , and more pragmatic than some might have predicted . \nSanders also resisted a developer 's plan to turn the derelict Lake Champlain waterfront into a cluster of high-rises , promising instead public access and open space . \nSanders met Jane O'Meara Driscoll , a community organizer nine years his junior and a divorced mother of three young children , when she invited him to a debate during his first mayoral campaign . \nThey were married in 1988 , and spent what even Sanders admits was \"a strange honeymoon ,\" in the Soviet Union , finalizing a sister-city relationship with the city of Yaroslavl . \nAll four children in the Sanders family are now grown . \n''' She mentioned a Quinnipiac University poll showing that , in a general-election contest against Donald Trump , Sanders would win by eight percentage points . \nWhen Sanders first ran for the House of Representatives , in 1988 , he lost to a Republican named Peter Smith , the scion of a banking family . \nIn 1990 , Sanders ran again , and the N.R.A. went after Smith , sending letters to its Vermont members describing Sanders as the lesser of two evils , since he was n't publicly supporting the ban . \nSanders won . \nThis is the origin of the critique that Sanders has weak gun-control credentials for a progressive . \nIn national office , Sanders has not been a vocal proponent of strict gun control . \nSanders tends to present guns as an urban problem that Vermonters can afford not to worry about , though mass shootings can happen anywhere and suicides by gun are as much a problem in Vermont as they are in other states . \nSanders 's congressional career did not get off to a promising start . \nSanders did n't help matters by giving more than one interview denouncing Congress . \nNelson told me that , when he ran into Sanders in Burlington , he warned him not to keep \"pissing in the soup ,\" adding , \"You 're our only representative !\" \nAccording to Nelson , Sanders said , \"Gary , you have no idea how totally corrupt it is .\" \nIn time , Sanders became slightly more discriminating in his criticism , and made some allies . \nIn national matters such as curbing the excesses of the Patriot Act , Sanders found that he could at least try to make incremental changes through the amendment process ; in 2005 , a Rolling Stone profile dubbed him \"the amendment king .\" \nAt home , Sanders became a symbol of Vermont 's cussed uniqueness , as affectionately regarded as a scoop of Chunky Monkey . \nBut when Sanders has run for the Vermont governorship he has n't done well . \nBut they do n't necessarily want Sanders running the state . \nSince joining the Senate , Sanders has received the most attention for his gestures of defiance -- such as his marathon oration against tax cuts for the wealthiest , which was published in book form as \"The Speech : A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class .\" \nYet Sanders has proved himself capable of bipartisan dealmaking . \nSanders explained to reporters that it was far from the bill he would have devised on his own : \"It opens up a fear of privatization , which I strongly , strongly am opposed to .\" \nSanders is proud of a few other Senate deals . \nSanders helped lead the opposition , and the President recently stopped pushing for the proposal . \n\"It was a tough fight ,\" Sanders said . \nCould Bernie Sanders win the Democratic nomination , let alone the Presidency ? \nSanders , who refuses to take money from Super PACs , had raised forty-one million dollars , mostly in donations of less than two hundred dollars each . \nIt 's impressive , too , that in a recent YouGovCBS News poll Sanders is leading Clinton by twenty-two percentage points in New Hampshire and ten in Iowa . \nBut among black Democrats in South Carolina Clinton leads , at fifty-two per cent ; Sanders is at four per cent . \nAnd though Sanders quickly modified his platform to accommodate Black Lives Matter activists , he still has a long way to go to win over African-American voters . \nA Washington PostABC News poll released in September shows that , if Biden were in the race , he would attract more nonwhite voters than Sanders -LRB- though substantially fewer than Clinton -RRB- . \nNor is Sanders 's trajectory likely to mirror that of Obama in 2008 . \nSanders supporters like to point out that , in the summer of 2007 , Obama was polling behind Hillary Clinton among black Democrats . \nBut , as Michael Tesler , a political scientist at the University of California , Irvine , recently noted in the Washington Post , Obama enjoyed much higher favorability ratings among black Democrats than Sanders does now . \nSanders 's commitment to recapturing some of the white working-class males that the Democratic Party lost in the Reagan years wo n't necessarily help his candidacy ; indeed , it could hurt his quest to connect with minority voters . \nYet Sanders is doing well enough to concern the Clinton team , and that creates its own challenges . \nOn the trail , Clinton has avoided mention of him ; Sanders , for his part , emphasizes their policy differences . \nSanders appears to be sticking with that approach . \nCorrect the Record , a Super PAC backing Clinton , recently sent an e-mail to the Huffington Post suggesting that Sanders shared many views with the controversial new British Labour leader , Jeremy Corbyn , then noting that Corbyn had called the death of Osama bin Laden a tragedy . \nCorrect the Record has also sent trackers -- operatives who tape rival candidates , looking for gaffes -- to Sanders events . \nSanders has promised not to run for President as an Independent in the general election , saying that he does n't want to have any role in handing victory to a Republican . \nSanders often says that he is not that far outside the mainstream -- that a majority of Americans agree with him on many of his tenets . \nIn mid-September , Sanders spoke before the weekly convocation attended by the student body at Liberty University , the evangelical school in Lynchburg , Virginia , founded by the Reverend Jerry Falwell . \nUnlike many liberal \u00e9lites , Sanders does not seem to prefer talking to people who share his views ; because he is not an especially convivial person , he does not require conviviality from others . \nSanders relishes the opportunity to enter enemy territory , where he believes that he can find secret allies . \nHe did not make knowing jokes about these differences : as usual , Sanders was dead serious . \nBut the occasion also played to the prophetic side of Sanders -- the register in which he can sound like an Old Testament preacher . \nUnlike his slicker rivals , Sanders is most at ease talking about the moral and ethical dimensions of politics .", "output": "Bernie Sanders", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

(Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg News)\nOn Sunday  Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Liberal Democratic Party won a landslide victory  winning 284 of the 465 seats in the lower house of the Diet. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s junior coalition partner  Komeito  added 29 seats  giving the ruling coalition a two-thirds supermajority.\nIn addition to freeing the LDP from a mandatory ballot challenge before 2021  Abe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election victory provides new support for  his  efforts to amend Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pacifist constitution.\n Abe  went into the election arguing that  his  track record on the economy and national security should be the decisive factor  and voters appear to have agreed. Japan faces new security challenges from two of its neighbors. North Korean missiles have passed over Japan twice in recent months  leaving Japanese citizens rattled by early-morning text alerts. And at the recent Communist Party Congress in Beijing  President Xi Jinping promised that China would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoving closer to center stage \u00e2\u0080\u009d raising additional concerns in Japan.\nThe ruling coalition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supermajority ensures not only that  Abe  will remain in power  but also that  he  can now push for a revision of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitution   his  personal pledge and an unfulfilled element of the LDP platform since 1955. Although many in the public remain skeptical of the constitutional revision plan  the LDP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success in this election represents an endorsement of the ruling coalition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s governing ability  particularly on security issues.\n[Did Trump and  Abe  just launch a new chapter in U.S.-Japan relations?]\nThere may also be debates within the ruling coalition on the need for Japan to deploy its own surface-to-surface missiles to enhance deterrence vis-a-vis North Korea.  Abe  has not taken a public stand on these \u00e2\u0080\u009ccounterstrike capabilities \u00e2\u0080\u009d which would to give Japan the ability to neutralize North Korean ballistic missiles on their launchpads. This would be an abrupt change from a postwar defense policy that has remained strictly defensive  with few offensive capabilities.\n Abe  will also continue moderate spending increases on Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s air and naval capabilities in an attempt to counter China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much higher spending on the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Liberation Army. The numerical balance of fighter aircraft and surface combatants has been steadily shifting in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favor for decades.\nMore recently  however  Xi has begun streamlining the PLA to strengthen its war-fighting effectiveness in preparation for a potential conflict in the Western Pacific.  Abe  knows that maintaining deterrence will require closer cooperation with the United States and continued reforms to break down the postwar barriers to the effectiveness of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own forces.\nWill  Abe  revise Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitution?\nTwo years ago   Abe  pushed through a reinterpretation of the constitution to allow new defense guidelines and operations with the United States and other like-minded states. Many in  his  party support revising the second half of Article 9 to declare that Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military is constitutional  though intended only for self-defense.\nSupport from pacifist-leaning coalition partner Komeito will probably be forthcoming  and friendly governments such as the United States and Australia are likely to be supportive as well. China will protest  as might South Korea  but polls elsewhere in the region suggest that Japan has moved beyond its wartime image. Nevertheless  Article 9 is highly political and ideological;  Abe  will have to carry out  his  promise to build domestic consensus before proceeding.\nDespite President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harsh rhetoric about Japan during  his  election campaign   Abe  has deftly engaged with the new administration in Washington and managed to build significant trust with Trump.  Abe  was the first foreign leader to visit Trump  and Trump will start  his  first Asia tour by spending several days in Japan in November.\nTrump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough line on North Korea is likely to be well received in Japan  but  his  hostile view toward trade (particularly the rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership) continues to perplex Tokyo.

Perhaps they would prefer to be ordinary numbers  \"but for some reason they couldn't do it.\" And he elaborates: There are some that almost touch -- 17 and 19  41 and 43 -- but are separated by an even number. As the numbers expand  these so-called twin primes become ever rarer  and the presentiment develops that these were accidents  and \"that solitude is the true destiny.\" But then  if you count long enough  you'll find another pair of twins  \"clutching each other tightly.\" Giordano depicts with aching vividness the traumas out of which Alice and Mattia emerge disabled. Alice's ski fall might be only that  despite a permanently crippled leg. But we get horror seen from within: a father who bullies her  even if lovingly  into enduring the cold  the awkwardness  the fear of something she has so little taste for that she humiliatingly befouls her ski pants. Adults cannot suspect what furnishes a child's nightmare; here  the reader is made to live it.\n Giordano remarkably and movingly portrays the hesitant groping toward warmth that works beneath the pair's emotional disabilities. Alice  unable to tolerate not just food but also the vitality it stands for  assumes a touchingly decisive if frail seductiveness with the shaky Mattia. When at 22 he brings himself to tell her about his sister  she embraces him  they kiss  and for a moment it seems things will change.\n Only briefly; Mattia retreats  goes off to Scandinavia. Upon his return years later there is another almost-moment. That too will vanish. Alice's reaching out  though tentative  is genuine. His response describes a parabola: rising  seeming to converge  dropping away. He is the man who fell to earth; she is earth  though crumbly.\n What is even more distinctive  and transforming  is the writing. The author works with piercing subtlety. He manages -- moving from math to physics -- an exquisite rendering of what one might call feelings at the subatomic level  emotion's muons  gluons and quarks. Take that kiss: \"All Mattia saw was a shadow moving toward him. He instinctively closed his eyes and then felt Alice's hot mouth on his  her tears on his cheek  or maybe they weren't hers  and finally her hands  so light  holding his head still and catching all his thoughts and imprisoning them there  in the space that no longer existed between them.\"", "output": "Alice", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

The White House press secretary further ruined the national holiday by humiliating the press corps by asking them why they are grateful. While none of this is true   attacking Sanders  personally has become the media\u2019s latest and lowest method of attacking President Trump.\n\u201cPiegate\u201d started after  Sanders  shared a picture on Thursday of a chocolate pecan pie with the caption   \u201cI dont cook much these days  but managed this Chocolate Pecan Pie for Thanksgiving at the family farm!\u201d April Ryan  the American Urban Radio Networks correspondent and a CNN political analyst  tweeted at  Sanders  the next day: \u201cShow it to us on a table.\u201d She then added  \u201cI am not trying to be funny but folks are already saying #piegate and #fakepie Show it to us on the table with folks eating it and a pic of you cooking it.\u201d Ryan\u2019s insinuation that  Sanders  used a stock photo launched a viral debate involving every nook and cranny of the crust and glazed pecan top of the pie.\n Sanders  responded to the second tweet with grace: \u201cDon\u2019t worry @AprilDRyan because I\u2019m nice I\u2019ll bake one for  you  next week ;-) #RealPie #FakeNews.\u201d\nRyan\u2019s fake news was so influential that other liberal media kept the rolling pin going. On Saturday  MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid  said she \u201ccannot verify whether or not  Sanders  baked that pie.\u201d Did anyone at MSNBC call the White House and ask? Fox News\u2019s Todd Stearns did  and  Sanders  told him  \u201cOf course I made the pie.\u201d She added that  \u201cI make it for every holiday family gathering and have for years.\u201d\n Sanders  was also attacked for asking reporters  in a pre-Thanksgiving briefing  to state what they were thankful for before asking their questions.  Sanders  started by saying she was thankful for  among other things  the people in the room  her faith and family. Reporters almost all responded in kind  which gave the usually antagonistic briefing room a kinder atmosphere.\n Sanders  is a practicing Christian  who prays before she does the daily briefing  so one would think she would be given the benefit of the doubt in understanding this as a good-will effort to transcend partisanship.\nPiling on  his colleague Kathleen Parker said  Sanders \u2019s request was \u201ccandy-coating her usual condescension with faux fellowship.\u201d Parker used the rest of her column to criticize every aspect of  Sanders \u2019s professional skills and recommended that she be replaced with \u2014 naturally \u2014 a journalist.\nThe Thanksgiving nastiness wasn\u2019t even the lowest the media sank in its attacks on  Sanders .\nEarlier this month  Los Angeles Times writer David Horsey began his piece: \u201c Sarah Huckabee Sanders  does not look like the kind of woman Donald Trump would choose as  his  chief spokesperson.\u201d  He  went on to say  she  \u201clooks more like a slightly chunky soccer mom who organizes snacks for the kids\u2019 games.\u201d\nThe backlash to this piece  especially the reference to  Sanders \u2019s weight  was so swift that the Times deleted all of it from the column and added an apology from the author. This is not standard procedure in newspapers. The as-written text normally stays in the piece  unless factually incorrect. There\u2019s no way the Times did this because it cares about Trump supporters. It cares about female readership. And we don\u2019t like men judging our weight and appearance at work.\nThe media hostility toward  Sanders  really has nothing to do with her but stems from its barely concealed hatred for Trump. So they want a Trump spokesperson to perform badly. But  Sanders  is effective in the way she does not give an inch in defense of the president  while keeping her cool and appearing unfazed. That means she gives the media few sound bites to nourish liberal cable shows and late-night television. She ducks and dodges when needed  which is part of the job.\n Sanders  has thick skin and a strong faith. None of these personal attacks appear to get to her  no matter how low and mean. She knows her purpose is to defend and promote the policies of the president and the administration. At some point  the elite pundit class in the media will realize that in attacking  Sanders   they are the ones who end up looking bad.", "output": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Perkins suited up but did not participate in drills and eventually left for treatment. He returned to the court following the team's workout and said he will be ready for Game 3 Friday.\n \"After the game Monday it was hurting  and even more when I woke up the next morning \" Perkins said. \"It's still a little sore in my hamstring area. I am glad we had a few days to rest and hopefully I'll practice tomorrow. I'll be ready for Friday. I am glad we have a few days to rest.\"\n Garnett's injury is the more serious of the two. He was hurt in the second quarter of Game 2 when Perkins backed into him while defending a drive by Anderson Varejao. Paul Pierce suffered a similar injury Feb. 1 against Washington and missed two games  but the Celtics are hoping the extra rest will make Garnett available for Game 3.\n Perkins said he tweaked the knee simply running down the court. Still  his defense against Shaquille O'Neal has been effective. The Celtics have used Garnett and Perkins to plug up the middle and reduce the inside scoring of O'Neal  Antawn Jamison  and Anderson Varejao.\n O'Neal hurt the Celtics in the fourth quarter of Game 1 but is 8 for 22 in the series and Perkins has limited his easy chances at the rim. If O'Neal gets even a few steps from a dunk  Perkins is helpless to stop the 325-pound train.\n \"The biggest thing with Shaq is  you don't let him get deep post-ups \" Perkins said. \"You try to fight him as much as you can and make him score over the top and no dunks  no layups. That's the game plan.\"\n When asked if O'Neal chatters during their matchup - which already has cost Perkins five stitches in his upper lip - Perkins said  \"Nah  he doesn't talk. Shaq really don't talk. He just plays hard and just a big body that plays physical.\"\n The Celtics are hoping the physicality of the first two games won't cost them a starter  but they have been accustomed to playing shorthanded all season  so there is no sense of panic.

In 2015  the Canadian artist Garnet Hertz invented a cheeky device called \u201cPhonesafe \u201d a masochistic lockbox designed to incarcerate smartphones for a set period of time. Hertz meant Phonesafe as a provocation  but the same idea quickly became a product. Today  you can buy similar  but mass-produced  containers on Amazon  and multi-phone lockers have become a mainstay in corporate offices and schools around the world. A McDonald\u2019s in Singapore has even installed a locker designed to promote \u201cfamily togetherness\u201d and face-to-face conversation. If you attend a Guns n\u2019 Roses concert or a comedy performance by Dave Chappelle  ushers will require you to lock your device in a neoprene pouch and take it into the show in that state.  The phone-locking pouch  made by a San Francisco company called Yondr   has a wide opening at the short end for inserting a smartphone. A magnetic locking mechanism  similar to those on anti-theft tags in retail stores  engages to hold it closed. After the show  this clasp is swiped across a counter-magnet  which releases the lock.  Yondr  is a surefire way to cut down on bootleg YouTube videos. In Wired  Alice Gregory recently took a tough look at the device. Gregory recounts her experience at a Chris Rock performance  where audience members waiting in the lobby had to forgo smartphone usage. The affair reduced them to \u201ca roomful of jonesing fiends \u201d as she puts it. Ultimately  Gregory connects  Yondr  to a thorny question about civil liberties: the right of the people to keep and bear smartphones.\nIt\u2019s an ironic conclusion  because  Yondr  is sold as a tool to provide freedom  rather than to take it away. To \u201cBe Here Now \u201d as the company\u2019s tagline puts it. It\u2019s a promise to deliver presence\u2014a tricky calling  to say the least. Presence has a long history in religion and philosophy  from Buddhist practices to the metaphysics of the 20th-century philosopher Martin Heidegger. Today  presence is most common in the various mindfulness trends that have overtaken individual and corporate life  in Silicon Valley in particular\u2014collectively the critic R. John Williams has called them \u201ctechn\u00ea-zen.\u201d Cutting through the history and the rhetoric  it\u2019s productive to think about presence in terms of attention. You\u2019re present where you focus your attention\u2014and you only have so much attention to pay. In the case of Chris Rock  he wants attention directed toward him  live on stage. Rock\u2019s show might involve awkward improvisation or new material that he doesn't want circulated online. Teachers are less concerned about copyright than comedians are  but they still demand attention. I have tested Yondr\u2019s effects on mind-wandering in classroom experiments with Dan Smilek of the University of Waterloo Vision and Attention Lab. Our research is based in part on the assumption that instructors want students to focus on the course materials  and not on Instagram  Facebook  or other distractions.  Yondr  can be a remarkably effective tool for enforcing digital abstinence in these contexts  thanks primarily to  its  portability. Rather than locking away devices inside lockers  or even inside a disused Catholic tabernacle  as I have done in a performance piece   Yondr  buffers the anxiety of being isolated from your device.\nGiven that the mere presence of one\u2019s smartphone can reduce cognitive capacity   Yondr  offers a way to surf between the waves of a device\u2019s presence and absence. You can hold it  but you can\u2019t use it. This might be an especially important balance in classroom situations  where students see a teacher\u2019s \u201cphone shoebox\u201d as an unwelcome imposition of authority. * * * Needless to say   Yondr  is still an imposition. And controlling attention requires more than just locking a device in a binge-breaking neoprene pouch. Joelle Renstrom has reported the results of her own  Yondr  experiment in a class at Boston University  where she had her 30 students lock away their devices over the course of a semester. At first  37 percent of the students found the policy annoying  but by the end of the term that figure had dropped to 14 percent. Those are promising  if tentative  results  but Renstrom\u2019s anecdotal comments about the experiment may be more instructive than the data she collected. Renstrom describes her students\u2019 initial experience of Yondr as \u201cakin to caging a pet  a clear denial of freedom.\u201d Moreover  she observes that some students left their cases unlocked as a sign of rebellion  even though they didn\u2019t remove the phones from them. Rather than becoming \u201cactive resistors to technology \u201d as the scholars Christine Satchell and Paul Dourish call people who choose to ignore their devices   Yondr  users are ultimately the victims of technological disenfranchisement. When implemented as a mandatory smartphone prophylactic   Yondr  becomes a means of control  not of choice  let alone of presence.\nSuch top-down tactics might be enforced easily at live performances  as one of my research assistants observed firsthand at a Chris Rock show in Niagara Falls. However  as a daily ritual for high-school students  all-or-nothing digital abstinence enforced by an authority figure seems destined to backfire  possibly leading to rejection\u2014or even worse  a legal complaint. In an attempt to tackle this disciplinary problem  I have been offering workshops to schoolteachers that riff on and revise the design Yondr originated. In the workshops  I provide a kit that allows students to make their own digital abstinence case  but with an obnoxiously loud Velcro enclosure rather than a silent  magnetic clasp. This semipermeable design\u2014the Resistor Case  I call it\u2014is intended to promote self-regulation  not authoritarian control. The Velcro acts as a gateway to conscience: It provides just enough resistance and noise to make its owner think twice before opening it. Michael I. Norton  Daniel Mochon  and Dan Ariely coined the \u201cIKEA effect\u201d to name the increase in value people assign to self-made products. With the Resistor Case  I\u2019m counting on a similar effect  that students who fist construct and then choose to make use of their DIY phone lockers might be more compelled to use them. Of course  the kit will only work if the teacher provides a context for it that includes a discussion of responsible smartphone use. (The kit provides a series of cards to prompt this conversation.)", "output": "Yondr", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

While his most recent comments about Belichick may have raised some eyebrows  they didn't shock the Patriots coach.\n Last year  Ryan said he didn't plan to kiss Belichick's rings  and Newsday's Bob Glauber asked Ryan Monday if he had backed off since making the statement last year. Ryan gave an honest response.\n \"I just told the truth \" Ryan said. \"I came here to win. As much as I respect and admire Bill Belichick  I came here to kick his ass  and that's the truth. That's just the way it is.\"\n The coaches may have different approaches  but they continue to publicly praise each other. While Ryan is focused on beating Belichick  he went on to talk about his respect for Belichick.\n \"I came here to beat him  and I'm never going to backtrack on that \" Ryan said. \"I do respect him and all that  absolutely. But he's the one to beat.\n \"I recognize that he's the best coach in football  and he still is. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to try to go beat him  because you're darn right I'm trying to beat him  without question. He's going to get my best.\"\n Belichick also had praise for what Ryan has accomplished.\n \"I think he's an excellent coach \" Belichick said. \"He did a great job at Baltimore  whether it says defensive line coach or defensive coordinator down there.\n \"He's doing the same thing with the Jets. Took them to the AFC Championship game last year. Got a great record this year.\n \"So he's a good football coach. His teams play hard. They're obviously well-coached. They handle pressure.

(Paul Burk/National Trust for Historic Preservation)\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Wednesday offered the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically black colleges and universities up to $100 million to resolve a 12-year-old lawsuit over inequality in public higher education.\nThe proposed settlement is more than double the amount the state pledged early in the case. It arrives a day after a federal judge granted the state a temporary reprieve as it appeals an order issued in November to establish a set of unique and high-demand programs at its four historically black institutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Morgan State University  Coppin State University  Bowie State University and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.\nBut the proposal may not be enough to satisfy the coalition of alumni from Maryland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically black institutions who filed the lawsuit in 2006 to dismantle what they say are vestiges of racial segregation. The group has accused Maryland of insufficiently funding historically black colleges and allowing other state schools to duplicate their programs  placing pressure on enrollment.\nThe state appealed a month after Blake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling  and has since suggested mediation in an attempt to resolve the case. The settlement offer revealed Wednesday would supplement state appropriations to the four public historically black institutions over a 10-year period  according to a letter Hogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief legal counsel Robert F. Scholz sent Wednesday to Cheryl D. Glenn (D-Baltimore City)  who chairs the Black Caucus.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGovernor Hogan wants to bring this litigation to an end in a manner satisfactory to all parties  and in the best interests of all Marylanders  especially current and future [historically black institution] students \u00e2\u0080\u009d Scholz wrote.\nTraditionally white public universities in Maryland count 122 academic programs not duplicated elsewhere within the state system  while historically black schools have only 11 such offerings. That disparity is why advocates have fought for more high-demand academic programs they say would enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of the four schools.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter just talks about dollars \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it does not talk about putting any kind of dent in that 10-to-1 disparity \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael D. Jones  lead attorney for the alumni coalition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe goal is to address the disparity by placing a certain number of unique programs at the [historically black institutions]  and it was up to the special master to figure out which ones and at what cost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOver the years  the coalition has called for increased funding and merging the University of Baltimore with Morgan State  the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest public historically black school. A more recent proposal to transfer programs from traditionally white state schools raised the ire of the Maryland Higher Education Commission and some university presidents who said the plan would ultimately harm students.\n[At Md.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically black schools  the pursuit of equity without forgoing identity]\nJudge Blake dismissed those proposals  but delivered a ruling that Jones and other advocates of desegregation have considered significant.

The Times described an alcohol - sodden   sexually charged office in which \u201c women would discuss which male lobbyists had texted them pictures of their genitals   and both men and women would talk about strip clubs and whether certain Fox News anchors had breast implants .\u201d CNN heard that Farenthold screamed at staffers   called them \u201c fucktards  \u201d made rude comments about a staffer \u2019 s fiancee   and left the staffer in severe pain with daily vomiting . By Thursday morning   Farenthold was announcing he wouldn \u2019 t run for reelection   though he intended to serve out his term . ( His ability to follow through will depend on whether further revelations emerge   and what sort of political pressure he receives \u2014 especially from other Republicans .) Related Story Who Survives a Sexual - Harassment Allegation ? But Farenthold \u2019 s case is also significant for its deviation from the normal pattern . Thus far   a strange dichotomy has developed within claims of sexual harassment . The last two months have seen many women newly inspired to share stories of bad behavior   be it recent or two decades ago . The men they are accusing have in many cases been toppled   for sins ranging from groping and lewd comments to rape . Meanwhile   men who stood accused of harassment or abuse before the sudden downfall of Harvey Weinstein have   for the most part   managed to remain in positions of power . It is as though accusations B . H . ( Before Harvey ) are grandfathered in . Farenthold   however   breaks the pattern : Even though stories of sexual harassment surfaced as early as 2014   that didn \u2019 t inoculate him . Examples of this grandfathering effect abound . Within politics   the most glaring example is President Trump . It has become truism to note the dissonance between his continued tenure as president   despite having been recorded boasting about sexual assaults   even as other abusers are forced from office \u2014 sometimes over behavior that is at once unacceptable but also less serious than the allegations against Trump . Trump is hardly alone   though .  Clarence Thomas  continues to enjoy  his  lifetime appointment at the Supreme Court   despite the allegations Anita Hill lodged against  him  during  his  confirmation hearings . Representative Alcee Hastings   a Florida Democrats   was known to have been sued for sexual harassment several years ago   though Roll Call only revealed the $ 220   000 settlement paid to his accuser last Friday . Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky but survived office and has enjoyed a post - presidential career as a globetrotting elder statesman and grand old man of the Democratic Party . ( Clinton \u2019 s past behavior did play a role in his wife \u2019 s loss in the 2016 presidential race   and while there is a move to reassess his legacy   it comes so late in his career as to be barely consequential .) Outside of politics   there are plenty of other examples . Dylan Farrow   who has long accused Woody Allen of sexual abuse ( and whose brother Ronan Farrow helped break the Weinstein story )  wrote in the Los Angeles Times   \u201c Why is it that Harvey Weinstein and other accused celebrities have been cast out by Hollywood   while Allen recently secured a multimillion - dollar distribution deal with Amazon   greenlit by former Amazon Studios executive Roy Price before he was suspended over sexual misconduct allegations ?\u201d Across entertainment   from R .

Adam Schiff said that  Trump Jr.  said he couldn't speak about the conversations with his father this summer because of attorney-client privilege  telling the committee a lawyer was present when he spoke to his father about the June 2016 meeting and the emails that led up to it.\nThe Trump Tower meeting is a matter of keen interest to special counsel Robert Mueller  who is also investigating the meddling and whether there was any obstruction of justice.  Trump Jr.  and Jared Kushner  Trump's son-in-law  attended the meeting with several Russian operatives under the impression that they might receive damaging information about the Democratic presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton.\nMueller is also interested in the White House response to the meeting once it became public. The White House has said the president was involved in drafting an early statement saying the meeting primarily concerned a Russian adoption program  but emails later released by  Trump Jr.  showed  he  enthusiastically agreed to the sit-down with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others after  he  was promised dirt on  his  father's rival.  Trump Jr.  later said the promised material never materialized.\n Trump Jr.  said during Wednesday's eight-hour interview that  he  spoke with President Donald Trump's communications aide Hope Hicks as early reports of the meeting emerged  according to one person familiar with the interview.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is also investigating the meeting  and interviewed  Trump Jr.  behind closed doors in September.\nIn that interview   Trump Jr.  cast the 2016 meeting as simply an opportunity to learn about Clinton's \"fitness  character or qualifications \" insisting to investigators that  he  did not collude with Russia to hurt Clinton's campaign.\nThe Senate intelligence committee also hopes to interview  Trump Jr.  before the end of the year.\nKushner has spoken to both intelligence committees. The panels have also interviewed Ike Kaveladze  who was at the meeting as a representative of a Russian developer who once partnered with  Trump  to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow  and Rinat Akhmetshin  a Russian-American lobbyist.

Both are white men  northeasterners  teetotalers. They are products of the Ivy League and great wealth. They joined their respective family trades \u2013 real estate for Trump  politics for Joe III.\nThe differences are obvious too  and more illuminating. Joe III is a liberal avatar of American institutions: the Kennedy family  Stanford  Harvard Law. Self-effacing in person  he recognizes how easy his path has been \u2013 he only briefly served as an assistant DA before taking a House seat -- and had  until now  chosen to mitigate charges of nepotism by playing the part of diligent backbencher. The Kennedys  for all their famous faults  have the saving grace that comes from being in on the joke; when President Kennedy appointed his younger brother attorney general  he quipped that he was just trying to give Bobby some experience before he started practicing law.\nThe result is the great destabilization of the Trump era. Few  it seems  have a firm grasp on what is happening  let alone what might happen next. Everybody  regardless of their ideology  thinks they're losing. A realignment appears to be happening in our politics  but nobody can agree on what it looks like. \"We all feel the fault lines of a fractured country \" as  Joe III  put it in  his  stilted  awkward speech on Tuesday night.\nThere is  of course  an element of nostalgia in liberalism's newfound fondness for our institutions. Trump-era liberalism  with its emphasis on American global leadership and veneration of federal agencies and the mainstream press  would be easily recognizable to that first generation of Kennedys. And in that sense  it makes sense that  Joe III  would become a natural face of contemporary Democratic politics.\nTuesday night was an attempt to make  Joe III  a symbol of institutional resistance to Trump. To the question of whether the institutions are worth saving  and therefore capable of reform   Joe III 's answer is an enthusiastic yes.  He  is  in a sense  already a symbol of how  his  own family has repaired itself from its reckless  impulsive  and selfish ways;  he  seems serious   he  is sober. The message  he  sends is that  his  family   his  party  and all the other institutions that nurtured  him  still have an innate and positive utility  an essential role to play. Where Trump says the rot must be amputated   Joe III  promises that a strong dose of antibiotics is all that's needed.\nWhether this message resonates among the Democratic rank-and-file is another story. While the liberal commentariat   Joe III's  natural constituency  remains fixated on norms and the need to defend institutions  a newly ascendant left sees civility as a neoliberal plot to uphold the status quo. And whereas  Joe III  and  his  ilk see Trump as an aberration  the left sees  him  as a symptom of a decayed political order  they  wish to abolish and replace.\nRobert Kennedy once said that he wished he had been born poor so he could have been a revolutionary. As his career advances  Joe III might harbor a similar desire  if only because his party is increasingly moving in a revolutionary direction.", "output": "Joe III", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a strong case to be made that Congress should terminate subsidies for fossil fuels and extend them for renewables  not the other way around.\nA new study by Oil Change International brings us up-to-date. Published earlier this month  it found that federal subsidies in 2015 and 2016 averaged $10.9 billion a year for the oil and gas industry and $3.8 billion for the coal industry. By contrast  the wind industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so-called production tax credit  renewed by Congress in December 2015  amounted to $3.3 billion last year  according to a Congress Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate. Unlike the fossil fuel industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s permanent subsidies  Congress has allowed the wind tax credit to expire six times in the last 20 years  and  it  is now set to decline incrementally until ending in 2020. Similarly  Congress fixed the solar industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment tax credit at 30 percent of a project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost through 2019  but reduced  it  to 10 percent for commercial projects and zeroed  it  out for residences by the end of 2021. The JCT estimates that the solar credit amounted to a $2.4-billion tax break last year. Totaling it up  fossil fuels \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at $14.7 billion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 still received two-and-a-half times more in federal support than solar and wind in 2016.", "output": "Scott Pruitt", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

He  simply was struck by the paucity of treatment when working as a clinician at Wenzhou Mental Hospital   his  first job on graduation in 1987.\nTrained in general practice at Wenzhou Medical University   Guan  was assigned arbitrarily to work at a mental hospital. Psychiatry hasn't been a popular area of specialization in China  but the career suited  him  well. The hospital was near  his  home  and  he  met  his  wife  Wang Lianyue  a nurse working in the same unit. Today she is his top lieutenant as the company's executive director and general manager. Together they own a third of Kangning.\nSensing both need and opportunity   Guan  started  his  own hospital in 1996  initially with 20 beds  encouraged by a local government with a reputation for fostering the freest brand of capitalism in China. Soon  he  bought land in then suburban Wenzhou for future growth.  His  wife joined two years later  when an expanded hospital was built.\nLater the city of Wenzhou's freewheeling underground banking network would help  him  cover cash-flow needs  though at usurious rates.  He  had no choice. Chinese law bars hospitals from pledging their facilities as collateral for bank loans.\nNo matter how desirable the room services  the ultimate goal is to reduce  not prolong  the stay. Thanks to enhanced efficacy of treatment   Guan  says  his  patients now each spend on average 47 days in hospital  compared with the Chinese industry's 60 days and as long as 90 days just a decade ago. \"With better medications and therapies come better results and shorter therapy sessions \"  he  says.\nStill  mental patients need longer and more intensive care than most physical hospitalizations. Even one with mild syndromes might stay one or two weeks   he  adds. That calls for more beds. On average  for every 100 outpatient visits a day  400-bed capacity is needed  according to  Guan --the reverse of the standard hospital formula. Wenzhou Kangning now averages 150 at its owned units.\nPrivate psychiatric care in China grew at a compounded 20% annually to 2014  largely to treat common disorders like anxiety  depression  substance abuse and psychosis. Among the key hubs is Guangzhou  a megacity of 13 million where  Xinhua News reported  68 out of every 100 citizens suffer insomnia. Elsewhere  large corporate employers such as Foxconn offer 24-hour hotlines and suicide prevention counsel.  Guan  sees the upsurge as a by-product of the nation's fast economic growth  likening it to Japan's experience at a similar stage of development.\nSpecialized mental hospitals have been around since the Chinese revolution in 1949  many drawing on care houses left behind by Christian missionaries.

Here are the facts.\nMayer and Abramson have made these accusations on the basis of accounts from sources who tell me they were either flatly misquoted or misrepresented  or refused to confirm information attributed to them.

And a whole array of alleged facts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 small and large \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are simply wrong.\nThe case that  Thomas  exhibited an interest in pornography after his student days rests on the accounts of two people: Barry Maddox  the proprietor of a Washington  D.C. video rental shop  and Frederick Cooke  a Washington attorney. [A third source  Kaye Savage  who claims to have information linking  Thomas  to Playboy magazine  is discussed later in this review.] Mayer and Abramson write:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the interest in pornography that  Thomas  first exhibited at Yale apparently continued through the early 1980s  when Long Dong Silver was a well-known figure among fans of X-rated movies. According to Barry Maddox  the proprietor of Graffiti  a video rental and equipment store just off Dupont Circle  a few blocks from the EEOC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters  the store began to rent pornographic videos in 1982. Not long afterward  Maddox recalled   Thomas  became a regular customer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThere are several problems with this account  including that the EEOC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters at 18th and L Streets NW  a few blocks south of the Dupont Circle area  did not open until August 1989.  Thomas  worked at that location for only a matter of months  and during the entire time  he  was in the middle of a brutal confirmation fight for a seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals  which  he  won in March 1990. In the early 1980s  when Maddox claims  Thomas  was a regular customer  the EEOC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters were at Columbia Plaza at 24th and E Streets NW \u00e2\u0080\u0094 nowhere near Dupont Circle or Graffiti.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was also in Graffiti that Frederick Douglass Cooke  Jr.  a Washington attorney and the former D.C. corporation counsel  saw  Thomas  at the cashier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counter in the late 1980s with another \u00e2\u0080\u0098freak-of-nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099 kind of film. Cooke thought it pretty amusing to run into the chairman of the EEOC  whom he had met once or twice on a social basis  standing with a triple X videotape entitled The Adventures of Bad Mama Jama.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThese sentences appear on page 107 of the book  where  though he is not quoted directly  it appears as if Cooke himself has told the authors what he supposedly saw. There is no note indicating otherwise. Not until flipping to a note for page 330  where efforts by  Thomas  opponents to extract damaging information from Cooke are discussed  do we learn  \u00e2\u0080\u009cReached on two separate occasions  Cooke would neither confirm nor deny the account.\u00e2\u0080\u009d[5.]", "output": "Clarence Thomas", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

In truth  he had already made up his mind it was Boone and once word leaked out of San Francisco early Friday night that Meulens was staying with the Giants  it was pretty much official.\nBased on sourced information from how all the interviews went down  Boone  Meulens and Beltran all made the strongest impressions on  Cashman  and  his  team of close advisors that included VP of Baseball Operations Tim Naehring  assistant GM Mike Fishman  and Senior VP Jean Afterman. Just the same  you had to immediately eliminate Beltran  if only because there was no way  Cashman  was going to take THAT big of a risk  turning the managerial reins over to someone fresh out of the player ranks. Of course  no one knows either if Boone or Meulens have any idea of how to handle a pitching staff  which is why  in retrospect   Cashman  made sure to retain the services of Larry Rothschild  recognized as one of the best pitching coaches in the business.\nBoone \u2014 Checked the three most important boxes with Cashman: A willingness to embrace analytics  communication skills with the players  and experience with handling the New York media. All of that made him an instant popular choice  but it didn\u2019t hurt that he also came from a three generational major league family  in which his father  Bob  managed the Royals and the Reds.  Cashman  fancies  himself  as an \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d thinker and this was the ultimate bold \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d choice.\nBeltran \u2014 Impressed  Cashman  and  his  staff with the sheer force of  his  personality and knowledge of the game. If  he  hadn\u2019t just retired and had spent perhaps just one year as a coach or minor league manager   he  might have been the favorite. As it is   he  will be with the Yankees in some capacity next year  either as a bench or hitting coach for Boone or a special assistant to  Cashman . Whatever  he  wants to do.\nEric Wedge \u2014 The only candidate with major league managing experience   Cashman  only interviewed  him  because other GMs  former and present  gave  him  high grades. But there was no way  Cashman  was going to go to Steinbrenner with a recommendation of a manager who had failed in two other places  Seattle and Cleveland  with seven losing seasons in 10 years. In addition   his  bland personality would have never gone over in New York.\nRob Thomson \u2014  He  was only in the process out of loyalty to the Yankee organization \u2014 28 years in various capacities  most importantly spring training coordinator the past few seasons. Ordinarily going from bench coach to manager would have been a natural ascension. The fact that it wasn\u2019t \u2014 and Thomson was again thrown into the mix of candidates \u2014 told you he was never a serious candidate for the job. He now leaves the Yankees to go to the Phillies as their bench coach.\nChris Woodward \u2014 It\u2019s not quite clear as to why the Dodger third base coach was one of the candidates other than perhaps  Cashman  wanted to talk to someone who was part of Dave Roberts\u2019 staff in Los Angeles. Early on   he  had talked about wanting a \u201cDave Roberts-type \u201d someone who was into the analytics and had good communication skills  especially with young players. Whatever  it doesn\u2019t appear as if Woodward  the former light-hitting utility infielder who spent a couple of seasons with the Mets and had never before interviewed for a manager\u2019s job  knocked anyone\u2019s socks off.", "output": "Brian Cashman", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.
