Gregory Chertok, a sports psychology consultant with the American College of Sports Medicine, said research has shown that even small amounts of social support can produce large and lasting gains in physical activity. In a 2007 study by Stanford University in California, researchers showed that even a simple, computer-generated phone call could be effective in motivating the sedentary to exercise. \u201cThese exercisers are being held accountable by their fitness studios to a degree,\u201d he said. AKT InMotion, a New York/Connecticut chain of dance and circuit-based interval training studios, offers a $2,000, personalized, eight-week exercise and nutrition program. It includes periodic body measurements and is supervised by a fitness concierge. Anna Kaiser, founder of AKT, said photographs and measurements are taken every two weeks to track progress. \u201cA client will say \u2018I still feel fat\u2019 because you don\u2019t actually see that you\u2019re changing, so it helps,\u201d said Kaiser, who added that measurements were private and optional. Accountability, she explained, is a two-way street. Clients must show up as well as work on nutrition, and if aspects of the program are not producing results, AKT will change it. Videotaping is popular for tracking progress. At Refine Method studio in New York City, which features full-body circuit training and small classes, it is used to give clients a  concrete measure to gauge progress. Clients do a few key assessment moves, such as a squat, and the videotape will show how they have improved over time. Founder Brynn Putnam, a former New York City Ballet dancer, said unlike professional athletes, who can count their wins, most people don\u2019t get clear indications of progress. Regularity is also an important factor for improvement. Barry\u2019s Bootcamp, a national chain of interval cardiovascular treadmill and strength-training studios, clients can sign up for a program called \u2018Academy,\u2019 in which they commit to the same classes at the same-time Monday to Friday for four weeks. Trainer Joey Gonzalez said he has used Facebook to reach out to no-shows. \u201cSocial media gives us a short cut for clients who have signed up for accountability-based programs,\u201d he said.

It came at a news conference to launch the pope\u2019s new book, \u201cLight of the World: The Pope, the Church, and the Sign of the Times.\u201d   In the book, a long interview with German Catholic journalist Peter Seewald, the pope made clear he was not changing the Catholic ban on contraception, but, using the example of a male prostitute, said there were cases where using a condom to avoid transmitting the HIV virus could be justified. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi made the clarification because the German, English and French versions of the book used the male article when referring to a prostitute, but the Italian version used the female form. \u201cI asked the pope personally if there was a serious distinction in the choice of male instead of female and he said \u2018No\u2019,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cThe point is it (condom use) should be a first step toward responsibility in being aware of the risk of the life of the other person one has relations with,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is a man, a woman or a transsexual who does it, we are always at the same point, which is the first step in responsibly avoiding passing on a grave risk to the other.\u201d   Theologians, AIDS activists and liberal Catholics said the latest developments marked a highly significant, perhaps even historic, change in the Church\u2019s attitude to condoms. \u201cThe pope\u2019s statement ... is a startling and welcome shift by the Vatican that has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives,\u201d said Dr. Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Washington-based Global AIDS Alliance (GAA). \u201cThe pope has created the possibility of rapid change in the way the Catholic Church views HIV/AIDS and how it can preserve the sanctity of human life,\u201d Zeitz said. Lombardi appeared to take the debate beyond the confines of prostitution in the context of fighting the transmission of AIDS, although the church prefers measures such as abstinence. \u201cThe fact that an official Vatican spokesperson seems to be extending the possibility of use clearly is groundbreaking,\u201d said Rev. John T. Pawlikowski, a professor of social ethics at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. \u201cThe real question is whether this papal statement will impact pastoral activity on the ground, particularly in AIDS-affected regions of the world,\u201d he told Reuters. The church had been saying for decades that condoms were not even part of the solution to fighting AIDS, even though no formal policy on this existed in a Vatican document. The late Cardinal John O\u2019Connor of New York famously branded the use of condoms to stop the spread of AIDS as \u201cThe Big Lie.\u201d   \u201cThe Vatican\u2019s acknowledgement that Pope Benedict\u2019s acceptance of condom use to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections relates to everybody shows how significant the pope\u2019s comments are,\u201d said Jon O\u2019Brien, president of the U.S.-based Catholics for Choice group. In the book, the pope says the use of condoms could be seen as \u201ca first step toward moralization,\u201d even though condoms are \u201cnot really the way to deal with the evil of HIV infection.\u201d   Through the book and Lombardi\u2019s comments, the pope seemed to be giving a cautious, qualified endorsement of the \u201cABC principle\u201d (Abstinence-Be faithful-Condom) espoused by many governments and health organizations in preventing AIDS. Archbishop Rino Fisichella, a Vatican official who presented the book, said Catholics had to \u201crespect\u201d the pope\u2019s words even though they were not made in an official papal pronouncement. \u201cFor the first time, the use of condoms in special circumstances was endorsed by the Vatican, and this is good news and a good beginning for us,\u201d said Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization.

In bypassing the injury and restoring communication between the brain and the relevant part of the spinal cord, the scientists successful treated two rhesus monkeys\u00a0each with one leg paralyzed by a partial spinal cord lesion. One of the monkeys regained some use of its paralyzed leg\u00a0within the first week\u00a0after\u00a0injury, without training, both on a treadmill and on\u00a0the\u00a0ground, while the other took around two weeks to recover to the same point. \u201cWe developed an implantable, wireless system that operates in real-time and enabled a primate to behave freely, without the constraint of tethered electronics,\u201d said Courtine. \u201cWe understood how to extract brain signals that encode flexion and extension movements of the leg with a mathematical algorithm.

The video was published just one year after YouTube was created. Before the prominence of social media, it was shared by email: The attached video is of dolphins playing with silver colored rings which they have the ability to make under water to play with. It isn\u2019t known how they learn this, or if it\u2019s an inbred ability. The dolphin does a quick flip of its head and a silver ring appears in front of its pointed beak. The ring is a solid, donut shaped bubble about 2-ft across, yet it doesn\u2019t rise to the surface of the water. The dolphin then pulls a small silver donut from the larger one. Looking at the twisting ring for one last time a bite is taken from it, causing the small ring to collapse into a thousands of tiny bubbles which head upward towards the water\u2019s surface. After a few moments the dolphin creates another ring to play with. There also seems to be a separate mechanism for producing small rings, which a dolphin can accomplish by a quick flip of its head. An explanation of how dolphins make these silver rings is that they are \u201cair-core vortex rings\u201d. Invisible, spinning vortices in the water are generated from the tip of a dolphin\u2019s dorsal fin when it is moving rapidly and turning. When dolphins break the line, the ends are drawn together into a closed ring. The higher velocity fluid around the core of the vortex is at a lower pressure than the fluid circulating farther away. Air is injected into the rings via bubbles released from the dolphin\u2019s blowhole. The energy of the water vortex is enough to keep the bubbles from rising for a reasonably few seconds of play time. We don\u2019t know the specific origins of this video clip, but bottlenose dolphins\u2019 producing and manipulating bubble rings is indeed a real phenomenon that has been observed and described by researchers, as noted in the 2000 article \u201cBubble Ring Play of Bottlenose Dolphins: Implications for Cognition,\u201d published in the Journal of Comparative Psychology: Ongoing research into the cognitive capabilities of dolphins and other cetaceans has captured the interest and imagination of both the scientific community and the public. Bottlenose dolphins are gregarious mammals that show a strong propensity for play behavior with physical objects and with [each other]. There have been previous reports that both captive and wild dolphins produce their own objects of play, termed \u201cbubble rings\u201d. During these events, dolphins expel air from their blowhole, and the expelled air rises to the surface in a torus or ringlike form. Air-breathing dolphins always produce bubbles when they expel air underwater. Besides bubble rings, dolphins also produce a wide variety of other bubble types. They occasionally emit bubble streams concurrent with vocal activity. When surprised, curious, or excited, dolphins often emit a rapid exhalation termed a \u201cbubble burst\u201d. Breathing in dolphins, unlike in other mammals, is solely under voluntary control, a crucial feature in their adaptation to a fully aquatic existence. Whereas the physics of ring formation is straightforward, the actual production of stable rings may require some practice, expertise, and forethought by the dolphins. Dolphins in different oceanariums have been reported to produce bubble rings. For example, dolphins would swim to the bottom of the pool, stop, assume a horizontal position, and then with a sharp upward jerk of the head, expel a ring of air through their blowhole. Dolphins frequently manipulate their bubble rings by generating vortices around the objects, which cause the bubble rings to turn vertically by 90\u00b0 or flip in orientation 180\u00b0. Bubble play can result in a sequence of two bubble rings, such that the second bubble ring joins the first bubble ring to form a large bubble ring, which is often then further manipulated. Sometimes a third smaller bubble ring extrudes from the larger ring as a result of the force of impact between the first and second bubble rings. This third bubble ring is frequently manipulated by the dolphins in a similar manner as described above for single rings where the dolphins vertically turn the bubble ring or completely flip the ring. A 1996 episode of \u201cNoorderlicht\u201d featured Dr. Ken Marten explaining the bubble rings and the intelligence of dolphins. The TV show was a Dutch scientific documentary series.

It\u2019s almost ipso facto \u2014 the more that you have people out there, the greater the possibility there is for transmission.Abbott\u2019s statement was first published by the political group Progress Texas on both Twitter and YouTube:BREAKING: As @GovAbbott reopens the state in the midst of a rising infection and death rate, leaked audio from a call with Texas Legislators reveals that he knows reopening puts more Texans at risk. #txlege pic.twitter.com/kTK4M8gpSY\u2014 Progress Texas (@ProgressTX) May 5, 2020As the\u00a0San Antonio Current reported, the audio was released as the Republican governor announced that hair salons would be allowed to reopen on May 8 2020. Ten days after that, said Abbott, fitness clubs would be allowed to reopen provided they stay at 25 percent capacity, but members would not be allowed to use their facility\u2019s locker room or showers and equipment would have to be sanitized every time it was used.Abbott can also be heard saying on the leaked audio:The goal never has been to get transmission of COVID-19 down to zero. It never can be to keep transmission down to zero, because with a rapidly transmittable disease like this there will be always be a level of transmission. Even when you have an immunization come out, there will be a transmission rate for COVID-19. The goal is to reopen using strategies that can continue to contain the spread of COVID-19. These are strategies that have proven effective in Texas for the past month and a half.A spokesperson for the governor, John Wittman, told the news site The Daily Beast that Abbott\u2019s remarks on the call were in line with previous statements he had made to local news outlets.\u201cThe governor has said this from the beginning, as we begin to open up, we will see flare ups, whether we open now or three months from now,\u201d said Wittman. \u201cThe key is ensuring we are able to contain that spread, which is where contact tracing comes into play.\u201dHowever, Progress Texas pointed out that Abbott had minimized the prospect of an increase in COVID-19 cases in those interviews; on April 24 2020, he told KSAT-TV:One thing that all scientists and doctors say is that as we do begin to open up, there could be an increase in the number of coronavirus cases. Two things about it. One reason for an increase is we are going to be doing more testing. We\u2019ll be doing what\u2019s called testing and tracing all across Bexar County to identify any types of hotspots. If there are hotspots where there is a sudden rise or increase in the number of people testing positive, we will provide all the medical care needed in order to quickly address it and to reduce it if it\u2019s widespread.That same day, he told KTBC-TV:When you begin to reopen, there can be spikes or increases in those who test positive for COVID-19. This is nothing to be worried about, in part, because we will be doing far more testing in the future than we have in the past and that alone will identify more people testing positive. Our goal is to make sure that there are not any dramatic spikes that lead to increased hospitalizations or increased deaths.The weekend after his conversation with lawmakers saw a sharp uptick in the number of COVID-19 diagnoses across the state: a combined 2,000 new cases were reported between May 2 and May 3 2020, a record increase for a two-day period.

The account exemplifies the fine line WHO officials are navigating between fear about the new coronavirus and hopes of increasing international preparedness over  an outbreak that has taken more than 360 lives and infected at least 17,238 people in China since late December  \u2014 and could become a pandemic. So far, growth has been exponential in China, but elsewhere cases remain under 150, scattered across nearly two dozen countries. \u201cInstead of spending time on fear and panic, we should say this is the time to prepare,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cBecause 146 cases, by any standard, is very low.\u201d  As governments clamp down on travel to China, airlines suspend flights and Chinese nationals fret about rising xenophobia and ostracism, WHO is calibrating a message of praise to Chinese officials and trying to focus on the epicenter \u2014 Wuhan city and surrounding Hubei province \u2014 to keep the virus from spiraling out of control. It also wants to help get weaker health systems ready. Before he left for the meeting with President Xi Jinping last week, Tedros reassured his daughter: \u201cIt\u2019s ok, it\u2019s not all over China.\u201d \u201cEven in China, the virus is not evenly spread everywhere, and the risk is not the same,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhen I was in Beijing, what we had discussed with the authorities is that our concentrated effort should be in the epicenters, or the sources of the virus.\u201d Pausing on a couple of occasions to cough, clear his throat, and drink some water, Tedros quipped: \u201cDon\u2019t worry: It\u2019s not corona,\u201d prompting laughter. WHO is also battling misinformation, working with Google to ensure that people get facts from the U.N. health agency first when they search for information about the virus. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Tencent and TikTok have also taken steps to limit the spread of misinformation and rumors about the outbreak. Chinese officials are increasingly speaking out. At the executive board meeting, Ambassador Li Song, deputy permanent representative for China in Geneva, lashed out at flight cancellations, visa denials and refusals by some countries to admit citizens of Hubei province \u2014 saying those moves went against WHO recommendations. Li noted how President Xi, in his meeting with Tedros, had said the coronavirus epidemic \u201cis a devil \u2014 we cannot let the devil hide.\u201d \u201cAt the same time, the international community needs to treat the new virus objectively, fairly, calmly, and rationally, and not over-interpret it negatively and pessimistically, or deliberately create panic,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe need facts, not fear. We need science, not rumors. We need solidarity, not stigma.\u201d Since the outbreak began, a number of misleading claims and hoaxes about the virus have circulated online. They include false conspiracy theories that the virus was created in a lab and that vaccines have already been manufactured, exaggerations about the number of sick and dead, and claims about bogus cures. On Sunday, WHO lamented that the outbreak and response have been accompanied by a massive \u2018infodemic\u2019 \u2014 an overabundance of information, some accurate and some not \u2014 that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. The report said WHO, the U.N. health agency, was working \u201c24 hours a day to identify the most prevalent rumors that can potentially harm the public\u2019s health, such as false prevention measures or cures.\u201d Tedros also addressed his decision last week to classify the virus outbreak as a global emergency, saying the move was prompted by increased human-to-human spread of the virus to numerous countries and the fear it could have a significant impact on developing countries with weaker health systems. Tedros said recent outbreaks such as the new virus and Ebola demonstrated the shortcomings of the \u201cbinary\u201d emergency system, calling it \u201ctoo restrictive, too simplistic, and not fit for purpose.\u201d \u201cWe have a green light, a red light, and nothing in-between,\u201d he said, adding that WHO was considering options to allow for an \u201cintermediate level of alert.\u201d In July, Tedros declared the Ebola outbreak in Congo a global emergency: There have been 3,421 cases and 2,242 deaths from it since the outbreak began 18 months ago.

A doctor in Libby since 1977, Black has been at the front lines of Libby\u2019s asbestos fight, and despite all the fuss that\u2019s been made over Libby in the last 20 years \u2014 despite the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s 2009 declaration of a public health emergency, the first such designation since the federal Superfund law passed in 1980; despite the more than $575 million spent in cleanup costs; and despite the well-documented asbestos contamination that\u2019s sickened thousands and killed hundreds \u2014 Black is still waging an uphill battle. \u201cWe keep on plugging because that\u2019s all we can do,\u201d Black said recently in a basement conference room at the CARD clinic. \u201cWhen you have new patients coming through the door on a regular basis, your primary objective is to provide them with care. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d Still, there\u2019s more to Black\u2019s work than traditional patient care, particularly as he and his colleagues pioneer new and innovative research in an effort to better understand Libby\u2019s rarefied breed of toxic fibers. He and the CARD staff are also striving to educate the broader medical community about how they\u2019re diagnosing asbestos-related health problems, and why they\u2019re interpreting the faint hues of gray and white that appear on thousands of patients\u2019 X-ray and CT images as disease when other pulmonologist colleagues don\u2019t see it. Lung disease caused from Libby Amphibole asbestos is difficult to detect because it develops subtly and forms a thin layer along the interior chest wall, where it may blend in with shadows, Black said. The scarring of the lungs is progressive in Libby patients exposed to asbestos fibers, so being able to see the scarring and gauge its growth early on through scans is critical for care, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried very hard to get people to see what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Black said. \u201cRadiology is a gray world. You\u2019re looking at gray shadows and everyone sees it differently. If you don\u2019t know the disease, if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for, if you haven\u2019t been tracking it here for 18 years, you won\u2019t understand. You\u2019ve got to know what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d Unfortunately, what Black\u2019s looking for is precisely what he\u2019s finding. New patients still arrive with metronomic regularity at the CARD clinic, a small medical clinic located off Mineral Avenue. Last year alone, 837 patients were screened and 209 were diagnosed, according to Tracy McNew, CARD\u2019s administrative director. McNew says that\u2019s a figure that falls right in line with the clinic\u2019s annual diagnostic rate of about 25 percent, which, when taking into account its nearly 20-year existence, portrays a bleak picture. \u201cEven after all this time, we\u2019re still receiving new patients all the time,\u201d she said. Two decades ago, the scope of asbestos exposure in Libby came to light when news reports detailed a link between the deadly fibers unearthed at a vermiculite mine operated by W.R. Grace and Co. between 1963 and 1990 and the hundreds of people who were sick and dying because of exposure to asbestos-laden dust. Two of the diseases most commonly associated with asbestos \u2014 asbestosis and mesothelioma \u2014 have latency periods of up to 40 years. That means people who were exposed to the asbestos dust could continue to develop illnesses for generations to come. \u201cConservative estimates put us out until 2030, so it won\u2019t go away for a while,\u201d Black said. \u201cAgain, those are conservative estimates. It\u2019s really hard to predict how many sick people we\u2019re going to see, but it\u2019s going to be a lot.\u201d Still, even as the volume of patients at the CARD clinic continues to swell, there\u2019s a relative dearth of science. That\u2019s because despite the millions spent by the federal government, no real investment has been made in scientific studies that would help answer some basic questions, such as: Does an effective treatment exist? Are there markers, like blood proteins, to help identify asbestos-related disease in patients before the air-constricting symptoms arrive? To what degree do genetics play a role in determining who gets sick? Do autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus serve as a precursor to asbestos-related disease and lung cancer? And why does Libby\u2019s particular brand of asbestos, a toxic cocktail of several naturally occurring mineral fibers, cause such devastating disease to people with short-term exposure? \u201cThere\u2019s a real misunderstanding that there has to be a long-term occupational exposure,\u201d Black said. \u201cEven low levels can lead to very serious lung disease. We have people in our population who had very brief exposures and 10 years later they have the disease. The level that it takes to cause significant disease is really hard to believe. But that\u2019s Libby\u2019s pattern.\u201d Libby\u2019s pattern is unlike that seen in most commercial asbestos, which belongs to a family called chrysotile asbestos, tiny fibers that, when inhaled, spiral into lung tissue like corkscrews. But Libby\u2019s asbestos hails from the amphibole family, dart-shaped fibers that, when inhaled, lodge in the outer lining of the lung, or the pleura, a thin, elastic sac that, when healthy, expands and contracts in time with a person\u2019s breathing. But when the pleura is riddled with rigid, dart-shaped asbestos fibers, it begins to scar over, rendering the soft, pink tissue that was once thin as plastic wrap into something that\u2019s thick as an orange peel. Disease that\u2019s the result of Libby\u2019s asbestos can also be tricky to diagnose because it remains latent for years, then progresses at rates that have stunned medical professionals. Black and his colleagues might read abnormalities on a patient\u2019s X-ray or CT images years before the patient ever exhibits symptoms. Many patients at the CARD clinic request screenings simply because they\u2019ve lived in Libby and may have been inadvertently exposed to the dust. Because of a provision former U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, inserted into the Obama administration\u2019s health care reform bill, the Affordable Care Act, victims of asbestos-related disease in Libby are eligible for a range of federal health care benefits, including services not normally covered by Medicare. The provision provides funding for screenings as well as Medicare coverage for all Libby residents with asbestos-related disease. Under a special Medicare pilot program, the government also pays for services not included under Medicare, such as home care, medical equipment, counseling, help with travel, and medications not covered by Medicare prescription plans. It\u2019s a boon to current and former Libby residents unsure whether they\u2019ve been exposed. Studies by the EPA explain how the old vermiculite mine on Zonolite Mountain dispersed about 5,000 pounds of amphibole asbestos fibers over Libby every day the mill operated. It was sprinkled on the local ball field, used on the high school track, piled in heaps around the community, trucked away by train, and used as insulation in millions of homes across the country. \u201cIn Libby, there are all kinds of pathways to exposure. It\u2019s not just miners. People played in piles of the stuff when they were kids,\u201d Black said. \u201cA lot of the time we\u2019ll screen hunters who grew up here and suddenly notice they can\u2019t hike uphill any more without stopping every 15 feet to catch their breath.\u201d The findings in Libby could have larger implications for helping doctors across the country better diagnose people who were exposed to the amphibole fibers and moved away or were exposed to the fibers through one of the many products made with asbestos from the Northwest Montana mine. Doctors might not recognize the more progressive form of lung disease caused by amphibole fibers, instead believing patients were exposed to chrysotile fibers, which make up 95 percent of asbestos use, Black said. Still, Black is sympathetic to his colleagues who don\u2019t see what he sees on patients\u2019 scans. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge since we started,\u201d he said. \u201cPrior to 2000, we didn\u2019t know anything. It was all a new experience for me because what we were seeing was so different than what we were trained to look for. We didn\u2019t know what we were looking for.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t your grandfather\u2019s asbestos disease,\u201d he added. In 2017, Black and his colleagues published a groundbreaking study that validated their interpretation of abnormalities they detected in imagery and scans that other radiologists dismissed. The case involved a 74-year-old former Libby resident who worked as a millwright at the vermiculite mine from 1969 until its closure in 1990. He moved out of the area in 1991, and had no other known exposure to asbestos fibers. In 2011, he developed increasing chest pain, and in 2013 lung cancer screening detected a new, solid nodule that continued to grow on follow-up scans. When the patient was referred for a lobectomy, a procedure that involves removing a section of the lung, analysis of the tissue revealed physical proof of what Black and his colleagues had detected on the patient\u2019s scans \u2014 it was riddled with asbestos fibers, specifically, 5.5 million fibers per gram of wet lung lining. \u201cMost people would never have interpreted this patient\u2019s scans as positive,\u201d Black said. \u201cAnd here we had physical proof, not just a radiologist\u2019s interpretation. It was an ideal case because it showed exactly what we have been seeing \u2014 a high fiber burden that would not have been recognized as abnormal by most radiologists. Here, we were able to show it and compare it to the finer features of the scan.\u201d It was the first case in which lung tissue from a Libby miner was evaluated for fiber analysis. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re looking for but to train other people to see it over time is a challenge,\u201d he said. Even as Black and his colleagues, like Dr. Albert Miller, who specializes in pulmonary medicine and performs work at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, seek to mount more scientific evidence to better understand Libby\u2019s asbestos disease, and better imagery to diagnose it, thousands of lawsuits plod on through the legal channels. Although W.R. Grace is no longer a defendant in legal actions, other defendants remain embroiled in lawsuits: International Paper, which owns the firm that operated a lumber mill in Libby; Grace\u2019s insurance carrier, Maryland Casualty; Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which trucked the asbestos-laced ore to communities across the country; and the state of Montana, which knew about the mine contaminants for decades. Black says the paper warfare waged in the lawsuits is time-consuming, and something he\u2019d \u201crather do without.\u201d The Montana Supreme Court recently appointed six additional Asbestos Claim Court judges to handle the thousands of claims pending against dozens of defendants, a bloated docket that until the high court\u2019s decision last month fell on a single jurist\u2019s desktop. The Asbestos Claims Court was created in November 2017, with the Honorable Amy Eddy, 11th Judicial District in Kalispell, appointed as the judge for pretrial proceedings for the 545 plaintiffs identified at that time, all of them fighting for reparations stemming from asbestos exposure from a now-defunct vermiculite mine in Libby, owned and operated by W.R. Grace, which derailed the cases for years after the company filed for federal bankruptcy. With the federal proceedings over, the clot of cases is coursing through a constricted legal artery, even as the docket continues to swell. Eddy said an additional six judges is barely scratching the surface of what\u2019s needed to efficiently handle the volume, and they\u2019re performing the work without compensation, on a voluntary basis. \u201cA total of seven judges just isn\u2019t enough with so many hundreds of complex cases based primarily in Northwest Montana,\u201d she said. Now, similar lawsuits are being filed against Johnson & Johnson following reports that some of the company\u2019s talc used in its baby products contained asbestos fibers, including tremolite fibers that have been the culprit in Libby. So if the fundamental science still has yet to be performed in Libby, ground-zero in the nation for asbestos-related disease, what are the implications for new discoveries of asbestos exposure in other corners of industry, which will spawn thousands more lawsuits? \u201cWe could have more science and it would still be a battle. It\u2019s the nature of the game,\u201d Black said. \u201cBut more science is exactly what we need.\u201d With a limited budget, and in some cases no budget whatsoever to perform the necessary studies, Black says the scientific community is missing out on a monumental opportunity. \u201cWe have the perfect population to perform these studies on, but to find the money? Nobody has it,\u201d Black said. \u201cIn the world of asbestos, it\u2019s tough to get a fair shake.\u201d \u201cTo lose this opportunity with the Libby population is one of the biggest mistakes we can make,\u201d he added.

Analyzing the skeleton using radiography and a scanning electron microscope, they managed to get clear imaging of lesions on the bones which showed the cancer had spread to cause tumors on the collar bones, shoulder blades, upper arms, vertebrae, ribs, pelvis and thigh bones. \u201cInsights gained from archaeological human remains like these can really help us to understand the evolution and history of modern diseases,\u201d said Michaela Binder, a Durham PhD student who led the research and excavated and examined the skeleton. \u201cOur analysis showed that the shape of the small lesions on the bones can only have been caused by a soft tissue cancer ... though the exact origin is impossible to determine through the bones alone.\u201d  Despite being one of the world\u2019s leading causes of death today, cancer is virtually absent in archaeological records compared to other diseases - and that has given rise to the idea that cancers are mainly attributable to modern lifestyles and to people living for longer. According to the World Health Organisation\u2019s cancer research agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within the 20 years. Yet these new findings, published in the Public Library of Science journal PLOS ONE on Monday, suggest cancer is not only a modern disease, but was around in the Nile Valley even in ancient times. Binder said the discovery should help scientists explore the underlying causes of cancer in ancient populations and give fresh clues about the evolution of cancer in the past. Ancient DNA analysis of skeletons and mummies with evidence of cancer can be used to detect mutations in specific genes that are known to be associated with particular types of cancer. The skeleton is of an adult male estimated to be between 25- and 35-years-old when he died. It was found at the archaeological site of Amara West in northern Sudan, on the Nile, 750 km downstream from the capital Khartoum. The researchers said they could only speculate on what may have caused of the young man\u2019s cancer, but it may have been as a result of environmental carcinogens such as smoke from wood fires, or due to genetic factors, or from an infectious disease such as schistosomiasis, which is caused by parasites.

Four of the five bills dealt solidly with fiscal policy -- taxes and the Public Employees Retirement System. The fifth, though, addressed whether local governments could regulate genetically modified crops. The bill was thrown in as something of a bargaining chip. Gov. John Kitzhaber needed Republican support for his other four endeavors, and the GMO bill was one way to reach a compromise. This deal, however, rubbed environmentalists the wrong way. They began calling the bill the \"\"Oregon Monsanto Protection Act.\"\" One of the bill\u2019s critics was Rick North, the former project director of the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility's Campaign For Safe Food. In a piece he wrote for BlueOregon, a liberal political blog, he called out two of the local -- and wholesome sounding -- groups that were big advocates of the legislation. \"\"Oregonians for Food and Shelter and the Oregon Farm Bureau, biotech puppets who have most state Republican legislators in their back pocket, jumped into action,\"\" he wrote. \"\"OFS proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech companies.\"\" We were curious about the board member and funding claims, so we decided to take a look. The first bit, that Oregonians for Food and Shelter has board members from those two leading biotech firms was easy to check. We simply went to the group\u2019s website and found, listed along with 34 other voting members, these two names: Michael Diamond, the director of government affairs for Monsanto, and Danelle Farmer, who was most recently listed as a senior state government relations manager at Syngenta. The names aren\u2019t difficult to find -- and they\u2019re listed along with their corporate affiliations. Naturally, we reached out to Oregonians for Food and Shelter to see if they had extra information we might consider. Scott Dahlman, the executive director, said it is unabashedly the group\u2019s position to defend \"\"the right to responsibly use pesticides and biotechnology.\"\" Next we checked out the Oregon Farm Bureau funding statement. We started by speaking with the bureau\u2019s spokeswoman, Anne Marie Moss. She said it was probably  because the group has a political action committee that accepts donations from any and all groups. Moss stressed, however, that the Farm Bureau is a largely grassroots organization that takes positions based on what county members -- all of whom are required to be involved in agriculture or ranching -- vote to take up on the state level. \"\"We have members on both sides of that issue as well, but it's like a democracy,\"\" Moss said. \"\"Majority rules.\"\" Generally, she said, the group tries to support all sorts of agriculture, whether organic or genetically modified, but often members come down on the side of fewer restrictions. \"\"We believe in the whole big tent of agriculture, all types are welcome,\"\" she said. There is already \"\"a lot of regulation so, as a whole, we try to push back. We don't want our members regulated out of business.\"\" We took a look at the campaign finance records for ourselves and found that both Monsanto and Syngenta had contributed a significant sum to the group. Since 2006, the Oregon Farm Bureau has reported receiving about $440,000 in cash contributions. Of that, Monsanto has contributed $103,500 and Syngenta has given more than $19,000. That means those two companies represent a combined 28 percent of the total reported cash contributions. This year, Monsanto donated $10,500 -- $4,500 in mid-September. During our conversation, Moss noted that while the money is appreciated, \"\"Monsanto couldn't come in and give us a command directive.\"\" Indeed, we found donations from other sources, including individual farms and nurseries. For our final stab at due diligence, we called North to let him know we\u2019d looked into his claims. We asked him why he thought this information was important given that both groups consider themselves to be grassroots. \"\"I don't know that it's anything more complicated than \u2018Follow the money,\u2019\"\" he said.

It has called on student and retired doctors to help an overwhelmed health service. On Wednesday Italy reported 475 new deaths, the biggest increase since the outbreak started and the highest one-day total posted by any nation. France also reported a spike in deaths - rising by 89, or 51%, to a total of 264 in 24 hours. Around the world, rich and poor alike saw lives turned upside down as events were cancelled, shops stripped, workplaces emptied, streets deserted, schools shut and travel minimized. \u201cCleanliness is important, but here it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Marcelle Diatta, a 41-year-old mother of four in Senegal, where announcements rang from loudspeakers urging people to wash hands but water was often cut off in her suburb. The crisis has created a wave of solidarity in some countries, with neighbours, families and colleagues coming together to look after the most needy, including dropping supplies at the doors of those forced to stay inside. Around Spain, applause and the banging of pots ring out in evenings at 8 p.m. as self-isolating neighbours express gratitude to health services. In several countries, stores began reserving special times for elderly shoppers to help keep the most vulnerable away from those who might infect them. The United States, which closed its border with Canada except for essential travel, was sending its two military hospital ships - Comfort and Mercy - to New York\u2019s harbor and the West Coast, while the Swedish military is setting up a field hospital near Stockholm. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the country was on wartime footing and invoked special powers through the Defense Production Act to rapidly expand manufacturing of masks and protective equipment in short supply. Spooked by a seemingly inevitable global recession, rich nations are unleashing billions of dollars in stimulus to bolster economies, aid health services, provide loans to tottering businesses and help individuals with mortgages and other routine payments. Extra cash from governments and central banks failed to calm markets: Stocks and oil prices reeled again, with European shares down nearly 5% to approach seven-year lows and major U.S. indexes off by 9% and down 30% from highs reached last month. Taking their cue from the waning of the coronavirus in China, where it emerged late last year, optimists predict a bounce back once the epidemic also passes its peak elsewhere - hoped to be within months. Pessimists are factoring in the possibility of recurring outbreaks and years of pain, some even whispering comparisons with the Great Depression of the 1930s. On the ground, millions of workers fear for their jobs. In the airline industry, tens of thousands have already been laid off or put on unpaid leave. The U.S. state of Nevada, home to the casinos of Las Vegas, effectively shut its entire leisure industry overnight. The sector employs 355,000 people - a quarter of all jobs in the state. In China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy after the United States, the jobless rate rose to 6.2% in February, the highest since records began, and up from 5.2% in December. The majority of Chinese businesses and factories \u2013 apart from the original epicentre in Hubei province \u2013 have reopened, but it is unclear how many workers and staff have actually returned. The crisis has exacerbated some long-running geopolitical frictions. A European Union document accused Russian media of stoking panic in the West via misinformation over the disease, while China withdrew credentials of American journalists at three U.S. newspapers in a row in part over coverage of the coronavirus.

Patriots coach Bill Belichick, a self-declared non-scientist, held a pre-Super Bowl news conference where he attempted to explain why a football inflated indoors would lose pressure after being used outside. \"\"When the footballs are delivered to the officials' locker room, the officials were asked to inflate them to 12.5 pounds per square inch. What exactly they did, I don\u2019t know,\"\" Belichick said. \"\"When the footballs go out on to the field into game conditions ... \u00a0That\u2019s where the measurements would be different than what they are, possibly different, than what they are in a controlled environment.\"\" Belichick said when Patriot staffers tested this, they found that the balls \"\"were down approximately one-and-a-half pounds per square inch.\"\" There are too many unknowns\u00a0to resolve Deflategate, as this flap is called. But we couldn't help but give\u00a0Belichick's main assertion the PunditFact treatment. The question in this case is what\u00a0physics tells us about Belichick\u2019s point. Could\u00a0conditions outside (basically temperature and humidity) bring down the pressure of a football\u00a0by about 1.5 pounds per square inch? A quick recap The Patriots advanced to the Super Bowl on Jan. 18, 2015, by defeating the Indianapolis Colts 45-7. But by the next day, the most interesting number wasn\u2019t the point spread, but the inflation pressure of the Patriots\u2019 footballs. Under NFL rules, each team provides 12 balls, and about two hours before the game, an official verifies that they are inflated to the regulation pressure range of 12.5 to 13.5 pounds per square inch. At half-time, the NFL re-checked the Patriots\u2019 footballs --\u00a0reportedly at the request of the Colts but there\u2019s a bit of conflicting information on this --\u00a0and found 11 of the 12 were under inflated. By how much? That\u2019s unclear. Some reports say by 2 pounds per square inch. Others say while one ball might have measured that low, the rest were only about 1 pound under. One other essential variable: The temperature on game day was around 50 degrees. No one knows the exact inside temperature. Most people assume it was about 70 degrees. Doing the math After Belichick spoke, ABC News turned to Bill Nye, the popular explainer of all things scientific, to assess the coach\u2019s claim. ABC played\u00a0up Nye's verdict that Belichick's words \"\"didn\u2019t make any sense,\"\" but from the video, it sounds as though Nye was talking about Belichick's claim that rubbing the footballs would change the pressure, not the impact of temperature. CBS Sports relayed a tweet from another science luminary, physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson who also expressed skepticism. \"\"For the Patriots to blame a change in temperature for 15 percent\u00a0lower-pressures, requires balls to be inflated with 125-degree air,\"\" Tyson wrote. CBS reported that \"\"Every 10 degree drop in temperature (F) results in about .2 PSI loss in a football.\"\" According to CBS, that meant the weather would account for just a 0.4 pound of pressure loss, and tied that conclusion, loosely, to an Ohio State University physicist. We\u2019ll get back to that CBS story\u00a0(and its flaws) in a bit. On the other side of the ledger, USA Today interviewed Bowdoin College physics professor Dale Syphers who declared that a drop from room temperature in the 70s down to 40 degrees would reduce the pressure in a football by 1.3 pounds per square inch. The Daily Beast turned to the chair of the Physics Department at Boston College who said that with a 30 degree drop in temperature -- 75 down to 45 degrees -- you would expect the ball pressure to fall by by 1.54 pounds per square inch. Finally, the world of physics is divided between the theoretical physicists and the experimentalists. The physicists cited in the news worked with formulas. HeadSmart Labs, a private firm in Pittsburgh, tested actual footballs. It found that footballs inflated at 75 degrees, then cooled to 50 degrees lost 1.1 pounds of pressure. The lab took one more step. Since it was raining on game day, the staff dampened the balls. This led to a drop of an additional 0.7 pounds of pressure for a total of at least 1.8 pounds per square inch. The physics teachers come off the bench Enter Robert Hilborn of the American Association of Physics Teachers. The Harvard-trained physicist showed in detail how a law of physics, the ideal gas law, applied to the Patriots\u2019 footballs. When a gas cools, it contracts. The ideal gas law helps us put numbers to that relationship between pressure and temperature. Math alert: We\u2019re going to show you pretty much everything, so you can do it yourself at home. \"\"As almost every chemistry and physics student knows, the ideal gas law tells us that Pf\u00a0= Pi\u00a0(Tf/Ti),\"\" Hilborn wrote. The final pressure Pf\u00a0equals the initial pressure Pi\u00a0times the final temperature divided by the initial temperature Tf/Ti. Plugging in the numbers is simple, so long as you keep two things in mind. First, the pressure isn\u2019t the pressure you see on your pressure gauge. It\u2019s that amount plus the pressure of the atmosphere that\u2019s all around you. It might feel\u00a0counterintuitive, but when a football comes off the assembly line, before it's ever pumped up, it actually has an internal pressure that you wouldn't notice because it's the same as the pressure we always ignore. That's\u00a0the pressure that comes from\u00a0all those miles of air in our atmosphere pushing down on us. That pressure averages around 14.7 pounds per square inch. When you pump air into the football, you are adding pressure on top of the 14.7 that are already there. In Hilborn's math, you'll see he's added in the atmospheric pressure. The other key step is to measure the temperature in Celsius and count from absolute zero. That\u2019s the Kelvin scale. Hilborn used a starting temperature of 70 degrees and a final temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit and a starting pressure of 12.5 pounds per square inch. \"\"Those numbers give us 27.2 psi for Pi, 294 K for Ti, and 283 K for Tf resulting in Pf = 26.2 psi for the total pressure and a corresponding gauge pressure of 11.5 psi, about 1 psi below the NFL lower limit.\"\" In short, taking the balls outside would bring the pressure down 1 pound per square inch. Hilborn then accounted for the rain that day. Cooling the moist air inside the footballs would shed another 0.2 pounds per square inch. \"\"Combining the air temperature change effect with that of water vapor gives us a total of 1.2 psi, not too far from the figure of 1.4 psi given in one of the early NFL statements,\"\" Hilborn wrote. Hilborn\u2019s results are pure math, and they are largely in line with the test results from the lab in Pittsburgh. The results in other news reports We were troubled by the CBS item that came up with a much lower number of 0.4 pounds per square inch due to a lower outdoor temperature. But when we called Prof. Michael Lisa, the Ohio State University physicist quoted in the CBS article, Lisa said, \"\"CBS got it wrong.\"\" Lisa sent us this chart that you can download showing that for each 10 degrees drop in temperature, pressure drops 0.5 pounds. (The chart\u2019s different lines show that the higher the starting pressure, the greater the impact of falling temperature.) We found that news reports that undercut the Patriots\u2019 explanation used a high number for the loss of pressure. CBS said the footballs lost 2 pounds of pressure. Ditto for a Toronto Sun article. If it turns out that there really was a loss that large, then those arguments hold up. For the moment, we are simply assessing whether the physics back up what Belichick said and he used the 1.5 pound figure. Lisa also affirmed Hilborn\u2019s analysis. \"\"That AAPT guy did a nice job,\"\" Lisa said. Nevertheless, Hilborn himself said no one should rush to judgment. \"\"A conservative conclusion is that temperature changes alone can account for much of the under-inflation,\"\" Hilborn wrote. \"\"But until more accurate information is available about the preparation of and measurement of the footballs\u2019 air pressure, we should not assert that conclusion with a great deal of certainty.\"\" The NFL is investigating and at some point, all the numbers might be known. Or not. Hilborn told PunditFact that the accuracy of the pressure gauges is unclear. One number that will be of interest is the starting pressure for the Colts\u2019 footballs. It's possible they may have deflated as well, but stayed within the legal limits. Our ruling Belichick said that moving the footballs from indoors to outdoors could explain the loss of about 1.5 pounds per square inch of pressure. Experimental and mathematical results are in that ballpark. Lab tests said air temperature alone could bring down the pressure by 1.1 pounds. The ideal gas law predicted a 1 pound loss. The rain that day would explain at least another 0.2 pound shift and possibly as much as 0.7. We lack firm numbers on the actual pressure drop in the Patriots footballs, as well as precise information on the starting and ending temperatures. Within the limits of what the physics alone can tell us at this point, the math gets us pretty close to what Belichick said.

What you may not know is that the military is doing some significant multitasking. In addition to chasing down terrorists and conducting humanitarian rescue missions in places such as the Philippines, the Defense Department is also working to prevent and cure some of the deadliest diseases known to mankind. U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., recently said the medical research may not be the best use of Defense Department resources. \"\"What I don\u2019t understand is why the \u2026 military is spending $80 million a year on prostate cancer research, why we\u2019re spending $25 million a year on ovarian cancer research and $150 million on breast cancer research. We\u2019re also doing lung cancer research,\"\" Chambliss said during a Nov. 7 meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Chambliss wants additional money for the Defense Department, but he says it should be spent wisely. \"\"Now if there are particular needs that the military has regarding military research and there are some, particularly because of the casualties we\u2019ve suffered recently, I can understand it,\"\" the senator continued. \"\"But these are types of research that simply have no place in my opinion in (the Defense Department). They ought to be done in (the National Institutes of Health).\"\" Chambliss complained there is little coordination between the research done by the Defense Department and the National Institutes of Health. PolitiFact Georgia was unaware that the Defense Department was doing that kind of research. We\u2019re not early-risers like the Army. We embarked on a mission to determine whether the senator was correct that the military was conducting research on these serious conditions and whether his math was correct about how much in taxpayer dollars it was spending on such work. In late 1992, Congress began to set aside annual funding toward research of various illnesses and diseases to be done by the Defense Department. Some of the research is for conditions that appeared directly related to the battlefield, such as Gulf War Illness and traumatic brain injuries. Other research is for conditions faced by Americans that are not necessarily military-related. The list of conditions includes, as Chambliss noted, breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer. As Chambliss told it, the now-deceased Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaskan Republican, asked for some prostate cancer research dollars to be allocated to the Defense Department. Chambliss said Stevens later realized those funds should be allocated to the NIH. We looked up the most recent funding totals for the various forms of research. The Defense Department Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs website said $80 million was spent in fiscal year 2013 on prostate cancer research, but the totals were slightly less for the other forms of cancer Chambliss mentioned. The website said $20 million was spent on ovarian cancer research and $120 million on breast cancer research in FY 2013. The 2013 federal fiscal year began Oct. 1, 2012, and ended Sept. 30. Lauren Claffey, a spokeswoman for Chambliss, said he was using numbers for fiscal year 2010. To sum up, Chambliss said the federal government gives the U.S. Department of Defense $80 million a year for prostate cancer research, $25 million a year for ovarian cancer research and $150 million a year for breast cancer research. The senator is correct that there is such a program. The numbers are slightly off for two of the three forms of research.

After Trump canceled, citing security concerns, there were scattered skirmishes between supporters and demonstrators inside and outside the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion. Security in Bloomington was tight Sunday, with attendees told to leave bags and umbrellas in their vehicles, forcing some to don black trash bags to protect against the rain as they waited to pass through metal detectors. Hundreds of people didn\u2019t make it inside. Also outside was a group of about 100 protesters, who waved anti-Trump signs and chanted \u201cMr. Hate, leave our state.\u201d In the immediate wake of those events, a number of Facebook users shared the image reproduced above, which overlaid a quote from Trump about protesters over an iconic news photograph of a student fatally shot by National Guard troops during a 4 May 1970 anti-war protest at Kent State University: \u201cI love the old days.\u201d \u201cYou know what they used to do (to protesters) like that when they got out of line? They\u2019d be carried away on a stretcher, folks.\u201d The quote reproduced with the image reflected words spoken by Donald Trump, but it was something of a paraphrase plucked from a longer statement, and it referenced an utterance made by Trump well before the chaotic Chicago rally. After a disruption at a Las Vegas political rally that took place on 22 February 2016, Trump told his gathered supporters that: I love the old days, you know? You know what I hate? There\u2019s a guy totally disruptive, throwing punches. We\u2019re not allowed to punch back anymore \u2026 I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They\u2019d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. Trump then briefly lauded police before describing the protester as \u201cthrowing punches \u2026 nasty as hell,\u201d and telling a cheering crowd: The guards are very gentle with him. He\u2019s walking out like big high-fives, he\u2019s smiling \u2026 laughing. I\u2019d like to punch him in the face, I\u2019ll tell ya. (Contemporaneous reporting suggested that the individual removed from the 22 February 2016 rally was not \u201cthrowing punches.\u201d) The image seen here truncated Trump\u2019s remarks, replacing \u201cto guys like that in a place like this\u201d with \u201cto protesters.\u201d A 23 February 2016 Esquire article pointed out that the euphemisms in Trump\u2019s commentary weren\u2019t entirely apparent\u00a0to non-attendees: I wonder who the \u201cguys like that\u201d are, and why they don\u2019t belong \u201cin a place like this\u201d? The protester\u2019s identity is not yet clear, nor do we know whether or not they were actually throwing punches. But this is not the first time Trump has responded to dissenting voices at his rallies by encouraging violence. On 12 March 2016, Vox compiled variations of remarks made by Trump at various rallies on multiple dates across the United States and selected eight instances during which Trump made similar comments. Four of those examples were as follows: [1 February 2016, Iowa] \u201cIf you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Okay? Just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise.\u201d [26 February 2016, Oklahoma] \u201cIn the good old days, they\u2019d rip him out of that seat so fast. But today, everybody\u2019s politically correct. Our country\u2019s going to hell with being politically correct.\u201d [29 February 2016, Virginia] \u201cGet him out of here please. Get him out. Get him out \u2026 Are you from Mexico? Are you from Mexico? Huh? Are you from Mexico?\u201d [4 March 2016, Michigan] \u201cGet out of here. Get out. Out! \u2026 This is amazing. So much fun. I love it. I love it. We having a good time? USA, USA, USA! \u2026 All right, get him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do, I\u2019ll defend you in court. Don\u2019t worry about it \u2026 We had four guys, they jumped on him, they were swinging and swinging. The next day, we got killed in the press \u2014 that we were too rough. Give me a break. You know? Right? We don\u2019t want to be too politically correct anymore. Right, folks?\u201d The image entered wide circulation following Trump\u2019s canceled Chicago rally and subsequent interest in the GOP candidate\u2019s lamentations that protesters couldn\u2019t be violently ejected from his rallies. The photograph upon which Trump\u2019s words were superimposed was well-known, as described in a 6 May 1990 New York Times article marking the twentieth anniversary of the prize-winning image: The photograph was of Mary Ann Vecchio, then a 14-year-old runaway from the Miami area, kneeling in anguish beside the body of one of four students slain by Ohio National Guardsmen on May 4, 1970. The photograph won a Pulitzer Prize for John Filo, a student photographer who is now deputy picture editor at Sports Illustrated magazine. It became a classic image of the Vietnam War and its repercussions at home. Context for the image and the events it depicts are available via the Kent State University Libraries\u2019 Special Collections and Archives. In brief, as described at History.com, the Kent State shooting incident unfolded when:  On April 30, 1970, President Richard M. Nixon appeared on national television to announce the invasion of Cambodia by the United States and the need to draft 150,000 more soldiers for an expansion of the Vietnam War effort. This provoked massive protests on campuses throughout the country. At Kent State University in Ohio, protesters launched a demonstration that included setting fire to the ROTC building, prompting the governor of Ohio to dispatch 900 National Guardsmen to the campus During an altercation on May 4, twenty-eight guardsmen opened fire on a crowd, killing four students and wounding nine. Following the killings, the unrest across the country escalated even further. Almost five hundred colleges were shut down or disrupted by protests. Despite the public outcry, the Justice Department initially declined to conduct a grand jury investigation. A report by the President\u2019s Commission on Campus Unrest did acknowledge, however, that the action of the guardsmen had been \u201cunnecessary, unwarranted, and inexcusable.\u201d Eventually, a grand jury indicted eight of the guardsmen, but the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence.

The juxtaposition of Trump\u2019s words with the historically significant Kent State image was illustrative\u00a0in nature, although Trump has repeatedly stated a desire to see individuals protesting at his campaign events treated  roughly (i.e., without \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d).", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

Paris regularly goes through periods of high pollution, especially during heat waves, but requests by Paris city hall to temporarily ban polluting vehicles from entering the city center often take a long time to be implemented by the government. The court ruled that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient proof to establish a direct link between the Paris air pollution and her and her daughter\u2019s health problems and rejected her claims for compensation. But in the first such ruling in France, the court said the state had repeatedly failed to take sufficient measures to prevent pollution from rising above government-set thresholds. \u201cThe state\u2019s responsibility has been established.

All of them,\u201d he told Record TV, adding that the leak, \u201cby all accounts looks like it was criminal.\u201d Brazil\u2019s government has been striving to investigate the cause of the spill that has hit 321 beaches along the northeast coast since early September, hurting fishing and tourism. Authorities have described the spill as one of the country\u2019s worst environmental disasters. The crude\u2019s density renders it invisible from above, making it hard to track its origin or to have a clear picture of the amount of oil yet to reach Brazil\u2019s coast. Some 4,000 tons of oil has been collected from northeastern beaches thus far, according to a statement Sunday from the Navy, Brazil\u2019s environmental regulator, and the national petroleum agency. \u201cTo say how much oil there still is very difficult to say,\u201d Commander Leonardo Puntel of the Brazilian Navy said at a press conference on Monday. \u201cSince the oil is underwater, we don\u2019t know if there\u2019s still a lot or a little. There is effectively no correct and accurate way to monitor these oil spots,\u201d he said, adding that they have seen a decrease in oil arriving onto beaches in recent days. He called the disaster \u201cunprecedented.\u201d \u201cThere is no case in the world of a large-scale oil spill where the origins are totally unknown. This case has no parallel, we don\u2019t know who polluter is,\u201d Puntel said. Brazil\u2019s defense minister, Gen. Fernando Azevedo e Silva, also stressed how challenging it is to calculate the spill\u2019s scope. \u201cIt is not detectable by satellite. ... It is imperceptible. We do not know how much will still come,\u201d he said. David Zee, an oceanographer at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said that the 4,000 tons of collected oil is \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg,\u201d both because the cleanup effort is mostly limited to sandy beaches in populated areas and also because a large portion of spilled oil is likely spread deep beneath the ocean\u2019s surface. Furthermore, when currents bring oil to sandy shores, it is relatively easy to collect, while is nearly impossible to remove from corals and mangrove forests, which make up part of the affected area, Zee said. Brazilian prosecutors have named Greek shipping company Delta Tankers Ltd as a suspect of the leak\u2019s origins. The company issued a statement earlier saying it found no evidence of leakage after reviewing the ship\u2019s cameras and sensors. \u201cThis material will be willingly shared with Brazilian authorities, should they contact the company regarding this investigation. So far, no such contact has been made,\u201d the statement said. Federal Police officer Franco Perazzoni said at Monday\u2019s press conference that the company will be officially notified via Interpol. Brazilian prosecutors said previously that Delta\u2019s oil tanker, named Bouboulina, was navigating through Brazilian waters at the time and location of the spill. The ship was carrying oil from Venezuela to Malaysia. In a search order seen Friday by The Associated Press, Brazilian prosecutors said \u201cthere is no indication of another boat\u201d that could have discharged the Venezuelan crude into the sea. Brazilian armed forces along with environmental protection agencies and petroleum authorities are leading an operation to clean, monitor and investigate the oil spill. Several public universities are conducting research about the spill\u2019s origins and impact. Television footage has also shown volunteers flocking to beaches to help with the cleanup, often without government supervision. Of particular concern at the moment is the Abrolhos national marine park, home to Brazil\u2019s largest coral reefs. Authorities said Sunday night that they had removed the fragments of oil that had appeared in the park and so far no new traces had been found. \u201cA very small amount of oil arrived on November 2, on November 3 only a few fragments remained, today there\u2019s none,\u201d Puntel said in the Monday press conference. \u201cWill more oil fragments come?

But 41 of the nation\u2019s 50 states fail to test widely enough to drive their infections below a key benchmark, according to an AP analysis of metrics developed by Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute. Among the states falling short are  Texas and Georgia, which recently moved aggressively to reopen stores, malls, barbershops and other businesses. Also Friday, Democrats approved a massive $3 trillion coronavirus response bill in the House over Republican opposition. It aims aims to prop up a U.S. economy in free fall and a health care system overwhelmed by a pandemic. But the measure has no chance of passing the GOP-controlled Senate and has already drawn a White House veto threat. As health authorities expand testing to more people, the number of positive results should shrink compared with the total number of people tested. The World Health Organization and other health researchers have said a percentage above 10% indicates inadequate testing. South Korea, a country praised for its rapid response, quickly pushed its positive cases to below 3%. Most governors are moving ahead with unlocking their states, even in cases where they are not meeting broad guidelines recommended by the White House. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has set a goal of 30,000 tests per day as his state launched one of the nation\u2019s most aggressive reopenings on May 1. He never set a firm date on when the state would hit the 30,000 mark, but for most of May, the daily testing numbers fell short of that. Local leaders say tests are still in short supply. El Paso officials have pleaded with the governor to postpone easing up any more business restrictions in light of the COVID-19 cases there surging 60% over the past two weeks. The first stage of Maryland\u2019s reopening began Friday evening, when some retail stores were allowed to reopen and a stay-at-home order was lifted. Some of the hardest-hit parts of the state, including the suburbs of Washington, D.C., extended restrictions for residents and businesses. Maryland averaged 4,265 tests per day this week, compared with about 4,900 the previous week. Nearly 22 percent of people tested positive in Maryland on average over the last seven days. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan made headlines last month when the state acquired 500,000 test kits from a South Korean company in a confidential deal, but Maryland has not had all the components needed for testing \u2014 like swabs \u2014 to meet demand. Hogan said Maryland just received swabs this week from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \u201cWe requested 350,000,\u201d Hogan said Wednesday. \u201cThey\u2019ve committed to 225,000, and I think we got 75,000 yesterday with another 125,000 that are supposedly days away, along with the tubes and the stuff that goes with them. So it\u2019s not enough, but it helps us.\u201d Harvard University researchers have calculated that the U.S. needs to test at least 900,000 people daily to safely reopen the economy, based on the 10% positivity rate and other key metrics. That goal is nearly three times the country\u2019s current daily testing tally of about 360,000, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project website. \u201cThe fact that testing has become the Achilles\u2019 heel that has made it hard for us to have a great national response to this pandemic is a tragedy,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute. President Donald Trump insisted again this week that his administration \u201cmet the moment\u201d and \u201cprevailed\u201d on testing, even as he continued shifting responsibility for the effort to the governors. Administration officials said they will provide states with enough testing supplies to conduct about 400,000 tests per day in May and June. That\u2019s less than half the total recommended by the Harvard team. Only nine states met the daily rate recommended by Jha and his colleagues, according to the AP analysis. Most of those states are large and rural, such as Montana, Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming. Meanwhile, states with some of the biggest testing shortfalls, including New York and New Jersey, have signaled they will keep stay-at-home orders in place or only partially ease restrictions. \u201cI really do feel there are dangers here to opening up without enough tests, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a uniform danger everywhere in the country,\u201d Jha said. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo will allow many smaller cities and rural regions of upstate New York to gradually reopen first, industry by industry, in areas that have been spared the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak. The first wave of businesses includes retail \u2014 though only for curbside or in-store pickup \u2014 along with construction and manufacturing. Cuomo also announced beaches would be allowed to open in time for the Memorial Day weekend. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy will let individual shore towns decide whether to reopen beaches. His long-awaited guidance Thursday directed them to set occupancy limits, require 6 feet (2 meters) of space between beachgoers, except family members or couples, and prohibit groups of 10 or more from congregating on the beach. California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the state\u2019s testing reached 35,000 daily this week and that more than 1 million tests have been administered. The state remains on lockdown, though Southern California\u2019s beaches are open with restrictions. North Carolina also has made testing progress, reporting on an all-time high of more than 12,000 additional tests completed Friday compared to the previous day. But the state\u2019s seven-day rolling average of just over 6,000 tests is still well below the 11,000 daily tests recommended by the Harvard team. The testing increases over the past few weeks contributed in part to Gov. Roy Cooper and state leaders feeling comfortable with easing his stay-at-home order May 8. Grand Canyon National Park reopened Friday to allow visitors in for day trips but not overnight. By 7:30 a.m., more than two dozen people were enjoying South Rim viewpoints. Signs reminded tourists to keep their distance from one another and stay in groups of less than 10. Volume of testing isn\u2019t the only concern. The Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday that it was investigating preliminary data suggesting a rapid COVID-19 test used daily to test Trump and key members of his staff can miss infections. Trump expressed confidence in the test from Abbott Laboratories. Worldwide, there have been more than 4.4 million coronavirus infections reported and 300,000 deaths, while nearly 1.6 million people have recovered, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. ___ Witte reported from Annapolis, Maryland.

But Pinki\u2019s problems ran much deeper. Highly ambitious, she was anxious she wouldn\u2019t fulfill her dreams. At the same time she\u2019d been under pressure from some family members to follow a more traditional route - to marry and settle down. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d Arun said. \u201cShe put a lot of pressure on herself.\u201d  Pinki\u2019s story is emblematic of problems confronting India\u2019s young, in a society impatient for progress and yet underprepared for the challenges that inevitably accompany modernity. Cultural issues, discrimination, parental pressure and competition for highly paid jobs are combining to create a suicide epidemic among young Indians. Compounding the problem is a system that barely recognizes mental health issues. India has the world\u2019s highest suicide rate among 15 to 29 year olds, ahead of next-placed North Korea, according to a September report by the World Health Organization. For the first time, suicide is the leading cause of death among young Indian women, overtaking deaths during childbirth, the WHO says.In most parts of the world suicides tend to occur among the most disadvantaged groups, but in India they are happening among better educated young adults living in the most prosperous regions. In south India, where literacy rates and incomes are highest in the country, suicide rates are 10 times higher than in northern states, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal in 2012. \u201cAspirations are at a much higher level and society around them is not always keeping pace, so the disappointment is much greater,\u201d said Vikram Patel, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who carried out the research. MENTAL HEALTH NEGLECT As India\u2019s policymakers strive to put the country on a path to modernity, something akin to China\u2019s transformation of the past two decades, the young are feeling the pressure. In particular, young females. Unlike the rest of the world where younger men are more likely to take their lives than women, in India the opposite is the case. Experts put this down to women\u2019s low status in society. Compounding the issue, little help is at hand for those suffering from mental illness. In India, the condition often goes undiagnozed or untreated, and until a couple of months ago the country did not have national mental health policy. Spending on mental health accounts for 0.06 percent of the government\u2019s health budget, the lowest level in the world after Zimbabwe. For most Indians with mental illnesses\u00a0\u201cthere is literally no care available\u201d, Harsh Vardan, then-health minister, said in October announcing plans to build more mental hospitals and train more psychiatrists.In January, the health ministry launched a nationwide program to provide community support for adolescents suffering from mental illness. TRAPPEDIn the run-up to Chauhan\u2019s suicide, conflict had been building on different fronts. Exam pressure weighed heavily on her mind. There were disputes with her parents. She felt trapped between the competing ideals of old India and new.She lived in a village on the edge of Gurgaon where the timeless India of wheat fields and cattle-drawn carts abuts the frantically rising apartment towers of the budding middle class. Chauhan didn\u2019t want to get married as a teenager, the path for most women in her village. In many families, once a woman gets married there is little chance for education and her primary job is to serve her husband\u2019s family. \u201cShe had been arguing with her parents, who wanted her to get married, but she was ambitious, she wanted to prove herself and achieve her dreams,\u201d said her brother, Arun. When she scored zero on a physics paper she was crushed, fearing it would blemish her job chances. Chauhan along with other students pleaded with their teachers for the papers to be reassessed. Her university, Government Girls College, declined comment when contacted by Reuters, saying the case was under police investigation. A teacher at the college, who asked not to be identified, said there was a mismatch between student\u2019s expectations and what they were capable of. \u201cWe find many students get a shock when they come here because they have been doing well in school and then they don\u2019t get good marks (here).\u201d  Another teacher said that while the college provided counseling to students, the high student-to-teacher ratio meant some people missed the safety net. Pinki appeared to fall into that category. Tragically, the college later said that what had pushed her to fatally strike a match was the result of an error.

REUTERS/Toby Melville In an analysis of 14 studies, a team led by Satoru Kodama at the University of Tsukuba Institute of Clinical Medicine in Japan found that the heaviest drinkers were more likely to be diagnosed with the condition than people who drank little to no alcohol. Though definitions of \u201cheavy\u201d drinking varied, it meant at least two or more drinks per day for men, and one or more per day for women. In some studies, heavy drinkers downed at least six drinks per day. While doctors have long known that a drinking binge can trigger an episode of atrial fibrillation (AF), the findings \u2014 reported in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology \u2014 suggest that usual drinking habits may also matter. \u201cWhat we revealed in the current (study) is that not only episodic but habitual heavy drinking is associated with higher risk of AF,\u201d said Hirohito Sone, a colleague of Kodama\u2019s, told Reuters Health by email. Atrial fibrillation is the most common abnormal heart rhythm and is not in itself life-threatening, but patients with it are at significantly higher risk of strokes. It may also result in palpitations, fainting, chest pain or congestive heart failure. When all the study results were combined, heavy drinkers were 51 percent more likely to suffer atrial fibrillation than either non-drinkers or occasional drinkers. Overall, the risk edged up 8 percent for every increase of 10 grams in participants\u2019 daily alcohol intake. More than 2.6 million U.S. citizens will suffer from atrial fibrillation this year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition becomes more common with age and additional risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. Since coronary heart disease is much more common cause of death than atrial fibrillation, Sone said moderate drinking \u2014 up to one or two drinks per day \u2014 is probably still a heart-healthy habit for most people. A better way to show a connection is with studies that measure people\u2019s drinking habits, then follow them over time to see who develops atrial fibrillation, said Kenneth Mukamal of Harvard University and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, who led two of the studies included in the analysis. One of Mukamal\u2019s studies found a connection only between heavy drinking, with men who had five or more drinks a day having a higher risk of developing the condition over time than occasional drinkers. Mukamal said that, based on longer-term studies, \u201cthere\u2019s little risk from chronic drinking in moderation, but heavier drinking \u2014 even rarely \u2014 acutely increases risk.\u201d   SOURCE: bit.ly/guQxql Claim: Heavy drinking may raise abnormal heart rhythm risk.", "output": "People who drink regularly, especially heavy drinkers, may be more likely than teetotalers to suffer atrial fibrillation, a type of abnormal heart rhythm, according to a research review.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

As such, dictionary editors frequently update their works in order to keep up with the lexicon as it is being used by modern speakers. One such change occurred in 2007, when the Oxford University Press removed dozens of words from their Oxford Junior Dictionary in order to make room for more modern terms. Example: [Collected via Facebook, September 2015]  While it was noted at the time that dozens of nature words had been removed from the Oxford Junior Dictionary during its most recent revision, the media primarily mainly focused on the fact that terms related to religion and British history such as \u201cbishop\u201d and \u201cmonarchy\u201d had been omitted in order to make room for newer technological words such as \u201cblog\u201d and \u201cbroadband\u201d: Oxford University Press has removed words like \u201caisle\u201d, \u201cbishop\u201d, \u201cchapel\u201d, \u201cempire\u201d and \u201cmonarch\u201d from its Junior Dictionary and replaced them with words like \u201cblog\u201d, \u201cbroadband\u201d and \u201ccelebrity\u201d. Dozens of words related to the countryside have also been culled. The publisher claims the changes have been made to reflect the fact that Britain is a modern, multicultural, multifaith society. But academics and head teachers said that the changes to the 10,000 word Junior Dictionary could mean that children lose touch with Britain\u2019s heritage. \u201cWe have a certain Christian narrative which has given meaning to us over the last 2,000 years. To say it is all relative and replaceable is questionable,\u201d said Professor Alan Smithers, the director of the centre for education and employment at Buckingham University. \u201cThe word selections are a very interesting reflection of the way childhood is going, moving away from our spiritual background and the natural world and towards the world that information technology creates for us.\u201d Vineeta Gupta, the head of children\u2019s dictionaries at Oxford University Press, responded to the controversy at the time by explaining how the Oxford Junior Dictionary had limited space, and therefore in order to add new words they had to remove some older words: \u201cWe are limited by how big the dictionary can be \u2014 little hands must be able to handle it \u2014 but we produce 17 children\u2019s dictionaries with different selections and numbers of words. \u201cWhen you look back at older versions of dictionaries, there were lots of examples of flowers for instance. That was because many children lived in semi-rural environments and saw the seasons. Nowadays, the environment has changed. We are also much more multicultural. People don\u2019t go to Church as often as before. Our understanding of religion is within multiculturalism, which is why some words such as \u201cPentecost\u201d or \u201cWhitsun\u201d would have been in 20 years ago but not now.\u201d These changes, the last of which occurred in 2008, quietly remained in place for several years. But in January 2015, a group of writers led by Margaret Atwood penned a letter to Oxford University Press urging them to reinstate some of the words that had been removed: We the undersigned are profoundly alarmed to learn that the Oxford Junior Dictionary has systematically been stripped of many words associated with nature and the countryside. We write to plead that the next edition sees the reinstatement of words cut since 2007. We base this plea on two considerations. Firstly, the belief that nature and culture have been linked from the beginnings of our history. For the first time ever, that link is in danger of becoming unravelled, to the detriment of society, culture, and the natural environment. Secondly, childhood is undergoing profound change; some of this is negative; and the rapid decline in children\u2019s connections to nature is a major problem. This is not just a romantic desire to reflect the rosy memories of our own childhoods onto today\u2019s youngsters. There is a shocking, proven connection between the decline in natural play and the decline in children\u2019s wellbeing. Compared with a generation ago, when 40% of children regularly played in natural areas, now only 10% do so, while another 40% never play anywhere outdoors. Ever. Obesity, anti-social behaviour, friendlessness and fear are the known consequences. The physical fitness of children is declining by 9% per decade, according to Public Health England. And just as in 2008, Oxford University Press (OUP) released a statement explaining how they decide which words to include and which words to remove from their dictionaries: \u201cOur children\u2019s dictionaries provide a vital tool for helping children to improve their literacy skills and develop a passion for language. \u201cIn the last 40 yours our range of children\u2019s dictionaries has incread from two to 17, and as such the total number of words \u2014 including those about nature \u2014 has significantly increased across the range. The last change to the content of the Oxford Junior Dictionary was in 2008 and it still includes a large number of words focusing on the natural world. Our dictionaries are developed through a rigorous research programme, analyzing how children are currently using language. They also reflect the language thatt children are encourage to use in the classroom, as required by the national curriculum. This ensures they remain relevant and beneficial for children\u2019s education.\u201d OUP offered additional explanation on their web site: Compiling a small dictionary for children is never easy \u2014 so many words competing for space in a book with a finite number of pages. Animals and plants, clothing, fruits and vegetables, musical instruments, body parts, animal noises \u2026 the list is endless. They can\u2019t all go in. We know that, but it\u2019s still painful to have to exclude some familiar favourites. At the extremes, it\u2019s fairly easy \u2014 apple is in and durian fruit is out, piano is in and didgeridoo is out, jumper is in and jeggings is out.

Ra\u00fal Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources, is leading an investigation into the proposed 28,000-home development in a small town in southern Arizona. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me why top Interior officials would weigh in on a local land development unless someone was being done a huge favor,\u201d Grijalva said in a statement Wednesday. The committee sent a letter last week to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt saying recent reports raised questions about whether the permit decision by the Fish and Wildlife Service \u201cwas inappropriately reversed.\u201d It set a July 29 deadline for the Interior Department to turn over \u201call documents and communications\u201d on the hotly contested El Dorado Holdings project developed by Mike Ingram, a co-owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team and a prominent Republican donor. The Interior Department defends the permit as a science-based decision. Described as a 19-square-mile (49-square-kilometer) housing and golf course development that would draw traffic to the city of Benson, the project had been in a holding pattern for more than a decade. It gained traction in 2015 when El Dorado Holdings took over the project and rebranded it Villages at Vigneto. A coalition of conservation groups challenged the permit in a federal lawsuit in January. Environmentalists argue the project\u2019s need for groundwater will threaten the San Pedro River and surrounding wildlife, including birds like the southwestern willow flycatcher and yellow-billed cuckoo as well as the northern Mexican garter snake. They are demanding federal officials conduct a more in-depth environmental review. Steve Spangle, a retired Fish and Wildlife Service field supervisor, told the Arizona Daily Star in April that he had similar concerns in 2016 but was pressured a year later to facilitate the permit anyway. He has since told several media outlets that he \u201cgot rolled\u201d by politics. \u201cI used that phrase to distinguish it from making a policy call based on fact, as opposed to making a policy call based on politics,\u201d Spangle told the newspaper. He says an attorney with the Interior Department\u2019s solicitor\u2019s office warned him that a \u201chigh-level politico\u201d thought he should change his assessment in favor of the development. Emails and calendars show that Bernhardt, as deputy Interior secretary, had an unofficial meeting at a lodge in Billings, Montana, with Ingram, the developer, in August 2017, CNN reported Tuesday. They discussed Villages at Vigneto, the congressional committee said. Lanny Davis, attorney for El Dorado Holdings, said Ingram did not lobby for the project. Then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whom Ingram has known for several years, found out both men would coincidentally be at the same hunting lodge and suggested they meet. \u201cI believe Mr. Ingram presented a legal memo to Mr. Bernhardt,\u201d Davis told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the opposite of the innuendo that this was about lobbying and political influence.\u201d Two months after the meeting, Ingram donated $10,000 to a fundraising arm of the Trump campaign. That donation was later refunded, as was two $2,700 donations. Davis said Ingram got a refund so he could donate instead to a political action committee that allows contributors to give more money than campaigns do. \u201cThis is very common for (political) fundraisers. I\u2019ve done that many times myself,\u201d Davis said. In the wake of Spangle\u2019s allegations, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sent a letter to the Fish and Wildlife Service asking if its opinion on the permit had changed. Jeff Humphrey, an agency official in Arizona, said Spangle\u2019s comments \u201cdo not change our previous determinations.\u201d The Interior Department, which is the parent agency of the Fish and Wildlife Service, reiterated that stance in a statement Tuesday. \u201cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has re-examined the issue at hand and using the best available science as required under the Endangered Species Act issued the same exact conclusion,\u201d Interior spokeswoman Molly Block said. El Dorado Holdings has already shared communications with the House committee, including an email from Ingram to Zinke about the meeting in Montana, Davis said. It was nothing more than a legal memo and summary, the attorney said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say, \u2018Hey, you and I have been buddies,\u2019\u201d Davis said. Rep. Grijalva, however, was skeptical. \u201cI have real doubts whether Mr. Ingram sold this project to the Interior Department on merits,\u201d he said. ___ Associated Press writer Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report.

The cafeteria directors who lobbied for the change say they just want greater flexibility to serve foods like white bread \u2014 which are more processed and have less fiber \u2014 when whole grains don\u2019t work. In Vermont, the relaxed rule means white rice will be served with beans again. In Oregon, macaroni and cheese may return. And in South Dakota, students may notice a change with their soup. \u201cThe staff asked right away, \u2018Oh my God, can we go back to the other saltines?\u2019\u201d said Gay Anderson, a school lunch director and president of the School Nutrition Association, which represents cafeteria operators and suppliers like Domino\u2019s and Kellogg. The rollback addresses rules on grains, milk and salt championed by former first lady Michelle Obama. Since 2014, schools had been required to serve only whole grain versions of food as part of the national school lunch program, a critical source of free and reduced-price meals for millions of children. The idea is that whole grains would be more nourishing and help cultivate healthy habits amid alarming obesity rates . The Center for Science in the Public Interest, which is among the parties suing over the rollback, notes the standards were based on the government\u2019s own dietary guidelines and that most schools were successfully meeting them. But cafeteria operators said costs were higher, cooking was more difficult and students were throwing away more food. The School Nutrition Association said it\u2019s more important that children who rely on the lunches eat something, and that the rule ignored cultural preferences, such as for flour tortillas in the Southwest or for white rice among Asian students. To ease the transition to whole grains, the U.S. Department of Agriculture let schools apply for temporary waivers to serve select dishes that didn\u2019t meet the whole-grain rule. For the last school year, it said about 20 percent of districts asked permission to serve refined grains that are enriched to add back some nutrients. Among the frequently waived foods were pasta , pizza , tortillas and biscuits , which one Georgia lunch official joked affects the \u201dtests scores of rednecks ,\u201d according to records obtained by The Associated Press from state agencies. Other waived foods included beignets, cinnamon rolls, corn dogs, sugar cookies and Pop Tarts. One district requested a waiver for croissants because it said students don\u2019t like the whole-grain version. \u201cPlus they are 20 cents more per serving,\u201d the district said. Then in December, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the USDA was going back to the old standard: At least half of grain foods must be rich in whole grains. The agency said that does away with the red tape of making schools get waivers, and gives schools more flexibility to offer wholesome meals that also reduce food waste. Whitney Ellersick, a school lunch director in Portland, Oregon, said the change means her district will no longer need a waiver for its lasagna. But she was surprised by the extent of the rollback. \u201cI was a little shocked to see it go to 50 percent,\u201d Ellersick said. The Center for Science in the Public Interest said the USDA\u2019s rollback may be halting progress made by schools, which could be tempted to bring back more refined grains that cost less or are easier to make. Already, the group notes the USDA defines \u201cwhole grain rich\u201d as being half whole grain, meaning there\u2019s built-in wiggle room to make bread and pasta students won\u2019t mind. Bettina Elias Siegel of The Lunch Tray website also noted a recent USDA report that found that \u201cplate waste\u201d was comparable before and after the rules were implemented in 2014, undermining arguments they were prompting students to throw away more food. The report also found that students took advantage of lunches more often in schools with healthier lunches. The American Heart Association likewise criticized the decision to relax the rules and called on school districts to stick to the previous standards, which also included stricter rules on salt and milk. Among the districts that plan to do so is Boston, where fifth grader Trinity Wilson likes the brown rice. She said it\u2019s is healthier than white rice. \u201cI know that because my mom told me,\u201d Wilson said. But some school lunch officials say the rollback could help smaller districts that don\u2019t have access to as many products. In Arkansas, students in the Magnet Cove district accepted whole-grain Pop Tarts and other changes, officials say, but still prefer the old noodles, biscuits and rolls. \u201cThey\u2019re tastier, softer and fluffier,\u201d said Danny Thomas, the district\u2019s superintendent. In Burlington, Vermont, white rice and beans can return to menus. Doug Davis, the district\u2019s food director and incoming president of the School Nutrition Association, said it\u2019s a healthy dish that students will actually eat. To avoid buying two types of rice, Davis said white rice will likely also be used in stir fries and soups. He plans to stick mostly to whole grains, but he appreciates not having to. Whole-grain pasta isn\u2019t ideal for mac and cheese, Davis noted. \u201cWould we make a change on that? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. ____ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

As mentioned in the press release accompanying this story, the study included the \"\"worst of the worst\"\"\u00a0 MS patients. The story includes interview with study authors and participants, as well as Dr. Richert, VP of research and clinical programs for MS Society, who puts the results of this study in perspective. The story mentions other FDA-approved treatments for MS and compares\u00a0 the current use of longer-term pulsed intervals of cyclophosphamide with the higher-concentrated regimen\u2013which lasted only 4 days and was less toxic. The story notes that this experimental delivery system was tested in people in the early stages of a particularly aggressive form of MS, and the treatment is not a long-term cure. The story mentions that high-dose cyclophosphamide\u00a0 (generic name for Cytoxan, Neosar, Revimmune) (HiCy) is currently being studied via clinical trials, and at this time the concentrated form of the immunosuppressant drug is limited to people in the early stages of an aggressive form of MS. The story mentions that cyclophosphamide is already used in\u00a0a different dosing regimen for treatment of MS. The high-dose regimen is under study and more information about risk and efficacy is needed before it can be accepted for clinical use. The story describes the pros and cons of this new method of administering an existing drug to a subset of patients in the early stages of a particularly debilitating form of MS. The story discusses why this method of delivery may be an improvement over existing immunosuppressant drugs regimens for difficult-to-treat cases. There is similar language in the press release and news story; however, there is also some independent reporting and the story includes a perspective (MS researcher Dr. Richert) other than those of the researchers and\u00a0 participants from the HiCy trials.\" Claim: \u201cI\u2019ve gotten my life back\u201d: Hopkins reports success with MS treatment", "output": "The story describes a new method of administering an existing drug to a subset of patients in the early stages of a debilitating form of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The story discusses why this method of delivery may be an improvement over existing immunosuppressant drug regimens for difficult-to-treat MS cases. And it explains why more information about risk and efficacy of the high-dose treatment is needed before it can be accepted for clinical use. The story adequately describes the small, open-label, pilot-stage study of 9 MS patients. The story appropriately notes inclusion criteria for the study (i.e. patients in the early stages of aggressive MS) and cautions that the preliminary findings may not apply to other people with different subtypes of MS. The suggestion by a study researcher that results of this study could lead to a cure for MS seems premature, especially given the small number of people involved and outcomes at 2 years; however, the story does note the limited information available for HiCy therapy and the need for future randomized controlled trials with a larger group of patients. The story mentions the harms of treatment typically seen in patients taking the pulsed dose of cyclophosphamide, as well as side effects seen in the small group of patients in the HiCy trial. The cost of currently available low-dose, pulsed immune suppressing drugs could have been mentioned. It would be good to know if there would be a potential cost-saving for the patient with HiCy therapy.

Thirty-five people were charged around the country. The alleged fraud flourished at a time when many people are getting DNA tests to trace back their family heritage. Fraudsters preyed on people\u2019s fears of harboring genetic markers for cancer. However, genetic testing is not routinely used to screen for cancer. \u201cA decade ago, it would have given Medicare beneficiaries pause if someone wanted to get a swab from their cheek of their saliva,\u201d said Shimon Richmond, who heads the inspector general\u2019s investigative division . \u201cToday people know and recognize what (genetic testing) is, and they think \u2018I can get that done, and I can get it done for free and find out if I have health issues that I need to address.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a bad decision, said Richmond. Not only does it put the patient\u2019s Medicare ID in the hands of fraudsters who can then keep reselling it for illicit purposes, but it can potentially compromise unique details of an individual\u2019s make-up. Another downside: Medicare might deny future coverage for genetic testing when it\u2019s really needed, since the patient\u2019s record would show such an analysis was already done. Patients should only have genetic testing if their own doctor orders it, officials said. The alleged scheme worked like this: Officials said a telemarketing or in-person \u201crecruiter\u201d would convince a Medicare enrollee to take a genetic test, assuring them that the program would pay the full cost. The patient would provide their Medicare information. A doctor in league with the fraudsters would approve the test, and collect a kickback from the recruiter company. A lab participating in the scheme would run the test, bill Medicare, and share payments collected from the government with the recruiter. Bills to Medicare connected with the scam typically ranged from $7,000 to $12,000, Richmond said, with some much higher. In many cases the patient never got a report back, or the results provided were incomprehensible. Medicare paid out hundreds of millions of dollars before authorities detected the fraud and moved in. There was no single organization behind the fraud. Friday\u2019s operation targeted defendants in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, the Justice Department said. Nine doctors were among those charged. Others included owners of telemedicine companies and testing labs. Medicare enrollee Linda Morris of Parker City, Indiana, said she was roped in at a conference on aging well. The retired high school math and journalism teacher got her cheek swabbed by one of the many health vendors at the event. \u201cTheir ploy was, \u2018Get a mouth swab and we can analyze how well your system synthesizes the drugs you are taking,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt never crossed my mind there was anything wrong with this.\u201d Then her Medicare statements started coming in, showing charges as high as $33,000. The program paid almost $10,000. Morris said she was never billed, and was never sent results. When she looked up the address for the test vendor it was \u201ca house on a back road.\u201d \u201cI feel stupid, and in the meantime, I\u2019m furious,\u201d Morris said. Health fairs, church events, and senior centers are like magnets for the fraudsters, officials said. Dennie Krivokapich of Farmington, New Mexico, said he almost sent in his cheek swab following a telemarketing pitch. The retired accountant is a three-time cancer survivor and concerned about his future risk. The company sent him a kit, but the paperwork that came with it made him suspicious. \u201cThe physician who requested it was not my physician,\u201d said Krivokapich. The marketing company kept calling him, until he blocked the number. Government-backed anti-fraud organizations known as the Senior Medicare Patrol have been trying to spread the word about genetic testing scams. Retired federal investigator Jennifer Trussell, a consultant to the groups, said fear of cancer is the scam artists\u2019 most effective tool. \u201cThese are bad actors trying to take advantage of good medicine,\u201d she said. Fraud against government health care programs is a pervasive problem that costs taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. The true extent is unknown. Experts say part of the problem is that Medicare is required to pay medical bills promptly, which means money often goes out before potential frauds get flagged. Investigators call that \u201cpay and chase.\u201d In recent years, Medicare has tried to adapt techniques used by credit card companies to head off fraud. Law enforcement coordination has grown, with strike forces of federal prosecutors and agents, along with state counterparts, specializing in health care investigations.

Still, it acknowledged that VA Secretary Robert Wilkie had wrongly asserted publicly without evidence that the drug had been shown to benefit younger veterans. The VA, the nation\u2019s largest hospital system, also agreed more study was needed on the drug and suggested its use was now limited to extenuating circumstances, such as last-ditch efforts to save a coronavirus patient\u2019s life. In the first week of May, 17 patients had received the drug for COVID-19, according to VA data obtained by the AP. The department declined to say how many patients had been treated with hydroxychloroquine for the coronavirus since January, but a recent analysis of VA hospital data showed that hundreds of veterans had taken it by early April. \u201cVA has not endorsed nor discouraged the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients and has left those decisions to providers and their patients,\u201d the VA said. \u201cWhile all drugs have the potential for adverse events and some drugs in particular, like hydroxychloroquine, are known to have specific risks, when they are used carefully and judiciously, they can be managed safely.\u201d As of Friday, 11,883 veterans had been confirmed to be infected with the virus and 985 had died, according to VA statistics. Responding to written questions from Sen. Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, the department admitted it had no studies or evidence to back up Wilkie\u2019s claim that hydroxychloroquine had shown effectiveness in younger veterans in particular. \u201cThe use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID has dropped off dramatically,\u201d the VA said. Trump repeatedly has pushed the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, but no large, rigorous studies have found them safe or effective for COVID-19, and they can cause heart rhythm problems and other side effects. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against the drug combination and said hydroxychloroquine should only be used for the coronavirus in formal studies. Two large observational studies, each involving around 1,400 patients in New York, recently found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine. Two new ones published Thursday in the journal BMJ, one by French researchers and the other from China, reached the same conclusion. Tester, who received VA\u2019s responses this week, said he remained concerned about the drug\u2019s safety. \u201cAny drug used to treat patients with COVID-19, especially veterans living with debilitating preexisting conditions, must be proven safe and effective before it\u2019s administered,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven recent studies from both VA and other hospitals, hydroxychloroquine seems to fall short of those requirements.\u201d Major veterans organizations and Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had called on the VA to explain why it allowed the use of an unproven drug on vets. Last week, a whistleblower complaint by former Health and Human Services official Rick Bright alleged that the Trump administration wanted to \u201cflood\u201d hot spots in New York and New Jersey with the drug. Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said Friday that his group was heartened by the VA\u2019s preliminary explanations and called it imperative that it release additional details. \u201cIt remains concerning that it took this long to begin to get answers to basic questions,\u201d he said. The analysis of VA hospital data, done by independent researchers at two universities with VA approval, was not a rigorous experiment. Researchers analyzed medical records of 368 older male veterans hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus infection at VA medical centers who died or were discharged by April 11. About 28% of veterans who were given hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, versus 11% of those getting routine care alone. In its response to Congress, the department provided copies of some of its guidance issued to VA physicians on hydroxychloroquine from March to May. It made clear that hydroxychloroquine should be considered mostly for use in clinical trials or when medically appropriate after a full discussion with the patient about risks. The VA did not explain the circumstances in which veterans in the recent analysis of hospital data were given the drug, only suggesting that \u201cit is possible\u201d they were prescribed as part of last efforts to save a patient\u2019s life. \u201cBased on the principles of patient-centric care, it would be inappropriate to deny patients access to hydroxychloroquine under these dire circumstances,\u201d VA wrote. It said it had followed the approach of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases by \u201csummarizing the medical literature regarding unapproved treatments for COVID-19 and making that available to VA clinicians in their shared decision-making with patients.\u201d That guidance now includes preliminary studies on remdesivir, which has been federally approved for emergency use to treat COVID-19. One VA document dated March 25 notes a few \u201cvery small cohort studies\u201d showing possible \u201cbeneficial effects\u201d but adds \u201cthese data have NOT been verified in randomized controlled trials and are extremely preliminary.\u201d The VA acknowledged to Congress that it had placed bulk orders for hydroxychloroquine from Feb. 1 to April 23 for 6.3 million tablets worth $208,000 in anticipation of a possible shortage of the drug, but that most of it was being used for approved uses, such as treating lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It said it did not have breakdowns. The department also said it planned further studies and clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine, including whether it could help prevent infection in veterans who were potentially exposed to COVID-19. It is in discussions with Novartis to have some VA facilities participate in a national clinical trial that will look at the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin in patients with moderate and severe disease. ___ AP Chief Medical Writer Marilynn Marchione in Milwaukee contributed to this report.

The city was in trouble because, for years, its elected officials failed to invest enough money to cover the retirement benefits they were promising. So it caught our attention when Fung, who is running for governor as a Republican, sent out a letter with the city's new tax bills reporting that \"\"Our budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefits costs.\"\" So is Cranston's pension problem fixed and up to speed? We decided to look at the numbers. Cranston actually has several pension plans. Police and fire workers hired over the past two decades, along with municipal employees, are covered by the state-run Municipal Employees' Retirement System. The state sets a percentage of payroll that municipalities in the MERS system must contribute to cover their costs. If the municipalities don\u2019t pay up, the state withholds aid to make up the shortfall. For the current fiscal year, Cranston\u2019s minimum was 13.69 percent of payroll; the city\u2019s budget includes that amount -- about $4.8 million on the non-school side of the ledger. In other words, it\u2019s paying 100 percent of the state-mandated MERS requirement. Then there\u2019s the funding level, the percentage of what the plans need to meet their pension obligations. The city\u2019s MERS plans are not funded exactly at 100 percent, but they're fairly close. According to the latest actuarial report, the city has 95.9 percent of the projected police retiree costs, 107.1 percent of the projected firefighter retiree costs, and 95.1 percent of all other municipal retiree costs. Any plan with a funded ratio below 80 percent is considered to be in trouble. However, the old police and fire pension programs, administered by the city, are a different story because, over the years, Cranston's elected officials neglected to put enough money into those programs to cover future retiree costs. Although they have been closed since 1995, the city would need an additional $231 million to fully fund them. (To put that amount in perspective, the city's entire budget for the current fiscal year is $262 million.) The old police pension is only 18.3 percent funded and the old fire pension program is just 24.1 percent funded, according to information from the city's latest actuarial report. They\u2019re far from 100-percent funded. However, the city is now on a payment plan designed to wipe out that shortfall by 2042. (The date has been 2037, but a recent court settlement with the unions forced the date to be pushed back by five years.) Under that plan, the city should be paying $22,353,591 this year, according to the city's actuarial firm, Buck Consultants. Fung, in an email to PolitiFact Rhode Island, showed where the city's appropriation for this year will actually be $22,518 more than the recommended amount. To cover other benefits, primarily retiree health insurance, Buck recommended that the city budget $5.1 million. The city has set aside $4.6 million and plans to cover the remaining $500,000 by using about a third of its $1.6 million hospital stabilization account, which is savings accumulated because the city self-insures its workers. Fung, in an interview, said he didn't intend to leave the impression in his letter to taxpayers that the city had covered 100 percent of all its pension obligations. \"\"If I had meant that, I would have said it was 100 percent fully funded, which is not true.\"\" Instead, he said his point was that, unlike in past years, the city is paying for 100 percent of its annual required contribution to solve its pension problems. We should note that Fung has not been shy about talking about the unfunded liability of the city's old pension systems, mentioning it in interviews and on other occasions. Our ruling Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said, \"\"Our budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefit costs.\"\" The city is making the minimum required payments for retirement benefits through the state-run MERS system and to pay down this year's share of the bill for the huge long-term liability incurred by the city's older police and fire pension systems. But his statement could lead a reader to conclude that 100 percent of the city\u2019s $231 million debt for the old plans is covered by this year's budget when, in fact, the only thing the city is paying in full is this year's installment on a plan that won't retire that debt for another 28 years.

New treatments for diabetes and cancer now awaiting approval and increased sales of animal-health products and drugs in China and Japan are some of the aggressive moves he has in mind. He is also counting on a robust success rate among three dozen other experimental drugs now in mid- and late-stage trials, including a cancer drug called ramucirumab. \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of launching products in cancer and diabetes, two therapeutic areas where we\u2019re well established and where we have built out the infrastructure we need,\u201d Lechleiter said. \u201cAnd we believe that\u2019s going to be the beginning of our return to growth.\u201d  Skeptical investors only now appear to be catching on to Lilly\u2019s potential upside. After rising only 3 percent in 2013, badly underperforming a 27 percent average advance for other large drugmakers, the stock is up 6 percent this month. \u201cInstead of having to play defense and manage through this difficult patent cliff, the company will be able to use additional cash flow to invest in its pipeline, to partner with others or make bolt-on acquisitions,\u201d said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss. \u201cThe outlook is much brighter, and they\u2019ll try to get that message across in coming months.\u201d  Lilly, which reports quarterly and 2013 results on Thursday, has forecast earnings of $2.77 to $2.85 per share this year, the final and worst year of its patent cliff. That\u2019s 41 percent less than 2010. Lilly last year sought U.S. approvals for four drugs, three of which Lechleiter said could be approved in 2014: ramucirumab for stomach cancer, and dulaglutide and empagliflozin for type 2 diabetes - the most common form of diabetes, which is closely linked to obesity. Analysts have forecast annual sales of more than $650 million for ramucirumab, saying sales could be far higher if the drug also wins approval for cancers of the colon, lung or liver. But they caution that the diabetes drugs may have a hard time competing against existing options. Lechleiter said Lilly plans to seek approval of necitumumab for squamous-cell lung cancer this year. The medicine, like ramucirumab, was acquired by Lilly through its $6.5 billion purchase of ImClone Systems in 2008. If approved, necitumumab could capture eventual annual sales of more than $1 billion, analysts say. Such sales could make a big difference for Lilly, whose annual revenue of $20 billion is far lower than Big Pharma rivals like Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co. In the meantime, Lilly is testing nearly 40 medicines in mid- and late stage studies, compared with only 7 in those stages of development a decade ago. They include new treatments for cholesterol, psoriasis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Animal health unit Elanco, with annual sales of about $2 billion, is thriving as Lilly introduces new products and has expanded the business in China and other fast-growing markets. Many analysts are wary, however, of the company\u2019s ability to win approvals of prescription drugs because it has not launched any major products in recent years and has suffered setbacks in clinical trials, including ramucirumab\u2019s failure to delay progression of breast cancer. Of 20 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters, 12 have hold or sell ratings on Lilly, versus 8 with buy ratings. Lilly shares trade at 19 times expected 2014 per-share earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.6 for other large drugmakers. That could be more a reflection of the company\u2019s poor earnings this year than excitement about the stock. \u201cWe believe that overall the pipeline will disappoint investors,\u201d said Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets in a research note, citing low sales expectations for ramucirumab and the new diabetes drugs. When Lilly\u2019s Zyprexa was confronted with cheaper generic treatments for schizophrenia in October 2011, it faced one of the industry\u2019s steepest patent cliffs ever, quickly losing 80 percent of its onetime $5 billion in annual sales. Similarly precipitous declines are expected for Cymbalta, Lilly\u2019s $5 billion-a-year antidepressant, which lost U.S. patent protection last month, and for blockbuster osteoporosis treatment Evista, which goes generic in March. Many other large drugmakers, when faced with patent expirations and earnings declines of lesser scope, have resorted to megamergers to cushion the blow from generics and prop up earnings with cost savings. Huge layoffs, sapped morale and poor track records in introducing new drugs are more common results. Pfizer Inc stands out, having snapped up U.S. rivals Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth since 2000. Lechleiter, who began his career at Lilly in 1979 as a senior organic chemist, has steadfastly spurned any suggestion of a big merger: \u201cIt\u2019s never entered our minds, and we remain adamantly opposed.\u201d  John Boris, an analyst for Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, said he expects Lilly earnings to grow an average of 10 percent a year between 2015 and 2020, which would make it second to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co in profit growth over that period. Atlantic Equities\u2019 Purkiss said he anticipates Lilly will deliver industry-topping earnings growth in the \u201cmid-teens\u201d percentage range in 2015, 2016 and 2017. \u201cThe sentiment has been very negative on Lilly, but it looks like it will go from one of the most growth-starved to the fastest growing of the major U.S. drugmakers and the European players,\u201d Purkiss said. By avoiding a disruptive megamerger, Lilly has allowed itself to press ahead with ambitious research, said Barclays analyst Tony Butler. He said to date the company has met long-term sales and earnings forecasts it provided in 2009 - before patents went over the cliff - while maintaining its generous dividend, with a current yield of 3.6 percent. \u201cAt the time, the market was incredibly skeptical about Lilly\u2019s ability to fund its dividend and to have enough remaining cash flow to fund its business,\u201d said Butler. \u201cLilly proved everybody wrong.\u201d  (This story has been refiled to change second subhead) Claim: Lilly CEO: 'It's time to go back on offense'.", "output": "After three years of seeing major drugs like Zyprexa for schizophrenia lose patent protection and wipe away billions of dollars in revenue, Eli Lilly and Co Chief Executive Officer John Lechleiter wants to change the game plan.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

Recently released emails between Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides when she was secretary of state and officials at the Clinton Foundation have demonstrated that some foundation donors did get access to Clinton, though there\u2019s no evidence of direct favors. Addressing the topic on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Barack Obama\u2019s former campaign manager David Plouffe noted the Clinton Foundation\u2019s work on HIV/AIDS and malaria and Trump\u2019s own ties to the charity. \"\"The Clinton Foundation, I think it\u2019s a universal agreement, has done remarkable work around the world. I think Donald Trump himself contributed $100,000 to the foundation,\"\" he said. Plouffe is right that Trump gave at least $100,000 to the foundation, a fact that Trump and his campaign readily admit. One caveat: It appears that the money came through Trump\u2019s own foundation, not directly from Trump. The Clinton Foundation lists Donald J. Trump as a contributor with a cumulative lifetime donation amount between $100,001 to $250,000. It\u2019s not clear if Trump himself made a personal contribution, but tax forms show that the Donald J. Trump Foundation (which Trump controls) donated $100,000 to the foundation in 2009 and reserved a table at the Clinton Foundation gala for $10,000 in 2010. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka is also listed as a donor who gave between $5,001 and $10,000 and her father-in-law, Charles Kushner, gave between $250,001 and $500,000. Trump\u2019s gift amount places him in the top 0.2 percent of the foundation\u2019s donors. Most of its 300,000 donors (85.5 percent) gave less than $250. Breaking it down by dollar amount, however, Trump\u2019s total contribution isn\u2019t that big. We estimated that the foundation has received at least $800 million in donations, over 70 percent of which came from gifts of $1 million or more. In 2009, the Trump Foundation gave $926,750 to some 40 organizations (page 18). The Clinton Foundation received one of the largest gifts that year, matched or surpassed only by the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000) and the Police Athletic League ($156,000). Altogether, the Trump Foundation has donated $5.5 million to 298 charities between 2009 and 2013 according to the nonprofit\u2019s tax forms, Forbes found. Trump did not make any personal contributions to his foundations during this time. (Money for the Trump Foundation in these years came from others and from investment income.) Trump doesn\u2019t deny that he donated to the Clinton Foundation that he now calls a criminal enterprise. During the first GOP primary debate in August 2015, Trump voluntarily brought up his giving to the Clinton Foundation when asked about his previous donations to Hillary Clinton. \"\"When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me,\"\" Trump said. \"\"With Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding, and she came to my wedding. You know why? She didn\u2019t have a choice, because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn\u2019t know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world.\"\" For the record, the Clintons did attend Trump\u2019s third wedding to Melania Knauss, but that occurred in 2005, four years before the $100,000 donation. A few months later, Trump gave pretty similar answers when he was asked to explain the Forbes article on his charitable giving record in late January. \"\"I did give to the Clinton Foundation. What I didn't know is they'd be using it for private aircraft and things like that. The Clinton Foundation was helping with Haiti and with lots of other things and I thought it was going to do some good work. So, it didn't make any difference to me,\"\" he said on Jan. 31\u2019s Fox News Sunday. \"\"Again, I was a businessman and it was my obligation to get along with everybody, including the Clintons, including Democrats and liberals and Republicans and conservatives.\"\" Our ruling Plouffe said, \"\"Donald Trump himself gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.\"\" Tax records show the Donald J. Trump Foundation gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2009, and spent an additional $10,000 for a table at a Clinton Foundation gala the following year. The Clinton Foundation also lists Donald J. Trump (as well his daughter Ivanka and Ivanka\u2019s father-in-law) as a contributor.

PIP\u2019s founder and long-time chief executive, 73-year-old Jean-Claude Mas, has admitted filling the implants with an unapproved homemade recipe made of industrial-grade silicone gel. Mas and four PIP executives, including the chief financial officer, are charged with aggravated fraud and risk maximum prison terms of five years each, plus fines, for selling the implants around the world from 2001 to 2010, when they were ordered off the market. Mas himself was in court an hour before the start of proceedings, which were mostly taken up with opening day legal arguments. \u201cHe bears the enormous weight of this trial on his shoulders,\u201d Mas\u2019s lawyer Yves Haddad said. A vast exhibition building close to PIP\u2019s former premises has been set up as a makeshift courtroom to accommodate the huge crowds expected for the trial, due to last until mid-May. Mas arrived at court under police escort and faced a crush of cameras as the trial began in the southern city of Marseille. \u201cBastard!\u201d shouted someone in the audience of some 300 victims as Mas appeared live on a giant video screen. Of the more than 5,000 individual lawsuits filed against PIP - once the world\u2019s third-largest supplier of breast implants - and its executives, 220 have come from women outside France. A French woman who alleges that one of her PIP implants began to leak four years after its insertion said outside the courtroom that victims were both scared and angry. \u201cWe had foreign bodies put inside us that were flawed ... we could have maybe died from it. The anger is because we were tricked,\u201d said Tomassine Catalano. \u201cIt\u2019s frightening.\u201d  Leaving court, Mas sought to defend himself against such charges. \u201cFor 30 years I made prostheses,\u201d he told journalists. \u201cI did my best to protect them (women).\u201d  The scandal - revealed after inspectors pursuing a tip-off discovered vats of industrial-grade silicone outside the PIP factory in 2010 - sparked worldwide panic when the government recommended removal of the implants due to an abnormally high rupture rate. Health experts say no link has been established between PIP implants and breast cancer, but in the months after the scandal broke, plastic surgeons around the world reported a flood of removal requests from worried patients. Half the French women with PIP implants, or nearly 15,000, have already opted for removal, whether because of rupture or as a precaution, according to the government. Mas was released in October from eight months in detention following a failure to post bail. He told police that 75 percent of PIP\u2019s implants had contained the homemade gel, which was never been approved by regulators, although he denies it was unsafe. He and the other executives deny the charges. Investigators estimate that Mas\u2019s formula allowed PIP to save nearly $1.6 million in one year alone. When Mas told the court he lived on a modest monthly retirement income of 1,800 euros, hoots erupted from the spectators, prompting the judge to warn that the next person to disrupt proceedings would be thrown out. Minutes before the trial began, a court in Paris rejected a defense request to have the case thrown out. Mas and PIP\u2019s former chief financial officer, Claude Couty are separately implicated in a civil case over fiscal fraud that has yet to reach trial. Mas is also under investigation for manslaughter following a complaint from the mother of a French woman with PIP implants who died of cancer in 2010.

REUTERS/Dadang Tri Liana, who holds an economics degree, is one of 300,000 Indonesians in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation who have fallen victim to widespread ignorance about AIDS, and the government\u2019s inability to campaign effectively against it for fear of being accused by conservatives of promoting promiscuity. Social taboos and strict laws that ban prostitution also work against those most vulnerable to the incurable disease, because police often use condoms \u2014 one of the best protection against AIDS \u2014 as evidence against sex workers. Although HIV prevalence in Indonesia\u2019s population is low at 0.2 percent, the government and health experts are worried because the number of newly confirmed cases has more than doubled to 4,158 in the five years to 2010. \u201cWhen I started the job, I did not know anything about HIV/AIDS or that condoms can prevent you from getting infected with the disease\u201d, said Liana, who quit her job and turned to prostitution after her husband died in 2007 because she needed to pay off a mortgage and support their daughter. A few months after she started sex work, Liana heard about HIV and tried getting tested. But was turned away two times by healthcare workers, who often do not understand the disease and are afraid of getting infected themselves. Liana tested positive last year after falling ill and is now on AIDS drugs, which cost her 30,000 Indonesian rupiah ($3.5) a month as they are subsidized. Until today, she doesn\u2019t know how she became infected. Her 4-year-old daughter is uninfected. \u201cThinking it over, I\u2019m not lacking in education. But how is it that I never heard of this disease nor how to prevent it? Why does the government not spread the information,\u201d said Liana, a graduate of an East Java university who now insists all her clients use condoms. \u201cHow can we prevent HIV/AIDS if we can\u2019t use the only protection that we have? There is no cure for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), but drugs can help to control the replication of the virus and prolong life. While Liana uses condoms, she says many of her friends do not as they are tempted by offers of more cash from clients who don\u2019t want to practice safe sex. They are also afraid they may be thrown in jail if police find condoms on them. Health Minister Endang Sedyaningsih told Reuters the government faced enormous opposition in the fight against AIDS in this country of 238 million people. \u201cWe cannot put ads for condoms openly on television or promote their use, or people will say the Ministry of Health promotes promiscuity,\u201d she said in a recent interview. Islam is the dominant religion in Indonesia and society remains largely conservative. \u201cWe have a program for methadone substitution and clean needle exchange (for drug users) but it\u2019s very difficult to expand it as it is seen as legalizing narcotics use.\u201d   Indonesia\u2019s approach is in sharp contrast to the aggressive interventions taken in nearby Thailand, which implemented a high-profile \u201c100 percent condom use campaign\u201d in the early 1990s to rein in an explosive HIV epidemic. That campaign was hugely successful and brought down drastically new HIV infection rates particularly in young men. The disease, which has killed 4,539 people so far in Indonesia, used to be spread mainly by injecting drug users. Eight out of 10 addicts have HIV. But in 2010, 65 percent of newly confirmed HIV infections came through unsafe heterosexual sex between sex workers and clients, who went on to infect their wives or girlfriends. The government estimates there are 200,000 female sex workers in the country and a male clientele of up to 3 million. Only 10 to 15 percent of clients use condoms. A sharp jump in mother-to-fetus HIV infections is one of the clearest signs that the AIDS epidemic may be moving from particularly vulnerable groups, such as injecting drug users and sex workers, into the general population. These perinatal infections made up 3 percent of all newly confirmed HIV cases in 2010, up from 0.2 percent in the 1990s. \u201cThis means that HIV transmission within the family is increasing ... If we have no new approach for HIV prevention within the family, it (the HIV epidemic) may become generalized. We should think out of the box to protect the family from AIDS,\u201d said Inang Winarso, assistant deputy secretary of the National AIDS Commission for program coordination. When HIV/AIDS becomes generalized and widespread, as in many parts of Africa, it takes a huge toll on countries, draining them of resources and economic productivity. In many parts of Asia, HIV has made a comeback in recent years among vulnerable groups. Governments and concerned groups in China, Hong Kong, Australia and Cambodia are battling hard to contain the epidemic. Through the use of high-profile campaigns, sometimes even involving state leaders as in China, they push hard for the use of condoms and clean needles to prevent the disease from spreading into the general community. But such high-profile interventions cannot be adopted in conservative Indonesia. Winarso, who was involved in a successful campaign against HIV transmission among gay and bisexual men, hopes to stop the virus from spreading among sex workers through empowering the women, quietly. \u201cIn every story that was told to me, nobody said they liked or that they trained to be sex workers. They all started because of trafficking or because of poverty, but they have no awareness that they are victims,\u201d he said. Winarso and his colleagues plan to reach out to sex workers in a pilot project in Semarang in East Java. \u201cWe will visit brothels, we will avoid the pimps. We will spread awareness, get them to tell us their stories, so that they realize they are victims, and continue to be victims under their pimps,\u201d said Winarso. \u201cHow do they fight? They need to fight their customers (for condom use) and they must fight the government to provide them with jobs.\u201d   The World Health Organization estimates there are 300,000 people in Indonesia living with HIV/AIDS, with the worst affected places being Jakarta and Papua province, where 2.3 percent of the population is infected. Some 50,000 HIV patients require drugs but only 20,000 are getting them. \u201cThere are several reasons: no access and shortage of drugs even though there are 200 (HIV drug distribution) sites all over the country,\u201d said Khanchit Limpakarnjanarat, the WHO\u2019s representative in Indonesia. The WHO has a 10-member team in Indonesia and one of its missions is to train medical personnel in treating HIV patients. \u201cWe need to strengthen the healthcare system in terms of human resources ... To provide HIV services requires human resources, like counseling and testing. Drug treatment is complicated. These remain a challenge,\u201d he said.

This next-generation device has been approved in Europe and is now under U.S. regulatory review. Abbott\u2019s plans for Libre, its fastest-growing diabetes product, used by 1.5 million people worldwide, will be in focus when the company reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Jared Watkin, Abbott\u2019s senior vice president for Diabetes Care, said in an interview that scale is a \u201chuge part\u201d of the company\u2019s strategy for its glucose monitors. \u201cWhen you\u2019re making disposable diagnostic products, the more you can make, the lower the cost you can produce them at.\u201d  While the Libre 2 has more features, including alarms for when blood sugar levels swing too low or high, Abbott plans to keep the U.S. price the same as its predecessor, Watkin said. Abbott started in diabetes care as a maker of inexpensive test strips and glucose meters. More recently, the company has sought to expand access to its so-called continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices - traditionally sold to type 1 diabetics in markets with generous insurance coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to bring this to a small, wealthy population. Diabetes is such a global epidemic that you need to bring products that can really make a dent in that,\u201d Watkin said. Launched in Europe in 2014 and in the United States three years later, the FreeStyle Libre allows people with diabetes to track blood sugar levels without multiple daily finger sticks. A sensor attached to the back of the upper arm uses a thin filament under the skin to measure glucose every minute. Users check their blood sugar levels throughout the day by waving a reader, or smartphone, over the sensor. Major competitors Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) and Dexcom Inc (DXCM.O) critique the current Libre\u2019s lack of automatic alerts that can help diabetics manage their disease. Yet they also are taking steps to introduce cheaper models themselves, executives told Reuters. Libre\u2019s sales are expected to reach $1.5 billion this year, the company said. In April, Goldman Sachs estimated the global CGM market could reach $5 billion by 2021, up from $3.7 billion in 2019. Goldman projected Abbott\u2019s 2021 sales at $2.7 billion compared to $1.7 billion for Dexcom and $894 million for Medtronic. In the past, CGMs were used almost exclusively by type 1 diabetics, whose bodies do not make insulin and who must inject themselves with the blood-sugar regulating hormone to survive. Increasingly, people with type 2 diabetes - the kind driven by obesity, lack of exercise and genetics - must also closely monitor their blood glucose and use insulin to manage their disease when it is not controlled by other medications and lifestyle changes. For now, Libre users include 1 million type 1 diabetic patients and half a million type 2. That\u2019s a tiny sliver of the 425 million people with diabetes worldwide. Although not all diabetics need glucose monitors, \u201cthere is an element of scratching the surface at this point,\u201d Watkin said. \u201cThe need to invest and bring up capacity is, we believe, going to be an ongoing activity for us.\u201d   Two 14-day Libre sensors, a month\u2019s supply, retail for $109. Abbott says most of its patients are commercially insured, and many pay as little as $10 out of pocket. In the United States, the company says, more than half of people in commercial health plans are covered, as well as any eligible diabetic person on Medicare, the federal program for the elderly and disabled. The device is also approved in 45 other countries, including Germany, Japan, Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates. Medtronic told Reuters it offers a discounted price of $345 per month for uninsured patients. The company estimates that the typical insured patient pays $50 a month. Medicare does not cover the device. Dexcom\u2019s G6 sensors retail online, with a discount, at around $350 for a month\u2019s supply. Dexcom says 98 percent of all U.S. private insurers cover the device, and patients covered by commercial insurance pay an average of $50-$80 per month for sensors through pharmacies or durable medical equipment suppliers. It is covered by Medicare. Libre\u2019s 14-day sensor is also longer-lasting. Dexcom\u2019s sensors work for 10 days, and Medtronic\u2019s for up to 7. Abbott was also the first company to introduce a product that can be used without routine finger stick tests to validate the sensor\u2019s readings \u2013 a feature Dexcom later matched and Medtronic has not. Dr. Roy Beck, an endocrinologist at the Jaeb Center for Health Research in Tampa, Florida, said that Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre is \u201can excellent sensor\u201d but not as accurate at detecting very low blood sugar as the devices from Dexcom, Medtronic or an implantable CGM made by Senseonics (SENS.A). That makes it less desirable for patients for whom this is a major issue, he said. Beck\u2019s center has received research funding from Abbott and Dexcom. Medtronic and Dexcom executives say the current Libre does not compare with their devices when it comes to features such as alerting users to dangerous blood sugar changes and providing comprehensive trend data. \u201cIt\u2019s the cheapest, but it\u2019s not exactly in the same category,\u201d said Mike Hill, vice president and general manager of Medtronic\u2019s sensor business. Abbott countered that its sensor has best-in-class accuracy, and noted that the next-generation Libre 2 does have optional alarms. Still, Medtronic is considering making a cheaper sensor for patients who don\u2019t need all the features of its current continuous monitor, Hill said. And next year, Dexcom plans to launch a cheaper, smaller, 14-day sensor developed in partnership with Verily, Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) life sciences division. Dexcom Chief Executive Kevin Sayer acknowledged that Abbott\u2019s pricing strategy will affect the global market over time, and that Dexcom expects its own prices to come down. \u201cWe\u2019ve planned for this,\u201d he said.

Lotrel, a pill combining two blood pressure drugs in one, was so effective at preventing heart attacks and other problems in a clinical trial that the study was stopped early, and its findings may change the way hypertension is treated, U.S. researchers said on Monday. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson The study compared the use of two different combinations of blood pressure drugs to see if combination pills could help patients get better control of their hypertension. While both pills helped control blood pressure, people who took the Novartis AG drug Lotrel \u2014 a pill containing an angiotensin-converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitor plus a calcium channel blocker \u2014 had 20 percent fewer heart events such as heart attacks and strokes than those who took an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, or \u201cwater pill,\u201d combination. \u201cFor the 73 million patients in America with high blood pressure, we offer a new option to reduce heart attacks, strokes and heart-related death by 20 percent,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Jamerson of the University of Michigan, who presented his findings at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago. He said the findings challenge current national guidelines for the treatment of high blood pressure, which call for patients who need medication to start out on a single pill, usually a diuretic, and to add other drugs only as needed. \u201cWe found a different strategy could reduce cardiovascular risk,\u201d Jamerson said in an interview. In all, 10,700 volunteers took a single tablet that includes two drugs. Both pills contained the ACE inhibitor benazepril, known by the brand name Lotensin. Lotrel combines benazepril with amlodipine besylate, the active ingredient in Pfizer Inc\u2019s calcium channel blocker Norvasc. In the other, benazepril was combined with hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic used to treat high blood pressure and fluid retention.

It\u2019s not that dexamethasone is especially expensive (it isn\u2019t \u2014 though the cost isn\u2019t necessarily negligible), but that cost needs to be addressed. Readers are simply given no information about cost. The release explains that the overall pool of 140 patients was split into four groups: Group One did not receive dexamethasone and was under \u201cdeep\u201d anesthesia; Group Two did not receive dexamethasone and was under \u201csuperficial\u201d anesthesia; Group Three received dexamethasone before surgery and was under \u201cdeep\u201d anesthesia; Group Four received dexamethasone before surgery and was under \u201csuperficial\u201d anesthesia. Got all that? The release tells readers that patients in Group Four had a 15.3 percent incidence rate of POCD immediately after surgery, and that none of the Group Four patients had POCD six months after surgery. We\u2019re glad that the release provides a specific, quantified benefit. However, the release does not give readers the information they need to understand what that number means. For example, what was the POCD incidence rate for any of the other groups immediately after surgery? What was the incidence rate for other groups after six months? What does the literature have to say about how common POCD is for patients in this age range and receiving this type of surgery? Without any of that information, it is impossible for readers to determine whether a 15.3 percent incidence rate of POCD is good or bad. While the release refers in general to the risks inherent with both deep and superficial anesthesia, it does not mention any of the potential side effects associated with its recommended intervention, dexamethasone. And there is no shortage of information on dexamethasone available. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine\u2019s Medline Plus page on dexamethasone, the drug\u2019s side effects range from vomiting to insomnia to depression. The page indicates that dexamethasone may also interact with a\u00a0 variety of other widely-used drugs. In addition, giving patients steroids, of which\u00a0dexamethasone is one, increases the risk of infection or worsening severity of existing infections. We don\u2019t expect a release to provide an exhaustive list of side effects, but acknowledging that there are known risks associated with the drug is important. The release explains that \u201cThe researchers evaluated 140 patients aged between 60 and 87 who underwent surgery under propofol-induced general anesthesia at the Central Institute of Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas, FM-USP\u2019s teaching hospital, in most cases for removal of gallstones.\u201d The release further explains that patients were divided into four groups (as we described above, under the Benefits section), and defines what constitutes \u201cdeep\u201d anesthesia and \u201csuperficial\u201d anesthesia. Those are all good things. However, the release would have been much stronger if it had done three things. First, it should have made clear that all of the surgeries were non-cardiac, non-neurological surgeries. Given how common these surgeries \u2014 particularly cardiac ones \u2014 are for older patients, this is an important point. Second, the release should have made it more clear that the benefits observed were based on one group (i.e., Group Four) of only 32 patients. This is a preliminary finding, and that needs to be stressed. Third, while the release tells readers that the anesthetic used was propofol, it doesn\u2019t tell readers how common or widely-used this drug is as a surgical anesthetic. That would be valuable context. The release does not engage in disease mongering. The release does not explicitly note who funded the study. However, the study does not appear to have received any external funding. According to the ClinicalTrials.gov page for the study, the work was sponsored primarily by the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and Duke University (where the authors work), with additional support from the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (or S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation), which is public. It\u2019s not unusual for universities to avoid mentioning funding for projects that they funded themselves. But it would have been a stronger release if it didn\u2019t leave readers wondering who paid for the work. Frankly, there\u2019s not a lot of research out there on steps to pro-actively reduce rates of cognitive dysfunction after anesthesia, and we\u2019re not aware of alternative interventions designed to do so. It\u2019s clear from the release that the relevant tools involved in this particular intervention \u2014 the use of dexamethasone and avoidance of \u201cdeep\u201d anesthesia \u2014 are currently available. However, as noted above, this is a relatively small study, and we suspect that more research would be needed before this approach was considered for widespread clinical practice. Since we already dinged it for that point earlier, we\u2019ll give it a satisfactory here. It\u2019s clear from the release that this is a new (and, ergo, novel) approach addressing a well-established problem. The release uses responsible language to discuss the findings, although it could have been more clear about the preliminary nature of the work. A larger study is almost certainly called for on this intervention. We do have some concerns over the use of the acronym \u201cPOCD\u201d to describe cognitive dysfunction following anesthesia. It appears to be a coined medical term that few clinicians use. Claim: Simple measures can reduce post-operative cognitive dysfunction in older patients", "output": "This news release focuses on a recent article published in the journal PLOS ONE, reporting that the use of the corticosteroid dexamethasone and avoiding \u201cdeep\u201d or \u201cprofound\u201d anesthesia during surgery can reduce the incidence of post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in older patients. However, the release does not give readers any context for understanding the reduced incidence of cognitive dysfunction after anesthesia, and does not discuss costs or potential harms associated with dexamethasone use. POCD is not uncommon. A 2014 literature survey paper found that 41.4 percent of patients age 60 or older who had major surgery (other than cardiac surgery) were exhibiting symptoms of POCD when discharged from the hospital. Three months later, 12.7 percent of those older adults were still experiencing POCD. But older adults aren\u2019t the only ones affected; more than 30 percent of adults under the age of 60 also experience POCD after major surgeries. And in addition to being fairly common, POCD can have a significant impact on a patient\u2019s health, quality of life and recovery. A major issue for older adults who have cognitive issues after surgery is their ability to care for themselves. All of these factors make POCD prevention a subject of public interest. However, as with any health-related research news, the costs, benefits and risks need to be clearly outlined.

REUTERS/Darren Whiteside German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim failed to convince an expert panel that its pill increased sexual desire enough to win approval. \u201cThe efficacy was not sufficiently robust to justify the risks,\u201d said Dr. Julia Johnson, the panel\u2019s chairwoman and head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Women reported depression, fainting, fatigue and other problems in company studies of the drug known chemically as flibanserin. The once-a-day pill, taken at bedtime, is the latest attempt to find a female counterpart to Pfizer Inc\u2019s Viagra, the blockbuster blue pill for men. Drugmakers have been searching for a medicine to improve women\u2019s sex lives since Viagra successfully debuted 12 years ago. The market for a \u201cpink Viagra\u201d could stretch into the billions of dollars. But some doctors and advocates worry that pharmaceutical companies are playing on women\u2019s insecurities to convince them they need a pill to improve their sex lives. \u201cLow sexual desire is not a disease,\u201d said Leonore Tiefer, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York University, reading to the advisers from a petition opposing approval of flibanserin. The Food and Drug Administration will make the final decision on whether to approve the pill and usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Privately held Boehringer wants clearance to sell its pill by prescription for premenopausal women with a persistent, bothersome and unexplained lack of sex drive. \u201cWomen deserve the option to choose a safe and effective pharmacological therapy for this distressing condition,\u201d said Dr. Anita Clayton, a Boehringer consultant and psychiatry professor at the University of Virginia. The drug, originally developed as an antidepressant, is believed to act on brain chemicals thought to play a role in sexual response, the company said. But the advisory committee of seven women and four men voted 11-0 that the drug\u2019s risks and benefits were unacceptable and 10-1 that effectiveness data was lacking. FDA reviewers, speaking before the panel voted, said flibanserin failed to increase sexual desire as measured by women\u2019s daily diary entries in two company studies. Boehringer said another analysis, based on a survey of women\u2019s responses, showed a jump in sex drive and lower distress levels with the drug. Women also reported slightly more satisfying sexual experiences \u2014 an average of 4.5 per month compared with 2.8 before taking the medicine. For placebo patients, the rate rose to 3.7 during the six-month studies. Nearly 15 percent of women stopped taking flibanserin before the study ended due to possible side effects. Boehringer said most of the reported problems were mild. Panel members, however, said they were worried women would take the drug for months or years with unknown risks. \u201cLong-term use needs to be better evaluated,\u201d said Dr. Kathleen Hoeger, a panelist and associate professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The drug\u2019s proposed brand name is Girosa. It is not yet approved anywhere in the world. \u201cWe are disappointed with the advisory committee\u2019s recommendations and will work with the FDA to address questions raised,\u201d Dr. Christopher Corsico, Boehringer\u2019s U.S. medical director, said in a statement. While the committee voted against the drug, members encouraged Boehringer and others to continue pursuing sex medications for women. \u201cIndeed this is a significant need for women, and finding a medicine that will benefit women is critical,\u201d Johnson said. Drugmakers have tested various ways to boost female libido, but women\u2019s sex lives have proved difficult to target with medication. Male impotence pills including Viagra work by widening blood vessels to increase the blood flow needed for an erection. Pfizer dropped tests of Viagra in females in 2004 after studies failed to show it helped women. That same year, an FDA advisory panel voted in 2004 against recommending approval for a testosterone patch made by Procter & Gamble Co, citing a lack of evidence for long-term safety. The patch was approved in Europe and has been sold to Warner Chilcott. Another U.S. drugmaker, BioSante, is developing a testosterone skin gel to treat a decline in libido in menopausal women. The company estimates the U.S. market for treating female sexual dysfunction tops $2 billion annually.

The Irish health authority (HSE) has launched an inquiry into the death, which has reopened a decades-long debate over whether the government should legislate to explicitly allow abortion when the health of a mother is at risk. Activists in the overwhelmingly Catholic country, which has some of the world\u2019s most restrictive laws on abortion, say the refusal by doctors to terminate the pregnancy earlier may have contributed to Halappanavar\u2019s death. \u201cA vibrant, healthy woman starting her family life has died needlessly ... because of the failure of successive governments to deal with this issue,\u201d independent member of parliament Clare Daly told the crowd, which responded with chants of \u201cshame.\u201d  Irish law does not specify exactly when the threat to the life or health of the mother is high enough to justify a termination, leaving doctors to decide. Critics say this means doctors\u2019 personal beliefs can play a role. Despite a dramatic waning of the influence of the Catholic Church, which dominated politics in Ireland until the 1980s, successive governments have been loath to legislate on an issue they fear could alienate conservative voters. Prime Minister Enda Kenny, whose ruling Fine Gael party made an election pledge not to introduce new laws allowing abortion, on Friday said he would not be rushed into a decision on the issue. Halappanavar was admitted to hospital in severe pain on October 21 and asked for a termination after doctors told her the baby would not survive, according to her husband Praveen. The foetus was surgically removed when its heartbeat stopped days later, but her family believes the delay contributed to the blood poisoning that killed Halappanavar on October 28. \u201cI just feel outrage,\u201d said Mary Sheehan, a midwife in her 50s, who took part in the march with a sign that read \u201cVatican Republic killed Savita. \u201cI want the message to out her parents that the Irish people are demanding change.\u201d  The crowd also targeted the government\u2019s junior coalition partner, the Labour Party, which is more socially liberal, for not doing more to force change on the issue, chanting \u201cshame on Labour.\u201d Claim: Irish rally for government action on abortion.", "output": "At least 5,000 people marched to the offices of Ireland\u2019s socially conservative prime minister on Saturday to call for clearer guidelines on abortion following the death of a woman denied a termination.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

Environmentalists and Senate Democrats have vehemently opposed Dourson, a toxicologist with close ties to the chemical industry. That means only one more Republican \u201cno\u201d vote would likely be needed to torpedo his nomination. Moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters Thursday she is also leaning against supporting Dourson, but has not yet made a final decision. The White House and EPA did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday or Thursday. Despite the fact he hasn\u2019t yet been confirmed by the Senate, Dourson has already been working at the agency as a senior adviser to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. The agency\u2019s press office did not respond to emails seeking how much he is being paid. The Associated Press reported in September that Dourson has for years accepted payments for criticizing studies that raised concerns about the safety of his clients\u2019 products, according to a review of financial records and his published work. Past corporate clients of Dourson and of a research group he ran include Dow Chemical Co., Koch Industries Inc. and Chevron Corp. His research has also been underwritten by industry trade and lobbying groups representing the makers of plastics, pesticides, processed foods and cigarettes. Burr and Tillis, both of whom are considered reliably pro-business conservatives, cited Dourson\u2019s past work and worries among their home-state constituents about tainted drinking water in opposing his nomination. \u201cOver the last several weeks, Senator Tillis has done his due diligence in reviewing Mr. Dourson\u2019s body of work,\u201d said a statement from Tillis\u2019 office. \u201cSenator Tillis still has serious concerns about his record and cannot support his nomination.\u201d Marine veterans and their families blame decades-old contamination of wells at a North Carolina base with solvents and dry-cleaning chemicals for infant deaths and serious health problems that include cancer. More recently, concerns have been raised about undisclosed discharges of chemicals used to manufacture Teflon and GoreTex into the Cape Fear River, a source of municipal drinking water for Wilmington and other southeastern North Carolina communities. Dourson worked at the EPA for more than a decade, leaving in 1994 as the manager at a lab that assessed the health risks of exposure to chemicals. The following year, he founded Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment, a private toxicity evaluation nonprofit organization that tests chemicals and produces reports on which chemicals are hazardous in what quantities. Dourson\u2019s views toward industry are consistent with others Trump has selected as top federal regulators. Among them is Pruitt, who in March overruled the findings of his agency\u2019s own scientists to reverse an effort to ban chlorpyrifos, one of the nation\u2019s most widely used pesticides. Court records show Dourson and his work have often been called on when his corporate clients are seeking to fend off lawsuits. DuPont was accused of polluting a West Virginia town with Perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, a chemical that the company\u2019s internal tests had long ago concluded was toxic. Corporate officials discussed hiring Dourson as part of a strategy to defend themselves. Dourson led a team that found in 2002 that PFOA levels up to 150 parts per billion were safe, a level higher than was found in testing of 188 private wells and springs. That was also well above the 1 part per billion that Dupont\u2019s own scientists had concluded could be considered safe years before. The EPA now says that only 70 parts per trillion of PFOA are acceptable \u2014 or only 0.05 percent of what Dourson\u2019s team said was safe. DuPont and a former subsidiary, Chemours Co., later paid $761 million to settle 3,550 lawsuits stemming from its use of the chemical. Chemours is the company whose spills of a chemical called GenX, a replacement for PFOA, are now at issue in North Carolina\u2019s Cape Fear River. \u201cI will not be supporting the nomination of Michael Dourson,\u201d said Burr, the state\u2019s senior senator. \u201cWith his record and our state\u2019s history of contamination at Camp Lejeune as well as the current GenX water issues in Wilmington, I am not confident he is the best choice for our country.\u201d The stand was quickly praised by environmental advocacy groups that rarely find common ground with the two Tarheel Republicans. \u201cNo one who has spent decades arguing on behalf of the chemical industry for weaker safety standards should be charged with reviewing chemicals for the EPA,\u201d said Scott Faber, a senior vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. \u201cIt would be like putting an arsonist in charge of the fire department.\u201d ___ Follow Associated Press environmental reporter Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck Claim: Trump EPA nominee opposed by GOP senators from NC.", "output": "North Carolina\u2019s two Republican senators say they oppose President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to oversee chemical safety at the Environmental Protection Agency, putting Michael L.

UCB has also yet to convince regulators its would-be  blockbuster Cimzia should be cleared for treating the bowel  disorder Crohn\u2019s disease.

Furthermore, Trump\u2019s initiative represents significant continuity of, rather than a departure from, the previous two administrations. Although every detail and working of the new initiative has not yet been outlined, it certainly does not represent a radical change. Trump\u2019s White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative bears a striking resemblance to the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, which George W. Bush set up in 2001, and which Barack Obama continued during his administration but renamed the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. In brief, Trump\u2019s executive order \u2014 which he signed on 3 May 2018, the National Day of Prayer \u2014 replaces the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships with the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative, keeping it within the Executive Office of the President of the United States. The executive order also sets out the following: Beyond that, Trump\u2019s order is somewhat vague on the exact workings of the initiative and the duties of the advisor who will lead it: One potentially significant provision in the executive order calls for those in charge of the Faith and Opportunity Initiative to contact the Attorney General if they see potential executive branch violations of a religious liberty memorandum published by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October 2017. The Sessions memorandum reiterated the positions set out by Trump in an earlier\u00a0executive order, in which the President wrote: It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce Federal law\u2019s robust protections for religious freedom\u2026. All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law, respect and protect the freedom of persons and organizations to engage in religious and political speech. President Trump has prioritized enhancing legal protections for religious freedom, including when it comes to obligations placed on faith-based organizations that receive federal funding, the freedom of employers and employees to abstain from practices (particularly in health care) which they feel compromise their religious beliefs, and in calling for an end to the Johnson Amendment, a long-standing provision that bars religious 501 (c)(3) non-profit groups from engaging in electoral activism. In his 2001 executive order establishing the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, President George W. Bush emphasized that a driving force behind the policy was a desire to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d in the disbursement of federal funding, and enhance the funding opportunities available for religious non-profit organizations\u00a0\u2014 especially those focused on poverty, addiction, crime and other social issues: The paramount goal is compassionate results, and private and charitable community groups, including religious ones, should have the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on a level playing field, so long as they achieve valid public purposes, such as curbing crime, conquering addiction, strengthening families and neighborhoods, and overcoming poverty. This delivery of social services must be results oriented and should value the bedrock principles of pluralism, nondiscrimination, evenhandedness, and neutrality. The Occupy Democrats meme is largely accurate. In May 2018, Trump did indeed establish an initiative within the White House which would give faith-based organizations what the administration\u00a0called a \u201cvoice in the White House.\u201d However, the description of the initiative as a \u201creligious office\u201d did not come from the Trump administration itself, and that is not its official name. Furthermore, Trump\u2019s 2018 initiative represents significant continuity from predecessor offices set up by George W. Bush in 2001 and Barack Obama in 2009, although the exact focus, workings, and influence of Trump\u2019s initiative remain to be seen. On 5 May, the \u201cBeing Liberal\u201d Facebook page and web site published an article with the headline \u201cTrump quietly signed an Executive Order allowing government to fund religious groups.\u201d This is very misleading, and ignores the fact that the federal government has been providing grants, funding and tax write-offs to religious non-profit organizations for many years, including during the Obama administration. Trump\u2019s creation of the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative did not usher in that state of affairs.

Most internet users, however, have probably heard of Koepcke in the form of an internet meme featuring a photograph supposedly showing the 17-year-old plane crash survivor and a short piece of text summarizing her story:  17 year-old Juliane Koepcke was sucked out of an airplane in 1971 after it was struck by a bolt of lightning. She fell 2 miles to the ground, strapped to her seat and survived after she endured 10 days in the Amazon Jungle While the story of Koepcke is undoubtedly true, we have a few unanswered questions about this photograph. This image most likely doesn\u2019t show Koepcke, but an actress from the 1974 movie about Koepcke, \u201cMiracles Still Happen.\u201d On Christmas Eve, 1971, Koepcke boarded LANSA Flight 508 (a Lockheed L-188A Electra turboprop plane) with her mother and 84 other passengers. The flight left from Lima, Peru, and was scheduled to land in Pucallpa, Peru, but was struck by a bolt of lighting. The plane went into a nose dive, broke into pieces, and Koepcke, who was still strapped to her seat, soon found herself outside of the plane plummeting approximately 9,000 feet (about 1.7 miles) into the Amazon jungle. Koepcke talked to the BBC about the ordeal in 2012: When we saw lightning around the plane, I was scared. My mother and I held hands but we were unable to speak. Other passengers began to cry and weep and scream. After about 10 minutes, I saw a very bright light on the outer engine on the left. My mother said very calmly: \u201cThat is the end, it\u2019s all over.\u201d Those were the last words I ever heard from her. The plane jumped down and went into a nose-dive. It was pitch black and people were screaming, then the deep roaring of the engines filled my head completely. Suddenly the noise stopped and I was outside the plane. I was in a freefall, strapped to my seat bench and hanging head-over-heels. The whispering of the wind was the only noise I could hear. I felt completely alone. I could see the canopy of the jungle spinning towards me. Then I lost consciousness and remember nothing of the impact. Later I learned that the plane had broken into pieces about two miles above the ground. I woke the next day and looked up into the canopy. The first thought I had was: \u201cI survived an air crash.\u201d Koepcke was seriously injured in the fall. She broke her collar bone, had deep cuts on her arms and legs, and had torn a ligament in her knee that made it difficult for her to walk. If there was one thing Koepcke had on her side, it was the fact that she had some experience in the jungle. Her parents worked at a research station in the Amazon and in the year before the crash where she \u201clearned a lot about life in the rainforest\u201d and found that it wasn\u2019t the \u201cgreen hell that the world always thinks.\u201d Koepcke spent 10 days alone in the jungle. She traveled down a small stream, thinking that it was her safest option, and eventually came across a boat and a path leading into the rainforest. Koepcke, who said that she was almost too weak to walk by the end of the ordeal, pushed forward into the jungle until she found a small hut. After cleaning her wounds with gasoline, she fell asleep. The next day, she was found by villagers and soon thereafter was rescued:\u00a0 By the 10th day I couldn\u2019t stand properly and I drifted along the edge of a larger river I had found. I felt so lonely, like I was in a parallel universe far away from any human being. I thought I was hallucinating when I saw a really large boat. When I went to touch it and realised it was real, it was like an adrenaline shot. But [then I saw] there was a small path into the jungle where I found a hut with a palm leaf roof, an outboard motor and a litre of gasoline. I had a wound on my upper right arm. It was infested with maggots about one centimetre long. I remembered our dog had the same infection and my father had put kerosene in it, so I sucked the gasoline out and put it into the wound. The pain was intense as the maggots tried to get further into the wound. I pulled out about 30 maggots and was very proud of myself. I decided to spend the night there. The next day I heard the voices of several men outside. It was like hearing the voices of angels. The crash of Lansa Flight 508 is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for having the \u201cHighest death toll (91) caused by lightning (in-flight).\u201d While Koepcke was the only person to ultimately survive the ordeal, there\u2019s evidence that some other passengers (including Koepcke\u2019s mother) survived the initial crash. They were unable to seek out help as the teen had, however, and perished before rescue crews arrived.

Bart Stupak's announcement hours before the final vote that an agreement had been reached on the abortion issue marked a momentous shift. For weeks, Stupak insisted he and a group of other abortion foes in the House could not support the Senate bill because it would result in federal funding of abortions, contrary to longstanding federal policy. But on the afternoon of March 21, 2010, Stupak said in a news conference that the promise of an executive order on abortion from President Barack Obama convinced him \"\"there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation.\"\" Stupak's comments several hours later on the House floor provided some of the most emotionally charged moments of the late-night health care debate. \"\"It is the Democrats who, through the president's executive order, ensure that the sanctity of life is protected,\"\" Stupak said. His comments were interrupted by catcalls from the bill's Republican opponents, one of whom was heard to yell \"\"baby killer!\"\" Texas Republican Rep. Randy Neugebauer later said he was the one who shouted. But he said he yelled \"\"It's a baby killer,\"\" referring not to Stupak (to whom he apologized), but to the agreement Stupak helped forge with the president. The abortion issue in the health care reform debate has been thorny from the start. From early on, legislators on both sides of the abortion issue professed a desire to maintain the status quo on abortion in the health care bill. But that quickly proved difficult, if not impossible. Here's why: Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military. But the health care reform bill proposes a health care exchange in which private insurance companies could compete for the business of people who do not get their insurance through an employer. The question then: Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do)? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? In the House, Stupak helped add an amendment that bars anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. The amendment does let them choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without using federal subsidies. And those who accept subsidies can still buy an abortion \"\"rider\"\" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money. The Senate took a different tack. The Senate language on abortion, written by an abortion opponent, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., would allow companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson inserted measures to ensure abortion services would be paid through patient premiums, not federal subsidies. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill requires that anyone who selects a plan that covers abortion must pay $1 a month toward a segregated fund that would pay for abortion services. One plan in every state exchange must offer coverage that does not include abortions, so there would be an option for those who morally object to $1 of their premiums going toward abortion services. Legislators supporting the bill -- along with President Obama -- insist that segregation of funds stays  to the Hyde Amendment restriction on federal funds for abortions. The Senate bill's proposal on abortion is opposed by activists on both sides of the abortion issue. Abortion rights groups like NARAL Pro Choice America, the National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood all put out statements denouncing the requirement that policy owners or their employers write separate checks -- one for abortion services and one for everything else. NARAL called the provision \"\"unacceptable bureaucratic stigmatization (that) could cause insurance carriers to drop abortion coverage, even though more than 85 percent of private plans currently cover this care for women.\"\" Abortion foes like the National Right to Life Committee and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops also vehemently opposed the Senate bill's abortion language, arguing that if you send federal subsidies to a person who then chooses a plan that cover abortions, that's federal funding of abortion. They called the plan to segregate money so that abortions are paid only through premiums -- not government subsidies -- nothing more than a bookkeeping scheme. Until March 21, 2010, that was Stupak's consistent position. In a Fox News interview on March 17, 2010, Stupak said of the Senate bill, \"\"It is very clear that abortion is, for the first time ever, a funded benefit by the federal government.\"\" So, what changed on Sunday that prompted Stupak to say \"\"there will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation\"\"? In the hours leading up to the vote, he and several other antiabortion Democrats in the House agreed to back the health bill after Obama promised to sign an executive order reinforcing the commitment that no federal funds would be used for abortions. The Senate bill already spelled out strict payment and accounting requirements to accomplish that, but Obama's executive order went one step further, putting the president's weight behind specific measures to ensure that funds are properly segregated. By our reading, the order mostly restates and reinforces the intent of the Senate bill. But it doesn't fundamentally change the fact that people getting government subsidies for health care will be able to buy a policy on the exchange that covers abortions. That's why some abortion foes -- not all -- believe Stupak essentially traded his vote for a handful of beans. \"\"It was issued for political effect,\"\" said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. \"\"We don't see any value in the order.\"\" We don't think Rep. Stupak can credibly claim one day that the bill is federal funding of abortions, and then the next day, after getting the agreement on the executive order,\u00a0that it does not. Stupak's issue all along was that if federal subsidies went to someone who could then choose a plan that covers abortions, that was federal funding for abortion. And that hasn't changed. The president's order spells out safeguards to ensure the funds are segregated. But if you thought that was a bookkeeping trick before, there's nothing in the executive order that would change your mind. At the climax of the health care debate from the floor, House Republican Leader John Boehner said that even with the executive order from the president, the Senate bill would provide \"\"taxpayer funding of abortions for the first time in 30 years.\"\" We don't agree. It's understandable that abortion foes\u00a0opposed\u00a0a proposal that gives more people the opportunity to obtain insurance that cover abortions. But it's another thing to say those abortion services would be paid with federal dollars. The Senate bill states very clearly that public funding through tax credits and government subsidies for elective abortion services offered in the exchange is prohibited. But more than that, the bill sets up a mechanism to ensure that abortion services offered in the exchange are paid entirely from patient premiums, premiums paid by people who have chosen a private plan that covers abortion. The executive order puts the weight of the president's word behind providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled. We think that's enough to back up Stupak's claim, \"\"There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation.\"\" But that's a conclusion we reached before the president promised an executive order, back when Stupak disagreed with us and insisted the bill would have had federal dollars subsidizing abortions. We don't understand how the executive order changes Stupak's logic on this issue, but no matter how\u00a0he arrived as his conclusion, we think he's right now. And we rule his claim .\" Claim: There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation.", "output": "Stupak revises abortion stance on health care bill, citing Obama's executive order", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

However, it would require medical oversight and perhaps other alternative pain treatments, both of which aren\u2019t free. We\u2019re told that with tapering, based on the literature review, \u201cpatients on average saw improved pain, function, and quality of life.\u201d But what do those terms mean,\u00a0exactly, and how much of an improvement on those criteria \u2014 numbers-wise \u2014 are we talking about here? Readers aren\u2019t told. Some numbers would have helped readers make more sense of what \u201cimproved\u201d means. The harms are addressed right away: Come off opioids too quickly, and patients can suffer by having little recourse to deal with chronic pain. Some even resort to illicit drugs or commit suicide. One of the study\u2019s authors is also quoted as recommending doctors and patients to exercise caution if tapering is being attempted, and another explains that not all patients respond the same way (and do poorly with tapering). This article does a thorough job of laying out the study\u2019s design, discussing what it found, and what its flaws might be. The author, in fact, dedicated several paragraphs to hedging the study\u2019s conclusions by walking readers through its hang-ups, including its reliance on small studies with sometimes poor methodologies. The self-selecting nature of the subjects in those studies is also described\u2014 i.e. only those who volunteered to taper off opioids were studied, not people who didn\u2019t want to go off opioids. We didn\u2019t see any gratuitous wording about the opioid epidemic or treating painkiller addiction in this story. A refreshing number of outside experts are quoted or cited in this story, and their remarks weren\u2019t the typical \u201cthe study was intriguing\u201d variety. Their quotes added some helpful context, such as how long it can take doctors to wean people off opioids (\u201cmonths or even years\u201d) and how everyone responds differently to tapering \u2014 and how some do poorly with it. This is one of the appreciable strengths of the story. It not only implies going cold-turkey as an option (and the pitfalls of that approach), but also digs into the topic of non-opioid pain-relief treatments to help patients deal with chronic pain as people they taper. We\u2019re also told how such\u00a0treatments\u00a0can be too expensive/out of reach for some, even those with health insurance \u2014 either due to lacking coverage or nearby access to capable doctors and facilities. The story delivers: It states that tapering is available, yet that it\u2019s to be attempted with caution. Non-opioid pain-relief treatments, which are also noted by the story, are also said to be available, though out of reach for many. While the approach of tapering itself itself isn\u2019t new, this article explains that the review is novel in that it increases confidence in the idea of tapering as an effective \u2014 though with many caveats, since the studies used in the review were mostly of \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d quality.

The story is much more than that, however, as it lays out some the core issues\u00a0with the U.S. opioid epidemic, which gives the study crucial context and potential meaning. Readers are expertly walked through the study\u2019s weaknesses as well as an important related issue: The troubles of\u00a0trying to treat people for chronic pain without using opioids, and how access to such care is problematic. One quibble, though: We think the story could have provided more numerical data on the studies themselves.

The measure  would strengthen a state law that requires health insurance companies to cover mental health services in line with how they cover medical care. Holland and Baumgardner say people suffering from mental illness and their families have discovered that insurers can throw up obstacles to getting services, such as requiring prior approval or not authorizing coverage unless someone has attempted suicide first.

The survey findings were a surprise to researchers, since Medicare is considered relatively good coverage and most people have supplemental insurance to fill its gaps. After drug costs, the most often cited issues were hospital bills, ambulance rides and emergency visits. \u201cIt points to a real issue that has gone under the radar,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, a Medicare expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation who was not involved with the study and reviewed it for The Associated Press. \u201cSurvey after survey shows that people are satisfied with Medicare, but this analysis shows that people with Medicare who have serious health problems can face very high out-of-pocket costs, and that\u2019s an issue that hasn\u2019t gotten much attention.\u201d All told, 53% of seriously ill Medicare patients said they had major trouble paying their medical bills. More than a third reported using all or most of their savings to pay medical bills, 27% said they were contacted by a collection agency and 23% were unable to pay for basics such as food, heat and housing. Nearly half (45 reported emotional or psychological distress, and 1 in 4 said their medical costs had become a major burden on their families. \u201cWe did not expect to see this extent of financial hardship in the Medicare population,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, lead author of the study and a doctoral candidate at Harvard University. She said lawmakers may need to devote more attention to the needs of Medicare beneficiaries with catastrophic costs. \u201cOut-of-pocket costs are very concentrated,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cThe sickest population is also getting the biggest bills. Especially if you are sick over time, you are slowly draining your bank account.\u201d The study defined seriously ill people as those with a condition that over the past three years required two or more hospitalizations and visits to three or more doctors. Included in the study were Medicare recipients 65 and older as well as younger beneficiaries who qualified for coverage because of disability. Over half had seen five to nine doctors in the past three years. Among the most prevalent conditions were heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Thirty percent reported that the cost of prescription drugs was their major hardship. Legislation to curb the costs of medicines for seniors has advanced this year in Congress, but it\u2019s unclear if it can pass because the House and Senate remain far apart. House Democrats want Medicare to directly negotiate prices for the costliest drugs \u2014 a nonstarter for Senate Republicans. However, there is widespread agreement on putting an annual out-of-pocket limit on drug costs for Medicare enrollees. Although President Donald Trump wants a bill, the House impeachment inquiry has overshadowed efforts to move legislation. As a candidate, Trump had backed Medicare drug price negotiations. It\u2019s uncertain if the White House will try to find a compromise now between the House and Senate positions. A second study out Monday also called attention to seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket costs. Focusing on people with traditional Medicare, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that the average enrollee spent $5,460 out of their own pocket for health care in 2016, counting premiums and medical services. That figure also included long-term care costs. The average was lower \u2014 $4,519 \u2014 for people living in their communities and not in institutions. The Health Affairs study was based on a 2018 national survey of people of any age who suffered from a serious illness.

Thailand was previously known for harsh anti-drug laws, but is now eyeing the economic potential of cannabis. A report last year by Prohibition Partners, which claims to be the leading authority on the subject, said Asia\u2019s medical cannabis market would be worth around $5.8 billion by 2024. Around 25 similar clinics have been operating part-time since the legislature agreed in 2018 to amend the country\u2019s drug laws to allow the use and production of medical cannabis.

The release describes what psoriasis is and its prevalence, and explains that these trials were for moderate to severe psoriasis which covers at least 10 percent of the body. The release is very transparent in stating that the drug manufacturer paid for the research and that the lead researcher is a paid consultant to Eli Lilly. The release did not compare the many different ways that patients treat psoriasis, some with topical agents and some with oral steroids or other medications. The release states that the drug has been approved by the FDA following the completion of the trials. This is a strong indication that the drug is or soon will be available. The release should have noted that the drug is already being marketed under the brand name Taltz. The release makes an understated claim to novelty with this quote from the lead researcher: \u201cTen years ago, we thought complete clearance of this disease was impossible.

However, in what amounts to a scientific food fight, experts from Harvard, Yale, Stanford and elsewhere, including one of the review authors, said guidelines that could lead people to eat more red and processed meats were irresponsible. They asked in a letter to the journal that it \u201cpre-emptively retract publication\u201d of the papers pending further review. A statement by the Harvard School of Public Health, shared with Reuters by Frank Hu, a doctor and chair of the nutrition department, said: \u201cFrom a public health point of view, it is irresponsible and unethical to issue dietary guidelines that are tantamount to promoting meat consumption, even if there is still some uncertainty about the strength of the evidence.\u201d  The World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) both say red and processed meat may or can cause cancer.

Giota Mitrou, the WCRF\u2019s director of research, said people should not misinterpret the review as saying meat is risk-free. \u201cThe public could be put at risk if they interpret this new recommendation to mean we can continue eating as much red and processed meat as they like without increasing their risk of cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the case.\u201d          In the analysis published on Monday, researchers from Canada, Spain and Poland conducted a series of reviews of both randomized controlled trials and observational studies looking at the possible health impact of eating red and processed meat. Among the randomised trials they selected for analysis, which included around 54,000 people, they found no statistically significant link between eating meat and the risk of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer.

The 400-page report recommended that a total of 15 individuals, including the two executives, be indicted for murder, wrongful bodily injury, environmental damages and pollution. Fabio Schvartsman stepped down as Vale\u2019s CEO under pressure from prosecutors in March. Luciano Siani, also targeted by the committee, continues to serve as CFO. The committee\u2019s initial report recommended manslaughter charges but at a hearing it approved an amendment to upgrade the charges to murder and add a 15th individual to its list for recommended indictments. Vale, a formerly state-owned Brazilian \u201cnational champion\u201d which is a leading exporter and employer, said it \u201crespectfully disagrees\u201d with the indictment recommendations. A \u201cforensic, technical and scientific conclusion about the causes of the dam burst\u201d should be arrived at before holding certain people responsible, the company asserted in a statement. T\u00dcV S\u00dcD said it was cooperating in full but declined to comment further, citing ongoing investigations. Vale shares, which early in the session touched their highest since before the Brumadinho disaster, closed down 4.2%. The nonbinding recommendations could influence prosecutors in their ongoing probe of Vale and its executives for negligence regarding the disaster. \u201cVale\u2019s tragedy is a series of tragedies,\u201d the committee said in its report. \u201cThe immeasurable human loss; the countless dead animals; the environment destroyed for years, perhaps decades; the dreams and heritage of a lifetime buried by the carelessness, neglect, greed, usury, irresponsibility, indifference and sloppiness of a company that used to be a role model.\u201d  Brazil must take action to ensure that \u201cnever again\u201d will such a disaster occur, it said, recommending three laws that would require congressional approval. One would outlaw all tailings dams for mining and industrial waste. That would go far beyond a ban instituted in February on the specific type of \u201cupstream\u201d dam that ruptured. It would allow for 10 years to decommission the hundreds of existing tailings dams around the country, a costly move for miners. A separate bill would hike taxes calculated on mineral production, with a tax of up to 40% on more profitable or larger scale mines. The investment banking unit of Brazil\u2019s Bradesco said such a tax is unlikely to be implemented given that comparable taxes in Australia and Mexico are up to 7.5%. But the bank said the rate is likely to rise for Brazilian miners from the current 3.5%. A third proposed law would expand the list of environmental crimes. Barclays analyst Amos Fletcher said he doubted that Congress would follow through on shutting down all types of tailings dams, a move that would halt a significant amount of mineral production, which Brazil counts on for a large portion of its GDP, he said. The recommendations may be depressing Vale\u2019s stock price more than the indictments because of worries that such changes \u201cwould lead to more supply being squeezed,\u201d he said. Vale\u2019s tailings dam ruptured in the city of Brumadinho in the mining state of Minas Gerais in late January, releasing a torrent of mud that buried hundreds of people, including a cafeteria full of workers at lunchtime. In the following months, investigators and regulators pointed toward a risky \u201cupstream\u201d style of dam construction, improper maintenance and negligence. T\u00dcV S\u00dcD certified the dam as stable in 2018 despite pointing out concerns about drainage and monitoring systems. Vale has argued that it followed all the required safety measures. While authorities have yet to conclude the cause of the rupture, a Minas Gerais state official and other experts suspect liquefaction, in which solid materials such as sand lose strength and become more like liquid. That was the same cause of a 2015 rupture of another upstream Vale dam that killed 19.

The release only gets as detailed on cost as the excerpts below: The findings, which support earlier research demonstrating positive results of the assessment and treatment method in a university setting, have the potential to transform dental care for high-risk patients at a lower cost to both patients and dental clinics and practices. Results appear online Jan. 22, 2018, in Advances in Dental Research. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices. The release also doesn\u2019t address the cost of prescription fluoride toothpaste which may actually result in higher costs overall. The number needed to treat was 4, meaning\u00a0that you would have to treat 4 people for one additional person to get benefit. This results in the cost of therapy being multiplied by 4 to get the effect found in the study. The release described benefits this way: Among 242 patients (137 intervention, 105 control) initially identified as high risk for caries, only a quarter of the patients remained at high risk in the CAMBRA group at 24 months, while just over half (54 percent) of the control group did. Of the 192 low-risk participants (93 intervention, 99 control), most participants remained low risk. As noted under Evidence criteria below, the release listed as a limitation the fact that only about one-third of the patients who started the study completed the 24 month checkup. There is no mention of harms. We are given enough information to judge the quality of the evidence; it was a randomized study with an experimental and a control group. The release also deserves praise for noting study limitations, including the high study attrition rate (65 percent of volunteers dropped out before their 24 month follow-up). The study quality seems to have been very good considering the difficulty in performing this type of community based study. The blinding was adequate and although the published study states that the\u00a0blinding was \u201cdouble\u201d (patient and investigator), it also appears\u00a0that the treating dentists (participating treaters) were also blinded to the group that the patient was assigned. This could\u00a0have been mentioned, too, and would have strengthened the release. There is no disease mongering. The funding sources are listed, and there are no apparent conflicts. In the strictest possible way, the release does not directly talk about all the different ways of preventing dental caries. But we were glad that the release discussed the improvements that happened for some patients in the control group who received fewer products. We are glad the release talks about possibly following up on this, in case the lesser products could still benefit many patients. Excerpt: The researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair, as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects. While not as significant as the CAMBRA group in this study, the risk level of these patients dropped more dramatically over time than for those in the 2012 UCSF CAMBRA study. It was surprising to see the benefits gained by the control group,\u201d Rechmann said. \u201cMore research is needed to see if the products and treatment administered to this group function in the way we speculate, and if so, they might be made easily available to dental patients. Doing so can change the whole picture of caries control. This CAMBRA method is available at about half of US schools and colleges of dentistry according to the release. However, the prescription fluoride toothpaste is available from most pharmacies. The release clearly explains that this research began in 2002, and small incremental steps in its validation have been published over many years. This is one more step. There is no unjustifiable language. Claim: Cavity prevention approach effectively reduces tooth decay", "output": "In a study of 460 patients at high risk of dental damage separated into two groups, those who used cavity-prevention products dramatically reduced their risk of cavities compared to the control group, according to researchers at the University of California, San Francisco. The system of prevention is known by the acronym CAMBRA, for Caries Management By Risk Assessment. It included giving the patients prescription fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine antibacterial rinse, xylitol mints and fluoride varnish. The release fell short in describing the potential cost saving and addressing any potential for harms. Dental problems are a plague to people of all income ranges and ages. The cost of dental care, where insurance is inadequate or out-of-reach, is a particular burden for low income people. If specific preventive measures are proven to significantly reduce cavities it could benefit many.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

If approved, such treatments are expected to command stratospheric prices. For example, a separate Spark gene therapy for a rare type of childhood blindness, which is on track for Food and Drug Administration clearance soon, could cost $1 million per patient for infusions in both eyes, according to some Wall Street analysts. Still, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings. Porteus noted in his editorial that the hemophilia therapy resulted in\u00a0savings of about $200,000 a year per patient because of the elimination of clotting-factor infusions. The story summarizes the outcome of the small, 10-person trial that dominates this narrative: Lindsey George, the lead investigator and a hematologist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said that nine of the 10 men in the trial didn\u2019t experience any bleeding episodes after the gene therapy treatment. The one patient who needed clotting factor because of bleeding used 91 percent less than before, she said. Although the story does not address harms directly\u2013and should have\u2013it does note that one of the worrying side effects of gene therapy\u2014spurring the body to attack itself\u2014was not present in this study. It is clear from the story that the study is small and an \u201cearly-stage trial.\u201d One source also notes that the researchers tracked individuals in the study for no more than a year and a half, making longer term assessments unavailable. The story could have done more, though, to signal to the reader that, despite the encouraging outcomes of the study, the treatment is still very much under development. The next stage\u2014Phase 3 trials\u2014requires more participants, more careful study design, and takes, on average, three years to complete. The treatment described here, if ultimately proved worthy, could have a profound impact on a serious genetic condition. Independent sources are identified in the story, as are the funders. But missing from the text is information describing linkages between the two funders\u2014Spark Therapeutics and Pfizer\u2014and the lead researchers. It\u2019s not clear from the story that there is a financial relationship. Individuals coping with hemophilia B have few options, and the story describes the main one: injections of blood-clotting factor to stem runaway bleeding. Since the story notes that the research is at an early stage with only 10 participants, a reader can easily infer that the treatment is not yet available. However, additional information about remaining evaluation stages for this treatment would have been a useful reinforcing addition. Hemophilia B sufferers who see this story will likely be contacting their doctors. The story establishes novelty with this: The researchers presented earlier\u00a0findings\u00a0on the gene therapy a year ago at the American Society of Hematology\u2019s annual meeting, but the latest data covers a larger patient group and a longer time period. A news release issued by Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia did a good job of describing this study; the Post story could have picked up more of the salient details from that text but reveals independent reporting nevertheless by including sources not connected to the study. Claim: Gene therapy makes a big advance treating hemophilia B blood disorder", "output": "iStock / Getty Images Plus A small, early-stage study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a single intravenous infusion of a novel bioengineered gene therapy treatment helped spare nine of 10 hemophilia B sufferers from repeated injections of blood-clotting factor to prevent debilitating bleeding episodes. This well-written story shares that information carefully and clearly. However, more details about the years-long road ahead for this treatment\u2019s development and about possible ties between the researchers and the funders would have made the piece stronger. Complicating the care taken by the reporter, however, is a glaring headline that promises much more than this small study can deliver (\u201cGene therapy makes a big advance treating hemophilia B blood disorder\u201d). Whether this particular treatment revolutionizes the landscape for hemophilia B sufferers will remain an open question for some years. People who have inherited the hemophilia B bleeding disorder face a lifetime of replacement therapy: injecting clotting factor when life deals them a stumble or a scrape. Gene therapy research appears to be on the cusp of offering an alternate treatment that would allow these individuals to lead normal lives.

Another wolf species, the Western gray wolf, is thriving in the Northern Rockies and Great Lakes and could lose federal protections under a proposal released earlier this month. For red wolves, the affirmation of their genetic uniqueness comes after some North Carolina officials and a small but vocal group of landowners pushed the government to abandon recovery efforts, arguing the animal is a coyote hybrid. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Laury Parramore declined to comment on the agency-funded study beyond a statement saying it was under review. Red wolves once occupied much of the Eastern U.S. but were driven to near extinction by trapping, hunting and habitat loss. Some of the last red wolves in the wild were removed from portions of Louisiana and Texas in 1980 and used in a captive breeding program. Their descendants were later reintroduced to a wildlife refuge along North Carolina\u2019s coast. An estimated 35 wild red wolves remained as of late 2018, down from about 120 a decade ago. Their range is currently limited to five North Carolina counties. Another 200 live in captive breeding programs. Acknowledging longstanding questions among some scientists about red wolf ancestry, federal wildlife officials said last year they would treat it as a distinct species while awaiting Thursday\u2019s report. The nine-member national academy panel found that the red wolf is unique based on its DNA, its behavior and its size, which is larger than a coyote and smaller than a gray wolf. While the red wolf appears more closely related to coyotes than gray wolves, red wolves diverged as their own species long ago, said Joseph Travis, chair of the national academy panel and a biology professor at Florida State University. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly been introduction of coyote genes and gray wolf genes into red wolves. But they also have genes not seen in coyotes and gray wolves,\u201d Travis said in an interview. \u201cThey must have continuity with some ancestor which was not a gray wolf or coyote.\u201d Ron Sutherland, a biologist with the nonprofit Wildlands Network, said he had been waiting on \u201cpins and needles\u201d to see what the panel decided. \u201cThat should be a kick in the butt for the Fish and Wildlife Service to stop the quiet negligence of letting the species go extinct in the wild,\u201d he said. A government plan to further shrink the territory where red wolves roam stalled last year when a judge ruled officials were neglecting their duty to protect the animals under the Endangered Species Act. That same plan would have allowed landowners to kill any wolves that strayed from the proposed smaller territory consisting of federal land in two counties. Conservationists accused the federal agency of neglecting the animals under political pressure and abandoning proven conservation techniques, such as releasing captive bred pups. In 2015, North Carolina\u2019s Wildlife Resources Commission passed a resolution urging an end to the federal program, saying \u201cthe purity of the red wolf genome is questionable\u201d after hybridization with coyotes.

Health officials are proposing jail terms of up to three years, with a penalty of up to 500,000 rupees ($7,000), for repeat offenders against the new rules, according to a draft of the executive order. First-time offenders would face a prison term of up to one year and a fine of 100,000 rupees. Such orders are typically issued in India as an emergency measure when parliament is not in session. It can lapse if it is not approved when lawmakers convene against in the next session, which will most likely be held around November. It was not immediately clear whether the draft executive order will face changes, or when it will be approved. India\u2019s health ministry did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The ministry\u2019s plans would deal a blow to U.S.-based Juul Labs Inc, which is hoping to launch its e-cigarette in India and has hired several senior executives in recent months. Philip Morris also has plans to launch its heat-not-burn smoking device in India, Reuters has reported. Advocates for the devices say e-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking tobacco, because users do not inhale the same dangerous matter. But many tobacco-control activists are opposed to e-cigarettes, saying they could lead to nicotine addiction and push people to consume tobacco. \u201cThere is evidence that these products are a gateway to tobacco products and induce adolescents and young adults to nicotine use leading to addiction,\u201d the health ministry said in the document. India has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China in the world, making it a lucrative market for firms such as Juul and Philip Morris. More than 900,000 people die each year in the country due to tobacco-related illnesses. Sixteen state governments in India have prohibited e-cigarettes but there is as yet no federal legislation to deal with what the health ministry termed the \u201chazardous product\u201d. Justifying its call for a ban, the health ministry argued that e-cigarettes can also be used as delivery devices for other substances such as cannabis, and could promote dual use with conventional cigarettes. \u201cThese devices are injurious to health and proliferation of these products has a negative impact on public health,\u201d the draft said. Reuters reported in March the health ministry had called for Juul\u2019s entry into India to be blocked, saying such products were \u201caddictive and could potentially undermine our tobacco control efforts\u201d.

He was elected House minority whip in 2017, shortly after Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives for the first time in nearly a century. Last month, state Republican Party officials filed an ethics complaint against Stone for using taxpayer money to campaign for votes. Stone sent a survey to his constituents, which is legal. But the survey included the line: \u201cI request your vote and support.\u201d Stone apologized for the mailing and said he would reimburse the state.

This is a humanized monoclonal antibody and the story might have mentioned some of the drugs currently on the market to treat other disorders such as bevacizumab (Avastin) or adalimub (Humira). This could have led to some discussion about costs because these are not inexpensive medications. The story merely mentions that this drug had \u2018shown promise\u2019 and that the studies reported are \u2018encouraging\u2019 because they indicate that people can tolerate the drug for 2- 4 years without safety concerns. Promise of what? What does the drug do? Although the story mentions amyloid accumulation, it failed to explain that though amyloid accumulation is seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it isn\u2019t clear whether it causes symptoms or is secondary to the disease process. The story would have added valuable context by at least mentioning the results of the placebo-controlled study from which the patients in this extension study were drawn. http://newsroom.elan.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=88326&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1166655 That study found that the drug had no effect on symptoms in the study group overall, although specific subgroups seemed to benefit in an after-the-fact analysis that was not part of the original study design. The story indicated that some patients taking the higher does of the drug experienced\u00a0headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms. From the information in the story, it appeared that 8% (21/262) of patients participating in a second study using the lower dose of the medication had some anomalies on MRI scan but no reported symptoms. At the end of this story, it was reported that the results had only been presented at a meeting and therefore considered only as preliminary until they were reviewed. In addition, the story indicated that the study reported on was an open-label trial. But it doesn\u2019t explain what open-label means \u2013 hardly a consumer-friendly term. Wanna do a poll on how many readers know what it means? (In an open-label trial, both the clinician and patient know what it is that they are taking; the potential impact of that on results should be obvious.) Nonethless, we\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt, largely on the back of one of the expert sources being quoted:\u00a0 \u201cit is too early to tell from the data from this small Phase 2 safety trial.\u201d (Although, again, do we expect that most readers know what a Phase 2 trial really means?). The story did not engage in overt disease-mongering. The story included a quote from Dr. Ian Murray who did not appear to have a role in the studies reported on as well as comments from Dr. Salloway, lead author of the study. But we\u2019re going to rule it unsatisfactory because the story should have noted that Dr. Salloway, according to previous disclosures available online, has received research funding and has consulting relationships with numerous drug companies, including Pfizer, which makes bapineuzumab. The story failed to explain how patients taking\u00a0bapineuzumab compared with those who did not take the drug. Without this information, it is impossible to evaluate the value this medication may have to patients. The story also should have put the findings seen with bapineuzumab in context with those of the other approved drugs (Aricept, etc) that have limited efficacy or perhaps mentioned the other drugs that are in testing. The subject of the story is the drug bapineuzumab, which was reported as not yet available to consumers. It would have been useful to include a link to Clinicaltrials.gov so that readers who might be interested could learn about the other trials being conducted. http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=Bapineuzumab This story did not overstate the novelty of the drug reported on.

Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi, chairman of the House panel investigating concerns about cancer-causing asbestos in cosmetic talc and powders, said he was disappointed Gorsky turned down the invitation. \u201cMr. Gorsky refuses to speak to the Subcommittee under oath, yet he has not refrained from making multiple public comments on the topic,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said in a statement. J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said that the subcommittee had rejected the company\u2019s offers to send a talc testing expert or a J&J executive in charge of consumer products.

Gorsky has played a lead role in J&J\u2019s efforts to reassure consumers and investors that its talc powders are safe and asbestos free. Last year, he issued a statement vouching for the safety of the products after a jury issued a $4.69 billion verdict in favor of 22 women who sued over allegations their ovarian cancers were caused by J&J powders. Gorsky appeared on CNBC's \"\"Mad Money with Jim Cramer\"\" and in a video posted on J&J's website to rebut a December 2018 Reuters report here that the company knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its talc and powders. \u201cSince tests for asbestos in talc were first developed, J&J\u2019s Baby Powder has never contained asbestos,\u201d Gorsky said in the video. In October, Gorsky testified in a depositihere in a lawsuit filed by an Indiana man, saying, \"\"We unequivocally believe that our talc and our baby powder does not contain asbestos.\"\" J&J faces more than 16,000 similar lawsuits. Concerns over asbestos in talc cosmetics have grown in recent months as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the carcinogen had been found in several products, including a bottle of Baby Powder. J&J said it recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d Later, J&J said labs it hired found no asbestos - other than some contamination it blamed on an air conditioner - in samples from the same Baby Powder bottle and its production lot.

Measles cases are on the rise globally, including in wealthy nations such as the United States and Germany, where some parents shun life-saving vaccines due to false theories suggesting links between childhood immunizations and autism. In Madagascar, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, parents are desperate to vaccinate their children, many trudging for miles to get to clinics for shots. But there are not enough vaccines, the health ministry says, and many people are too poor to afford them. Fisherman Dada \u2013 like many Malagasy, he only uses one name \u2013 had taken his son Limberaza to be vaccinated once already in their home in the southern district of Fort Dauphin. But a second-dose booster shot cost $15 at a clinic - and the whole family survives on less than $2 a day - so he took the boy to a back-street doctor instead. \u201cI could not afford to take him to the hospital,\u201d Dada said quietly as his young wife silently held Limberaza\u2019s two-year-old brother. In January, Limberaza began to cough. A rash followed. After a week, he died, his body afire with fever. By then Dada\u2019s niece, three-year-old Martina, was also sick. Her weeping mother Martine stroked her face as her fever spiked. She died eight days later. That evening, his other sister Pela\u2019s three-year-old son Mario died as she clutched his hands. \u201cThey were so full of life,\u201d Dada said, his voice breaking. The three cousins are among the almost 1,000 people, mostly children, who have died from measles in Madagascar since October. Their deaths show the grim reality for those left unprotected from one of the world\u2019s most contagious diseases. The virus, which can cause blindness, pneumonia, brain swelling and death, is able to survive for up to two hours in the air after a cough or sneeze, where it can easily infect people nearby. Even though there is a highly effective vaccine, globally, around 110,000 people died from measles in 2017, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Most, like Limberaza and his cousins, were children under the age of five. During 2000 to 2017, the WHO estimates that widespread use of measles vaccinations prevented 21.1 million deaths - making the shots one of what the United Nations\u2019 health agency calls the \u201cbest buys in public health.\u201d  Yet misinformation is knocking confidence in the safety of vaccinations and has jeopardized progress against measles - allowing the disease to gain a hold again in places where it was considered almost beaten. Europe last year saw its highest level of measles cases in a decade, and in January, the WHO named \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d - the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate - as one of the top ten global health threats for 2019. In Madagascar, poverty is a bigger risk. While wealthy tourists flock to its rainforests to spot wide-eyed lemurs and business people bargain for its luminous sapphires and fragrant vanilla, nearly half of Madagascar\u2019s children are malnourished, the highest rate in Africa. The former French colony has been battered by decades of coups and instability. Foreign aid plummeted after a 2009 coup sparked bitter political street fighting. Corrupt leaders ignored the crumbling healthcare system despite frequent outbreaks of plague, hemorrhagic fevers and deadly viruses. Measles is endemic on the island but the last vaccination drive was in 2004. Nearly two-thirds of children have not been vaccinated, according to the WHO and coverage needs to be around 95 percent to prevent the virus spreading in communities. The country is $3 million short of the $7 million needed for enough measles vaccines to cover its population, the WHO said last month. There are other hurdles. The vaccines must be kept cold, but less than 15 percent of people in Madagascar have electricity. Roads are mostly mud in the tropical country; journeys are arduous and expensive. At least 922 people - mostly children - have died of measles in Madagascar since October, the WHO says, despite an emergency program that has vaccinated 2.2 million of the 26 million population so far. Some of those, like Limberaza, had previously been vaccinated but had only received one shot, and still needed a second booster jab. Madagascar hopes to roll out a free routine two-dose vaccination program this year. Currently, the first shot is free but the booster is not. Despite the difficulties, some parents walk miles seeking shots, said Jean Beno\u00eet Mahnes, deputy representative for the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund in Madagascar. But they often arrive to find the clinic closed, or a doctor with no vaccine, or a vaccine that has expired. \u201cVaccinating a child can be a real obstacle course here,\u201d he said. Lydia Rahariseheno, 33, said she had to walk an hour and a half to a clinic along a road plagued by robbers to get her three children vaccinated. She has only managed to get one shot so far because the doctor is often not there. The health system\u2019s failures mean poverty-stricken parents often take sick children to traditional healers who prescribe a herb, tingotingo, which is boiled and given to them to drink. The children are only brought to a hospital when their condition deteriorates, said Manitra Rakotoarivony, director of health promotion at the Ministry of Public Health. Limberaza\u2019s father hoped a second, cheaper shot would protect him - but it didn\u2019t. His cousins Mario and Martine weren\u2019t vaccinated at all. Now the family is desperate to protect their remaining children. \u201cWe did not expect the failure to vaccinate him would kill him,\u201d wept Pela, Mario\u2019s mother. \u201cMy other child, for sure, I am going to take him to get vaccinated.\u201d Claim: Pardoned felons are allowed to vote.", "output": "Two months ago, giggles floated through the home of fisherman Dada as his four-year-old son played ball outside with his two younger cousins on one of Madagascar\u2019s famed sun soaked beaches.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

The Kenney administration said it got the statistic from a Dickinson College study conducted in conjunction with Philadelphia Police and the Fairmount Park Conservancy, a nonprofit that leads capital projects and programming across 10,200 acres of Fairmount Park and 100 neighborhood parks throughout the city. Meg Holscher, the Conservancy\u2019s senior director of development, said the 87-acre Hunting Park in North Philadelphia was identified in 2008 as an area of development because of how close it was to a high number of families. At the time, prostitution and drug trade were common in and around the park. After community meetings and input from neighbors, the Conservancy -- along with the Philadelphia Department of Parks and Recreation -- presented a master plan for the park in October 2009 that outlined two new playgrounds, a community garden and farmers market, new tennis courts and youth tennis programming, as well as a renovated football and soccer field. One of the most visible changes, though, was 64 lights placed around the park, which Holscher said residents wanted to curb illegal activity and violence. \"\"This project for us was a little bit of a game changer,\"\" she said. \"\"We\u2019ve started to look at parks and how they are tied to healthy eating, healthy living and violence prevention.\"\" Holscher said the $4.5 million Hunting Park capital projects and programming was funded through both public and private funds. In addition to that, another $500,000 was added through grants and corporate donations, bringing the total amount for phase one of the revitalization to some $5 million. After efforts to spruce up the park started in 2010, Conservancy staff started hearing from community members that it seemed like crime in the area had slowed, but an analysis wasn\u2019t completed until 2014. That year, Amanda Vandenburg, then a researcher at Dickinson College in Carlisle, was interested in how parks influence communities. Vandenburg said she analyzed public data from the Philadelphia Police Department and charted crime statistics from 2006, before the revitalization efforts began, through 2013, when the first phase of the project had wrapped up. The data included both part I crimes (violent crimes like homicide, rape and aggravated assault) and part II crimes (like simple assault, prostitution, drug possession and other non-violent offenses.) She mapped instances of crime from inside and a half-mile buffer around the park, and found that there was a spike in crime between 2006 and 2007. After that point, crime began decreasing in 2008 citywide as police enforcement efforts in Philadelphia changed under a new mayoral administration. But crime continued to go down near Hunting Park. Between 2009 and 2013, \"\"there was an 89 percent drop in the number of crimes,\"\" according to Vandenburg\u2019s study. Rape and theft from vehicle crime incidents increased over that time period, but other crimes decreased, including prostitution and drug use. Vandenburg also conducted a \"\"hot spot\"\" analysis that showed areas predicted to have the highest amounts of crime were closer to and in the park in 2009 and moved away from the park by 2013. While she said the revitalization of Hunting Park can\u2019t be attributed as the only reason for a decrease in crime in the immediate area, the data does support the theory that illegal activity in the area decreased as the park was improved. Our Ruling Kenney used the efforts in Hunting Park as an example of why City Council should authorize more funds to revitalize parks and recreation centers throughout the city. He said \"\"when the city and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, crime went down 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years.\"\" The Fairmount Park Conservancy confirmed that it -- along with the city and private donors -- invested about $5 million in revitalizing the park. Vandenburg, who conducted the study, said crime did in fact drop by 89 percent within a half-mile radius over the next three years.

The photograph\u00a0was taken from a news story from Los Angeles-area outlet\u00a0KTLA\u00a0on 29 March 2015, and shows\u00a0Dr. Michael Shannon,\u00a0Chris Trokey, and three other firefighters from Orange County Fire Authority\u2019s Paramedic Engine 29. According to KTLA,\u00a0Shannon saved\u00a0Trokey\u2019s life in 1981, just after he was born: Trokey was just 3.2 pounds at birth, and doctors had initially gave him a 50/50 chance at surviving. But his pediatrician \u2014 Dr. Shannon \u2014 helped save his life, staying with the infant around the clock until his health improved and he was stable. Trokey returned the favor in 2011, when Dr. Shannon was involved in a car accident: Firefighters from Paramedic Engine 29 were returning from another call and responded within minutes to the fiery crash. By the time they arrived, Shannon\u2019s vehicle was also ablaze and the flames were burning his legs. Fire crews then worked to extinguish the flames and rescue him using the Jaws of Life. The seriously injured Shannon was taken to Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo where he spent the next 45 days recovering from internal injuries. He also had to have two of his toes amputated. Among those who had helped save Shannon that day was Orange County Fire Authority paramedic Chris Trokey, whose own life had been saved 30 years earlier by the pediatrician. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about until I went to the hospital and started talking about it, Dr. Shannon.

A national organization representing publicly funded family planning providers said Monday it would file a separate lawsuit over the policy. The new rules announced Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services would bar taxpayer-funded family planning clinics from making abortion referrals. They would also prohibit clinics that receive federal money from sharing office space with abortion providers \u2014 a rule that Ferguson said would force many to find new locations, undergo expensive remodels or shut down. Clinics that receive money under Title X, the 1970 law designed to improve access to reproductive health care for communities around the nation, provide a wide array of services, including birth control and screening for diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and cancer. Beyond interfering in a patient\u2019s relationship with her doctor, Ferguson said, the rules could leave vast areas without such care for low-income residents. \u201cRural communities currently have a shortage of health care providers,\u201d Ferguson told reporters. \u201cThis rule will make the shortage even more acute.\u201d Abortion is a legal medical procedure, but federal laws prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the woman. Religious conservatives and abortion opponents have long complained that Title X has been used to indirectly subsidize abortion providers. Chris Plante, policy director of the Christian group Family Policy Institute of Washington, called the legal challenge \u201cwrongheaded\u201d and said the new policy \u201csimply returns the Title X regulations back to their original legislative intent: \u2018None of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.\u2019\u201d \u201cA doctor can still talk about abortion,\u201d Plante said. \u201cThe doctor simply can\u2019t say, \u2018There\u2019s an abortion provider three streets down, turn left.\u2019\u201d While the new rule would permit clinic staff to discuss abortion with clients, it would no longer be required that they do so. If patients ask for an abortion referral, staff would be required to give a list of primary care providers with no indication as to which provide abortions. The list would have to include providers who do not offer abortions, and it could not include clinics or organizations that aren\u2019t primary care providers, such as Planned Parenthood, Ferguson said. Ferguson, who has filed nearly three dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, including over the travel ban, said he would file the challenge in federal court in Spokane, in eastern Washington, after the policy is made official with its publication in the federal register. He intends to seek a court order blocking it from taking effect. Eastern Washington has 20 counties, 11 of which would be left without Title X providers, he said. Across Washington state in 2017, 14,000 patients received federally funded services at 85 of the clinics, many of them operated by Planned Parenthood. Ferguson said Trump\u2019s policy violates the Affordable Care Act, which protects providers and patients from government interference in the health care relationship, and a federal law that requires doctors to provide information about abortion and prenatal care to patients in an unbiased manner. It also violates the Administrative Procedures Act by contradicting Title X regulations without sufficient justification, and it violates doctors\u2019 right to free speech and women\u2019s right to an abortion under Roe v. Wade, he alleged. The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association said it would sue separately. Erin Berry, Washington state medical director of Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands, was one of many advocates who joined Ferguson at his news conference. \u201cI cannot imagine withholding information from my patients.

But Republicans appear ready to stymie that proposal once again. The topic came up Jan. 26, 2014, on Fox News Sunday during a discussion between host Chris Wallace and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \"\"Isn't it reasonable that somebody who's working full time, 40 hours a week, should be able to live above the poverty line?\"\" Wallace asked McConnell, referring to Obama\u2019s calls to hike the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. \"\"Yeah. But of course, the minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people,\"\" McConnell replied. \"\"We have a crisis in employment among young people right now.\"\" McConnell went on to say that he believes raising the minimum wage will hurt employment and \"\"we ought to be doing things that create more jobs.\"\" But what about McConnell\u2019s characterization of minimum wage workers? Is it a workforce mostly made up of young folks? We\u2019ll stick to the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25, since that\u2019s the topic up for debate. As it stands, 21 states and the District of Columbia have set their minimum wage higher than the federal level. A spokesman for McConnell pointed us to a study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics, \"\"Characterizations of Minimum Wage Workers,\"\" released in February of last year. We\u2019re familiar with it, having written a couple of fact-checks recently on the minimum wage. According to the report, of the 75 million people making hourly wages in 2012, about 1.6 million earned the minimum wage while another 2 million earned less than $7.25 an hour. (How does one earn less than the minimum wage? Certain exceptions are carved out for \"\"vocational education students,\"\" \"\"full-time students employed by retail or service establishments, agriculture, or institutions of higher education,\"\" and those \"\"impaired by a physical or mental disability.\"\") The underlying data in the report largely backs up McConnell\u2019s claim. In fact, the report even says \"\"Minimum wage workers tend to be young.\"\" How young? Only 20 percent of individuals earning hourly wages are ages 16-24, but that demographic makes up half of all individuals earning at or below the minimum wage. About a quarter of those individuals are teenagers ages 16-19 and another 25 percent are 20 to 24 years old. Broadened to include 25-29 year olds, and nearly two-thirds of all workers making at or below the minimum wage are younger than 30. The older you get, the more likely you\u2019re making more than $7.25. But McConnell also described minimum wage jobs as \"\"entry-level.\"\" That\u2019s a characterization with which some may take an issue. Entry-level jobs typically indicate positions that, while at the bottom of the totem pole, have potential for growth. Young adults take entry-level jobs at companies hoping to climb the career ladder. And while wages are lower, there is potential to see considerable salary increases and/or career advancement. A majority of minimum-wage jobs don\u2019t really fit that description. According to the report, two-thirds are part-time, and half of all minimum wage jobs are in the leisure or hospitality industry. This includes food service jobs like waiters and cooks, hotel employees or movie theater workers, among other jobs. While many of those jobs are traditionally held by young people, they don\u2019t typically lead to careers in those industries. The same can be said for retail jobs, which make up another 16 percent of all minimum wage-or-less positions. Our ruling McConnell said \"\"the minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people.\"\" The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that indeed half of all workers making a minimum wage are 16 to 24, and another 20 percent are in their late 20s or early 30s. That\u2019s a large chunk of the minimum wage workforce, though about 30 percent of people making the minimum wage are 35 and older. McConnell also goes a bit too far in calling these jobs \"\"entry-level.\"\" For most young people, these are part-time jobs in the food or retail businesses or similar industries with little hope for career advancement.\" Claim: The minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people.", "output": "\"McConnell said \"\"the minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people.\"\" The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that indeed half of all workers making a minimum wage are 16 to 24, and another 20 percent are in their late 20s or early 30s.

He praised President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts in addressing drug and opioid abuse and noted \"\"drug overdose deaths decreased in 2018 for the first time in 30 years.\"\" The detective has worked for the Albuquerque, New Mexico, police department for nine years and was invited by Trump to the 2018 State of the Union address. The year before, Holets promised an addicted mom that he and his wife would adopt her baby \u2014 and they did. Holets has seen the results of the nation\u2019s drug crisis both professionally and personally. We reached out to the Albuquerque Police Department for the source of Holets\u2019 data but did not get a response. The nation\u2019s opioid crisis has been a talking point in Trump\u2019s campaign since 2016 \u2014 and his administration has touted efforts it has made to provide money to states for treatment and other programs, so we decided to look into it. Did the death rate decline in 2018 as Holets noted? Yes, but that\u2019s not the whole story. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 67,367 people died of a drug overdose in 2018. That number exceeded the tally, based on the most recent data available, of those who died either in car wrecks or by firearms. Two-thirds of those drug overdose deaths involved some type of opioid, including those given by prescription or those purchased illicitly, such as heroin. The CDC cites a rise in opioid deaths as coming in three \"\"waves.\"\" The origin of the first wave came after doctors began prescribing more opioids for pain relief in the 1990s, with data showing a rise in deaths emerging around 1999, the CDC said. Another wave began in 2010. This one was fueled by deaths involving the illegal use of heroin. The third wave quickly followed, starting in 2013, with increases in deaths associated with synthetic opioids, particularly illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Despite the rising number of deaths, opioid prescribing continued to rise, fueled by marketing campaigns aimed at physicians by drug manufacturers. The total number of opioid prescriptions peaked in 2012 at more than 81 prescriptions per every 100 people in the U.S., according to CDC data. To combat that, a growing number of prescribing recommendations have been issued by physician and hospital groups, aimed at reducing the number of pills per prescription and the total number of prescriptions. The overall prescribing rate fell to 51 prescriptions per 100 people by 2018, according to the CDC. Still, Americans are more likely to fill a prescription painkiller than patients in other countries, and the rate of opioid prescriptions in the U.S. remains among the highest in the world. Deaths associated with all types of opioid use \u2014 from prescriptions to street use \u2014 are a lagging indicator of the number of people dependent or addicted to the drugs, said experts. Improved access to treatments to help people quit, as well as increased use of overdose reversal treatments, such as naloxone, can suppress death rates. The Trump administration has continued and expanded funding efforts, some of which began under President Barack Obama, to help provide treatment, research and other services. Yet the administration is also actively seeking to end the Affordable Care Act, which includes a provision requiring insurers to offer substance abuse treatment and has expanded access to treatment through Medicaid in the majority of states that fully implemented the law. Drug overdose deaths did decrease from 2017 to 2018, dropping by about 4.1%, according to the CDC. Still, the agency notes that the crisis is far from over, as the number of overdose deaths was four times higher in 2018 than in 1999. Parsing those numbers further, the decrease in deaths in 2018 came in three categories, with prescription-involved opioid deaths falling the most, a 13.5% decrease, followed by heroin deaths, down 4%. Conversely, deaths associated with the use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, rose by 10%. So Holets was correct to say drug overdose deaths fell in 2018. But that statistic doesn\u2019t put the issue in perspective. \"\"It did decrease slightly, meaning it went from 134 deaths a day to 130 deaths a day,\"\" noted Dr. Chad Brummett, a director of the Michigan Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network, a collaboration of physicians that makes recommendations on prescribing. \"\"It\u2019s disingenuous to pretend that was a huge win,\"\" said Amy Bohnert, associate professor at the University of Michigan. \"\"As someone who does research on this, I would be reluctant to consider a change of that scale to be clearly a sign of a real change as opposed to random error.\"\" Brandeis University professor Andrew Kolodny said it was the first overall downtick in drug overdoses in 30 years, but he would parse it a bit for opioids, saying it was the first decline in 25 years. However, a bigger issue for Kolodny is that the speaker failed to mention that drug overdose numbers went up again last year. \"\"It is misleading to point to a slight reduction in 2018, when deaths went up again in 2019 and we remain at record-high levels of opioid deaths,\"\" said Kolodny, medical director for the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management. The CDC says preliminary data shows reported overdose deaths went up 6% in the 12 months ending in January 2020. Holets is correct in saying that overall drug overdose deaths ticked down in 2018, although a small category of deaths \u2014 those related to fentanyl \u2014 rose. And it\u2019s pretty close to 30 years since a decline was documented. Still, Holets failed to mention that drug overdose deaths went up again last year, according to preliminary data from the CDC. Also left unsaid were other factors that may contribute to the rising or falling drug death rates \u2014 and what that may say about the underlying level of dependence or addiction.\" Claim: \u201cDrug overdose deaths decreased in 2018 for the first time in 30 years.\u201d", "output": "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 67,367 people died of a drug overdose in 2018.

Shoppers wearing masks trickled in and out of the store. It\u2019s part of an effort aimed at tamping down the spread of disease in an area where an outbreak alarmed officials. Gainesville\u2019s Hall County and neighboring Habersham County have the highest infection rates in north Georgia, which prompted Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s administration to begin focusing on the region in late April. The Republican governor visited Gainesville Friday to highlight the effort, with local leaders saying they believed community outreach and infection-control efforts had begun to control the disease. It had threatened to overwhelm local nurses and take down the nation\u2019s largest concentration of chicken processing plants. As poultry industry officials proudly noted Friday, Georgia is the nation\u2019s largest chicken producer, a $41 billion industry that employs more than 45,000 people statewide and turns out 15% of U.S. production. Kemp\u2019s visit came as Georgia neared 37,000 overall infections and had more than 1,550 deaths. The state recently surpassed 300,000 tests, which Kemp hailed as a milestone in efforts to locate virus cases. The latest testing figure represents close to 3% of the state\u2019s population. But an Associated Press analysis found Georgia was among 41 states that are falling short of the COVID-19 testing levels that public health experts say are necessary to safely ease lockdowns and avoid another deadly wave of outbreaks. The spread of the virus claimed two workers at the Fieldale Farms Corp. poultry complex in nearby Cornelia as well as a nurse at the Gainesville hospital, among 56 confirmed deaths in Hall and Habersham counties. Norma Hernandez, an accountant who heads the Northeast Georgia Latino Chamber of Commerce, said that over the past two weeks, community leaders have worked to present a message from people that Spanish speakers will trust. \u201cWe need to make it simple. And the main thing is, let\u2019s get healthy. Let\u2019s get back to work,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cAnd how are we gonna do that? We\u2019re gonna do it by taking care of each other, taking responsibility for yourself. Because if you are careful, then you will not get infected and then you will not bring it home.\u201d Besides testing, a company was sanitizing taxis for free outside the grocery store. Hernandez said she and others have handed out 3,000 masks to stores so they can force customers to don them before entering. Hernandez said she\u2019s been counseling businesses to stay closed, but many stores were open Friday. State Insurance Commissioner John King and others say they\u2019ve been trying to warn Latinos not to have large gatherings. Fieldale Farms executives said they saw a spike in cases in the weeks after families got together on Easter. \u201cThis community has embraced what we\u2019ve asked them to do, not only in the plants, but in the communities \u2014 with social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, and helping us to flatten the curve and stop the spread,\u201d Kemp said. Concerns have been widespread nationwide about the spread of the virus in meatpacking plants. Poultry plants in Georgia have soldiered on, under orders from President Trump to stay open, even as workers\u2019 groups have voiced concerns that workers could be sacrificed and conditions could lead to widespread outbreaks. \u201cI\u2019m proud of how quickly the industry has responded, but even more so I\u2019m proud of the workers, essential workers, that continue to come to work and provide food for America,\u201d said Georgia Poultry Federation President Mike Giles. Executives at an 800-worker Fieldale Farms plant in Gainesville that prepares chicken slaughtered elsewhere for fast-food restaurants said they have taken typical precautions. Those include having partitions between workers and in breakrooms, taking temperatures of everyone who comes on property and wiping down vending machines and other surfaces. Vice President for Operations John Wright said of 17 cases at the plant, 11 workers have returned to work. The privately held company has seen 200 cases among 5,000 employees in facilities scattered over six Georgia counties, and says 75% have returned to work. Wright said that the company has paid employees with symptoms to stay home for 14 days or more. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to be on what we believe to be the waning end of this pandemic, and we\u2019ll remain vigilant, until it\u2019s eradicated or no more exists,\u201d Wright said. ___ Writer Sudhin Thanawala contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak or https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.

A sort of moving memorial, the parade will feature about 500 members of the public honoring victims of the pandemic, four illuminated floats and an original piece of music performed by Grammy-winning choir \u201cThe Crossing.\u201d \u201cThe parade has turned into an interesting commemorative act,\u201d said Matt Adams, co-founder of Blast Theory, the artists\u2019 group creating the parade. Anyone can sign up to participate and can choose the name of an actual flu victim to honor while marching. Marchers will be given a sign with the name of the person they chose and will move along the parade route flanked by the illuminated sculptures. Members of city\u2019s public health community have been urged to join in. \u201cThis is all about the process of remembering what the risks are in public health, because that is a crucial way for us to stay safe today,\u201d he said. More U.S. soldiers died from the flu than from battles in Europe during the war. It was called the Spanish flu at the time because Spain was neutral during the conflict and had no restrictions on the press, and could therefore report the outbreak freely, said Nancy Hill, special projects manager at the museum. The general public in much of the U.S. was uninformed about the virus because of the crackdown on news and any speech deemed unpatriotic. Speaking of soldiers dying from the flu fell into that category. About 500 million people, or one-third of the world\u2019s population, became infected with the virus. An estimated 20-50 million died around the world, with about 675,000 flu-related deaths in the United States. Troops moving around the globe in crowded ships and trains helped the deadly virus spread as the war dragged on. The exhibit itself will include interactives that allow people to explore their own neighborhoods to see how the flu hit their street, and even their own homes. Among the most poignant artifacts is a selection of Christmas gifts that a woman named Naomi Whitehead Ellis Ford purchased for friends and family, all fitted with handwritten personal notes to the intended recipients. But they were never handed out, because she passed away from the flu on Oct. 21. Hicks hopes visitors take away a sense of the scope of the pandemic and see how the city came together to help each other, and to be vigilant \u2014 getting vaccines, taking common-sense health care measures and staying informed. The museum even threw a health fair in a south Philadelphia neighborhood, offering everything from flu shots to Narcan training. \u201cIt is too easy in the United States to forget,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cCholera, typhus, typhoid fever all mean nothing to most Americans today, but President Lincoln\u2019s son was killed by typhoid fever. From the high and mighty to those whose names aren\u2019t remembered, these diseases were commonplace.

The reporter does a decent job of describing the results, reporting that 12 percent of Avastin patients in the study developed blood clots, a \"\"30\"\" percent higher risk than those who did not take Avastin. This formulation, which appears in the abstract of the study, provides both absolute and relative risks. But ideally the report would have provided a more apples-to-apples comparison of absolute risk, stating that 12 percent of Avastin patients developed blood clots, compared to 8 percent of controls. The story earns an unsatisfactory rating, though, because it reports the findings incorrectly. The study shows the risk linked to Avastin to be 33 percent greater, not 30 percent. Further, the story fails to indicate the differences in risk for different types of cancers, which vary considerably. This is a significant omission. The story exaggerates the risks associated with the use of Avastin. The opening lines note the seriousness of the clots. The study notes a 12% incidence of venous clots in patients treated with Avastin\u2013yet fails to note that only about half required treatment. This leaves the reader with an incorrect belief about the true risk. By overstating the risks of serious blood clot, the story could leave patients who may benefit from treatment with an inaccurate impression of risk vs. benefit. The article is based on an analysis of previous research published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The study author is quoted saying the results are more powerful than individual studies because it takes into account the results of 15 high-quality papers involving almost 8,000 patients. The story might have added that results of meta-analyses are often criticized, and rarely considered definitive, because they combine data from studies that used different methologies. This failure is significant in that it may add an undue degree of importance to the analysis. The article doesn\u2019t exaggerate the severity or prevalence of the cancers Avastin treats. The story cites the study itself, the lead author, a company spokesperson, and one independent clinician. This is adequate sourcing for a story of this length. The story mentions, at least briefly, that Avastin treats cancer via a different mechanism from traditional chemotherapies. But the story falls short of a satisfactory rating by mentioning, only at the end and very briefly, that most Avastin patients also use conventional chemotherapy\u2013and are therefore exposed to all of those side effects as well. This raises, but doesn\u2019t answer, the fundamental question of the overall benefit and overall risk of adding Avastin to treatment. A reader exits the story with an unsettling piece of information that should have been put in context earlier. The article makes clear that Avastin is widely available to and used by cancer patients. The story explained the relative new-ness of the drug.

But it suffers from at least one significant flaw. On the positive side, the story explains the findings in a clear and fair way, with adequate detail, sourcing and context. The story is based on a credible study on a topic relevant to many readers. The reporter follows several practices of good medical reporting, as the ratings show. Having said that, reporting the increased risk as 30 percent rather than 33 percent is an inexplicable, fundamental error. There are two additional problems, however. 1. Some reporting at the end of the story takes up the question of total benefit and total risk for patients who take Avastin, but this could have been explored further. The bottom line most patients and physicians care about isn\u2019t the risk of one side effect. It\u2019s whether taking the drug improves survival. It\u2019s true the meta-analysis did not take up that question. But the story could have explored this matter more thoroughly on the readers\u2019 behalf, and would have put that reporting more at the core of the story, not as going-away thoughts at the end. 2.

The tests are the latest effort by J&J to prove the safety of its widely used consumer product after the test by the FDA prompted J&J to undertake a nationwide recall of one lot of  Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder in October. The FDA was not immediately available for comment. However, in response to an October announcement from J&J that a smaller number of independent tests also found no asbestos, the regulatory agency said it stood by its findings. The different test outcomes could have resulted from the fact that contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and there is no standard test for asbestos in talc, FDA officials told Reuters in October. Tests conducted by the third-party labs showed asbestos was not present in the single bottle that the FDA\u2019s contracted lab had tested, nor was it present in retained samples of the finished lot from which the bottle was produced, the company said on Tuesday. The company said its investigation concluded that the most probable root causes for the FDA\u2019s reported results were either test sample contamination or analyst error at the lab, or both. In October, J&J recalled around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after the FDA said it had found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online. The voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said at the time. That move marked the first time the company recalled its baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma.

An estimated 2.3 million U.S. adults have done tai chi in the past 12 months, according to a 2007 National Health Interview Survey. The practice is not perfect. Tai chi \u201cdoes not supply the cardiovascular component that we\u2019d be looking for in a well-rounded routine,\u201d said Jessica Matthews, a San Diego, California-based exercise physiologist. \u201cThe exertion level, while challenging, is not going to increase your heart rate.\u201d  T\u2019ai chi ch\u2019uan, as it is formally known, derives from a form of Chinese martial arts. Explaining the slow, circular movement of the practice, Rosenfeld said tai chi is a philosophical term that means the harmonious interplay of opposing forces. When nature encounters a strong force, the way it answers that force to maintain harmony in the world is with a spiral, he said. \u201cAstronomers see galaxies moving in spirals, water goes down the drain in a spiral, tornados form as a spiral. We spiral in tai chi because the most effective way to move fluid through solid is a spiral.\u201d  Hawaii-based personal and group-fitness trainer Jordan Forth, who has studied tai chi since 2006, said one translation of tai chi is \u201cgrand ultimate motion.\u201d  \u201cI recommend it to everybody,\u201d said Forth. \u201cIt teaches people to move well in multiple planes of motion with a state of awareness not cultivated in everyday fitness.

The release could have been even even more helpful by adding information showing chest ultrasounds cost about two-and-a-half times less than chest X-rays ($140 versus $370 respectively). The release also might have mentioned that there\u2019s a large initial outlay for ultrasound machines that may make them too expensive in the developing world. Another upfront cost not mentioned is the expense of training emergency medicine physicians (and presumably also internal medicine, pediatric and family medicine physicians) to do this procedure. The release clearly stated that chest ultrasounds effectively diagnosed study patients who had pneumonia as well as chest X-rays. There were 38.8 percent fewer chest X-rays required for a pneumonia diagnosis in the investigational arm of the study compared to the control group of the study. The study also showed that stays in the emergency department by ultrasound-only patients were almost a half-hour shorter than those\u00a0of the control group. We offer a word of caution, however. The release didn\u2019t explain how the pneumonia\u00a0cases\u00a0were actually diagnosed so we cannot determine if the ultrasound really was accurate and effectively diagnosed study patients who had pneumonia. The release points out that there was no increase in adverse events reported during the study, nor were there any cases where pneumonia was not appropriately diagnosed. There is the potential for some harms that aren\u2019t addressed, namely missed diagnosis and the identification of small pneumonias that don\u2019t need to be treated (overdiagnosis). \u201cIn the era of precision medicine, lung ultrasound may also be an ideal imaging option in children who are at higher risk for radiation-induced cancers or have received multiple radiographic or CT imaging studies,\u201d according to the lead study author. This benefit in terms of harms reduction might have been stressed even more. Ultrasound screening could be safer in the long run for children than X-ray since repeated exposure to radiation presents a cumulative risk for cancer. Radiation oncology experts and the FDA have long called for reduced reliance on routine X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) screening in children unless the benefits outweigh the risks. More than 100 professional organizations including pediatricians, radiation physicists and oncologists have signed on to the \u201cImage Gently\u201d campaign which urges the use of ultrasound instead of radiation when feasible. The release makes clear that this was a randomized, controlled trial comparing chest ultrasound versus chest X-rays as a diagnostic tool for identifying pneumonia in young patients. Participants either received an ultrasound possibly followed by a chest X-ray, if needed, in the investigational arm, or a chest X-ray followed by a chest ultrasound in the control group. However, as noted above, it isn\u2019t explained how the pneumonia\u00a0cases\u00a0were actually diagnosed. This reduces the quality of the study. Ultrasound should correctly diagnose the larger pneumonias without problems, but small ones can be missed or they may be overdiagnosed. The published article briefly discusses the lack of accuracy in its discussion section. It appears to rely heavily on a meta-analysis of previous studies involving ultrasound accuracy. The study states: \u201cSecond, we were unable to calculate test performance characteristics adhering to the STARD (Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy studies) statement due to the fact that 38.8% of the subjects in the investigational arm did not receive a CXR [chest x-ray] that would have served as a practical reference standard. By design, our sonologists were not blinded to CXR results in the control arm so that the information could be used to guide treatment. Lack of blinding to a reference standard could be a potential source of bias in calculated test performance characteristics for LUS.\u201d This release doesn\u2019t engage in disease-mongering. The release notes that the study was conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai but doesn\u2019t disclose sponsors or potential conflicts of interest. According to the journal article, one of the researchers has a consulting relationship with an ultrasound company. This should have been included in the release. The release adequately explains that chest X-rays are the diagnostic method of choice for determining cases of pneumonia, according to the World Health Organization. The study\u2019s primary goal was to determine if chest ultrasounds were an adequate alternative to chest X-rays. A non-imaging method used to diagnose pneumonia is a physical examination. The release does make a point that ultrasound technology is widely available in health care facilities around the world. We would have liked for the release to include the fact that in perhaps three-quarters of the world, there is a lack of facilities that can provide even diagnostic X-rays. This fact, attributed to the WHO in the journal article, is absent in the news release. High resolution ultrasound machines would be even further out of reach in these countries. The novelty of a safe and cheaper alternative to expensive radiography that could provide equivalent diagnostic precision is clearly enough to warrant this release. We don\u2019t believe the news release relies on unjustifiable language to summarize the potential benefit of substituting ultrasound over X-Ray in screening for pediatric pneumonia. Claim: Lung ultrasound may be a safe substitute for chest X-ray when diagnosing pneumonia in children", "output": "This Mount Sinai news release describes a small study aimed at testing whether chest ultrasounds are as effective at diagnosing pneumonia in children as chest X-rays, the current diagnostic method of choice. Patients were randomized into either a test group, which received a chest ultrasound and a possible follow-up chest X-ray, versus a control group which received first a chest X-ray and then a chest ultrasound. The release does a good job of explaining the study results, and the potential cost savings here and in lesser-developed countries. Weaknesses are no mention of an investigator\u2019s consulting relationship to an ultrasound company and lack of discussion of study limitations. Pneumonia is the number one killer of children on the planet, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). While chest X-rays are the accepted means of diagnosing pneumonia, WHO points out that in three-quarters of the world, the necessary equipment isn\u2019t available, meaning an alternative that is both more widely available and cheaper than radiography would be\u00a0a great boon for health care.

During a visit to The Villages, a bustling community for adults in Central Florida, Trump was trying to turn attention away from House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry and focus on pocket-book issues instead. \u201cThat\u2019s why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can\u2019t beat us fairly,\u201d he told the friendly audience, which included many seniors. That part of Florida voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016. Health care has emerged as a central issue for Democrats competing for their party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. Much of the debate has centered on Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, which would cover everyone under a government-run plan and eliminate most private insurance. Trump said electing a Democrat would jeopardize seniors\u2019 access to health care. \u201cMedicare is under threat like never before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAlmost every major Democrat in Washington has backed a massive government health care takeover that would totally obliterate Medicare.\u201d Far from \u201cobliterating\u2019\u2019 Medicare, Sanders says his plan would lower costs and provide new benefits, including coverage for long-term care. Medicare, which covers about 60 million seniors and disabled people, is the government\u2019s flagship health care program. Trump also signed an executive order directing his administration to pursue changes to Medicare. Much of what he wants to do is geared toward enhancing Medicare Advantage, the private insurance option picked by about one-third of seniors. Medicare Advantage plans offer savings on premiums and an annual limit on out-of-pocket costs. These plans provide one-stop shopping, eliminating the need for separate supplemental insurance. Offered by major insurers, the plans also cover prescription drugs in most cases. But there are trade-offs. People joining a Medicare Advantage plan generally must accept limits on their choice of hospitals and doctors as well as prior insurer approval for certain procedures. If they change their minds and decide to return to traditional Medicare, they\u2019re not always guaranteed supplemental \u201cMedigap\u201d coverage, which is also private. The president\u2019s order is basically a to-do list for the Department of Health and Human Services that will require months of follow-up. Among the other priorities are an expansion of telemedicine and changes to avoid overpaying for procedures just because they get done in a hospital instead of a doctor\u2019s office. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Trump\u2019s order directs his department to examine whether its current policies and practices put traditional Medicare ahead of the private Medicare Advantage option. Some advocates for older people say that it\u2019s the other way around and that the administration is trying to put private plans ahead. The executive order does not involve a major overhaul of Medicare, which would require congressional approval. So far the debate about Medicare for All has mainly been about its projected costs to the government, estimated at $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years. The Sanders plan would eliminate most private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option. Sanders, who unexpectedly underwent a heart procedure this week, says Medicare for All would nonetheless offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs. Sanders\u2019 style of single-payer health care has long been popular among liberals. But recent polling has shown that a majority of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic prefer expanding coverage by building on the Affordable Care Act, or the Obama-era health law. Trump is asking federal courts to overturn that law as unconstitutional. As a presidential candidate, Trump promised not to cut Medicare. As president, he has avoided calling for privatization of the program, raising the eligibility age beyond 65 or rolling back benefits. But Trump\u2019s latest budget proposed steep cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals and other service providers, prompting protests from the industry and accusations by Democrats that he was going back on his promises to seniors.

Most customers at Grassy Plain Vape & Smoke buy electronic cigarettes to help them quit smoking tobacco, but a growing number are referred by medical marijuana commissaries in the neighborhood \u2013 the nearest is about five miles away. The Osmuns\u2019 experience is becoming more common as the number of U.S. vape shops soars and shop owners seek to capitalize not only on the\u00a0vaping trend, but on the more widespread, and legal, use of medical marijuana. Since 2008, the number of U.S. vape shops has grown to about 8,500, and the sale of electronic cigarettes and supplies climbed to $3.5 billion, according to Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog. She expects U.S. use of e-cigarettes and vaporizers to overtake combustible cigarettes in 10 years. Marijuana represents an additional lucrative market. IBISWorld, a market research firm, projects sales of cannabis for medical use to increase to $13.4 billion in 2020 from $3.6 billion in 2015, largely due to demand from an aging population with conditions such as arthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and glaucoma. GreenWave Advisors, an industry research firm, estimates marijuana sales could reach $35 billion in 2020 if all 50 states legalize marijuana for both medical and recreational uses. Medical marijuana use is permitted in 23 states and the District of Columbia for a number of conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, severe pain and HIV/AIDS, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. Another 15 states allow patients \u2013 often with severe seizure disorders - to use a few strains of cannabis for treatment. Recreational use is legal in Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska. At many vape shops, the new customers are typically older nonsmokers suffering from serious illness, according to vape shop owners, customers and industry experts. Patients and medical marijuana groups say they prefer the vaping device for marijuana rather than smoking because they believe there are lower risks. Some states, including New York and Minnesota, prohibit patients from smoking the cannabis. In a vape device, the cannabis leaves or concentrate are heated to a temperature that\u2019s lower than required for combustion. Vaping devices, which can be as small as a ball point pen, also provide medical marijuana users with more privacy, since the vapor released by the heating device is nearly odorless. \u201cVaporized\u00a0cannabis is a really significant trend in both medical and adult use,\u201d said Christie Lunsford, a Colorado-based consultant who focuses on issues involving cannabis. \u201cIt\u2019s consistent, it\u2019s almost instantaneous, and it\u2019s appropriate for a wide variety of consumers.\u201d  Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Palm Beach Vapors has opened 14 shops and is in the process of starting another eight, said Chip Paul, CEO and co-owner. He told Reuters that 90 percent of the franchisees eventually hope to capitalize on marijuana-related sales. Individual stores pay a $25,000 franchise fee and $50,000 for initial stocking, while Palm Beach Vapors helps train workers and set up the store. Franchisees are on average grossing about $20,000 a month, Paul said. \u201cWe think the cannabis market will mimic and mirror the tobacco market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think they will see this (vapor) as a safer alternative.\u201d  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patients need a doctor\u2019s approval to get the marijuana, which is typically available from state approved dispensaries, private growers, and \u2013 in some instances - their own plants if they can\u2019t afford the cannabis, which is not covered by most insurance plans. At the same time, vaping devices have gone mainstream as the industry pushes them as an alternative to tobacco. Marijuana dispensaries in some states also sell the electronic devices. But vape shops, with their larger selection of devices, have seen an uptick in sales especially from consumers who don\u2019t want to shop at tobacco stores or head shops, which cater more to recreational use. \u201cWe try to steer our patients to someone who will explain to them the different models and find them the one that is right for them,\u201d said JoAnne Leppanen, executive director of the Rhode Island Patient Advocacy Coalition. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily want to go into a place geared for people who want a tie-dyed T-shirt.\u201d  The process can be daunting for someone who is seriously ill and struggles to even hold a device because of tremors, arthritis or other medical conditions. Leppanen said medical marijuana patients \u201cdo not want to be associated with recreational use.\u201d They also want their privacy. Some patients don\u2019t even \u201cwant their cars to be seen in a dispensary parking lot,\u201d she said. Most investments in the future of legal marijuana have focused on growing, branding and technology firms, especially those already producing medical marijuana. A subsidiary of Scotts Miracle-Gro Co, for example, purchased General Hydroponics Inc, which is popular with indoor marijuana growers. A small number of private equity and hedge funds have invested in companies that produce and market the cannabis. Billionaire Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, for example, has invested in Privateer Holdings, which has raised $82 million. Privateer\u2019s portfolio includes companies like Tilray \u2013 a medical cannabis company in Canada \u2013 which has applied for a license in New York. Privateer has also invested in Leafly, a tech company that helps consumers find cannabis information, doctors and stores. By contrast, vape shops are still primarily mom-and-pop operations. VaporFi, one of the largest franchises, has grown in two years to 52 stores. Kevin Cintorino opened Elevated to sell vaping equipment and snacks in Providence, Rhode Island, where medical marijuana users can gather to vape. He came up with the business plan during a college class. \u201cWhy not open a place where we could get the entire patient community together?\u201d he said. John Avey and his father, Dillard, opened in May a Palm Beach Vapors franchise in rural Council Bluffs, Iowa, to supplement income from their seasonal cement business.

The longest life expectancy at birth is for baby girls in Japan, at 87.0 years, and boys in Iceland, at 81.2 years. Japan, Switzerland, Singapore, Italy and Luxembourg rank in the top 10 for both sexes. \u201cThere are major gains in life expectancy in recent decades and they continue,\u201d said Ties Boerma, chief of statistics and information systems at the WHO. The lowest life expectancy is in sub-Saharan Africa, where nine countries have expectancy of less than 55 for babies of both sexes. Lifestyle changes leading to heart problems and other diseases were curbing life expectancy in some cases. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a health transition from success in infectious diseases to more people dying, including at younger ages, from non-communicable diseases,\u201d said Boerma. However, even in the rich countries where people live longest, there is no sign of life expectancy gains slowing down. \u201cIf human life expectancy was capped at population level at around 90 years of life we would expect to see a slowdown as we approach those limits. We\u2019re not seeing that,\u201d said Colin Mathers, coordinator of WHO\u2019s statistics on mortality. For the first time the annual statistics report, the most comprehensive statistical overview of the world\u2019s health, measured \u201cyears of life lost\u201d, a number that takes account of the age when people die as well as the number of deaths, to put more focus on the things that kill more people at a younger age. Years of life lost to diarrhea and respiratory infections, the biggest causes of early deaths in 2000, had fallen by 40 percent and 30 percent respectively by 2012, when ischemic heart disease was the biggest factor in early deaths. Years of life lost to road injuries have also increased by 14 percent between 2000 and 2012 as more people driving in developing countries outweighed gains in road safety elsewhere. Life expectancy at birth has increased in almost every country since 1990, and in almost all cases it was higher in 2012 than in 2011, with Botswana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Syria among the exceptions. Another was Pakistan, where life expectancy averaged 65 years in 2012, down from 67 years in last year\u2019s report. Mathers said that reduction reflected improved data, which revealed child mortality was 30 percent higher than previously thought. The global average life expectancy for a 60-year-old has also increased, with hope of another 20 years in 2012 instead of 18 years in 1990. But not everywhere. In Russia and several other former Soviet states, life expectancy for a 60-year-old was lower in 2012 than in 1990. Mathers said death rates rose fast in the early 1990s, due to cardiovascular disease and injury, both influenced by high rates of binge drinking. Although the death rates have since improved, they have not yet dropped to pre-1990 levels. Russia\u2019s experience surprised epidemiologists who had expected chronic diseases would take a long time to take root. Many countries, especially those recovering from conflict, have also shown that it is possible to make big gains fast. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in many countries a catch-up, really fast progress,\u201d said Boerma. \u201cExamples - Liberia, which has been our fastest catch-up country, but also Rwanda, Cambodia.

A decade ago the industry was forced to climb down in a bruising battle with South Africa over AIDS drugs patents and access to generics. The latest fight reflects tension between an industry that wants to protect its intellectual property, even as it pushes further into emerging markets, and governments from India to Brazil that are determined to increase patients\u2019 access to life-saving treatments. South Africa is in the final stages of implementing a new law that would allow generic drugmakers to produce cut-price copies of patented medicines and make it harder for firms to register and roll over patents. Global drugmakers have drawn up a $600,000 publicity campaign to mobilize local and overseas opposition to the intellectual property (IP) changes, according to a document written by a drugs industry lobby group and seen by Reuters. Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi on Friday lashed out at drugmakers, saying their campaign was aimed at turning South Africans against the government. \u201cIt\u2019s a conspiracy of satanic magnitude,\u201d he said. \u201cThis document can sentence many South Africans to death. This is a plan for genocide.\u201d  The ruling African National Congress is looking to cut healthcare costs as it grapples with the world\u2019s heaviest HIV/AIDS caseloads and its biggest treatment program. The new law is expected to reduce medicine prices and open up a fledgling generic drug industry dominated by Aspen Pharmacare and Adcock Ingram. The policy would also close a loophole known as \u201cever-greening\u201d that allows a drugmaker to make minor changes to an existing drug or discover a new use for it, and then register it as a totally new find. Healthcare activists say South Africa\u2019s track record of approving drug patents - in 2008 it granted more than 2,400 patents compared with fewer than 300 in six years in Brazil - shows the need for reform. The document - prepared by U.S. consultancy Public Affairs Engagement for industry lobby Innovative Pharmaceutical Association South Africa (IPASA) - outlines a plan to delay the reform at least until after South Africa\u2019s elections in early May by suggesting the new law would be politically damaging. \u201cThe world cares that South Africa is proposing to take a wrong turn in economic policy by weakening IP protections. And by cares, we mean both expresses compassionate concern and will take action by reducing investment,\u201d the document reads. IPASA members include drugmakers such as Sanofi, Baxter International, Pfizer and Novartis. IPASA spokeswoman Val Beaumont confirmed the authenticity of the document but said the proposals were still under consideration. \u201cNo part of those proposals have been accepted.

It\u2019s inspired some members of our congregation to install panels on their homes,\u201d Reverend David Lowry said of the \u201csolar cross\u201d mounted in 2009 on the Caloundra Uniting Church, which groups three Protestant denominations. Many religions have been wary of moving to install renewable energy sources on their places of worship, from cathedrals to mosques - or of taking a strong stand on climate change in general - despite teachings that people should be custodians of nature. But slowly, that may be changing, thanks to new religious leaders including Pope Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Francis\u2019s stress on environmental protection since he was elected in March and his choice of the name of a 13th century nature lover - Saint Francis of Assisi - may make a difference for all religions trying to work out how to safeguard the planet from threats including climate change. Under his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, the Vatican took green steps such as installing solar panels on the roof of the Papal Audience Hall in 2008. It says it wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but has no formal target. \u201cReligious environmentalism is slowly increasing,\u201d said John Grim, a coordinator of the forum on religion and ecology at Yale University in the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s very uneven. Religions tend to be very conservative in their practice and doctrine.\u201d  Grim said the pope\u2019s influence was significant since few other religions recognize a single earthly leader - and there are 1.2 billion Catholics, amounting to a sixth of humanity, according to the Vatican. In his inaugural homily, Pope Francis stressed that people should safeguard the Earth. \u201cLet us be \u2018protectors\u2019 of creation, protectors of God\u2019s plan inscribed in nature, protectors of one another and of the environment. Let us not allow omens of destruction and death to accompany the advance of this world!\u201d he said. In a 2010 book \u201cOn Heaven and Earth\u201d, when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, he said mankind sometimes lost respect for nature. \u201cThen ecological problems arise, like global warming.\u201d  Some religions have been reluctant to be associated with climate change policies because of divisions among believers. A 2012 Pew Research Center poll showed that only 42 percent of Americans agree global warming is mainly man-made, a view overwhelmingly held by climate scientists, for example. The Church of England says it aims to cut its carbon emissions by 42 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050 across widely varying energy use in 16,000 buildings, but it is an exception. \u201cSome churches are used all week and others used very occasionally, with only one light bulb,\u201d said David Shreeve, environmental advisor to the Archbishops\u2019 Council. He said other religions were now asking for advice on emissions cuts. Irrespective of climate change, big savings can be made by plugging draughts and improving heating and lighting. Some believers object that solar panels can damage or disfigure fragile historic buildings. Some cathedrals, like the Catholic Saint Stephens in Vienna, have elaborate patterns on the roof. Bradford Cathedral, where the oldest parts of the Nave date from 1458, installed solar panels in 2011 and said it was the first cathedral in England - and perhaps in the world - to generate its own power. Among other examples, a planned mosque in Bursa, west Turkey, aims to use solar panels and install a vertical axis wind turbine - without big revolving blades - on a minaret. \u201cMosques ... can be covered with photovoltaic panels,\u201d the mosque\u2019s architect \u00c7elik Erengezgin said. Green initiatives by religious leaders and groups are not new. The Jewish Temple Emanuel in Lowell, Mass., installed solar panels in 1978 in what is believed to be the first such system on a religious building in North America, the Lowell Green Building Commission says. And Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians, has long been called the \u201cGreen Patriarch\u201d for seeking to protect the environment, from organizing conferences about fresh water to writing an encyclical in 2012 urging repentance for \u201cour sinfulness in destroying the world\u201d. Saint Francis has long been a green inspiration. In what are known as the Assisi Declarations from 1986, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish and Islamic leaders called for people to live in harmony with nature. Baha\u2019i, Jainism and Sikhism later added their own declarations. In the United States, many evangelical Christians stress a broad need for \u201cstewardship of creation\u201d, rather than man-made climate change, as a spur to action. Many evangelical Christians are Republicans who are more likely than Democrats to doubt that climate change is mostly caused by human activity, such as burning fossil fuels. \u201cAmericans allow their politics to inform their faith,\u201d said Katharine Hayhoe, an evangelical Christian and climate scientist at Texas Tech University. In Australia, Lowry said the solar panels were saving money and cutting greenhouse gas emissions for the Uniting Church, which brings together Methodists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians. \u201cThe solar cross ... doesn\u2019t bring hordes of people into the church,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it helps people understand that God is a presence in the world in which we live.\u201d  The Vatican has an observer seat at U.N. talks among 200 nations who have agreed to work out, by the end of 2015, a climate deal to avert more floods, droughts and rising sea levels. Pope Francis himself has focused on environmental protection without yet spelling out clear solutions. Raising awareness of the environment could be a step to modernize the Church, besieged by scandal for covering up sexual abuse of children by priests and whose strict moral traditions are often at odds with a increasingly secular society. \u201cWith Pope Francis there is new hope,\u201d said Reverend Henrik Grape of the Church of Sweden, who is also a member of the World Council of Churches\u2019 climate change group.

In two patients who got a medium dose of the treatment, urine levels of large sugar compounds that are hallmarks of Hunter syndrome had fallen by half, on average, four months later \u2014 a possible sign the treatment is working. Two others who got a low dose have seen little change in these sugars so far. There\u2019s no way to know yet whether the change in the middle-dose patients is due to the gene editing or something else, but the fact their sugars have declined consistently since treatment suggests it might be. \u201cI cannot absolutely say it\u2019s a treatment effect\u201d but the drop is \u201creally encouraging,\u201d said the study leader, Dr. Joseph Muenzer of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The main goal of early treatment studies is to test safety, though researchers also look for hints that the therapy is working. Muenzer gave the results at a conference in Greece and consults for the treatment\u2019s maker, California-based Sangamo Therapeutics. The company\u2019s president, Dr. Sandy Macrae, said tests in about five months will reveal more, but the change in the middle-dose group so far \u201clooks really good.\u201d \u201cThe most rational explanation for this is that what we hoped was going to happen has happened,\u201d he said. Several independent experts agreed. \u201cThe results are exciting\u201d and suggest that the gene editing is working to some degree, without safety concerns so far, said Dr. Howard Kaufman, a Boston scientist and member of a National Institutes of Health panel that reviewed the study before it began. Dr. Matthew Porteus, a genetics expert at Stanford University who consults for two other companies developing gene therapies, said more time is needed to see how the patients\u2019 immune system continues to react to the treatment and whether the effects last, but added, \u201cI would be excited about continuing to push along\u201d based on these results. HOW IT WORKS Gene editing is intended as a more precise way to do gene therapy, to knock out a bad gene or supply a good one that\u2019s missing. Doctors hope it will give a way to address a host of diseases that can\u2019t be treated well now. In November, a Phoenix-area man with Hunter syndrome, Brian Madeux, became the first person to test this inside the body. He lacks a gene that makes an enzyme that breaks down certain large sugar compounds called GAGs. These build up in cells and cause havoc throughout the body. Through an IV, Madeux received many copies of a corrective gene and a gene-editing tool called zinc finger nucleases to help put it in a precise spot in his DNA. He was one of the two patients given a very low dose of the treatment, because this first-in-human testing called for extreme caution. EARLY RESULTS In Madeux and the other low-dose patient, levels of the tell-tale sugar compounds in urine rose 9 percent on average after four months. Muenzer said it\u2019s hard to know whether this is a significant change; little is known about the biology of these compounds, including whether they fluctuate during the day or before or after meals. A liver biopsy on one patient given a low dose of the therapy found no evidence that the gene editing had occurred, but Sangamo scientists said this dose is far below the level at which such signs had been detected in research on primates. Two other patients were given a middle dose that was twice what the first two patients received. Their GAG levels declined by 51 percent after four months, on average. Two of the main types of these sugars that accumulate in tissues declined 32 percent and 61 percent, respectively. It is not yet known if declines like these can improve patients\u2019 health or slow the progression of the disease. \u201cThis is not proof that this is a successful therapy yet, that these patients had enough gene editing to now supply them with the enzyme they need for the rest of their life,\u201d Muenzer said. But he said an important goal was met: the treatment seems safe. There were two serious side effects \u2014 one patient was hospitalized for bronchitis and another for an irregular heartbeat \u2014 but those were deemed due to their disease and pre-existing conditions, not the gene treatment. Blood tests did not detect the missing enzyme. Company scientists said this could be because any that was being made was rapidly used by cells rather than getting into the bloodstream \u2014 an explanation some outside experts agreed with. What counts, they said, was seeing the result of enzyme activity, the drop in sugars. NEXT STEPS Two more patients have been given the highest dose being tested \u2014 10 times the starting dose \u2014 for a total of six patients in the study. The next step is to start taking patients off the weekly enzyme treatments they\u2019ve been receiving to see if the gene therapy has changed their bodies so they make enough of the enzyme themselves. More results are expected at a medical meeting in February. \u201cWe need to see sustained levels for this to be practical. If this only works for six months, that\u2019s not very beneficial,\u201d Muenzer said. \u201cTime\u2019s going to tell.\u201d In an interview at his home in Arizona last month, Madeux, 45, told The Associated Press he volunteered for the study in hope of being able to stop the weekly, three-hour enzyme infusions, but also to help find a treatment for future generations with the disease. \u201cI\u2019m old and having Hunter\u2019s has done a lot of damage to my body,\u201d Madeux said. \u201cI\u2019m actually pretty lucky I\u2019ve lived this long.\u201d ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP . ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Along with his brother, Tom, and former Fetzer Vineyards winemaker Paul Dolan he bought the Parducci Wine Cellars and revived the wine\u2019s reputation. He also used his background in horticulture to design a wetland area in the middle of the vineyard to reclaim wastewater, which is a byproduct of wine making. \u201cWhat I run into constantly are people who say \u2018I wish I could be environmental, but I can\u2019t afford to be,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is always clear to me that they haven\u2019t figured out that being environmental is being efficient. And when you\u2019re efficient, money drops to the bottom line.\u201d   Water is a concern in California, where there is always a shortage. Wineries can produce hundreds of thousands of gallons of wastewater, mostly from the grape-crush, tank and barrel cleaning and bottling operations. Wastewater contains the grapes\u2019 natural sugars that deplete the water\u2019s oxygen. Thornhill designed a system of gravity-fed tanks and trickle towers made from old wooden slats that oxygenate the water. The result is a small wetlands area and a pond that ducklings seem to favor. \u201cWhen you start seeing life, you know your water is getting clean and you look in here between the beautiful green filaments of algae, the duckweed, the rushes, the insects, the birds we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ve got life,\u201d he explained. The water will be used for drip irrigation in the vineyards, to hose down redwood tanks where the wine ages slowly in large lots and it will be reclaimed to start the cycle all over. Unlike Thornhill\u2019s vineyards, Chiarito Vineyards uses natural rainfall and runoff for its much smaller production. \u201cThis is dry farmed. There is no drip irrigation. There\u2019s no nothing. They are totally dependent on the spring rains and the runoff from the mountains,\u201d John Chiarito said. As a result, the vines send their roots down into the volcanic ash that lies under a topsoil of river deposits and sandstone. With a yield of less than three tons of grapes per acre, Chiarito estimated he makes about 800 cases of Zinfandel and Nero d\u2019Avola. It all started 20 years ago when he bought an abandoned walnut orchard and planted Zinfandel vines in \u201cthe old style, eight by eight foot spacing, head-trained. No wires.\u201d   Chiarito farms organically, but his wine is not certified because he said it involves too much paperwork. Last week the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and the Department of Agriculture issued new rules to clarify what wineries must do to use the word organic on their labels.

Comparing the report to a health checkup, four researchers and several outside experts described Earth\u2019s prognosis as \u201cguarded.\u201d \u201cThere are some very severe warning signs, but there are some hopeful indicators too,\u201d said co-author Dr. Howard Frumkin, a professor of environmental health at the University of Washington. \u201cGiven the right treatment and aggressive efforts to prevent things from getting worse, I think there\u2019s hope.\u201d The report highlighted health problems stemming from more frequent heat waves, disease spread by insects, air pollution and other woes. While the disasters have been costly, deaths haven\u2019t been increasing because society is doing a better but more expensive job adjusting to the changing conditions, the researchers noted. A team of 63 doctors, public health officials and scientists from around the world wrote what they considered the first of a regular monitoring of the health of the planet, similar to having a \u201cfinger on the pulse of the patient,\u201d said Dr. Hugh Montgomery, an intensive care specialist and director of the University College of London\u2019s Institute for Health and Performance. Based on 40 indicators, the study said \u201cthe human symptoms of climate change are unequivocal and potentially irreversible.\u201d While other disease rates are dropping, cases of dengue fever \u2014 a mosquito-borne disease \u2014 has doubled every decade since 1990 with 58.4 million cases and 10,000 deaths in 2013. Frumkin, a former environmental health director at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said climate change, which allows mosquitoes to live in more places and stay active longer with shorter freeze seasons, is part but not all of the reason. The same goes for the increase in tick-borne Lyme disease in the United States, Frumkin said, adding \u201cthe ticks do better with warmer weather.\u201d Between 2000 and last year, the number of vulnerable people \u2014 those over 65 or with chronic disease \u2014 exposed to heat waves increased by about 125 million, the study said. It also highlighted the increasing likelihood of food shortages as climate change worsens. Columbia University\u2019s Madeline Thomson, who wasn\u2019t part of the study team, praised the work, saying \u201cclimate is a stress multiplier\u201d so it is important to monitor this way. Acting on climate can have side benefits, Frumkin said. Cutting coal takes smog and soot out of the air,  while eating less meat and bicycling and walking more to use less electricity means fewer accidents and reduced obesity, he said. ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears.

People with dyslexia have difficulties with reading, spelling, writing and pronouncing words. About one-fifth of people with severe dyslexia learn to read. Hoeft and colleagues wanted to see what was occurring in the brain in these students. They studied 45 teens aged 11 to 14 who took a battery of tests to determine their reading abilities. Based on these, they classified 25 of them as dyslexics. The team used two different imaging techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging, which measures oxygen used by the brain during different activities, and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging or DTI, which reveals connections between brain areas. The researchers then showed the teens different pairs of words and asked then to identify which ones rhymed, even though they were spelled differently. They found that about half of the children who were dyslexic had extra activity in a part of the brain near the right temple known as the right inferior frontal gyrus. And some of the children with dyslexia had stronger connections in a network of brain fibers that links the front and the back of the brain. When they checked these same children two and a half years later, they found children who had this unusual brain activity were more likely to have learned to  read than other dyslexics. Paper and pencil tests typically used for these children, however, were unable to predict which students would succeed. \u201cThe reason this is exciting is that until now, there have been no known measures that predicted who will learn to compensate,\u201d Hoeft said. Alan Guttmacher, director the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, one of the National Institutes of Health, said the finding gives insight into how certain people with dyslexia compensate for reading problems. \u201cLearning why other individuals have difficulty compensating may lead to new treatments to help them overcome reading disability,\u201d Guttmacher, whose agency funded the study, said in a statement.

The decision is a blow to major pharmaceutical companies which had lobbied hard to reverse the CL policy launched by the previous government appointed after a bloodless 2006 coup. The three drugs are Letrozole, a breast cancer medicine made by Novartis AG, the breast and lung cancer drug Docetaxel by Sanofi-Aventis, and Roche\u2019s Erlotinib, used for treating lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. A license issued on a leukemia drug, Glivec, was cancelled last month after its maker, Novartis, agreed to supply it free to hundreds of Thai patients. Shortly after a democratically-elected government took power in February, Chaiya ordered the review of a policy he said was a \u201cpolitically correct decision, but not legally correct\u201d. At the time he said the government could afford the full cost of the drugs, if it meant avoiding trade retaliation by the United States, home to some of the world\u2019s biggest drug firms. U.S. officials denied there were any plans to impose sanctions on Bangkok, although Thailand was placed on a watch list, meaning Washington believed its respect for patents had weakened. When Chaiya, a businessman with no medical training, fired the Health Ministry\u2019s top official negotiating cheaper prices from foreign drug firms, outraged health activists and doctors launched a campaign to remove him. Chaiya said on Monday the ministry would buy cheaper versions of the cancer drugs from generic producers, such as Indian firms which already supply copy-cat HIV-AIDS medicines to Thailand. Under World Trade Organisation rules, countries can issue a compulsory license to make or buy generic versions of patented drugs deemed critical to public health as long as the medicines are meant for domestic use. Former Health Minister Mongkol na Songkhla overrode Merck\u2019s AIDS drug Efavirenz in late 2006, arguing that Thailand could not afford patented drugs for a national health plan that covers about 80 percent of the country\u2019s 63 million people. A few months later he did the same on a Sanofi-Aventis heart medicine and an AIDS drug made by Abbott Laboratories, which refused to register several new medicines in Thailand. Mongkol, who targeted the four cancer drugs weeks before he left office, has defended the CL policy against major drug firms which accused him of stealing their intellectual property rights.

Roy Barnes says. And that means corporations are reluctant to relocate here and give you jobs. It's because your state Legislature has done some wacky things, according to the Democrat's latest campaign commercial, \"\"Travel for Jobs.\"\" In this bid to win his old job back, Barnes took us on a trip down memory lane to recall some of the Legislature's stranger moments. \"\"[I]t's hard for industry to take us seriously when the Legislature attempts to outlaw stem cell research, passes bills about microchips in the brain and talks about seceding from the union,\"\" an announcer said in the ad. Wait. Microchips? In the brain? And secession? Recently? The Barnes campaign sent us information on all three legislative attempts. All passed the Senate, then withered in the House. On stem cell research:  The campaign cited 2009's Senate Bill 169, the Ethical Treatment of Human Embryos Act, sponsored by state Sen. Ralph Hudgens of Hull. Typically, when people discuss the stem cell research controversy, they're talking about \"\"embryonic\"\" stem cell research, which can destroy the embryo. This poses ethical problems for people who regard a human embryo as a human life. The legislation stated that the creation of all embryos \"\"shall be solely for the purposes of initiating a human pregnancy.\"\" This means it would have barred scientists from creating human embryos for research. The bill does not ban embryonic stem cell research involving already-existing stem cell lines or lines from out of state. This was by design, Hudgens told PolitiFact Georgia. It passed the state Senate March 12, 2009. So state legislators did try to \"\"outlaw\"\" an important element of embryonic stem cell research, but not all of it. On microchips in the brain:   Barnes cited SB 235, the Microchip Consent Act of 2010, sponsored by state Sen. Chip Pearson, a Republican from Dawsonville. It would have made it a misdemeanor to require a person to be implanted with the device beneath or in the skin. This includes the brain. Proponents had no evidence of large-scale abuses of the technology. \"\"This is proactive,\"\" state Rep. Ed Setzler, who pushed the bill in the House, said at the time. It passed the Senate on Feb. 4. Therefore, while the state Senate did not pass \"\"bills\"\" on \"\"microchips in the brain,\"\" it did pass one of them. And that one only cleared one chamber of the Legislature. On seceding from the Union:  The Barnes camp pointed PolitiFact Georgia to Senate Resolution 632, which was also sponsored by Pearson. He could not be reached to clarify the bill's intent, so we analyzed the language ourselves and read an op-ed he wrote that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The six-page resolution does not specifically mention \"\"secession,\"\" but it does lay out how and when states would do it. If the federal government creates laws that states think overstep its constitutional authority, they can \"\"nullify\"\" those laws, or declare them void. Here's where the possibility of secession comes into play. The bill lists six types of laws that, if enacted, would prompt the dissolution of the United States. Some, such as the declaration of martial law, are remote possibilities. Others are not, such as laws that limit the right to bear arms, \"\"including prohibitions of type or quantity of arms or ammunition.\"\" If such laws are passed, the federal government's powers would revert to the states, according to the resolution. States that want to form a new United States can do so. The rest can go off on their own. The resolution passed the state Senate April 1, 2009. In Pearson's op-ed, he disagreed with critics who said that the bill \"\"will likely lead Georgia to secede from and disband the United States.\"\" It is an \"\"extreme view\"\" and \"\"loose interpretation of the measure's language.\"\" That may be true, but whether the bill makes secession \"\"likely\"\" is a separate issue. The bill opens the door to it. Or as Barnes' commercial said, it \"\"talks about seceding from the Union.\"\" We find that Barnes' ad is not entirely correct but does say many accurate things. Georgia's state Senate did try to outlaw types of embryonic stem cell research, though not all of it, as the ad suggests. It passed a law -- not \"\"laws\"\" -- on \"\"microchips in the brain.\"\" And while a bill didn't use the word \"\"secession,\"\" it raised the possibility and outlined what would trigger it.

It might have been helpful to say \"\"half the men survived at least\"\" rather than \"\"median survival was.\"\" The story lists the serious side effects reported in the trial and the fact that earlier trials raised worries about strokes related to treatment. Although this story, like the USA Today report that we reviewed, stated in the lead that patients receiving Provenge lived four months longer without specifying that it was four months longer than placebo, not standard therapy, it does a better job of detailing the available results. The story improperly compares the reported survival advantage of the experimental treatment to the expected survival of men receiving standard chemotherapy, implying the two treatments have been tested head-to-head. The story also includes speculation that Provenge could be more effective when given earlier in the course of the disease, even though there is no evidence to support the statement.

The story did not refer to the stock price jump earlier this month that followed the vague company announcement at a meeting with analysts claiming that the treatment extended patient survival. The story mentions that chemotherapy with Taxotere is the only approved treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer.

The story meets most of our criteria, and, thus, gets a high rating. But it has its flaws. The quotes in this story almost uniformly praise the drug as an advance or even groundbreaking. Only one comment suggests questions remain about side effects. None highlights the point that despite treatment, two out of three participants died within three years. While other stories quoted experts who called the results an \"\"incremental\"\" advance, no such cautionary perspectives were included in this story. The reporter erred by comparing survival data from this Provenge trial to the typical results of standard chemotherapy. Since the trial merely compared Provenge to placebo, not to standard treatment, it is inappropriate to claim the experimental drug is superior. Rather than raising expectations by saying doctors \"\"hope for even greater benefit if they give the drug earlier,\"\" the story should have simply stated that it is not known what effect this treatment might have if given earlier in the course of prostate cancer.

Rossello acknowledged Puerto Rico remains vulnerable to another major storm. He said the government has improved its communication systems and established a network to distribute food and medicine, but he noted that there are still 60,000 homes without a proper roof and that the power grid is still unstable. \u201cA lesson from this is that efforts for assistance and recovery need to focus as much as possible on lower-income areas, on people who are older, who are more vulnerable,\u201d said Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken institute. Tuesday\u2019s finding is almost twice the government\u2019s previous estimate, included in a recent report to Congress, that there were 1,427 more deaths than normal in the three months after the storm. The George Washington researchers said the official count from the Sept. 20 hurricane was low in part because doctors were not trained in how to classify deaths after a disaster. The number of deaths from September 2017 to February 2018 was 22 percent higher than during the same period in previous years, Goldman said. Donald Berry, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who was not involved in the study, told The Associated Press in an email that he believes the report is more accurate than the one released by Harvard investigators in May that estimated up to 4,600 more deaths than usual occurred. He said the data sources used by George Washington also are better, \u201cbut its accuracy is not as great as they advertise.\u201d \u201cIf the true number of deaths attributable to Maria turns out to be 2,000 then I would not be surprised,\u201d he said.

Shortly after the storm, when the official death toll stood at 16, President Donald Trump marveled over the small loss of life compared to that of \u201ca real catastrophe like Katrina.\u201d Hurricane Katrina, which struck New Orleans in 2005, was directly responsible for about 1,200 deaths, according to the National Hurricane Center. That does not include indirect deaths of the sort the George Washington researchers counted in Puerto Rico.

Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat, said the report shows the U.S. government failed the people of Puerto Rico. \u201cThese numbers are only the latest to underscore that the federal response to the hurricanes was disastrously inadequate and, as a result, thousands of our fellow American citizens lost their lives,\u201d she said in a statement. There is no national standard for how to count disaster-related deaths. While the National Hurricane Center reports only direct deaths, such as those caused by flying debris or drowning, some local governments may include indirect deaths from such things as heart attacks and house fires. Researchers with George Washington said they counted deaths over the span of six months \u2014 a much longer period than usual \u2014 because so many people were without power during that time. \u201cThat caused a number of issues,\u201d Goldman said, explaining that people were forced to exert themselves physically or were exposed to intense heat without fans or air conditioning. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly striking that you have so many households without electricity for so long. That\u2019s unusual in the U.S. after a disaster.\u201d Power has not yet been fully restored to Puerto Rico nearly a year after the hurricane, and outages remain common. Puerto Rico\u2019s government released data in June showing increases in several illnesses in 2017 that could have been linked to the storm: Cases of sepsis, a serious bloodstream infection usually caused by bacteria, rose from 708 in 2016 to 835 last year. Deaths from diabetes went from 3,151 to 3,250, and deaths from heart illnesses increased from 5,417 to 5,586. Bethzaida Rosado said government and health care officials were not prepared for the storm, and she is still angry her 76-year-old mother died because oxygen tanks were not available on the island after the hurricane. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to see your mother run out of oxygen?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t wish that on anyone.\u201d Months ago, the Rossello administration stopped updating its official death toll at 64 and ordered the independent investigation amid suspicions the dead were substantially undercounted. The first phase of the study cost $305,000. In the second phase, the researchers plan to focus on the causes of death. The researchers found that the risk of death was 45 percent higher for those living in impoverished communities, and that men over 65 saw a continuous elevated risk of death. They also reported that physicians and others told them that Puerto Rico\u2019s government did not notify them about federal guidelines on how to document deaths related to a major disaster. \u201cOthers expressed reluctance to relate deaths to hurricanes due to concern about the subjectivity of this determination and about liability,\u201d the report said. For the study, the researchers reviewed mortality data from July 2010 to February 2018. They also took into account an 8 percent drop in Puerto Rico\u2019s population in the six months after the storm, when tens of thousands fled because of the damage. However, they did not share details of their methodology, saying those will be released if the study is published in a scientific journal. \u201cWe did not cherry-pick, I can promise you,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cWe used very rigorous methodology.\u201d The study also found that government emergency plans in place when Maria hit were not designed for hurricanes greater than a Category 1. Maria was a Category 4 with 154 mph winds. Damage was estimated at more than $100 billion. The researchers made several recommendations, including more emergency planning and government training for doctors on filling out death certificates. They also said the public health system needs to be strengthened, though Goldman said they don\u2019t know yet whether those weaknesses contributed to storm-related deaths. Rossello pledged to carry out the recommendations, though there are questions about Puerto Rico\u2019s ability to do so. The island is trying to restructure a portion of its more than $70 billion public debt amid a 12-year recession.

The American Stroke Association is a division of the American Heart             Association. In an article published in February of 2003, the ASA says that a             60-second test can help determine whether someone may be             experiencing a stroke. The three question test has been used by             health care professionals as an initial way of determining whether             someone may be experiencing a stroke. But a research project by North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of             Medicine in Chapel Hill, N.C. looked into the question of whether             non-medical professionals could administer the short test and             correctly identify the symptoms of a possible stroke. The conclusions was yes, that bystanders could be helpful in             determining whether a person is experiencing a stroke. One of the reasons they looked into it was to see whether bystanders             could be helpful to a 9-1-1 dispatcher in helping narrow down what             is happening to a potential patient. The three questions given to the suspected stroke sufferers were: Can you raise your arms and keep them up?Can you smile?Can you repeat a simple sentence? The study found that when non-medical volunteers were asked by a             telephone dispatcher to administer the test, they correctly             identified the symptoms 96 percent of the time\u2026especially the             raising of the arms and the speaking of a simple sentence. They were less effective in evaluating whether there was facial             weakness in a smile, probably because of not knowing what the             person\u2019s normal smile looked like. Doctors caution that this does not mean that citizens should             try to diagnose stroke symptoms themselves.This study focused on citizens who were being given instruction over             the telephone by emergency dispatchers. Any sign of weakness in the face, slurred speech, or weakness or             numbness in the limbs should be evaluated by medical professionals             immediately. If stroke victims are given proper help within 3 hours of the             stroke, the ability to recover is greatly increased.

Wisconsin witnessed a historic set of nine recall elections in the summer of 2011. Voters removed two Republican state senators from office. But Ryan, whose city calls itself the bratwurst capital of the world, claims his removal would be unique -- partly because it would not involve a recall. On Aug. 15, 2011, the Sheboygan Common Council launched a process that could eventually take Ryan, who has resisted calls to resign, out of office. If the move plays out, Ryan essentially would be put on trial with the council acting as judge and jury, according to a Sheboygan Press article and Sheboygan City Attorney Steve McLean. Ryan made his claim to aldermen during the Aug. 15 council meeting, according to WBAY-TV in Green Bay. \"\"This whole thing stinks. If you want to take me out of office, by all means start your recall,\"\" he said. \"\"If you want to go down this path, it's not a threat, it's a fact, it's never been done. There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office. I'm here to do a job. I will continue to do that job. You should know by now, I never quit. Ever.\"\" For us, the key claim is this sentence:  \"\"There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office.\"\" Never is a long time. Ryan didn\u2019t return our call and emails over two days asking him to clarify his claim and to provide evidence for it. \"\"Public official,\"\" for example, could mean an elected official or an appointed one, such as a school superintendent. But our sense is Ryan was referring to elected officials like himself being removed by a governmental body, and not the voters. Ryan has argued that his drinking -- he has admitted to being an alcoholic -- has not affected his duties as mayor. The saga in Sheboygan, a Lake Michigan community of about 50,000 people 60 miles north of Milwaukee, began in September 2009, six months after Ryan, 48, was elected mayor. He called a news conference to apologize for making a sexually explicit remark about his wife\u2019s sister. Ryan\u2019s remark was captured on video, posted on YouTube, became fodder for Jay Leno and led the Common Council to censure him. The drama intensified in July 2011, when news surfaced that Ryan was issued a warning by police after a weekend of drinking at taverns in Elkhart Lake, becoming rude and obnoxious and passing out at least once. The Common Council voted to begin the removal process after Ryan refused its call to resign. To see whether Ryan\u2019s claim is correct, we contacted a number of experts. They include state government entities -- the Legislative Reference Bureau, the Historical Society, the Department of Public Instruction and the Judicial Commission; statewide associations -- the League of Municipalities, the Counties Association and the Association of School Boards; political scientists -- Dennis Dresang of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Joe Heim of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse; and Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Here\u2019s what we found:  Fatal shooting: In 1842, six years before Wisconsin became a state, James Vineyard, a member of the Territorial Legislature\u2019s version of the state Senate, shot and killed fellow member Charles C.P. Arndt during an argument after a legislative session adjourned. Vineyard was expelled from the legislature after it refused to accept his resignation, although he was acquitted of manslaughter at trial, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau and the Wisconsin Historical Society. Given that the shooting occurred on the legislative floor, it could be fairly argued that the removal was related to misconduct in office. So, that one does not directly undercut Ryan\u2019s claim. Felony crimes: At least four state lawmakers have been removed from office after being convicted of a felony. But under state law, the expulsions were automatic -- no action needed to be taken by the Legislature -- so that makes their removals different than Ryan\u2019s would be. Crimes not directly related to official duties also have led to removals that were not automatic. For example, the New Holstein School Board fired Christopher J. Nelson, the district\u2019s superintendent, after he was charged in February 2011 with trying to set up a sexual encounter with a person he thought was a 15-year-old boy. That could undercut Ryan\u2019s claim, but Nelson was an appointed official, not elected. Non-criminal removal: In 1992, the state Supreme Court removed Racine County Circuit Court Judge Jon Skow from the bench after he admitted he was permanently disabled from stress and depression. The high court determined that Skow, who suffered from alcoholism, could not carry out his duties. He previously had been suspended following a number of incidents, including leaving the bench during a trial. That case does undercut Ryan\u2019s claim, since the judge was not removed for malfeasance in office. As rare as removals from office appear to be, at least two other Wisconsin mayors have been targeted for removal since 2008. The Common Council in Montello, 60 miles north of Madison, removed Mayor Frank Breitenbach in August 2008 for reasons related to misconduct in office, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. He faced 15 allegations by city employees and residents, including using profanity with employees and threatening to fire Montello's police chief without legal authority. In Marinette, a Lake Michigan community 120 miles north of Sheboygan, a Common Council committee recommended hiring a special prosecutor in an effort to remove Mayor Robert Harbick from office. Harbick had pleaded no contest to first-offense drunken-driving, which is a traffic violation in Wisconsin. But the removal process failed to proceed when the proposal to hire the attorney failed in a 4-4 vote before the full council in August 2011. Let\u2019s review what we\u2019ve found. The embattled Sheboygan mayor said no public official in Wisconsin has ever been removed from office \"\"for anything but malfeasance in office.\"\" Ryan\u2019s reference was not to recall elections or automatic removal, but removal by a governmental body such as a city council. Our sense is it\u2019s likely the mayor was speaking of elected officials, and we could find only one instance, involving a judge, in which a removal was not for misconduct in office. We also found a school superintendent fired by a school board following the filing of criminal charges, but he did not hold an elected position. This is a statement we could revisit if more information surfaces; after all we\u2019re talking about more than 150 years of history and countless governmental entities in Wisconsin. For now, we feel Ryan\u2019s statement needs a little clarification, but is essentially accurate -- our definition of .\" Claim: \"Outside of recall elections, \"\"there's never been a public official removed from office\"\" in Wisconsin \"\"for anything but malfeasance in office.\"", "output": "Sheboygan Mayor Bob Ryan says no public official in Wisconsin has been removed from office for reasons other than malfeasance", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

The technique involves intervening in the fertilisation process to remove mitochondria, which act as tiny energy-generating batteries inside cells, and which, if faulty, can cause fatal heart problems, liver failure, brain disorders, blindness and muscular dystrophy. The treatment is known as \u201cthree-parent\u201d IVF because the babies, born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor. Research teams around the world have tested and trialled the techniques in a series of pre-clinical experiments, but as yet they have not been used to treat patients in Britain. The world\u2019s first and so-far only known mitochondrial transfer baby was born earlier this year after U.S. doctors working at a clinic in Mexico helped a Jordanian couple conceive using the new three-way treatment. In Britain, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) will decide whether to issue the first licence to a clinic.

The eggs were sold to retailers and food service operators in plastic pails and could be used in products like salads. The CDC said retailers and food service operators should wash and sanitize any surfaces that may have come in contact with the eggs or packaging, since listeria can spread easily. The warning does not apply to Almark\u2019s hard-boiled eggs sold directly to consumers. Nor does it apply to eggs hard-boiled at home or in restaurants and stores. The CDC also said people at higher risk for listeria should confirm whether a store or restaurant is using Almark\u2019s eggs before buying or ordering products with hard-boiled eggs. If the store or restaurant does not know, officials say not to buy the product. Pregnant women and people with cancer are 10 times more likely than others to get a listeria infection, while people on dialysis are 50 times more likely, the agency said.

Amazon, owned by the richest man in the world, is soliciting PUBLIC DONATIONS to pay sick leave for contract drivers who contract COVID-19This is not a jokehttps://t.co/YAYeLo5Jak\u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) March 24, 2020Alongside a screenshot and a link to a longer claim, Legum began a thread:1. Amazon, owned by the richest man in the world, is soliciting PUBLIC DONATIONS to pay sick leave for contract drivers who contract COVID-19This is not a joke2. Amazon has one of the worst policies for workers who contract COVID-19. Requires a positive test or a formal quarantine order to get paid.But contractors have it even worse. They have to apply for a \u201cgrant\u201d from the Amazon Relief Fund.3. Amazon gave $25 million to the Amazon Relief Fund and then solicited donations for more.Apparently someone realized this looked bad so later they added language saying the \u201caren\u2019t expecting\u201d anyone to donate.4. There is a lot of talk about PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY during this crisis. That\u2019s important.But equally important is CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY.That\u2019s the mission of my newsletter, Popular Information.\u2026 5. A broader point: If you are delivering packages for Amazon and contract COVID-19 you should not be forced to APPLY FOR A GRANT to get paid while you recover.It\u2019s ghoulish.6. As a result of the pandemic, Amazon\u2019s business is booming. It is likely to permanently benefit from this crisis. The absolute least it can do is take care of the workers that make its service possible.7. UPDATE: Amazon has responded and they say that it is COMPLETELY NORMAL for a company with $281 billion of revenue last year to require workers who contract a potentially-deadly virus to APPLY FOR A GRANT to get paid while they are quarantined.8. Amazon also claims it has \u201cnot asked for donations\u201d despite the fact that it created a public website for this grant fund that solicited donations. The initial version had a way to donate via text!Amazon thinks this is normalThis is not normalLegum\u2019s tweets linked to his website, Popular.info, a newsletter-based news service described by\u00a0Wired as a \u201ca one-man political newsletter \u2018for people who are feeling overwhelmed'\u201d in a 2018 profile on the effort. His commentary stretched across those eight initial tweets:In his seventh tweet, Legum added that Amazon had confirmed the policy he described and added a screenshot with a statement attributed to an Amazon.com spokesperson:That quote contained an assertion that Amazon was effectively not actively soliciting donations to the Amazon Relief Fund \u2014 but that the innate, third-party structured platform \u201crequired\u201d that it be \u201copen to public contributions\u201d:We are not and have not asked for donations and the Amazon Relief Fund has been funded by Amazon with an initial donation of $25 million. The structure to operate a fund like this, which hundreds of companies do through the same third-party, requires the program to be open to public contributions but we are not soliciting those contributions in any way.The linked Popular.info page was a March 24 2020 article by Legum headlined, \u201cAmazon soliciting public donations to pay workers\u2019 sick leave.\u201d It reported in part:Amazon\u2019s large contract workforce, which delivers packages and performs other critical tasks, is in even worse shape. Amazon is not providing any sick leave at all for these workers, even if they test positive for COVID-19. Instead, these workers must apply to the \u201cAmazon Relief Fund\u201d and apply for a grant to cover their sick leave. The fund is \u201cfocused on supporting our U.S.-based Delivery Associates employed by Delivery Service Providers, our Amazon Flex Delivery Partners, and Associates working for Integrity Staffing, Adecco Staffing, and RES Staffing, and drivers and support team members of line haul partners under financial distress due to a COVID-19 diagnosis or quarantine.\u201dAmazon donated $25 million to the fund and is soliciting individual donations to add to the pot. It initially included an option to donate by text.Popular.info had previously reported that the retail giant requested diagnostic criteria (a positive test or being \u201cplaced into quarantine\u201d) which made it difficult to employees of the company to use paid sick time during the pandemic. Legum said that Amazon offered \u201cunlimited unpaid leave\u201d for its hourly employees, adding that Amazon\u2019s fleet of contractors were required to apply for a \u201cgrant\u201d from the \u201cAmazon Relief Fund\u201d in the event they contracted COVID-19 while on the job or off:Amazon announced that it would offer \u201cunlimited unpaid time off for all hourly employees through the end of March [2020].\u201d This is of little use for most hourly employees, who in most cases can\u2019t afford to take unpaid leave.The company also says, \u201call Amazon employees diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine will receive up to two-weeks of pay.\u201d This is similar to Kroger\u2019s [since changed] policy. But testing is still extremely limited, and most employees will not be able to evaluated and be \u201cplaced into quarantine.\u201dFor contractors, like [an interviewed] driver in Illinois, things are bleaker. Amazon will not guarantee paid leave even for contractors that are diagnosed with COVID-19. Instead, \u201cour independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and seasonal employees under financial distress\u201d can \u201capply for grants approximately equal to up to two-weeks of pay if diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine by the government or Amazon.\u201d The company has made an initial contribution of $25 million for this grant program. That\u2019s how much revenue Amazon brought in every 47 minutes in 2019. Contractors are supposed to apply for grants through a website that does not appear to be online yet.A link in the March 17 2020 article went to\u00a0blog.aboutamazon.com, an official Amazon.com corporate site, and an entry titled, \u201cAmazon\u2019s COVID-19 blog: How we are supporting our employees, customers, and communities.\u201d (A version of the page archived on March 15 2020 is available here.)

This additional pay while away from work is to ensure employees have the time they need to return to good health without the worry of lost pay. This is in addition to unlimited unpaid time off for all hourly employees through the end of March, which we shared with employees last week.Amazon Relief Fund We are establishing the Amazon Relief Fund with a $25 million initial contribution focused on supporting our independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and seasonal employees under financial distress during this challenging time. We will be offering all of these groups the ability to apply for grants approximately equal to up to two-weeks of pay if diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine by the government or Amazon.Additionally, this fund will support our employees and contractors around the world who face financial hardships from other qualifying events, such as a natural disaster, federally declared emergency, or unforeseen personal hardship. Applicants can apply and receive a personal grant from the fund ranging from $400 to $5,000 USD per person.We will be publishing a website in the coming days where employees and contractors can apply for grants from the fund.Neither the reporting nor Amazon\u2019s various statement pages made it easy to locate the page. As Amazon stated, the \u201cAmazon Relief Fund\u201d was hosted on a third-party website. When we accessed the page on March 25 2020, it read:The Amazon Relief Fund was created to help individuals who are facing financial hardship immediately after a natural disaster or an unforeseen personal hardship. The Amazon Relief Fund relies primarily on individual donations from individuals and support from Amazon Relief Fund to fund this program. Every contribution helps and when combined with the donations of others, can provide the help a fellow individual needs when they are facing the unexpected.Clarifying their dueling claims based on available information was not straightforward, in part because links weren\u2019t archived and the initiatives described in various stories (such as the Amazon Relief Fund) were difficult to find and hosted on a third-party site.As Amazon said, the Amazon Relief Fund was administrated through\u00a0an outside party \u2014 the Emergency Assistance Foundation (EAF), an organization enabling \u201ccorporations make emergency hardship grants for their employees when they face unexpected and unavoidable financial hardships or disasters.\u201dHowever, Legum quoted Amazon\u2019s spokesperson as explicitly stating that the \u201cstructure to operate a fund like this, which hundreds of companies do through the same third-party, requires the program to be open to public contributions but we are not soliciting those contributions in any way.\u201d A screenshot of the Amazon Relief Fund taken on March 25 2020 shows that the fund was indeed soliciting donations via credit card, debit card, or PayPal, with options for people inside and outside the United States:We were unable to determine if any barrier existed for Amazon directly funding sick leave for its range of workers. It did not seem likely using the EAF platform was anything other than optional, and \u201cWhat We Do\u201d text at the bottom of the page emphasized that the program was primarily for coworkers to donate to one another:The Emergency Assistance Foundation, Inc. is a 501c(3) charity created to design and operate multiple employer-sponsored disaster relief and employee hardship funds. These funds allow domestic and international employers and employees to help their coworkers in times of crises.EAF\u2019s FAQ\u00a0explained that part of EAF\u2019s purpose was to outsource vetting and verifying claims made by employees of any company for financial relief due to hardship:How does an Employee Relief Fund Work? There are a number of distinct processes or steps to establishing and operating an effective Employer-Sponsored Employee Hardship and Disaster Relief Fund Program. Here are the basics:a. An employer creates and names a custom fund within the Emergency Assistance Foundation, Inc. Establishing a fund is offered at no cost to the employer and is as simple as signing a simple Field-of-Interest agreement.b. Donations are made by employee contributions (through payroll deduction, credit or debit card, check), by the employer (usually through a donation-matching program or direct contribution), by the employer\u2019s foundation, and sometimes through fundraising events.c. Employees complete applications for assistance, which EAF staff review.d. Each application undergoes a preliminary review to ensure a qualifying emergency or hardship exists and that all required documentation has been received. The applicant will be contacted if additional information is needed.e. Trained EAF personnel conduct final application reviews to determine if they meet the criteria established specifically for the company\u2019s Employee Relief Fund. After the review, the grant requests are either accepted or denied based on the objective criteria. For approvals, the amount of the grant is determined.f. Grants are paid directly to vendors and service providers on behalf of the employee applicant or directly to the employee applicant in accordance with the employer\u2019s guidelines.Per EAF, the burden was placed on employees to provide documentation that \u201ca qualifying emergency\u201d actually existed:A Qualified Disaster is defined as:\u2022 Results from terrorist or military actions \u2022 Results from an accident involving a common carrier \u2022 A presidentially-declared disaster \u2022 An event that the secretary of the treasury determines is catastrophic \u2022 An Employee Emergency Hardship is defined as:Any other permissible hardship other than a Qualified Disaster, which can range from house fire, serious injury or illness, death or a number of other events[. ]A sixth question addressed how employees feel about being asked to donate to their employers\u2019 various funds. EAF\u2019s response seemed geared more to charity and altruism than the distribution of benefits, such as \u2014 for example \u2014 paid sick leave during a pandemic:When a company gives employees a chance to donate to a worthy cause it increases their connection to the organization. This may seem counterintuitive, but research shows it\u2019s true. It\u2019s called prosocial motivation, which is the desire to protect and promote the well-being of others, and is distinct from altruism and independent of self-interested motivations. Interestingly, this is also true with Employee Relief Funds where the donor is more connected than the receiver.The Amazon Relief Fund was also accessible at\u00a0amazonrelieffund.org. As of March 25 2020, text on that page explicitly solicited donations from anyone visiting the page:This fund has an initial donation of $25 million from Amazon. The company will continue to make additional contributions to the fund as it\u2019s needed. While we aren\u2019t expecting anyone to do so, you can make a voluntary donation to the fund if you desire to do so.To make a US Donation using your Credit Card, Debit Card or PayPal click here.All donations to the fund at the Emergency Assistance Foundation, Inc. are tax deductible in the U.S. The EIN# for the Emergency Assistance Foundation is 45-1813056.As Legum stated in his tweets, Amazon had indeed changed the language on that page. A version archived on March 19 2020 made no reference to Amazon not \u201cexpecting\u201d anyone to donate:Make a Donation You can make a voluntary ongoing gift or one-time gift through our secure site using your credit/debit card or directly donate through your payroll.To make a US Donation using your Credit Card, Debit Card or PayPal click here.To make a donation via Text-to-Give, simply text the unique keyword \u201cARelief\u201d to 71777.All donations to the fund at the Emergency Assistance Foundation, Inc. are tax deductible in the U.S. The EIN# for the Emergency Assistance Foundation is 45-1813056.In addition to the solicitation for visitors to donate money to the Amazon Relief Fund, it appeared a since-deleted line asked for \u201ctext-to-give\u201d donations. Users were instructed to text keyword \u201cARelief\u201d to 71777 to make a donation via text message, which we tested and found it appeared to still be doing as of March 25 2020:We contacted EAF to ask if it requires the program to be open to public contributions as a platform requirement, which was what the Amazon spokesperson was quoted as claiming, and asked:Can you tell us whether it is necessary for companies using EAF to solicit public donations for its respective relief funds? Is there a requirement companies include non-employee donations along with employee donations?We received a response in direct conflict with Amazon\u2019s statement. EAF said that employers and employees were the primary funders of their programs:There is no requirement , most likely the donors will be the company, the company foundation or employees. Sometimes vendors donateBased on Amazon\u2019s own statements, full-time employees were required to have tested positive for COVID-19 or under formal quarantine to access paid time off during the coronavirus pandemic; Amazon established the Amazon Relief Fund to cover sick leave for other classes of employee, such as contract workers and Amazon Flex participants who fell ill due to COVID-19; and Amazon\u2019s contract workers who contracted COVID-19 were required to apply for a grant from a third-party-administered fund, the Amazon Relief Fund. In response to questions about the relief fund as well as their solicitation of public donations to fund it, an Amazon employee stated that the company was both required to solicit public donations and that it was not soliciting those contributions in any way.Archived, earlier versions of the Amazon Relief Fund page not only solicited donations from the public, but also invited donations via texts of \u201cARelief\u201d sent to 71777. We texted \u201cARelief\u201d to 71777 the afternoon of March 25 2020, and it appeared donations were still being accepted. (It was unclear how Amazon\u2019s text-to-donate function was set up, but it nevertheless existed and functioned on March 25 2020. )Finally, we asked EAF if it \u201crequires the program to be open to public contributions\u201d in order to operate; a representative indicated that was false, and that the Amazon Relief Fund was neither required to accept public donations, nor was the program innately structured to include such a requirement.

In a study in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal on Thursday, researchers said more than half of 30 drug-resistant TB patients treated with a transfusion of their own bone marrow stem cells were cured of the disease after six months. \u201cThe results ... show that the current challenges and difficulties of treating MDR-TB are not insurmountable, and they bring a unique opportunity with a fresh solution to treat hundreds of thousands of people who die unnecessarily,\u201d said TB expert Alimuddin Zumla at University College London, who co-led the study. TB, which infects the lungs and can spread from one person to another through coughing and sneezing, is often falsely thought of as a disease of the past. In recent years, drug-resistant strains of the disease have spread around the world, batting off standard antibiotic drug treatments. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in Eastern Europe, Asia and South Africa 450,000 people have MDR-TB, and around half of these will fail to respond to existing treatments. TB bacteria trigger an inflammatory response in immune cells and surrounding lung tissue that can cause immune dysfunction and tissue damage. Bone-marrow stem cells are known to migrate to areas of lung injury and inflammation and repair damaged tissue. Since they also modify the body\u2019s immune response and could boost the clearance of TB bacteria, Zumla and his colleague, Markus Maeurer from Stockholm\u2019s Karolinska University Hospital, wanted to test them in patients with the disease. In a phase 1 trial, 30 patients with either MDR or XDR TB aged between 21 and 65 who were receiving standard TB antibiotic treatment were also given an infusion of around 10 million of their own stem cells. The cells were obtained from the patient\u2019s own bone marrow, then grown into large numbers in the laboratory before being re-transfused into the same patient, the researchers explained. During six months of follow-up, the researchers found that the infusion treatment was generally safe and well tolerated, with no serious side effects recorded. The most common non-serious side effects were high cholesterol levels, nausea, low white blood cell counts and diarrhea. Although a phase 1 trial is primarily designed only to test a treatment\u2019s safety, the scientists said further analyses of the results showed that 16 patients treated with stem cells were deemed cured at 18 months compared with only five of 30 TB patients not treated with stem cells. Maeurer stressed that further trials with more patients and longer follow-up were needed to better establish how safe and effective the stem cell treatment was. But if future tests were successful, he said, it could become a viable extra new treatment for patients with MDR-TB who do not respond to conventional drug treatment or those with severe lung damage.

W. Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which extended federal civil rights protections to people with mental or physical impairments: The ADA is one of America\u2019s most comprehensive pieces of civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination and guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else to participate in the mainstream of American life \u2014 to enjoy employment opportunities, to purchase goods and services, and to participate in State and local government programs and services. Modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin \u2013 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \u2014 the ADA is an \u201cequal opportunity\u201d law for people with disabilities. More than a quarter-century on, and despite further work to be done, the ADA has\u00a0so positively\u00a0affected how\u00a0people with disabilities are treated and perceived in America that the notion that laws once\u00a0existed to keep physically and cognitively challenged people indoors and out of sight seems scarcely believable. But it was the case \u2014 and not so long ago. Beginning in the late 1800s, statutes known as \u201cunsightly beggar ordinances,\u201d aka \u201cugly laws,\u201d were enacted in some American cities to rid public spaces\u00a0of what Chicago Alderman James Peevey euphemistically referred to as\u00a0\u201cstreet obstructions\u201d: By street obstructions, Peevey didn\u2019t mean food carts, construction materials, roadblocks or potholes. He meant beggars, such as the ones described in the Tribune as \u201cthe one-legged individual who, with drooping eye and painfully lugubrious countenance, holds forth his hat for pennies\u201d or \u201cthe fellows who yell \u2018ba-na-naas'\u201d and \u201cthe woman with two sick children who was drawn through the carding-machine in a woolen mill, and who grinds \u2018Mollie Darling\u2019 incessantly on a hurdy-gurdy on a street corner.\u201d Following the example of San Francisco, which had pioneered the legislation\u00a0in 1867, Peevey helped pass a law in 1881 imposing fines (or stints in the poorhouse) on all who were \u201cdiseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object,\u201d yet dared beg, panhandle, or otherwise make nuisances of\u00a0themselves in public. Among other cities, Omaha, Columbus, Cleveland, and Portland, Oregon followed suit, all passing ugly laws using\u00a0virtually\u00a0identical\u00a0language. In a discussion of Susan M. Schweik\u2019s The Ugly Laws: Disability in Public (2009), reviewer Shannon Sommer encapsulates the social and economic developments leading up to\u00a0these measures: Schweik discusses in detail several factors which combined to create the perfect storm for the emergence of ugly law in America at this time. These include: the formation of Charity Organization Societies, the rise or eugenics and state institutions, an increasing focus on using urban planning to create beautiful cities, increasing immigration at a time when there were few restrictions placed on immigration, the large number of soldiers injured in the Civil War which had ended just a few years earlier, temperance and prohibition, and the increasing industrialization of society with resulting industrial-related injuries. Schweik notes that though the passage of new ugly laws ceased by the beginning of World War I and enforcement of existing statutes dwindled thereafter, they\u00a0remained on the books until well into the latter half of the 20th century: Schweik found that the last known arrest under an ugly law occurred in Omaha, NE in 1974 when a policeman wanted to arrest a homeless man but had no basis for arrest. After searching the city code and finding that Omaha\u2019s Ugly Law was still on the books he was able to take the man into custody on the basis that the man had \u201cmarks and scars on his body.\u201d Prosecutors refused to press charges in this case. Schweik recounts one prosecutor pointing out that \u201ccriminal prosecution under this law would require the impossible: courtroom proof \u201cthat someone is ugly.\u201d Claim: \"During the 19th and 20th centuries, some U.S. cities enacted so-called \"\"ugly laws\"\" banning people deemed \"\"diseased, maimed, mutilated or in any way deformed so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object or improper person\"\" from public spaces.\"", "output": "That same year, 1974, saw the demise of ugly laws in America.

Anywhere in the world, when a bone marrow, lung or heart transplant saves a life, they are touched by the value of the American miracle. And on one night in July of 1969, the whole world witnessed the American miracle firsthand. For on that night an American walked on the surface of the moon, and it was clear to the whole world that these Americans\u2026 could do anything. We briefly considered wading into fringe conspiracy theories about whether astronauts actually walked on the moon, but got control of ourselves. We were more curious about his other technology claims. Were Americans truly the ones responsible for innovation of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and the global positioning system? We dropped a line to Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos, who provided us with links about inventors of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and GPS. Indeed, stories from The Telegraph (via Huffington Post), NPR, the Internet Society, PBS and MITnews identify American origins for all four technologies. But these are complex systems that have developed over time. We wondered: Was there more to the story? Mobile phone  A lot fits under the umbrella \"\"mobile phone\"\" -- including, say, early radio technology that led to car phones by the 1940s. But Rubio\u2019s spokesman pointed to the inventor of the first portable cellular phone, which is fine by us. (Did you think of dawn-of-the-1900s ship-to-shore communication when Rubio said \"\"mobile phone\"\"? We didn\u2019t think so.) Martin Cooper worked for Illinois company Motorola as it developed the DynaTAC phone and the cellular network behind it in the early 1970s. The lead engineer for the team that developed the phone, Martin made the first wireless call from Manhattan in 1973. The FCC approved the phone -- the world\u2019s first commercial portable cell phone -- for regular folks in 1983. Now, Japan and some European countries were quicker to deploy cellular networks, in the late \u201870s and very early \u201880s. But Paul Levinson, a Fordham University professor who wrote the 2004 book \"\"Cellphone: The Story of the World's Most Mobile Medium and How It Has Transformed Everything!\"\" says it\u2019s the phone that matters. \"\"That was the breakthrough,\"\" he said \"\"There were several different companies and scientists working on it. \u2026 But no one believed that it could be done. \u2026 So everything that came afterwards was based on that first breakthrough.\"\" An American breakthrough. Score one for Rubio. Internet & E-mail  We read the work from the Internet Society and PBS that Burgos sent our way, then exchanged messages with Stephen Stein, who teaches the history of technology at the University of Memphis. Computer networks that led to the Internet we know today include Arpanet , a 1970s project of the U.S. Department of Defense, and NSFnet, created by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s. These projects, with their indisputably American roots, provided two cornerstones of the modern-day Web: the TCP/IP protocol and a major communications backbone. But Stein pointed out that the way we interact with the Internet owes much to the work of Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist who worked for CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland. It was there -- in the late \u201880s as NSFnet was being developed in the United States -- that Berners-Lee \"\"developed the whole concept of the World Wide Web,\"\" Stein said. (There\u2019s more on this in a PBS article related to the one Burgos sent.) HTTP? HTML? Both Berners-Lee. \"\"So, yes, Americans developed the Internet, but Berners-Lee made it user-friendly,\"\" Stein said. Meanwhile, Virginia Tech scholar Janet Abbate says in her 1999 book \"\"Inventing the Internet,\"\" published by MIT Press, that even in the expansion of Arpanet , Americans enlisted the help of computer experts from England and France. She also points to Berners-Lee\u2019s contributions, saying, \"\"The history of the Internet is not \u2026 a story of a few heroic inventors; it is a tale of collaboration and conflict among a remarkable variety of players.\"\" The origins of e-mail, as you might expect, are entwined with the Internet. Electronic mail was part of the development of Arpanet in the early \u201870s, according to Stein, Abbate and others. American programmer Ray Tomlinson gets credit (and tongue-in-cheek blame) for the first working network mail program, picked up by users of Arpanet sites. Here's what Abbate told us when we asked her about Rubio's claim. \"\"I think it's an overstatement to call the Internet a purely American product. Certainly other countries were building their own computer networks (and inter-networks) in parallel with the U.S.; these other networks eventually became part of the Internet,\"\" Abbate said. \"\"Also, the Internet itself (as opposed to the earlier Apranet) was a collaborative effort with input from computer scientists in France and elsewhere, and I argue in my book that the diversity of input made the resulting system stronger. I do think the U.S. did a remarkably good job with the Internet design and expansion, maybe better than anyone else would or could have done. But if the resulting Internet hadn't suited other countries' needs, they were perfectly capable of creating their own networks (indeed, for a while there were a number of different competing network systems before TCP/IP eventually became the standard). \"\"And of course, the World Wide Web was invented at CERN, not in the US or by an American. So does that mean we in the U.S. are enjoying the benefits of the \"\"Swiss miracle\"\" every time we use the Web?\"\" GPS  The satellite technology that puts some of the smart in your smart phone and informs your car\u2019s navigation system is a system of satellites funded by taxpayers and operated by the U.S. government. So calling the global positioning system an \"\"American miracle\"\" is no stretch. The technology was born at Aerospace Corp., a military research contractor in El Segundo, Calif. Its founding president was New York native Ivan Getting. That isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t foreign navigation satellites. The United States cooperates with Australia, China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia on global navigation satellite systems, sometimes referred to as GNSS. But Rubio said GPS, and the history there is fairly clear -cut. The ruling  What to make of all of this? Rubio's basic point, that the technology behind mobile phones, e-mail, the Internet and GPS all have American roots, holds up. It\u2019s true \"\"in a general sense,\"\" said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who writes on our relationship with technology. Or, as the University of Memphis professor, Stein, put it: \"\"The statement is superficially correct, but there is (as usual) more to the story.\"\" Stein was most concerned about the non-American role in the development of the Internet, especially the substantial contribution of England's Berners-Lee. It\u2019s also important to note in the context of Rubio\u2019s \"\"only in America\"\" rhetoric that while the United States led, it wasn\u2019t alone in its innovation. Other nations\u2019 researchers contributed to the early Internet; commercial mobile phone networks were available overseas before they were in America; other nations operate satellite navigation systems. But in these areas and many others, Americans can claim primacy.\" Claim: Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle.", "output": "Rubio says mobile phone, e-mail, Internet, GPS stem from 'American miracle'", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

Hogan Administration officials said during the hearing that they are aware of the safety concerns and are working to address them, along with the shortage. Jason Kramer, policy analyst with Legislative Services, said during the hearing that the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services alone had a need for more than 1,000 employees, while agencies like the Department of Juvenile Services and Department of Health were short more than 200 positions each, according to the study. Delegate Marc Korman, D-Montgomery, noted during the hearing that recent safety incidents \u201ctriggered\u201d the meeting Tuesday morning, which also included testimony from members of Maryland\u2019s American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \u2014 a public employee trade union.

David Brinkley, secretary of the Department of Budget and Management, said the administration takes the staffing shortage issue \u201cvery seriously\u201d and is focused on \u201chard-to-fill\u201d positions like correctional officers. Nick Pepersack, Brinkley\u2019s deputy chief of staff, later confirmed to Capital News Service that those employees received a nearly 10% salary increase between January and July of this year. Total salary enhancements in the last and current fiscal years, Pepersack said, amounted to approximately $467 million for employees statewide. Robert Neall, secretary of the Department of Health, said there is now an \u201cincrease in emphasis\u201d on reporting all incidents at state hospitals and he looks \u201cforward to reporting more progress\u201d in January.

New Yorkers still can smoke on sidewalks, parking lots, streets and in their homes, although many landlords of rental properties do not allow it. Not everyone was so pleased by the new law.

A company announcement said it would continue maintenance and environmental safeguards, but would make no further investment in three mines in the Halkidiki area of northern Greece and two projects in the northeastern province of Thrace. It said the permit delays \u201chave negatively impacted Eldorado\u2019s project schedules and costs, ultimately hindering the company\u2019s ability to effectively advance development and operation of these assets.\u201d Burns said the company\u2019s decision will take effect on Sept. 21 unless Eldorado receives the permits. \u201cApprovals must not be held hostage to political posturing or other agendas put forward by a vocal minority,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep hearing the permits are coming, but they\u2019re not coming in a timely fashion.\u201d But Environment Minister Giorgos Stathakis said European and national law had to be upheld, and that the company had still not completed all necessary procedures, including completing an investment plan detailing production methods. He also said some pending permits were scheduled to be given in mid-September for six months, allowing the company to operate during the arbitration process. \u201cThe company\u2019s choices toward the employees are clearly their responsibility,\u201d Stathakis said. \u201cWe are witnesses of an extraordinary event, of a company that through its CEO holds press conferences and makes statements judging prime ministers, ministers and political parties in Greece.\u201d Burns said the company was unable to legally continue work without the permits, adding he was open to dialogue and hoped to have the issue resolved in time. This is not the first time Eldorado has suspended operations in Greece. In January 2016, it had threatened to suspend work at one of its sites and lay off 600 workers following protests by local residents and a spat with the government. Work restarted several months later. Burns said he had sent three letters to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras during the last five months, since he took over the helm of Eldorado, but had not received any reply. Eldorado employs some 2,400 staff and contractors in Greece through its local subsidiary, Hellas Gold. The company said 90 percent of the workers faced being suspended temporarily from their jobs if the permits don\u2019t come through in time. The company took over old mines in 2012, paying nearly $2 billion. Burns said it had since invested a further $1 billion in Greece, a figure which would double if the company could fully develop its assets in Greece. Monday\u2019s action comes as Greece struggles to emerge from years of a deep financial crisis and attract investment. Interior Minister Panos Skourletis said disagreements would be resolved through arbitration. The company, however, counters it has not been officially informed of what the arbitration would be about. \u201cThis might be a move to (exert) political pressure on the government at a crucial time,\u201d Skourletis said. He insisted Greece was friendly toward foreign investments, but that the Canadian project, being a mining operation, was a special case. \u201cSuch kinds of investments no longer exist in the rest of Europe. They\u2019re not allowed due to the great environmental cost they have,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s wrong to connect this particular case with the general picture in the area of investments (in Greece).\u201d The Halkidiki mines have been mired in controversy for decades, with Eldorado\u2019s predecessors also facing protests. Many in the local communities vehemently oppose mining development on environmental grounds, saying it would hurt the area\u2019s tourism industry, destroy forests risk contaminating the groundwater. The company counters it\u2019s carrying out environmental cleanup work even of its predecessors, and rejects accusations of pollution. It noted that Greece\u2019s Council of State, the country\u2019s highest administrative court, had issued 18 decisions in its favor in various permit disputes. Burns said he remained optimistic that a solution could be found. \u201cI\u2019m confident these mines will be built,\u201d he said. When first elected on an anti-bailout platform in 2015, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 left-wing government initially favored the suspension of the permits that had previously been granted to the mining company. Greece\u2019s confederation of industries urged Tsipras to personally intervene to rescue the gold mine investment. Nikos Panairlis, head of the workers\u2019 union at one of the mines, described the company\u2019s move as \u201ca catastrophe for us,\u201d adding that workers were looking to organize protests. The mood among opponents of the mine was cautious. Aristotelis municipality mayor Giorgos Zoumbas accused Eldorado of \u201cusing the workers and their jobs to blackmail and get the permits.\u201d Local residents, he said, would be happy if the suspension goes ahead, \u201cbut they\u2019re still cautious.\u201d ___ Derek Gatopoulos in Athens and Costas Kantouris in Thessaloniki, Greece contributed to this report. ___ Follow Becatoros http://www.twitter.com/ElenaBec Claim: Canadian mining firm threatens to suspend Greece investment.", "output": "Canadian mining company Eldorado Gold on Monday threatened to suspend a major investment in Greece in 10 days, accusing the government of delaying permits and licenses.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

It wasn\u2019t clear from a news release whether Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk would face any punishment for reopening last Monday in defiance of county orders. Messages were left early Wednesday seeking comment from health officials and Tesla. The release said Fremont police would verify whether Tesla was holding up its part of the agreement. The deal requires that public health indicators have to remain stable or improve for the factory to stay open. \u201cWe will be working with the Fremont PD to verify Tesla is adhering to physical distancing and that agreed upon health and safety measures are in place for the safety of their workers as they prepare for full production,\u201d the release said. Tesla\u2019s factory reopened Monday for pre-production with Musk practically daring local authorities to arrest him, and operations apparently continued into Tuesday. The company met a Monday deadline to submit a site-specific plan to protect worker safety. But the reopening defied orders from the health department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can\u2019t fully open under restrictions intended to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. The health department has said it warned the company was operating in violation of the county health order, and hoped Tesla will \u201ccomply without further enforcement measures\u201d until the county approves a site-specific plan required by the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom framed the issue Wednesday as a local dispute, noting that the state guidelines have allowed some manufacturing \u201cfor weeks\u201d when counties permit resumption. He said he\u2019s urged local governments to follow the state\u2019s approach in dealing with rogue operators by seeking \u201cnot to be punitive at first.\u201d \u201cIt sounds like, based upon the progress that\u2019s been made public, with the county and Tesla, that they were able to resolve their issue in fairly short order along those same lines,\u201d he said. State law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders. The plant in Fremont, a city of more than 230,000 people south of San Francisco, was closed March 23. It employs about 10,000 workers. Public health experts have credited stay-at-home orders with slowing the spread of the coronavirus, and helping hospitals handle an influx of cases. The coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. But it has killed more than 80,000 people in the U.S., with the death toll rising. Alameda County was among six San Francisco Bay Area counties that were the first in the nation to impose stay-at-home orders in mid-March. Newsom has repeatedly said that counties can impose restrictions that are more stringent than state orders. The order in the Bay Area has been extended until the end of the month, but the counties plan to allow some limited business and manufacturing starting May 18, the same day Detroit automakers plan to reopen auto assembly plants. Some auto parts plants were to restart production this week. The Detroit automakers\u2019 150,000 U.S. workers are represented by the United Auto Workers union, which has negotiated for added safety precautions. Tesla\u2019s workers do not have a union. Musk, whose company has sued Alameda County seeking to overturn its order, threatened to move Tesla\u2019s manufacturing operations and headquarters from the state. Tesla contends in the lawsuit that Alameda County can\u2019t be more restrictive than orders from Newsom. The lawsuit says the governor\u2019s coronavirus restrictions refer to federal guidelines classifying vehicle manufacturing as essential businesses that are allowed to continue operating. Tesla released a plan to maintain worker safety, including wearing gloves and masks, installing barriers between workers and maintaining social distancing. Local officials said the company initially pushed back on checking employee temperatures before boarding a company bus to get to work. But Tesla relented and agreed to check workers. ___ This story has been changed to clarify that the health department tweet came late Tuesday PST. ___ Associated Press writer Juliet Williams contributed to this report.

This year, the best-selling book in the onsite bookshop was \u201cHeroic Failure,\u201d an evisceration of Brexit failures by Irish journalist Fintan O\u2019Toole. Britain\u2019s 2016 decision to quit the European Union created a deep fault-line between the 48% of voters who wanted remain in the European Union and the 52% who voted to leave. Three years on, Britain\u2019s politicians have failed to agree on exit terms, the country is still in the bloc, and voters on both sides are angry. The words \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d are shouted and shared on social media in what often feels like a bad-tempered dialogue. \u201cWe have half the country who think the other half are idiots,\u201d said British historian Peter Frankopan, whose book \u201cThe New Silk Roads\u201d charts the growing power of Asia. \u201cOne of the challenges is how you blend those perspectives. How do you sit in the middle?\u201d The depth of the political chaos has come as a surprise, even to the experts. American historian Jared Diamond, whose latest book examines nations under pressure in his latest book \u201cUpheaval - How Nations Cope with Crisis and Change,\u201d told his audience at Hay that he originally planned to include a chapter on Britain, a country long regarded as a stable leading democracy. \u201cIt was going to be a happy-ending chapter,\u201d he said, about how Britain in the late 20th century overcame a crisis over its loss of empire \u201cby finding a new identity in joining the European Union.\u201d The 2016 Brexit referendum made him reconsider that thesis. Diamond said that at the moment, he\u2019d hesitate to write about Britain at all. \u201cThings are changing so fast with Brexit anything I wrote a week ago would be out of date,\u201d he said. As it stands, Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, the delayed departure date set by the bloc amid political deadlock in London. Prime Minister Theresa May has given up trying to get her unpopular divorce deal approved by Parliament and will step down as Conservative Party leader on Friday. Most of the more than a dozen contenders to replace her have vowed to take Britain out of the bloc, even without a deal. Pro-EU Britons \u2014 along with most economists \u2014 say that would plunge the country into recession. But many Brexit supporters believe the only alternative is being stuck in the EU indefinitely. The deep division over Brexit looks to be transforming British politics. Last month\u2019s European Parliament elections saw voters desert the Conservatives and main opposition Labour \u2014 the two parties that tried and failed to find a compromise EU divorce deal \u2014 for the newly formed Brexit Party and the fervently pro-EU Liberal Democrats. Several speakers searched for antidotes for the poison tainting Britain\u2019s body politic. David Lammy, a lawmaker with the left-of-center opposition Labour Party, lamented \u201cthis civil conflict in Britain that is making us navel-gaze at ourselves and not look outward into the world.\u201d His solutions included people\u2019s assemblies to find a way forward on Brexit, and a written constitution \u2014 something Britain famously lacks \u2014 \u201cto get serious about who we are.\u201d Shafak said people should ignore their Brexit fatigue and start listening to one another. \u201cI don\u2019t have to agree with Brexit, but I need to understand why people voted Brexit,\u201d she said. ___ Follow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://twitter.com/JillLawless Claim: UK\u2019s anxiety takes center stage at Hay ideas festival.", "output": "At Britain\u2019s leading literary gathering, the word of the year was anxiety.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

We have an outbreak of a disease that seems to put everybody in a panic.\u201d Peebles is among roughly 40 million black Americans deciding minute by minute whether to put their faith in government and the medical community during the coronavirus pandemic. Historic failures in government responses to disasters and emergencies, medical abuse, neglect and exploitation have jaded generations of black people into a distrust of public institutions. \u201cI\u2019ve just been conditioned not to trust,\u201d said Peebles, who is now obeying the state\u2019s stay home order and keeping his distance from others when he goes out. Some call such skepticism the \u201cTuskegee effect\u201d \u2014 distrust linked to the U.S. government\u2019s once-secret study of black men in Alabama who were left untreated for syphilis. Black people already suffer disproportionately from chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease and are far more likely to be uninsured. How the government and medical community responds to the crisis will be especially crucial for outcomes among black Americans, civil rights advocates and medical experts say. \u201cWe are right to be paranoid and to ask tough questions,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts who joined other congressional leaders in asking the government to collect and release information about the race and ethnicity of people who are tested or treated for the virus that causes COVID-19. \u201cHistory has shown us, when we do not\u201d ask questions, said Pressley, who is black, \u201cthe consequences are grave, and in fact life and death.\u201d  NAACP President Derrick Johnson, who hosted a coronavirus tele-town hall with U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams last month, said black and brown communities need reliable information about the crisis. \u201cNow that this has been deemed a pandemic, I am most concerned with inequities in who\u2019s provided tests, who\u2019s provided treatment and how those tests and the treatments are administered, in a way that is open, transparent, and equitable,\u201d Johnson said. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. Cities with large black populations like New York, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee and New Orleans have emerged as hot spots for the coronavirus. Figures released by Michigan\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services show 40% of those who have died from COVID-19 are black in a state where African-Americans are just 14% of the population. And many Southern states with large black populations have been slow to mandate statewide restrictions shown to slow virus spread. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, black adults are 60% more likely than non-Hispanic white adults to be diagnosed with diabetes, 40% more likely to have high blood pressure and are less likely to have those conditions under control. Additionally, in 2015, black women were 20% more likely to have asthma than non-Hispanic whites. Those disparities make the availability of a treatment or vaccine urgent, even as the virus is currently projected to claim tens of thousands of lives. But given history, Peebles said he wouldn\u2019t rush to accept a remedy. \u201cIf we got to a place where the government says, \u2018OK, now it\u2019s time to take a vaccine,\u2019 then I\u2019m definitely going to be skeptical of their intentions,\u201d he said. Launched in 1932 by the U.S. Public Health Service, the Tuskegee study involved roughly 600 poor black men in Alabama who weren\u2019t treated for the sexually transmitted disease so researchers could track its progress. The program was exposed and ended in 1972, and then-President Bill Clinton formally apologized in 1997. The Tuskegee legacy has helped pollute the black community\u2019s relationship with American medical science. A 2016 paper found the fallout included mistrust of medicine among black men, along with fewer interactions with doctors and higher mortality rates. In Tuskegee, where many families include descendants of victims, many residents don\u2019t trust government health information, said Lucenia Dunn, a former Tuskegee mayor. So volunteers trying to get the word out about coronavirus have gone door-to-door distributing fliers with cartoon-like illustrations that don\u2019t look \u201ctoo official,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a general distrust in this community,\u2019\u201d Dunn said. \u201cI call it \u2018subconscious rejection.\u2019 The attitude is, \u2018I\u2019m going to rebel against this. You people have been telling us lies for years. Why should I believe you now?\u2019\u201d In Los Angeles, Jahmil Lacey helped found a public health group for black men and boys, TRAPMedicine, that educates black barbers and organizes workshops to address health disparities among their customers. \u201cPeople will quote the Tuskegee experiment as the reason why black people don\u2019t trust health care, but there\u2019s so much more than just that one example,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust systems that are connected to white supremacy. So, we have to do the work to repair it.\u201d Indeed, Tuskegee didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. In the 1950s, doctors at the John Hopkins Hospital used cervical cancer cells from Henrietta Lacks, a black mother of five, to pioneer medical advances and research that continue globally today. Lacks, who died in 1951, never gave her consent and her family has never been compensated. One way to begin healing the mistrust is to increase black representation in the medical field, said Dr. Nicollette Louissaint, executive director of the Washington-based emergency response advocacy group Healthcare Ready. \u201cWe have to make sure that ... the message itself and the messengers are being adapted to the appropriate audience,\u201d said Louissaint, who is black. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really important that we get that right.\u201d ___ Reeves reported from Birmingham, Alabama.

All descent maneuvers were performed without any hitches and the crew reported feeling fine as their ship slid off the orbit and headed down to Earth. Helicopters carrying recovery teams were circling the area as the capsule was descending slowly under a massive orange-and-white parachute. Support crew helped the trio get out of the capsule, charred by a fiery descent through the atmosphere, and placed them in reclining chairs for a quick check-up.

Helen Sharman visited Russia\u2019s Mir space station in 1991 on a privately backed mission and several British-born American citizens flew with NASA\u2019s space shuttle program. But Peake is Britain\u2019s first publicly funded British astronaut and the first Briton to visit the International Space Station. He performed the first British space walk and was honored by Queen Elizabeth II in her annual Birthday Honors List. He excited many at home by joining the 26.2-mile (42-kilometer) London Marathon \u2014 from 250 miles (400 kilometers) above the Earth, harnessed to a treadmill aboard the ISS with a simulation of the route through London\u2019s streets playing on an iPad. Peake finished the race in 3 hours and 35 minutes, a record for the fastest marathon in orbit, according to Guinness World Records. The trio spent 186 days in space since their launch in December 2015. They have conducted hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss the view definitely,\u201d Peake said after landing. NASA said the data received would help in the potential development of vaccines and could be relevant in the treatment of patients suffering from ocular diseases, such as glaucoma. For Malenchenko, it was a sixth mission, and he logged up a total of 828 days in space, the second-longest accumulated time in space after Russian Gennady Padalka. Kopra has logged up 244 days in space on two flights.

On Friday, six bodies were successfully retrieved from the island by a New Zealand military team and taken to the mainland for disaster victim identification. Police said they remained committed to recovering the two bodies and that police and military divers were continuing to scour the waters around the island. \u201cEveryone went out there absolutely desperate to find bodies and return them to loved ones,\u201d Clement said.

At a minimum, that information should have been included here. It presents the benefits in both relative and absolute terms in the second paragraph of the story. It would be nice to have a NNT or number needed to treat in here. It also would be nice to see the range of performance after using the drug. Did some of the men on placebo have gains in ejaculation time that were unusually high? Did some on the drug have no gain or even a loss of time? It\u2019s also not clear how the researchers knew what the \"\"no drug\"\" ejaculation time was, how they were chosen for the research or whether they fell into a particular age bracket. The story did a \"\"satisfactory\"\" job quantifying the benefits, not a perfect job. And in an imperfect world of health stories, this part of the story was actually above average. It talks about the potential side effects, but it limits that discussion to what the study found in a very small group of men. Are there long term effects from lidocaine exposure that have been found in other studies? Does the body build up resistance to lidocaine? This isn\u2019t a short term problem that can be solved with a few weeks of therapy. It is\u00a0usually a\u00a0life long problem, and the story should be framed that way both in discussing the benefits and the harms. By using an outside expert to say in the third graph that the findings are \"\"clinically significant,\"\" the story makes it sound as if the case for this drug has already been made. Perhaps Tom Lue gave some context around this comment, but that context is not included. Instead, we are told that\u00a0patients will be \"\"much\u00a0happier.\"\" If you have this problem, you are looking up the company\u2019s website to get on their mailing list. But both groups experienced a gain in ejaculation time. Why would that be? And, given that these sexual encounters were self timed, how confident can we be in the results? Another thing that the story never addresses is the idea of optimal time for sex. It also treats this particular sexual dysfunction as a purely\u00a0single male problem instead of a larger issue of an unsatisfying sexual relationship between a man and his partner. The drug was tested with two people having sex, but the person who did not receive the spray is never taken into account. The men \"\"rated their sexual experiences significantly higher\"\" than those who got placebos. The only reference to the partners is literally the second to the last sentence, \"\"Also, 0.6% of the men\u2019s female partners reported at least some loss of sensation.\"\" We don\u2019t hear anything about the limitations of the study design. It appears to be a quasi-synthesis of 2 clinical trials. There isn\u2019t any caution about the limited or nonexistent peer-review which takes place for an \"\"abstract\"\" at a meeting. Regarding study design, all we know is that researchers took 2 previous trials already made public (would have been helpful to include what the primary findings were) and \"\"combined them with added new data.\"\" This study design is highly suspect. We do not know anything about whether the 2 trials were similar enough to combine, and in what manner they were combined. The section describing premature ejaculation does a better than average job attempting to define the scope of the problem while describing the limitations of the research that has been done in this area. One line could be a model for other journalists to learn from: \"\"Surveys have suggested that as many as 20% to 30% of men may suffer from premature ejaculation, though these figures are often drawn from broadly worded survey questions and may overstate the number of men with significant problems.\"\" The reporter clearly read a lot about the problem and the potential treatments and does a fairly good job synthesizing this information. The story makes it clear that the two outside sources were not involved in this research. It is unclear whether these doctors are involved in any competing research or research into a similar product. There are three full graphs in a 12 graph story about the standard treatments and off-label treatments. I felt like I knew more about the state of premature ejaculation medicine after reading this story than I did about the actual success of these two trials. The story makes it clear, even in the headline, that these are the results of a trial and that there currently is no product even in the FDA pipeline.

It says at one point in the story that the \"\"findings of both trials had previously been made public.\"\" It would have been nice to know where, how and why. Presumably at previous conferences, and, if so, why is this treatment not already in the FDA\u00a0pipeline. Reporters should always be wary of scientists, especially corporate ones, who are using the trade show circuit to build momentum for their product instead of following a rigorous peer review process. This story really is all about the novelty, and it does a good job of exploring some of the other treatments available. Clearly, there is no published study. The company involved in the drug did issue this press release (http://www.renalandurologynews.com/novel-treatment-for-premature-ejaculation-shows-promising-results/article/171435/)There are some differences between the numbers used in the story and the numbers in the press release, but it\u2019s not clear how much of this is because of different caveats.

Did the partners rate their experiences as improved? I would characterize this finding as \"\"less than perfect\"\" just as the urologist quoted referred to the alternative treatments.

The inference is that insurers will cover the cost for others. The story needed to include more information about the study results\u2013in particular, how both the drug and the placebo performed in the trials. As we learn from the NEJM study, the drug reduced pain for about half of the women who took it\u2013but the placebo also reduced pain for about 35% of the women who took it. That\u2019s a good detail to include as it provides a better sense of the drug\u2019s effectiveness. The text does an impressive job of sharing information about the debits of the drug, including bone loss and symptoms of menopause. The double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are described, as are cautions, such as the short-term nature of the research. The reader will find ample information about the unpleasant symptoms of endometriosis. In some areas, it comes close to disease-mongering, when pointing out very rare instances of women needing many surgeries, or a case study of one woman having endometrial tissue in her nose. However, endometriosis is a medical condition, and often under-diagnosed, so we\u2019ll rate this satisfactory. The scientist who led the two trials is clearly identified as such, but his consulting relationship with the company now marketing the drug is not mentioned, nor is the fact that that company, now positioned to benefit from selling the drug, paid for the studies. A number of existing pain-reduction alternatives are mentioned, from hormonal treatments to surgery, and their debits discussed. It would have been helpful to try and articulate how many women find the current alternatives insufficient. The text offers a likely date when this just-approved drug would become available at pharmacies. Although the research report describing the trials was published in The New England Journal of Medicine\u00a0more than a year ago, this story is pegged to a more useful (to readers) \u201cnew event,\u201d the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug.

The rate of unintentional fatal drug overdoses \u2014 those not linked to suicides \u2014 showed a slight increase. Nearly three in four overdose deaths statewide involved opioids of some kind, including prescription pain medication and heroin. State Epidemiologist Michael Landen said the plateau in the fatal overdose rate is unsatisfactory but runs counter to a worsening national trend. \u201cThis is much more favorable than having continued substantial increases in rates, which is what we\u2019re seeing from around the country,\u201d Landen said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not satisfactory. We want our rates to drop and continue dropping.\u201d Overdose deaths in New Mexico have hovered well above the national average, even as the state has implemented pioneering policies to rein in fatalities. The state was the first in 2001 to increase access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, and a few years later, it led the way in releasing people from legal liability when they assist in overdose situations. This year, New Mexico became the first U.S. state to require all local and state law enforcement agencies to provide officers with antidote kits in an effort to curb deaths from opioid overdoses. State health officials are holding out hope that documented decreases in opioid prescriptions in early 2017 will help limit addiction and overdose deaths. New Mexico strengthened its prescription monitoring program in response to a surge in its drug overdose death rate in 2014, when the state ranked second only to West Virginia. In 2015, seven states had higher overdoes death rates. Full state-by-state comparisons for 2016 won\u2019t be released until later in the year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health Department Secretary Lynn Gallagher cited a decrease in early 2017 in the amount of prescribed opioids and fewer dangerous overlapping prescriptions for individual patients as encouraging developments, while lamenting the continued loss of life from overdoses. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more work to be done,\u201d she said in a statement. Unintentional overdose deaths in New Mexico increased to 428 in 2016 from 410 in 2015. Drug overdoses are the leading cause of death from injury in New Mexico and nationally, exceeding traffic related deaths. Emily Kaltenbach, state director for the Drug Policy Alliance, said stubbornly high fatalities should prompt new questions about state spending and tactics. Landen said recently approved funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is helping New Mexico study the effectiveness of efforts to stem overdose deaths \u2014 \u201cto tease out what policy interventions are more effective and which ones may be less useful.\u201d Republican New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez counts drug overdose prevention as a major priority, including efforts to increase access to medications such as buprenorphine and methadone used to wean addicts off opioid pills or heroin. At the same time, a federal review is underway into the level of access that New Mexico residents have to behavior health services, which include drug-dependency treatment, under Medicaid. The state\u2019s behavior health system was upended in 2013 when Martinez\u2019s administration froze payments to more than a dozen nonprofits based on concerns about possible fraud.

The citation was included in an article published by the McGill Journal of Law and Health, a publication covering healthcare-related law. The story itself is a first-person account by activist Florence Ashley regarding their experience seeking medical care both pre-and post-gender transition.Their listing of the nicknames for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) appears alongside a passage covering the temporary effects from stopping the treatment prior to reassignment surgery:I had to stop taking the hormones three weeks before surgery, give or take a few days. I was ill-prepared for this endeavour. Because hormones regulate emotions, amongst many other things, changes in hormonal regimen can have a heavy impact on mood stability and mental health. In my case, the fluctuations were large enough that I had to raise my dosage of antidepressant.A few months after surgery, my reflection in the mirror elicited an emotional reaction I had not yet grown accustomed to. After over a year on hormone replacement therapy, my body had changed in ways that finally began feeling comfortable. After decades of discontent, I was finally feeling at home in what I had previously described as a flesh prison. It had only taken a few weeks without hormones to lose what I estimated as six months of progress, noticeable in terms of fat redistribution, breast tissue loss, and changes to sexual functioning. The mirror served me a cruel reminder of this loss of self.In their paper, Ashley argues that current regulations covering disclosure of information between medical providers and transgender patients rely \u201con overly narrow conceptions of informed consent and underestimates the role that communal knowledge should play in health care.\u201dTheir own surgeon, for example, did not mention what the side effects would be of stopping HRT prior to surgery.\u201cI would not have changed my mind about having surgery, it is true, but I could have done more to prepare had I known about the impact of ceasing hormone replacement therapy,\u201d they wrote:Knowing in advance is crucial to psychological preparation and adaptation.

On Sept. 18, 2009, the first lady gave a speech about the importance of health care reform to women, and cited several reasons she thinks the current system is gender-biased. This line caught our attention:  \u00a0  \"\"Women are affected because, as we heard, in many states, insurance companies can still discriminate because of gender,\"\" she said. \"\"And this is still shocking to me. These are the kind of facts that still wake me up at night. ... In some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence.\"\" Health reform bills under consideration by Congress would prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-exisiting conditions, an issue we've already  explored  ; we've also examined how  pregnancy can sometimes be  a basis to deny coverage, and how pre-exisiting conditions already lead to  health care rationing  by private health insurers. But we'd never heard domestic abuse could count as a pre-existing condition, so we decided to look into the claim. The issue first came to light in 1994, when a Pennsylvania woman was denied health, life and mortgage disability insurance because of domestic violence, according to the Women's Law Project. That group, along with the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, began advocating for legislation to expressly prohibit the practice. Since then, most states, including Pennsylvania, have adopted laws prohibiting the practice. But, as Mrs. Obama said in her speech, denying coverage due to a history of domestic abuse is still legal in some states. Those states are Idaho, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Wyoming, and the District of Columbia, according to the National Women's Law Center. The claim has become a  popular talking point  for groups supporting health care reform such as the Service Employees International Union. (It's been discussed so much recently that Arkansas, which had no prohibition, this year passed a law prohibiting discrimination against domestic violence victims.) A  Huffington Post story  about the laws last week prompted several states and insurance companies to say that the laws have been changed or that the companies don't treat domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. The North Carolina situation is a matter of some disagreement. Although the Women's Law Center says the practice is still allowed, state officials say they interpret the laws to mean it is not. Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney told the  Jackson Free Press  that he wanted to explore whether insurance companies were taking advantage of the law:  \u00a0  \"\"I've got to get some of my lawyers to do some research on this, but we have only six mandated (conditions that must be covered) in our state statues, and we have 25 or more optional coverages, but domestic abuse doesn't seem to be one of them. ... The whole situation is bad. Let's say a woman works with a company that had Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and she gets beat up in her house and Blue Cross says 'we're not covering you because getting beat up is your pre-existing condition.' That's terrible.\"\" Meanwhile, Wyoming Department of Insurance staff attorney James Mitchell told the  Huffington Post  that state law does not expressly prohibit insurers from using domestic abuse as grounds to deny coverage, though he'd found no cases of the practice in his state. Mitchell's response raises an important point: Just because it's legal in some states for insurance companies to cite domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, it doesn't mean that insurance companies are actually taking advantage of the loophole. Back in the 1990s there was evidence that the practice was widespread. In 1994, a House Judiciary Committee panel conducted an informal survey and found that eight of the 16 largest insurers in the country used domestic violence as a factor in deciding coverage. And a year later, the Insurance Commission of Pennsylvania reported that a formal survey showed that 24 percent of accident, health and life insurers took domestic violence into account when deciding whether to issue and renew insurance policies. But that data is more than 10 years old, so we asked Lisa Codispoti, senior counsel for the National Women's Law Center, if insurance companies are still denying health care coverage based on domestic violence history. Examples are hard to come by, she said, because people who get coverage through an employer don't usually face exclusions about pre-existing condititions. Only people who apply for individual coverage would, she said. \"\"It's such a small number of people who apply for individual insurance,\"\" she said. \"\"And it's not like insurance companies have to tell you why you're being denied coverage.\"\" Indeed, underwriting standards are private, said Nancy Durborow, health projects coordinator for the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, making it difficult for groups such as hers to find out how widespread the practice still is. \"\"This is very secretive stuff,\"\" she said. A spokesman for the association representing insurance companies told us he's not aware of any insurers that deny women coverage based on history of domestic abuse. And the group supports a proposal by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that would fully prohibit the practice. \"\"No one should be denied coverage because they are victims of domestic abuse,\"\" said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans. We find that the first lady is correct that \"\"in some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence.\"\" Putting aside the disputed North Carolina law, there still are several other states \u2014 including Mississippi and Wyoming \u2014 that have no specific laws prohibiting the practice.

With California\u2019s increasingly warm, dry and overgrown landscape, wildfire has become a perpetual danger. Among the most important tools the state has against fires is to mimic their effects: thinning trees and brush by hand to reduce the amount of vegetation that would become fuel in a fire, and using controlled burns to keep undergrowth and shrub lands in check. State lawmakers committed more than $200 million annually to fire prevention efforts and Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to spend even more, motivated by infernos such as one last year that killed 85 people in Paradise, California, some who died in their cars while trying to flee. Yet officials say efforts to make areas such as this road corridor in Northern California more fire safe are undercut by property owners who refuse to let fire crews work on their property. Offered the choice between clearing vegetation-choked areas or retaining greenery that acts as a shield against the din of the nearby highway, a small minority opted for privacy over safety or said they\u2019d do the work themselves. That means patches of low-lying shrubs and some thickets of trees will remain when the job wraps up next year. As a result, future fires will retain potential avenues to spread into residential areas and threaten people and property. \u201cIt\u2019s a chink in the armor,\u201d said Ed Orre, division chief with Cal Fire, the state\u2019s firefighting and fire prevention agency. \u201cIf that property catches fire, then you get a chain-reaction, domino effect... It compromises the effectiveness of the entire project.\u201d  Climate change and decades of lax land management practices put the U.S. West on a collision course with out-of-control wildfires, and authorities are now rushing to limit the potential damage from blazes that threaten year-round. Since 1970, the amount of land burned each year in California has increased five-fold. Across the 11 western states, acreage burned annually has doubled since 1984. Over the past three years, fires have killed 149 people and destroyed almost 25,000 homes across the state. California is now nearly 3 degrees (1.67 degrees Celsius) warmer than in 1990 due to climate change, with hotter temperatures during the Golden State\u2019s long dry season removing moisture from plants and soils, said Park Williams, a climate scientist at Columbia University. \u201cI see the recent wildfires as a tidal wave \u2014 it\u2019s going to be very hard to stop that,\u201d Williams said. Rapid residential development in recent decades boosted populations in high-risk areas. Almost 2 million homes are in flammable areas in western states, said Jennifer Balch, a fire expert at the University of Colorado. Some common but non-native plants \u2014 including eucalyptus trees, cheatgrass and pernicious shrubs such as French and Scotch broom \u2014 burn more readily than native species. Although it\u2019s not feasible to manually thin all the forests and shrub land in California, targeted efforts to remove flammable vegetation in areas of high human activity can effectively reduce the chance of major fires. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do field treatment, we have to do it where it matters most \u2014 where people live and work,\u201d Balch said. The changes in climate and development are on display Redwood Estates, which was conceived in the 1920s as a vacation community, an escape from the city where families could weekend in small cabins in the Santa Cruz Mountains. A promotional film from the community\u2019s early days reveals that much of the surroundings were once bare of trees, due to logging and the use of the land for ranching and vineyards. Today those same views are largely blocked by thick stands of redwoods, oak and eucalyptus. Many of the community\u2019s original cabins are gone, replaced by larger single-family homes that in some cases push right up to the property line. That leaves little space between houses and the forest, meaning embers could easily leap from house to house in a fire. Much of the surrounding land is also private, and real estate development grew unchecked for much of the past century. The area has a long history of large wildfires, yet the land on which Redwood Estates sits has not burned since the 1800s, said Jeff Bates, a lifelong resident of and manager for the local homeowners association. Route 17, which gets about 80,000 vehicles daily and is flanked by hundreds of homes, is the only direct way into or out of the area. Given the highway\u2019s high traffic volume and frequent backups, a quick escape from an approaching fire is unlikely. Bates said a county emergency official told him that in the event of a major fire, \u201cYou folks are on your own.\u201d  \u201cThey won\u2019t be able to get here \u2014 and we won\u2019t be able to leave,\u201d Bates said. While lightning strikes can start wildfires, today more than 95% in California are started by people \u2014 mostly accidentally. Fires are sparked by downed power lines, campfires, mechanical equipment such as chainsaws, and even hot vehicle exhaust pipes touching dry grass. Managing the risk of wildfires isn\u2019t only the job of firefighters, say experts. The most important prevention strategy is education \u2014 teaching people about what starts accidental fires, and how to minimize them. They recommend avoiding highly flammable materials for roofs and decks, and not planting fire-prone non-native species. Yet these steps won\u2019t entirely keep the flames away. \u201cCalifornia is in the fire sweet spot,\u201d said Williams, the climate scientist. \u201cSome big fires are probably inevitable.\u201d  ___  Larson reported from Washington, D.C.  ___  Follow Matthew Brown on Twitter: @MatthewBrownAP, and Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina  ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Language study often focuses on cultural factors, \u201cbut our work shows that language is also a biological phenomenon \u2014 you can\u2019t fully separate culture and biology,\u201d said Balthasar Bickel, a linguist at the University of Zurich and co-author of the new study. The researchers analyzed Stone Age and modern skulls and created simulations of how different jaw placements allow our mouths to make different sounds. They analyzed a database of roughly 2,000 languages \u2014 more than a quarter of languages in existence today \u2014 to identify which sounds were more and less frequently used, and where. Languages spoken by groups with hunter-gatherer societies in their more recent past are far less likely to use consonants used by longtime farming societies, the study found. \u201cOur anatomy actually changed the types of sounds being incorporated into languages,\u201d Noreen von Cramon-Taubadel, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Buffalo who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email. Before societies cultivated crops and learned to cook food, early humans chewed tough raw meat \u2014 which was hard work on our jaws and teeth. Stone Age adult skulls don\u2019t look like modern skulls. These older skulls have upper and lower teeth closing directly on top of each other \u2014 whereas today most people have some degree of overbite, with the front teeth extending in front of bottom teeth when the mouth is closed. \u201cIf you are raised on softer foods, you don\u2019t have the same kind of wear and tear on your bite that your ancestors had, so you keep an overbite,\u201d said Bickel. Eating softer foods not only sets the jaw in a different fashion, but also changes which sounds are easily pronounced. In particular, it becomes much easier to say \u201cf\u2033 and \u201cv,\u201d which linguists call \u201clabiodental\u201d sounds. (Try it. Put your upper and lower incisors \u2014 or \u201cfront teeth\u201d \u2014 directly on top of each other and try say \u201cfavor.\u201d It\u2019s difficult.) The researchers looked closely at 52 languages from what is called the Indo-European language group \u2014 including dialects spoken from Iceland to India \u2014 and charted how the \u201cf\u2033 and \u201cv\u2033 sounds appeared in a rising number of languages over time. As more societies developed agriculture and traded in raw meat for softer fare \u2014 whether it\u2019s cooked meat and potatoes, or rice and stewed vegetables \u2014 these sounds became more common, the researchers found. \u201cNew sounds get introduced into languages, and then are more widely adopted,\u201d said Steven Moran, also a linguist at the University of Zurich and co-author of the paper. The notion that agriculture shaped language was first suggested decades ago by American linguist Charles Hockett, but he did not attempt to prove it. Elan Dresher, a linguist at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the study, commended testing Hockett\u2019s theory, but said the research could be fine-tuned by looking at historical reconstructions of languages, rather than using language databases to make comparisons. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Most of the patients were in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. The Times said New York health officials disclosed the names of the facilities because Candida auris has been spreading quickly. Michael Craig, an antibiotic resistance expert for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the newspaper that someone in the United States dies of a resistant infection every 15 minutes. The Times said Candida auris has been such a secretive subject that various governments have declined to identify or confirm the names of hospitals and nursing homes where the fungus was present, or even to discuss cases after families or physicians confirmed them. New York health officials said they decided to disclose the names of the facilities with cases in the state over the past three years to help stop its spread and provide transparency to the public. However, the state did not say how many cases were at each institution. More than 800 cases of the fungus have been recorded in the United States \u2014 about half of them in New York.

The lawmakers, Senator Jeff Merkley and Representative Suzanne Bonamici, did not mention Johnson & Johnson by name but expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d about Friday\u2019s Reuters report, according to a copy of their letter dated Dec. 19 and reviewed by Reuters. Read the Reuters investigation reut.rs/2rAz2TO  In their letter, the two lawmakers asked the EPA how it was regulating potentially unsafe asbestos-containing products. J&J has disputed the Reuters report, calling it a \u201cmisrepresentation.\u201d The company says its talc is safe and has never contained asbestos, adding that decades of studies and regulatory assessments confirm the safety of its product. Representatives for the EPA did not be respond to an email or a telephone call seeking comment on the congressional letter. Asked about the lawmakers\u2019 letter, J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz declined to comment but said the Reuters report was \u201cone-sided, false and inflammatory.\u201d  According to the Reuters report, documents as well as deposition and trial testimony showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s the company\u2019s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. Most internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed did not find asbestos. The company has defended its products in recent days with a series of full-page newspaper advertisements and a television interview with its chief executive. Shares of the company have fallen about 12.5 percent since the Reuters report on Friday. Merkley and Bonamici also asked the EPA to detail what steps it was taking to help prevent vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and infants from being exposed to products containing asbestos, including other products with talc, a mineral. Although baby powder is subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, other talc products sold to consumers would be within the purview of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and thus the responsibility of the EPA, they wrote in the letter. Democratic U.S. Senator Edward Markey separately called on the FDA to investigate the findings in the Reuters report in a letter on Friday. The FDA could not immediately be reached for comment. \u201cAsbestos is a known carcinogen, and one for which there is no controlled use or safe level of exposure,\u201d Merkley and Bonamici wrote. \u201cFifty-five countries have already banned asbestos.

Now an expected United States-Taliban agreement to end nearly 18 years of fighting raises questions about whether the foreign aid largely propping up the country will drop as troops withdraw. Much depends on the Taliban, who have indicated they want that aid to continue even as they call for armed \u201cinvaders\u201d to leave. But if the insurgent group that already controls roughly half of Afghanistan tries to assert a harsh form of Islamic law across the country or continues its attacks, some donors could walk away. The urgency of aid is seen in Jebul Siraj, a mountainside community north of the capital, Kabul, where a burqa-clad woman held a gaunt, startled-looking boy named Abdullah, just 7 months old. Days ago, he was at an emergency ward. Now he sipped curiously at a supplement as part of a new nutrition monitoring program at a clinic in Parwan province supported by the United Nations children\u2019s agency. Mothers and children lined up outside. Some 2 million children in Afghanistan face acute malnutrition, according to UNICEF, about 600,000 of them so severely malnourished that without urgent treatment they could die. The hospital in nearby Charikar city treats more than 1,000 children a month for malnutrition and the problem is growing, nurse Fariba Hashimi said. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly an economic issue, for mothers as well,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t breastfeed because they don\u2019t have enough income to feed themselves.\u201d Aid has dropped in recent years, with supplemental biscuits and wheat flour that was once provided for patients now unavailable. Health care and other basic services are precarious in a country where the World Bank says grants finance some 75% of total public expenditures. This year it warned against the dire consequences of \u201cany rapid decline in international aid flows.\u201d Afghanistan has been the largest single recipient of American aid since the U.S.-led invasion to oust the Taliban in 2001, but despite billions of dollars in assistance more than half of its people still live in poverty. Much of the aid has gone to security efforts, and frustrated Afghans assert that untold amounts have been lost in corruption and mismanagement. U.S. aid to the country was cut in half in 2014, the year that U.S. and NATO forces formally ended their combat mission. About 20,000 forces remain, largely to train and support Afghan counterparts. If a U.S.-Taliban agreement on ending America\u2019s longest war brings badly needed peace, Afghanistan could see an increase in aid, said Alex Thier, who once directed assistance for the country with the U.S. Agency for International Development. But if the peace process drags out or fails, that could \u201cdepress enthusiasm for giving,\u201d he warned after a visit to Kabul this month. Some donors could be reluctant to fund a government in which the Taliban wield power and don\u2019t respect the rights of women and others. The Taliban have indicated they want international aid to continue, and understanding how to keep it flowing is part of talks with the U.S., Thier said, citing what he has heard from diplomats, Taliban proxies and people who met with Taliban leaders in intra-Afghan dialogues in Moscow and Qatar this year. \u201cPart of the Taliban motivation in the peace process is, they clearly want to avoid being a pariah state as before,\u201d he said. But no one knows what they will give up to keep receiving support. The local U.N. humanitarian coordinator, Toby Lanzer, who has spoken with \u201call of the authorities across Afghanistan,\u201d said he believes aid won\u2019t drop, calling the country\u2019s case so compelling that efforts must continue, whatever happens. He has spoken with the United States and other \u201cparticularly generous\u201d countries and believes donors are in Afghanistan for the long haul. Asked how the interest of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in cutting overall foreign aid complicates the situation, Lanzer paused for more than 10 seconds before saying that \u201cwhen it comes to a strategic location such as Afghanistan, everybody has to chip in, and everybody has been chipping in. And I would very much count on the continued generosity of the people of the United States of America, of institutions such as USAID, to stay the course.\u201d Next year could be Afghanistan\u2019s most pivotal, he said, as the latest round of international aid pledges ends. He expects another pledging conference in 2020 for \u201cthe new government, whichever government that might be.\u201d At the Indira Gandhi children\u2019s hospital in Kabul, which treats 70 to 80 malnourished children a month, director Dr. Mohammad Bashir Qurishi worried about how doctors will be paid and medicine purchased if aid follows troops out of the country. Everyone is afraid of losing the progress made since 2001, he said, as the U.S. and the Taliban negotiate the country\u2019s future while excluding the Afghan government. \u201cIf Trump wants to take us back to Stone Age time, then it is their policy,\u201d he said. In the ward for malnourished children, decorated with aid stickers from UNICEF and Japan, a nurse pointed out fragile toddlers. One 2-year-old, her face covered in tape to keep a nasal feeding tube in place, breathed with discomfort, a Barbie-like doll next to her on her pillow. Nearby was Bibi Warai. Her 2-year-old granddaughter had just died at home outside the eastern city of Jalalabad, and now the girl\u2019s 3-year-old sister, Humaira, was undergoing treatment. After their hours-long journey to the capital she wished for more such wards so that all Afghans can reach help in time. \u201cMy son told me, \u2019How can you leave us at this time of mourning?\u201d\u2033 she said. \u201cI told him, \u2018I can\u2019t stay, I have to take my child for treatment.\u2019 Maybe God will help us, and she will survive.\u201d She placed her hand gently on the girl\u2019s forehead and began to cry. ___ Associated Press video journalist Ahmad Seir in Kabul contributed to this report.

Though formal notice of the reversal has not yet been filed, EPA said the policy it has followed since 1995 relied on an incorrect interpretation of the landmark anti-pollution law. \u201cThis guidance is based on a plain language reading of the statute that is in line with EPA\u2019s guidance for other provisions of the Clean Air Act,\u201d said Bill Wehrum, assistant administrator of EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation. \u201cIt will reduce regulatory burden for industries and the states, while continuing to ensure stringent and effective controls on hazardous air pollutants.\u201d Prior to his confirmation by the GOP-dominated Senate in November, Wehrum worked as a lawyer representing fossil fuel and chemical companies. The American Petroleum Institute was among the industry groups that had called for the longstanding policy to be scraped. The Clean Air Act defines a \u201cmajor source\u201d as a one that has the potential to emit 10 tons or more per year of any hazardous air pollutant, or 25 tons per year of any combination of hazardous air pollutants. For more than 20 years, EPA\u2019s \u201conce-in always-in\u201d required major sources to remain subject to stricter control standards, even if they took steps to reduce their pollution below the threshold.

It\u2019s a choice between air flow in stifling heat or keeping potentially toxic smoke out. \u201cMy daughter hasn\u2019t shown any sort of symptoms, let\u2019s say. For me, I can feel it in my lungs, my throat has felt weird,\u201d Connor said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping her, but the long-term effects? Who knows? She\u2019s 3. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d she added. Slovenian tennis player Dalila Jakupovic fell to her knees in a coughing fit on Wednesday while competing in a qualifying match for the Australian Open in Melbourne. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced something like this,\u201d Jakupovic told Nine Network television. \u201cWe are used to pollution \u2014 like, we play in China and more polluted countries \u2014 but this smoke is something different that for sure we\u2019re not used to.\u201d  Canberra as well as Australia\u2019s two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, have at various times in recent weeks rated as the most polluted cities in the world, although some argue the industrial pollutants in places such as New Delhi are more dangerous than wood smoke. The fires have claimed at least 28 l ives since September, destroyed more than 2,600 homes and razed more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million acres), mostly in New South Wales state. The area burned is larger than the U.S. state of Indiana. Victoria state increased its official fire death toll by one to five on Wednesday when it reclassified the death of a fire management contractor in a traffic accident in November as a victim of the current wildfire crisis. Hospital admissions have increased in the smoke-affected cities, with some patients suffering asthma for the first time in their lives. The government has responded by distributing 3.5 million free particle-excluding masks. Acting Australian Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said he was discussing with the government launching a study of the long-term health implications of the wildfire smoke. Bruce Thompson, president of the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, is among the respiratory disease experts who predict increases in heart and lung diseases as well as some cancers if climate change makes prolonged exposure to wildfire smoke an annual phenomenon. \u201cWe\u2019re breathing in stuff that the lungs don\u2019t like that leads to significant changes, especially people who are predisposed to respiratory conditions,\u201d Thompson said. Thompson, who suffers itchy eyes and a running nose from smoke at home in Melbourne, said comparisons could be drawn between the current crisis and a wildfire that ignited coal in the open-cut Hazelwood mine near the town of Morwell in Victoria state in 2014. The fire burned for 45 days, blanketing Morwell and its 14,000 residents in thick smoke and coal dust. That exposure was still taking tolls on the health of the Morwell community and the wider Latrobe Valley, particularly the young, Thompson said. Brian Oliver, head of the Respiratory Molecular Pathogenesis at University of Technology Sydney, likened prolonged and repeated exposure to such wildfire smoke to smoking cigarettes. Oliver predicted increases in smoker diseases across Australia if the wildfire smoke became more common in a drier and hotter future. NASA says the unprecedented masses of Australian smoke that have drifted east across the Pacific Ocean have returned after circumnavigating the globe. In the U.S., an estimated 20,000 premature deaths now occur annually due to chronic wildfire smoke exposure. That\u2019s expected to double by the end of the century, according to scientists funded by NASA, as tens of millions of people get exposed to massive \u201csmoke waves\u201d emanating from blazes in Western states. Experts say an increase in serious health problems in California may be almost inevitable for vulnerable residents as the disasters become more commonplace. Research suggests children, the elderly and those with existing health problems are most at risk. Short-term exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen existing asthma and lung disease, leading to emergency room treatment or hospitalization, studies have shown. Increases in doctor visits or hospital treatment for respiratory infections, bronchitis and pneumonia in otherwise healthy people also have been found during and after wildfires. Some studies also have found increases in ER visits for heart attacks and strokes in people with existing heart disease on heavy smoke days during previous California wildfires, echoing research on potential risks from urban air pollution. For most healthy people, exposure to wildfire smoke is just an annoyance, causing burning eyes, scratchy throats or chest discomfort that all disappear when the smoke clears. Wood smoke contains some of the same toxic chemicals as urban air pollution, along with tiny particles of vapor and soot 30 times thinner than a human hair. These can infiltrate the bloodstream, potentially causing inflammation and blood vessel damage even in healthy people, research on urban air pollution has shown. Studies have linked heart attacks and cancer with long-term exposure to air pollution. Whether exposure to wildfire smoke carries the same risks is uncertain, and determining harm from smog versus wildfire smoke can be tricky. There is little known about the long-term effects of wildfire smoke because of difficulties in studying populations years after a wildfire. Michael Abramson, professor of epidemiology and preventive medicine at Melbourne\u2019s Monash University, is a co-author of a report on the ongoing investigation of the health impacts of the Hazelwood blaze. Abramson urges a national study of the health impacts of the latest wildfires, saying his research focused on a much smaller population of 74,000 people in the Latrobe Valley. \u201cWe\u2019re now seeing substantial exposure extending over weeks to cities that have millions of inhabitants, so I think it\u2019s very likely that there might be more subtle effects that we haven\u2019t been able to detect,\u201d Abramson said.

Trade in the beaver pelts, used to make fashionable fur hats, drove European expansion in North America in the 1600s and early 1700s. Eaton said the ever-busy dambuilders are now nuisance, but avoided mentioning another gnawing problem with the emblem: In modern times, its name is slang for female genitals. Last year The Beaver, one of Canada\u2019s oldest magazines, re-christened itself Canada\u2019s History, complaining that its emails and newsletters were being blocked by Internet filters.

In their global Tobacco Atlas, the WLF and the American Cancer Society said that in 2013, the last year for which detailed figures were available, tobacco industry profits were more than $44 billion. Meanwhile, 6.3 million people died from smoking-related illness, equivalent to a profit of $7,000 for each death caused by tobacco. The report said that, if current trends continue, a billion people will die from smoking and exposure to tobacco this century. Besides causing lung cancer, which is often fatal, tobacco use is also a major risk factor for a range of other illnesses. It is the world\u2019s leading preventable cause of premature death from chronic conditions such as heart disease, strokes and high blood pressure. In China, the world\u2019s most populous country, almost 2,250 cigarettes were smoked per person over age 15 last year, making it one of only around a dozen countries topping 2,000. The average Chinese smoker consumes 50 percent more than in 1980, a symptom of a broader phenomenon, as tobacco use declines or is stable in many wealthy, developed nations but growing in poorer regions such as Africa and parts of Asia. \u201cThe significant reductions in smoking rates in the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, and other countries that implement increasingly tight tobacco control laws have been offset by the growing consumption in a single nation: China,\u201d the report said. Many countries around the world have introduced some anti-tobacco laws, including curbing advertising and banning smoking in enclosed spaces such as bars, restaurants and offices. But the Tobacco Atlas found that only 10 percent of the world\u2019s population are covered by comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and only 16 percent by comprehensive smoke-free legislation. Low- and middle-income countries now account for more than  80 percent of tobacco users and tobacco-related deaths. The Tobacco Atlas also found that smoking among women is also on the rise, driving up rates of female lung cancer. In an indication of future trends, there are 24 countries where girls smoke more than boys, compared to just two countries where more women smoke than men, it said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the link between tobacco and increasing rates of lung cancer among women or the ever-increasing number of health conditions and deaths related to tobacco use, the health and economic case for reducing tobacco use has never been clearer,\u201d said John Seffrin, chief executive of the ACS.

For her job, Narkiewicz has been trained in CPR and mental health crisis response and carries the opioid overdose antidote naloxone with her. As libraries nationwide contend with a surge in patrons seeking refuge in the stacks because of poverty, drug addiction or mental illness, a growing number of institutions have social workers on staff. It\u2019s the latest step in an evolution that libraries have been dealing with for years as homelessness and the opioid crisis reach emergency levels and patrons have come to rely on libraries as free, safe spaces open to all. Though homelessness has seen some declines in the U.S. since the recession, it has surged in cities like Seattle, where a homelessness state of emergency and a spike in questions from library patrons about things like housing, transportation and food led the public library system to hire its first full-time social worker in 2018. Other libraries, unable to afford such a step, have trained librarians to handle certain emergencies themselves. That\u2019s caused some debate among library workers about whether they\u2019re being asked to adapt to an evolving job or to do work that goes too far beyond their expertise. \u201cI can get you a phone number, I can get you a book you want ... but when you\u2019re dealing with mental health issues, I don\u2019t feel appropriately trained for it,\u201d Narkiewicz said. A few master\u2019s degree programs for aspiring librarians have classes on mental health, but most don\u2019t. To help fill in the gaps, an estimated 40-plus library systems have full-time social workers on staff, according to Whole Person Librarianship, an organization that tracks such partnerships. At the Queens Public Library in New York City, resident social worker Shantel Johnson oversees a team of library case managers, but she\u2019s also available to help librarians communicate with struggling patrons, connect visitors to services or just listen to people. \u201cThey\u2019ll open up to staff, and staff is doing 14 different things,\u201d Johnson said. She says she regularly helps patrons who are homeless, experiencing abuse or having trouble applying for jobs. The Queens Public Library also started stationing New York University social work interns in some branches last year, as does the New York Public Library, which got its first interns two years ago. Library patron Sofia Ciniglio was meeting twice weekly with an intern at a Manhattan branch last year for career advice. But their conversations eventually involved her family, feelings and personal life. The intern introduced Ciniglio to a library where she could learn Braille, which she\u2019d been curious about. \u201cShe was very much a good listener, very attentive, and she knew who I was and the nuances of how I go about things,\u201d Ciniglio said. The NYPL\u2019s librarians, meanwhile, are trained to de-escalate conflicts but aren\u2019t asked to do more in-depth mental health crisis training. Spokeswoman Amy Geduldig notes that the library \u201cis not a social services organization, and its staff are not medical or mental health professionals.\u201d The NYPL, the nation\u2019s busiest library system, still hasn\u2019t hired a full-time licensed social worker, though Brooklyn did in 2015 and Queens did in 2018. In some libraries without professional social work help, employees are being asked to take on new tasks. At the San Diego Public Library, a state library grant has funded employee trainings in mental health first aid since 2016. Librarian Joseph Miesner says the training helped him personally when he came across a suicidal patron. In small town Titusville, Pennsylvania, library director Justin Hoenke recently agreed with his library\u2019s board that all staffers should be trained to administer naloxone if needed. \u201cThis is a new requirement of the job,\u201d Hoenke said. \u201cIf they\u2019re not comfortable with it, they kind of have to reevaluate their life and their job. You have to change with the times.\u201d Fobazi Ettarh doesn\u2019t see it that way. An academic librarian at Rutgers University in Newark, she says too many expectations can distract librarians from their work, and she personally wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable as a first responder to an overdose. \u201cIt would just be a lot for my mental health,\u201d she said. Research suggests other librarians feel the same way. A 2018 survey of librarians in Pennsylvania found many reported they already felt stressed from trying to answer questions from patrons about mental health and social services, even without handling acute emergencies in the library. Meanwhile, some librarians, like Amanda Oliver, have begged in vain for more preparation. Oliver said she quit her public library job in Washington when she asked supervisors for more training and \u201cwas largely ignored.\u201d District of Columbia Public Library Executive Director Richard Reyes-Gavilan says Oliver\u2019s branch offered at least two trainings related to mental health during her tenure, but the library is also \u201ccommitted to doing even more\u201d to support staff. Despite fraught encounters with people in crisis, Narkiewicz, who works part time right now, still hopes to find a full-time job in the library field. \u201cSome days are really difficult. Some days are amazing and terrific,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an eye-opening, but an amazing, wonderful career.\u201d Claim: Librarians facing new tasks say crisis isn\u2019t in the catalog.", "output": "When Jackie Narkiewicz switched careers and became a librarian, she thought she\u2019d spend her workdays \u201cdrinking hot beverages and discussing literature with people.\u201d", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

More than half have received a booster shot that protects against tetanus, whooping cough and diphtheria, the survey of 20,000 teens aged 13 to 17 said. \u201cWe can see that more parents of adolescents are electing to protect their children from serious diseases such as pertussis (whooping cough), meningitis, and cervical cancer but there is clear room for improvement in our system\u2019s ability to reach this age group,\u201d the CDC\u2019s Dr. Anne Schuchat said. She pointed to recent outbreaks of whooping cough, especially in California, where state health officials say seven infants too young to be vaccinated have died and 3,000 cases have been reported. \u201cYoung infants are most vulnerable to serious complications from pertussis and can be infected by older siblings, parents or other caretakers,\u201d Schuchat said in a statement. The survey found that 56 percent of teens aged 13 to 17 had at least one dose of tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine, known as Tdap, an increase of 15 points since 2008. It found 54 percent of teens got at least one dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine, up 12 points. This vaccine is aimed at teenagers who will go to new high schools or colleges and risk getting infected by the sometimes fatal bacteria in dorms or when they begin dating. The survey showed 44 percent of girls had received at least one dose of human papillomavirus, or HPV vaccine, an increase of seven percentage points.

All in all, it\u2019s a form of violence against women.\u201d    Her bill has attracted support from three Democratic lawmakers, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s administration officials called the practice \u201cdisturbing.\u201d Solages said no other states have such bans. The World Health Organization, U.N. Women and the U.N. Human Rights office called for the end of the tests worldwide last year. They said the testing often involves inspecting the hymen or inserting fingers into the vagina. T.I., also known as Clifford Joseph Harris, Jr., drew criticism when he said in a November episode of the podcast \u201cLadies like Us\u201d that he asked a gynecologist to check his teenage daughter\u2019s hymen shortly after her birthday each year. She is now 18. \u201cI put a sticky note on the door: \u2018Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30,\u2019\u201d Harris said. After his comments prompted backlash on social media, he told Jada Pinkett Smith on the Facebook interview show Red Table Talk he\u2019d been exaggerating and that \u201che was never in any exam room.\u201d Phone and email messages were left with Harris\u2019 publicist Tuesday. Experts say such testing is painful and that there\u2019s no evidence such testing shows whether a woman or girl has had vaginal intercourse. \u201cThere is no test that can tell you whether someone had intercourse, whether consensually or non-consensually,\u201d Ranit Mishori, professor of family medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine and senior medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights. Mishori said there\u2019s a mistaken belief that you can tell whether someone\u2019s had vaginal intercourse from a tear in a hymen, which can also tear from tampons or physical activity. Some women lack a hymen, a membrane that partly covers vaginas and can also change as a girl matures due to hormonal change. \u201cIt\u2019s of course not only impossible to tell for sure, but also a violation of woman\u2019s rights,\u201d said retired obstetrician-gynecologist Jaana Rehnstorm, who is the founder and president of gender equality non-profit The Kota Alliance. Such testing stems from cultural concerns about a woman\u2019s \u201cpurity\u201d or \u201cmarriageability,\u201d Mishori said. \u201cIf a women is not a \u2018virgin,\u2019 her prospects of being married, her prospects of securing a family, her prospects of being thought of as an upstanding citizen can go down the drain,\u201d she said. \u201dBut these are very sexist ideas about women and sexuality.\u201d But criminalizing the practice is \u201cmisguided,\u201d Mishori said. \u201cI think the solution is we have to think about education, we have to think about changing social norms,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to think about breaking down stigma and educating not only the patients in front of us but the family members and community members.\u201d \u201cI think unfortunately, if you ban it or if you criminalize it, it will drive it underground,\u201d she said. Such examinations have been documented in at least 20 countries. The extent of whether they are performed in the U.S. is unclear, though Mishori said that physicians have shared anecdotes of patients and parents requesting such testing. \u201cThis happens in different communities \u2014 not just migrant or immigrant communities, but also maybe very, very religious communities,\u201d she said. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists President Ted Anderson has said the organization does not have guidance on so-called virginity testing. \u201cAs a medical organization, ACOG releases guidance on medically indicated and valid procedures,\u201d he said in a statement.

We enjoy the invocations of history, especially when they're factually accurate. We like the annual cookout with old friends. And we love fireworks. So we were especially interested to read a newspaper commentary by Bill Weimer, vice president of Youngstown-based Phantom Fireworks, the nation\u2019s largest retailer of consumer fireworks. \"\"Fireworks have never been safer, and their use continues to increase each year,\"\" he wrote. \"\"This alone provides a strong case for the regulated and sensible use of consumer fireworks.\"\" Really? Safer than ever? In 1994, Weimer said, the United States imported 117 million pounds of fireworks, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported 12,500 fireworks-related injuries. By 2010, \u00a0fireworks imports grew more than 75 percent to 205.9 million pounds, but the number of fireworks-related injuries dropped by more than 30 percent to 8,600. \"\"This is phenomenal progress in safety,\"\" Weimer wrote, calling on Ohio's General Assembly to relax state laws and legalize consumer fireworks. PolitiFact Ohio looked at the law and checked the numbers. Ohio law, which now permits the use of only \"\"novelty and trick\"\" fireworks, is among the more restrictive nationally. Three other states have similar laws, and four ban all consumer fireworks. Forty-one states and Washington, D.C., allow some or all types of consumer fireworks permitted by federal regulations, according to the American Pyrotechnics Association. We found that Weimer's numbers, as reported by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Pyrotechnics Association, a trade group, are accurate. The same day Weimer\u2019s column was published, the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, which set standards for consumer fireworks in 1976, issued its annual fireworks report last week. It confirmed the injury number Weimer used -- 8,600 for 2010. CPSC spokeswoman Nikki Fleming said the injury rate as measured by injuries per 100,000 persons has leveled off. The Massachusetts-based National Fire Protection Association takes the position that \"\"using consumer fireworks is simply not worth the risk,\"\" division manager Guy Colonna said. \"\"We don't seem to be trending that rapidly toward zero,\"\" he said of the injury numbers. \"\"You haven't moved the needle so much in terms of saying it's safe for consumers to use.\"\" The NFPA -- which coordinates the national Alliance to Stop Consumer Fireworks -- said in its annual report in June that there are more fires on a typical July 4th than any other day of the year, and that fireworks account for 40 percent. Colonna acknowledged statistics showing that the rate of injury per 100,000 pounds of imported fireworks has declined, but said it is \"\"still a significant number.\"\" The American Pyrotechnics Association, a trade group, cites the latter statistic. It shows that the rate of injuries dropped from 38 per 100,000 pounds of fireworks in 1976 to 7 in 2000 and to 4 per 100,000 pounds of fireworks in 2010. The trade group considers that significant because U.S. fireworks consumption has skyrocketed. It more than doubled between 2000, when the trade group says \"\"the trend in relaxing (state) consumer fireworks laws was first initiated,\"\" and 2011, when 212 million pounds were sold. The trade group credits \"\"safety education efforts and the ever improving quality of its products.\"\" It says that injuries and fires most typically result from illegal fireworks and from improper use, especially involving children. But does that mean that fireworks themselves are safer? We asked Weimer what he had to support his statement. He immediately credited the work of the CPSC and the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory. In the 1970s, the CPSC set federal requirements for consumer fireworks that cover cautionary labeling, the burn time of fuses, explosive powder content, stability for both ground-based and aerial devices and proper performance. In 1988, the CPSC started an inspection and enforcement program for Chinese-manufactured fireworks. China -- which now supplies 98 percent of the fireworks in the United States -- began exporting fireworks to this country in 1973. Initially, 75 percent of fireworks tested \u00a0by the CPSC failed to comply with the regulations. \"\"The quality truly wasn't very good,\"\" Weimer said. \"\"The quality was inconsistent. The industry knew that if it didn't so something there would be big issues.\"\" Working with the CPSC, importers established the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory to set additional, stricter requirements for consumer fireworks. The AFSL went to factories in China, conducted seminars, worked with manufacturers and started a testing program in China in 1994. \"\"The linchpin of the system is the testing,\"\" Weimer said. The testing is conducted by an independent laboratory hired from outside China by the AFSL. Each fireworks shipment is tested for compliance with 15 quality standards, Weimer said. If any standard is not met by any of the randomly selected cases, the entire case lot fails. In the program's first year, 1994, 36 percent of the random lots of tested fireworks were rejected. By 2002, that number was less than 10 percent. The compliance rate exceeded 90 percent. CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum, speaking at a symposium in China last January, noted that the agency has been working for years with manufacturers and with China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. \"\"While AQSIQ and CPSC may work to improve product safety with somewhat different motivations, everyone benefits from the end result, which is improved product safety,\"\" she said, adding that \"\"we have increased the frequency, scope, and depth of our training in China.\"\" Weimer thinks that the availability of regulated consumer fireworks diminishes the use of the \"\"really lethal\"\" illegal and homemade variety. So what's the grand finale? PolitiFact Ohio is not ruling on the advisability of maintaining, relaxing or tightening Ohio laws regulating fireworks. And we\u2019re not taking a position on whether consumer use of fireworks is even a good idea. Weimer\u2019s statement addressed legal and proper use of fireworks by consumers -- not use of homemade or illegal products. And fireworks are -- as Weimer told us -- a \"\"product with risk associated with it.\"\" But, the statistical record shows that the rate of injury from fireworks declined nationally while their use increased dramatically, and while laws governing their consumer use loosened. There still are injuries, but the annual rate has plateaued even while consumption continues to grow. We found no stronger explanation than the concurrent regulatory and policing work of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory to make fireworks safer.

The burger is the result of years of research by Dutch scientist Mark Post, a vascular biologist at the University of Maastricht, who is working to show how meat grown in petri dishes might one day be a true alternative to meat from livestock. The meat in the burger has been made by knitting together around 20,000 strands of protein that has been cultured from cattle stem cells in Post\u2019s lab. The tissue is grown by placing the cells in a ring, like a donut, around a hub of nutrient gel, Post explained. To prepare the burger, scientists combined the cultured beef with other ingredients normally used in burgers, such as salt, breadcrumbs and egg powder. Red beet juice and saffron have been added to bring out its natural colors. \u201cOur burger is made from muscle cells taken from a cow. We haven\u2019t altered them in any way,\u201d Post said in a statement on Friday. \u201cFor it to succeed it has to look, feel and hopefully taste like the real thing.\u201d  Success, in Post\u2019s view, would mean not just a tasty burger, but also the prospect of finding a sustainable, ethical and environmentally friendly alternative to meat production. According to a 2006 report by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), industrialized agriculture contributes on a \u201cmassive scale\u201d to climate change, air pollution, land degradation, energy use, deforestation and biodiversity decline. The report, entitled Livestock\u2019s Long Shadow, said the meat industry contributes about 18 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions and this proportion is expected to grow as consumers in fast-developing countries such as China and India eat more meat. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), annual meat production is projected to rise to 376 million metric tons by 2030 from 218 million metric tons in 1997-1999, and demand from a growing world population is expected to rise beyond that. Post cites FAO figures suggesting demand for meat is expected to increase by more than two-thirds by 2050. Animal welfare campaigners applauded the arrival of cultured meat and predicted a great future for it. \u201cIn vitro technology will spell the end of lorries full of cows and chickens, abattoirs and factory farming,\u201d the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) campaign group said in a statement. \u201cIt will reduce carbon emissions, conserve water and make the food supply safer.\u201d  A study published in 2011 comparing the relative environmental impacts of various types of meat, including lamb, pork, beef and cultured meat, said the lab-grown product has by far the least impact on the environment. Hanna Tuomisto, who conducted the study at Oxford University\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, found that growing meats in-vitro would use 35 percent to 60 percent less energy, emit 80 percent to 95 percent less greenhouse gas and use around 98 percent less land than conventionally produced animal meat. While Monday\u2019s fry-up will be a world first and only an initial proof-of concept, the Dutch scientist reckons commercial production of cultured beef could begin within the next 20 years. \u201cWhat we are going to attempt is important because I hope it will show cultured beef has the answers to major problems that the world faces,\u201d he added.

Francis said declarations on the immorality of the use or possession of nuclear weapons would be incorporated in the Church\u2019s universal catechism, a compilation of Catholic teachings and rules. The pope comforted victims of the 2011 Fukushima disaster on Monday in Tokyo and noted a call by Japan\u2019s Catholic bishops to abolish nuclear power outright. Around 18,000 people died or were classified as missing after the so-called Triple Disaster, when a massive earthquake set off a tsunami - in some places 30 meters high - destroying a wide swathe of Japan\u2019s northeastern coast and triggering a nuclear meltdown at the plant. \u201cThe use of nuclear energy is at the limit (of safety) because we still have not managed to achieve total security,\u201d Francis said. \u201cIn my personal opinion, I would not use nuclear energy until there is total security. There is not enough security to guarantee that there will not be a disaster,\u201d Francis added. Francis said assertions that nuclear accidents were rare were insufficient because effects of radiation are felt for decades on people and the environment, such as in the area around the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine which was crippled by a meltdown in 1986. Francis, who wrote a major encyclical in 2015 on protection of the environment and the effects of global warming, said humanity had gone beyond the limit in violating nature. As examples, he listed the overuse of pesticides and dispensing growth hormones to animals destined for human consumption. \u201cThe (need for the) protection of the environment has gotten to the point where it is either now or never,\u201d he said. Without naming countries, Francis accused states of practicing \u2018armament hypocrisy\u2019, saying nations of Christian tradition \u201cspeak of peace but live off weapons. This is called hypocrisy\u201d. Francis said the United Nations does much good around the world but criticized the system that gives veto power to only a few nations in the Security Council. \u201cWithout meaning any offence to anyone, think of the (UN) Security Council: if here is a problem with weapons and everybody votes in favor of avoiding a bellicose action ... and one with veto power votes no, everything stops,\u201d he said.

That today\u2019s death tolls are higher and the media coverage surrounding them more intense might serve to encourage belief that this sort of random murder by, and of, young people is a recent phenomenon, but the sad history of such attacks belies that belief. Deadly shooting sprees at schools perpetrated by troubled teens took place at least as much as a generation before Columbine. One of the earliest mass school shootings occurred in 1975 in Ottawa, Canada, when on 27 October of that year, 18-year-old Robert Poulin went on a killing spree at St. Pius X High School, killing one student and wounding five others before turning the gun on himself. Poulin had earlier raped and stabbed a 17-year-old friend to death. Of all the pre-Littleton school shootings, the one most remembered by people at the time was recalled primarily because of its impact on pop culture: it inspired the popular Boomtown Rats song \u201cI Don\u2019t Like Mondays.\u201d Released in October 1979, this song captured the insanity of the moment by working the shooter\u2019s chilling utterance into its lyrics:  Of course fallible memory being what it is, people who now remember the shooting spree behind the song recall it in only the most haphazard of fashions. They recall that a shooting took place at a school, that lives were lost, that the shooter was female, and that by way of explanation for her actions she said \u201cI don\u2019t like Mondays,\u201d but some have her as a high school student gunning down students at her own school, while others remember her as a high school teacher who turned a gun on some of her pupils:  There\u2019s this 80\u2019s song called \u201cI Don\u2019t Like Mondays\u201d. I don\u2019t know who wrote it, but the rumor is that the song was based on a girl. She was a younger girl, I think in High School. She was quiet and was very shy. She didn\u2019t have very many friends. One Monday she went to school with a gun and shot several of her teachers and fellow students. When the cops asked her why she did it she said \u201cI don\u2019t like Mondays\u201d. And that\u2019s what the song was based on. The late 70s/early 80s song \u201cI Don\u2019t Like Mondays\u201d was written to reflect the mindset of a teacher who came to work one day and shot up a schoolyard full of kids. When asked at trial why she did it, the teacher supposedly only gave the reply, \u201cI don\u2019t like Mondays.\u201d  The facts are that on 29 January 1979, 16-year-old Brenda Ann Spencer opened fire on children arriving at Cleveland Elementary School in San Diego from her house across the street, killing two men and wounding eight students and a police officer. Principal Burton Wragg was attempting to rescue children in the line of fire when he was shot and killed, and custodian Mike Suchar was slain attempting to aid Wragg. Spencer used a rifle her father had given her as a gift. As to what impelled her into this form of murderous madness, she told a reporter, \u201cI don\u2019t like Mondays. This livens up the day.\u201d The \u201cMondays\u201d comment was not the only eyebrow-raising declaration to issue from Spencer that day. According to a report written by the police negotiators who spoke with her during the six-hour standoff, she made comments to them such as: \u201cThere was no reason for it, and it was just a lot of fun\u201d; \u201cIt was just like shooting ducks in a pond\u201d; and \u201d [the children] looked like a herd of cows standing around, it was really easy pickings.\u201d That Spencer failed to kill any of the children she shot at was attributable to luck rather than any reluctance on her part to take their lives. The bullet that struck 9-year-old Charles \u201cCam\u201d Miller missed his heart by about an inch. Spencer pled guilty to two counts of murder and assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. She has been up for parole four times and has been turned down each time, the last in 2005. At her first parole hearing she expressed doubt that any of the victims was hit by bullets from her rifle and contended they might have been shot by police. She also claimed to have been under the influence of alcohol and hallucinogenic drugs at the time of the shootings and asserted prosecutors and her attorney had conspired to fabricate test evidence showing there had been no drugs in her system. By her third parole hearing she was admitting guilt and expressing remorse but was still contending she had been drunk and high on marijuana laced with PCP the day of her deadly rampage. She also claimed something new, that she had been beaten and sexually abused by her father, an avowal conspicuously absent from previous records.

Conservative columnist Erick Erickson ran down the list in a recent post on RedState.com. Trump has given money to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. He has supported abortion rights. And \"\"he has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system,\"\" Erickson wrote. We decided to look into Trump\u2019s track record on health care. The billionaire\u2019s 2000 book The America We Deserve makes a strong pitch for universal health care. \"\"I\u2019m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one,\"\" Trump wrote. \"\"We should not hear so many stories of families ruined by health care expenses. We must not allow citizens with medical problems to go untreated because of financial problems or red tape.\"\" When he turned to how the country might achieve universal coverage, Trump focused like a laser beam on a Canadian-style, single-payer plan. He said it would eliminate many billions of dollars of overhead. \"\"The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America,\"\" he wrote. \"\"We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.\"\" Ever the pragmatist, Trump noted change would not happen overnight. \"\"While we work out details of a new single-payer plan, there are a number of ways to make the health care system now in place work more efficiently,\"\" Trump wrote. So, it\u2019s fair to say that in 2000, Trump supported a Canadian-style health care plan. By 2011, his views had changed. As he contemplated a presidential bid, he told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., that \"\"I will fight to end Obamacare and replace it with something that makes sense for people in business and not bankrupt the country.\"\" In an interview with the New York Times, Trump backed away from a single-payer plan, as well as another of his proposals from a decade earlier, a surtax on the wealthiest Americans. ''We had a much different country when I proposed those two things,'' he said, according to the New York Times reporter. We searched the Nexis database of news reports for any other views Trump might have voiced on universal health care between 2000 and 2011 and found none. In a recent radio interview, Trump did not so much reject his previous support for a Canadian-style plan as describe, in a roundabout fashion, a totally different approach. He gave few\u00a0details but said, \"\"we're going to have great (private) plans,\"\" and that government should help people \"\"at the lower levels.\"\" \"\"You can\u2019t have a guy that has no money, that\u2019s sick, and he can\u2019t go see a doctor, he can\u2019t go see a hospital,\"\" Trump said. \"\"I mean, because I\u2019m actually a conservative with a heart.\"\" Our ruling Erickson said that Trump has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system.

During arguments before a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday, the families\u2019 lawyer, Jonathan Nace, said Wheeler and the Johns Hopkins black lung unit \u201cbelieved they were above the law\u201d when Wheeler disregarded federal regulations on how to interpret X-rays to diagnose black lung disease. \u201cNow they are asking the court to confirm that for them,\u201d Nace said. Nace said Wheeler failed to follow the regulations outlined in the Black Lung Benefits Act for years, causing two West Virginia coal miners \u2014 Michael Day and Junior McCoy Barr \u2014 to lose significant amounts of money in compensation. Both men later died of black lung disease. James Mathias, arguing on behalf of Johns Hopkins and Wheeler, said the case \u201cbegins and ends\u201d with witness immunity, which shields witnesses from later civil liability. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III said exposing expert witnesses to liability could have a chilling effect. \u201cYou need the privilege ... to get people to testify,\u201d Wilkinson said. The three-judge panel did not indicate when it would issue its ruling. The proposed class-action lawsuit filed by the families of Day and Barr cited a 2013 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity and ABC News reporting that Wheeler did not apply the required guidelines for evaluating X-rays of patients to determine if they had black lung disease. The series, which won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting, found that in at least 280 cases in which Wheeler convinced an administrative law judge to deny benefits, autopsies later showed the miners had the disease and were entitled to benefits. After the report was published, Johns Hopkins suspended and later discontinued its black lung program headed by Wheeler, who retired. A spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit, but released a statement saying  Johns Hopkins \u201ctook swift action when we learned of potential issues with the program.\u201d \u201cWe extend our deepest sympathies to those who have lost loved ones to this horrible disease, and we commend all efforts to ensure the Black Lung Benefits claims process is fair and just for all parties involved,\u201d the statement said.

A previous case in Guangzhou, disclosed last month, prompted the tests. The incidents have raised fears the unexplained issues that started in Cuba in 2016 have expanded to other countries. China says it has uncovered no information that could point to a cause. The most recent evacuations followed medical testing that revealed they might have been affected. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said \u201ca number of individuals\u201d had been brought to the U.S. but didn\u2019t say how many were affected or evacuated. Friday\u2019s alert called for people to be attentive of symptoms including \u201cdizziness, headaches, tinnitus, fatigue, cognitive issues, visual problems, ear complaints and hearing loss, and difficulty sleeping.\u201d It urged them \u201cnot to attempt to locate the source of any unidentified auditory sensation. Instead, move to a different location.\u201d The U.S. government has deemed the Cuba incidents \u201cspecific attacks\u201d on American workers but hasn\u2019t publicly identified a cause or culprit. Most of the incidents were accompanied by bizarre, unexplained sounds that initially led U.S. investigators to suspect a sonic attack. Asked about the latest incidents, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Thursday that the U.S. had not formally raised the matter with Beijing. \u201cIf the U.S. makes formal contact with us, China will continue necessary investigations in an earnest and responsible manner and maintain close communication and cooperation with the U.S.,\u201d Hua said at a regularly scheduled news conference. China earlier said it had looked into the case announced last month but came up with no clues about the cause of the symptoms. A U.S. official, who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the situation publicly and requested anonymity, said the evacuated American government workers were being brought from China for testing to the University of Pennsylvania. That\u2019s where doctors have been treating and studying patients previously evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Havana. The preliminary findings of the medical reports on the 24 personnel affected in Cuba showed they had sensory and memory problems similar to the brain dysfunction seen with concussions. The Penn team said the patients from Cuba experienced persistent disability though rehabilitation therapy customized for them seemed to help. Canada in April also ordered families of diplomatic staff in Cuba to return home after mysterious health symptoms were detected in 10 Canadians stationed on the island. Canada said the 10 continued to show unexplained brain symptoms and that \u201cmedical information raised concerns for a new type of a possible acquired brain injury.\u201d In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month about the first case in China, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China had \u201csaid all the right things and have demonstrated their willingness to help us identify the vector which led to this medical incident.\u201d The China incidents affect one of the most important of the seven U.S. diplomatic outposts in the country. The Guangzhou consulate opened months after the establishment of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Washington in 1979 and moved to its new purpose-built facility in 2013. It serves four southern provinces with a combined population of more than 204 million and processes more than 1 million visa applications of all types annually. It is also the only U.S. diplomatic installation in China authorized to process immigrant visas and handle adoptions. People working in The Canton Place complex, a few kilometers (miles) from the consulate, said Thursday they were just hearing about the incidents, reflecting a lack of coverage in China\u2019s entirely state-controlled media. Aled Williams, a British teacher at a kindergarten said Thursday that the reports sounded \u201csci-fi-ish.\u201d \u201cHard to get my head around how it works,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter watch myself.\u201d Linda Chen, who runs a coffee shop in the area, said she was mystified as to why only certain people seemed to have been affected in an area known for its comfort and safety. \u201cFor me I feel it\u2019s very strange.

Those six factors were, as described in the journal article: \u201cnot currently smoking or quit 10 or more years ago, body mass index under 30 kg/m2, high vigorous physical activity, high intake of tomatoes and fatty fish, and low intake of processed meat.\u201d It\u2019s tough to put a price tag on those lifestyle choices. How much does \u201chigh vigorous physical activity\u201d cost? How much does it cost to avoid eating processed meat? It would be easy to say this category doesn\u2019t apply. But the release does address the issue, saying the study findings underscore \u201cthe ongoing need for more effective prevention measures and policies to increase exercise, improve diet quality and reduce tobacco use in our population\u2026.It takes co-operation and effort from multiple areas, like insurance companies, employers, policy makers and city planners, to figure out how to creatively support and encourage more exercise into most busy adults\u2019 working day.\u201d Recognizing the need for policies that support these lifestyle changes is important \u2014 and addresses the cost issue in a meaningful way. This is where things get a little tricky. The research described in this journal article looked at data from two different studies: the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians\u2019 Health Study (PHS). The HPFS tracked 42,701 men from 1986-2010. The PHS tracked 20,324 men from 1982-2010. The release (and journal article) explain that the researchers used the HPFS data to develop a \u201chealthy lifestyle score,\u201d and then applied that score to the men in the PHS to see if it predicted whether someone would contract a lethal form of prostate cancer. The researchers identified the number of lethal cases of prostate cancer in each group to calculate benefits. The release states: \u201cParticipants with 5 to 6 points [the highest scores] in the HPFS had a 68 percent decreased risk of lethal prostate cancer[,] and a 38 percent decreased risk was observed in the [PHS] for the same comparison.\u201d Several points to make here. First, the \u2018healthy\u2019 group appeared to have been compared to the \u2018least healthy\u2019 group (score 0-1) and not all the other groups combined. This was noted in the published results but not mentioned in the release. That\u2019s important. Second, the release does not note (but the journal article does) that the 38 percent decreased risk seen in the PHS was not found to be statistically significant. That\u2019s also an important distinction. Third, this is the relative reduced risk, and doesn\u2019t tell readers what the actual, absolute reduction of risk is. The release doesn\u2019t address harms. But the lifestyle choices at issue here are (for the most part) so broadly defined that it would be difficult to say what the harms would be. What harms are associated with eating tomatoes, avoiding processed meats, or not smoking? We\u2019ll rate this one not applicable. The release does a good job of explaining what is a somewhat complicated study design. The study is basically an analysis of data drawn from two large, previous studies \u2014 and the release describes the overall sample size, age range, and length of those two studies. But the language used to describe the results is inappropriate. Since this was an analysis of observational study data that\u2019s unable to prove cause and effect, it\u2019s misleading to use active verbs to describe the results. The release does this in several places: It\u2019s more appropriate to state that these habits were \u201cassociated with\u201d reduced risk \u2014 not that the habits \u201csave lives\u201d or \u201ccut\u201d risk. Another thing that\u2019s not clearly explained to readers (as noted above) is what it means to develop a lifestyle scoring system based on one study\u2019s data set, and then apply that scoring system to a second data set, when the results section is provided for both data sets. It\u2019s confusing. We\u2019d encourage public affairs specialists preparing news releases and reporters using them as their initial sources to focus more on the limitations of this type of research. Sometimes referred to as \u201cdata dredging,\u201d it\u2019s basically finding statistically significant results only by chance. In this case it\u2019s a statistic of a statistic (up to 47% of cancer cases could be prevented with these lifestyle interventions). No disease mongering here. Funding sources were clearly identified, and there are no clear conflicts of interest. Things get tricky again here. As the release notes, most prostate cancers don\u2019t metastasize and aren\u2019t life threatening. But some do metastasize and can be fatal. Are there different types of prostate cancer, just like there are different types of flu? Are there genetic factors that affect risk? Readers would have benefited from that information. And we suppose that the release could have also mentioned other dietary or lifestyle factors that might help reduce risk that were not considered in the paper. However, the range of healthy behaviors discussed here is pretty broad, and it seems excessive to expect the release to address an entire laundry list of possibilities. We\u2019ll give this a Satisfactory rating. The study was limited to a relatively high level income group and the interventions may not be attainable for all men, in all socioeconomic groups. Does partaking of vigorous physical exercise on a regular basis require access to a gym or just a high degree of motivation? Are tomatoes and fish attainable year round for all socioeconomic groups? The study addresses this to some extent when it says, \u201cIt takes co-operation and effort from multiple areas, like insurance companies, employers, policy makers and city planners, to figure out how to creatively support and encourage more exercise into most busy adults\u2019 working day.\u201d We\u2019ll award a Satisfactory here. There are a lot \u2014 a lot \u2014 of papers out there on lifestyle choices and prostate cancer. In fact, the opening sentences in the abstract for the journal article says as much, while articulating what sets this research apart: \u201cSeveral lifestyle factors have been associated with risk of lethal prostate cancer, but little is known about their combined effect. Our objective was to develop and apply a lifestyle score for prevention of lethal prostate cancer.\u201d However, the release does not acknowledge all of the existing work on lifestyle and prostate cancer, and therefore fails to highlight how this paper fits into that broad body of work. Apart from the cause-and-effect statements addressed above, there is no unjustifiable language used here. Claim: Working up a sweat may protect men from lethal prostate cancer", "output": "This release summarizes an article in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute which reports that healthy lifestyle habits, including regular vigorous exercise, are associated with reduced risk of death from prostate cancer. The release does a fine job of describing a complex study that actually analyzed two studies and came up with a common scoring system, but could have explained the study limitations and articulated the benefits more clearly for readers. It also overstated the strength of the evidence by suggesting that these habits \u201csave lives\u201d \u2014 this study wasn\u2019t capable of demonstrating that. Prostate cancer is costly \u2014 in both lives and money. It is the most common cancer in U.S. men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2012, more than 177,000 men in the U.S. were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 27,244 died from the disease. In 2006, it was estimated to cost the U.S. more than $9.86 billion. New information that can shed light on how lifestyle choices may limit deaths related to prostate cancer is both welcome and newsworthy.

About a dozen states have also targeted Richard Sackler, the company\u2019s former leader, or members of his family. \u201cPurdue and the Sacklers traded the health and well-being of Californians for profit and created an unprecedented national public health crisis in the process,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said at a news conference announcing the legal action by his state. \u201cWe will hold them accountable.\u201d Becerra, echoing allegations lodged against Purdue Pharma by others attorneys general across the country, said the company falsely introduced OxyContin in the 1990s as a safe and effective treatment for chronic pain. However, the California\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Purdue and Sackler knew in 1997 that drugs containing oxycodone, such as OxyContin, were widely abused. Still, company representatives marketed it as not being addictive and downplayed the potential for abuse, the suit states. In a statement Monday, Purdue Pharma and former directors of the company denied the allegations and vowed to defend against the \u201cmisleading attacks.\u201d It noted that OxyContin represents less than 2% of total opioid prescriptions and is still approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its intended use as a painkiller as prescribed by doctors and dispensed by pharmacists. \u201cSuch allegations demand clear evidence linking the conduct alleged to the harm described,\u201d spokesman Robert Josephson said in a statement. \u201cBut we believe the state fails to show such causation and offers little evidence to support its sweeping legal claims.\u201d A spokesman for Sackler did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The family has faced a backlash in recent years amid a growing public outcry around opioid addiction. In addition, activists have targeted institutions, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, that the family has supported through large contributions. The museum has said it will no longer take money from members of the family linked to the drugmaker. Purdue stopped marketing OxyContin to doctors last year. It settled a lawsuit by the state of Oklahoma in March for $270 million. The company previously said it is pursuing several options, including bankruptcy, which could upend pending litigation by states as well as about 2,000 local and tribal governments across the country. The lawsuits filed Monday allege that Purdue Pharma pushed doctors to prescribe opioids for longer periods of time at higher doses. \u201cOur complaint alleges that their unrelenting sales visits to doctors and deceptive practices led to a marked increase in opioid prescriptions, and a corresponding increase in the number of Mainers suffering from opioid use disorder,\u201d Maine Attorney General Aaron M. Frey said. Maine\u2019s lawsuit names Richard Sackler, Jonathan Sackler, Mortimer D.A. Sackler and Kathe Sackler \u2014 all of whom have served on the board of Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma. States have also cracked down on doctors who overprescribe the drug. Hawaii Attorney General Clare Connors said in a statement Monday that she has filed lawsuits alleging violations of Hawaii\u2019s Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices Law. One complaint alleges Purdue deceptively marketed OxyContin and other opioids. Another says manufacturers and distributors sold more opioids than could be \u201clegitimately prescribed.\u201d Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said opioids are the main driver of drug overdose deaths. Opioids were involved in 47,600 overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2017, according to the agency. In 2017, it says, prescription opioids were involved in 1,172 overdose deaths in California; 100 overdose deaths in Maine; and 58 in the District of Columbia. Maine set a state record for total drug overdose deaths in 2017 with 417. Jordan Basileu joined Becerra in announcing California\u2019s lawsuit.

These measures, which were similar to those currently adopted, included closure of schools and churches, banning of mass gatherings, mandated mask wearing, case isolation, and disinfection/hygiene measures. However, these measures were not implemented at the same time or for the same duration in different cities, nor were they uniformly followed. A recent analysis concluded that in some cities (San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City), where the measures were implemented early, they reduced transmission rates by up to 30\u201350%. Cities that implemented such measures earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality, and had lower peak mortality rates and lower total mortality. The duration that these \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures were kept in place correlated with a reduced total mortality burden.

But scientists don\u2019t understand why, something that could affect care for women in highly polluted areas. One theory is that the particles lodge in mom\u2019s lungs and trigger potentially harmful inflammation. Tuesday, Belgian researchers reported another possibility, that any risk might be more direct. A novel scanning technique spotted a type of particle pollution \u2014 sootlike black carbon \u2014 on placentas donated by 28 new mothers, they reported in Nature Communications. The placenta nourishes a developing fetus and tries to block damaging substances in the mother\u2019s bloodstream. The Hasselt University team found the particles accumulated on the side of the placenta closest to the fetus, near where the umbilical cord emerges. That\u2019s not proof the soot actually crossed the placenta to reach the fetus \u2014 or that it\u2019s responsible for any ill effects, cautioned Dr. Yoel Sadovsky of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a leading placenta expert who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research. And it\u2019s a small study.

The Belgian researchers developed a way to scan placenta samples using ultra-short pulses from a laser that made the black carbon particles flash a bright white light, so they could be measured. The researchers included placentas from 10 mothers who lived in areas with high pollution and 10 others from low areas. The higher the exposure to pollution, the more particles the researchers counted in the placentas. \u201cAs the fetal organs are under full development, this might have some health risks,\u201d said Hasselt environment and public health specialist Tim Nawrot, the study\u2019s senior author.

And some conservatives derisively use the phrase \"\"Romneycare\"\" to slight Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and the changes he approved to Massachusetts\u2019 health care system when he was governor there. How about \"\"Perrycare\"\"? That\u2019s Georgia anti-illegal immigration activist D.A. King\u2019s term for what he contends was an effort by Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry to impose a binational health care plan between his state and Mexico. King even has a website dedicated to highlight Perry\u2019s stance on immigration issues. King is one of the most vocal voices in Georgia\u2019s ongoing debate over illegal immigration. \"\"Granting instate tuition to illegals is only a small part of Perry\u2019s problematic record,\"\" King, president of the Dustin Inman Society, which is opposed to open borders between the U.S. and Mexico, wrote in a recent op-ed to the Marietta Daily Journal. \"\"We noted that Perry had dismissed any consideration of a state immigration enforcement law such as Arizona, Georgia and other states struggled to put in place; had proposed a binational health insurance program with Mexico (Perrycare? ); has expressed his support for legalizing the fugitive illegals who have escaped capture at American borders (it\u2019s not amnesty, it\u2019s a guest worker plan! ); and refused to use the power of his office for any E-Verify legislation in Texas. So what if that state has one of the highest number of illegals in the country?\"\" King made a number of points, but we decided to look at the Perrycare charge because the presidential candidate\u2019s immigration policy has come up in a number of other forums. Some Perry critics describe him as being soft on illegal immigration because of his position on allowing students who are illegal immigrants to pay instate tuition at colleges in Texas. The criticism has hurt Perry\u2019s standing among some Republicans. So we wondered if King had found another case in which Perry could be criticized as soft on illegal immigrants. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas recently examined this issue when another GOP presidential candidate, Rick Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, said Perry supported binational health insurance. King dismissed the PolitiFact Texas ruling, forwarding us an e-mail with a widely circulated speech by Perry on the issue. The Texas governor urged lawmakers there to pass a telemedicine program that allows \"\"individuals living on the Mexican side of the border\"\" to get care from a specialist hundreds of miles away. Telemedicine is using forms of communication such as video conferences to provide health care, according to the American Telemedicine Association. Perry also mentioned a study to look at the feasibility of binational insurance. \"\"This study recognizes that the Mexican and U.S. sides of the border compose one region, and we must address health care problems throughout that region,\"\" Perry said. Those comments were made in August 2001, two weeks before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The study guidelines were outlined in House Bill 2498, passed by the Texas Legislature in 2001. It begins by stating the interest of the state to deliver affordable health care services to citizens \"\"on both sides of the Texas-Mexico border.\"\" The 141-page report, released in 2003, found some legal problems with the idea and logistical challenges, such as there are no laws in Mexico preventing a doctor from performing the duties of a specialist. The report found other problems. Some Texas health care providers were concerned that medical care in Mexico did not meet their standards, the medical equipment in Mexico was not as advanced and some medicine approved in Mexico may not meet Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The report offered several options if Texas wanted to move forward with the idea. Perry and state lawmakers didn\u2019t act. A spokeswoman for Perry noted to PolitiFact Texas that the Legislature took no further action on the topic. Still, some websites have bashed conservative media for not being more critical of Perry. \"\"However, in spite of the Legislature\u2019s failure to act, Perry made clear his willingness to funnel Texas\u2019s assets to Mexico,\"\" an item in the New American website said. It then had excerpts from Perry\u2019s August 2001 speech. The website failed to note that the speech was made two years before the study. By signing the bill that allowed the study, and through his 2001 speech, we can see how some find seeds for Perry\u2019s support of a binational health insurance program with Mexico. But the governor never acted on the study, and he hasn\u2019t appeared to talk much about the subject since 2001. Still, Perry pushed for the study, which implies his interest in the idea.\" Claim: \"D.A.

The image provided no citations to substantiate the information it presented, and the notion that opossums were a possible tool in the epidemiological battle against Lyme disease seemed implausible to some. As it turned out, there is at least some truth to the opossum-as-tick-slayer rumors. On 18 April 2014, the Cary Institute of\u00a0Ecosystem Studies and NewsTimes published an article that focused on the role of opossums in the spread of Lyme disease with respect to their role in the ecosystem: [N]ow ecologists have learned something else about opossums. They\u2019re a sort of magnet when it comes to riding the world of black-legged ticks, which spread Lyme disease. \u201cDon\u2019t hit opossums if they\u2019ve playing dead in the road,\u201d said Richard Ostfeld, of the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. Ostfeld is forest ecologist and an expert on the environmental elements of infectious diseases like Lyme disease. Several years ago, scientists \u2026\u00a0tested six species \u2014 white-footed mice, chipmunks, squirrels, opossums and veerys and catbirds \u2014 by capturing and caging them, and then exposing each test subject to 100 ticks\u00a0\u2026\u00a0[O]f the six, the opossums were remarkably good at getting rid of the ticks \u2014 much more so that any of the others. [A]mong other opossum traits, there is this: They groom themselves fastidiously, like cats. If they find a tick, they lick it off and swallow it\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Extrapolating from their findings, Ostfeld said, the team estimated that in one season, an opossum can kill about 5,000 ticks \u2026 Some ticks end up getting their blood meal from the possum. But more than 90 percent of them ended up being groomed away and swallowed. \u201cThey\u2019re net destroyers of ticks,\u201d Ostfeld said. Ostfeld had previously discouraged disruption of opossum populations for this reason. In July 2012, he said\u00a0in a podcast: Because many ticks try to feed on opossums and few of them survive the experience. Opossums are extraordinarily good groomers it turns out \u2014 we never would have thought that ahead of time \u2014 but they kill the vast majority \u2014 more than 95% percent of the ticks that try to feed on them. So these opossums are walking around the forest floor, hoovering up ticks right and left, killing over 90% of these things, and so they are really protecting our health. Ostfeld was also named as one author of a September\u00a02009 study in\u00a0Proceedings of the Royal Society which examined animal kingdom hosts \u201cas\u00a0ecological traps for the vector of Lyme disease\u201d and asserted that: By subjecting field-caught hosts to parasitism by larval blacklegged ticks, we found that some host species (e.g. opossums, squirrels) that are abundantly parasitized in nature kill 83\u201396% of the ticks that attempt to attach and feed, while other species are more permissive of tick feeding. [T]he vast majority (96.5%) of larval ticks that encounter an opossum and attempt to feed are apparently consumed. Working backwards, [we calculate that] during any given week in the larval activity peak, each opossum must host more than 5500 larval ticks to produce 199 that successfully feed. By this logic, during the larval peak, each mouse encounters approximately 50 larval ticks per week, almost half of which feed to repletion and become nymphs. As far as \u201camazing facts\u201d images go, the opossum/Lyme disease one was very well researched, with numbers that matched up with what ecologists have learned about opossums, deer ticks, and the spread of Lyme disease in recent years (although those studies surmised opossums kill approximately 5,000 ticks per season, not per week).

And Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is making his case for what a supplemental rescue package should include \u2015 guaranteed universal sick leave for all workers. \"\"It has been estimated that only 12% of workers in businesses that are likely to stay open during this crisis are receiving paid sick leave benefits as a result of the second coronavirus relief package,\"\" Sanders argued in an op-ed published April 8 in The Guardian, just hours before he suspended his presidential campaign. Paid sick leave emerged as a sticky issue on Capitol Hill as lawmakers worked to develop a federal relief package. The Families First Coronavirus Emergency Response Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law on March 18, included a guarantee of paid sick leave for some workers, which supporters say is crucial to make sure those who contract the virus are, in fact, able to stay home. The law requires companies that employ fewer than 500 people to provide two weeks of emergency sick leave if an employee develops COVID-19 symptoms, is isolating per the advice of a medical professional or is caring for a family member with a potential case of COVID-19. These employers also must provide paid family leave for people who may need to care for children during coronavirus school closures. But the law exempts bigger companies, a category that includes often-\"\"essential\"\" retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target and supermarket chains. That concession was made to satisfy the White House and congressional Republicans, many of whom have argued that most big companies already offer sick leave packages, and a federal requirement would create unnecessary red tape. Sanders\u2019 argument is that their employees are still vulnerable. Many of the firms exempted by the law remain open during the crisis. Employees who may become ill will not be protected by the federal guarantee of sick leave. Sanders argues that many will fall through the cracks because, while their employers can choose to provide paid time off, those benefits would not fall under the federal directive and could prove less generous than what smaller firms, which must comply with the law, will provide. We contacted Sanders\u2019 congressional office for more information but never heard back. Our research suggests that he has the big picture right, though the precise calculations are tricky. Nuances in the law make it difficult to quantify the number of people who would benefit from the relief package\u2019s paid sick leave requirement. Sanders\u2019 figure appears to come from an analysis conducted by The Washington Post, which suggests that \"\"only 12 percent of workers in businesses that are likely to stay open will be affected.\"\" The analysis used Philadelphia\u2019s shelter-in-place order to determine which private-sector businesses would likely stay open because it offered a clear and publicly available list of workplaces excluded from the order. Other experts validated this approach, noting that this list was a good proxy \u2014 though not a perfect one \u2014 for locations across the country. Then, the Post used data from the Census Bureau\u2019s Statistics of U.S. Businesses (the most recent figures come from 2017) to determine how often those excluded businesses \u2015 such as grocery stores, pharmacies, big-box stores, hardware stores, banks and dry cleaners \u2014 employed enough people to qualify for an exemption from the paid sick leave mandate. It arrived at the rate of 12%. So, first and foremost: Sanders is correct that someone had estimated this percentage. But there\u2019s more to consider. Because of the law\u2019s exemptions for large companies, many of the workers Americans are counting on now may not have protection. \"\"The workers who are on the front lines, on the grocery chains, pharmacies and warehouses, aren\u2019t covered,\"\" said Vicki Shabo, a senior fellow for paid leave policy and strategy at New America, a centrist think tank. \"\"The businesses that continue to operate are very likely to be those that are bigger, that have the cash flows to keep their sales going and that provide essential services.\"\" Per the Post\u2019s analysis, those large companies employ about 7.4 million people who would likely be deemed essential workers. The law provides other exemptions, too. In interpreting the law, the Labor Department has issued regulations saying that a company with fewer than 50 employees can exempt itself from the paid family leave element of the mandate if it burdens business operations. But the new law still requires those small businesses to provide paid medical leave to their employees, a total workforce of about 2.2 million \u2015 a factor, some policy researchers pointed out, the Post did not include in its analysis. If you redo the math counting those workers, the measure\u2019s sick leave promise holds up a bit better \u2014 encompassing about a third of all essential workers. But there\u2019s another catch. The law also does not guarantee paid sick leave to health care providers and emergency responders \u2015 another category of workers typically deemed essential during a pandemic. The Labor Department defines these categories broadly. For instance, health care providers include \"\"workers who are needed to keep hospitals and similar health care facilities well supplied and operational,\"\" not only clinicians. Back-of-the-envelope math suggests that by factoring these various exemptions into the number of likely essential employees guaranteed paid sick leave under the relief package \u2014 dividing the number of essential workers who qualify for guaranteed leave by the full count of essential workers \u2014 the true percentage of people covered hovers closer to the teens. Bottom line: \"\"We need people to understand just how broad the exemptions ended up being,\"\" said Kathleen Romig, a senior analyst at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The numerous carve-outs in the federal mandate \u2014 and the benefits it requires from eligible companies \u2015 together illuminate a larger point. Historically, American sick leave policies haven\u2019t been uniform across industries or organizations. The new law does build on policies some businesses already had in place, Shabo said. For instance, private-sector workers who had sick leave, on average, received seven paid days a year guaranteed. The law bumps that up to 10 days (so, two workweeks for most people) and allows those days to be used to care for someone else. That\u2019s a big change. Even so, the majority of front-line workers are not covered by the federal promise of paid leave if they fall ill during the pandemic. Many get some kind of paid sick leave. Dillon Clair, a public policy associate at the ERISA Industry Committee \u2014 which represents large employers \u2015 said, typically the companies his organization represents offer at least 40 hours of paid sick leave, and that medical leave is accompanied by other benefits (like vacation time) that employees can use if they fall ill after exhausting their sick leave. Meanwhile, companies like Walmart and McDonald\u2019s have rolled out emergency coronavirus programs, offering two weeks of paid time off for people the company deems sufficiently at risk. But the issue of who is deemed at risk gets dicey. Other employers, like Burger King, Dunkin\u2019 and Marriott International, have not instituted any emergency coronavirus policies for their workers, according to New America. And the lack of standardization means that many of the voluntary leave policies have substantial holes, Shabo said. For instance, McDonald\u2019s and Walmart both require employees to get an official quarantine recommendation or a confirmed medical diagnosis of COVID-19 to access the sick leave benefit. Those operational barriers mean people who have developed the virus are less likely to stay home \u2014 especially because coronavirus tests are sometimes difficult to come by. That influences both individual and public health. \"\"They\u2019re more likely to get sick than someone like me, who is self-isolating and working from home. They are literally putting themselves at risk every time they go to work,\"\" Romig said. Without a guarantee of paid leave, she added, individual workers may have to choose between taking a day off to recover from illness and earning money for groceries. And there are the public implications, too. \"\"We really don\u2019t want people who have contracted this virus to be in public. We don\u2019t want them at the grocery store where everyone has to go to get food,\"\" she said. \"\"We want them out of circulation. We want them to have the income they need to sustain that.\"\" In his op-ed, Sanders argued that \"\"it has been estimated that only 12% of workers in businesses that are likely to stay open during this crisis are receiving paid sick leave benefits as a result of the second coronavirus relief package.\"\" This is true. There are different takes on the math, but when you factor in the impact of the law\u2019s exemptions to this requirement, it still appears that the number of essential workers guaranteed paid sick leave because of this law is in the range of 12% to the low teens. More important, Sanders is correct about the big picture: Congress\u2019 paid sick leave guarantee exempts the vast majority of front-line workers during the pandemic, which could make containing the virus harder. Sanders\u2019 claim could use some more context, but it is generally a fair assessment.\" Claim: \u201cIt has been estimated that only 12% of workers in businesses that are likely to stay open during this crisis are receiving paid sick leave benefits as a result of the second coronavirus relief package.", "output": "Bernie Sanders\u2019 estimate that only 12% of essential workers would qualify for paid sick leave under the congressional coronavirus relief package exposes the chokehold that large-employer exemptions have on these benefits.

An important caveat about how the prostate cancer in the study differed from the way in which prostate cancer is most commonly detected today in the US was explained. The story provided a reasonable view of the novelty of the treatment options detailed in the study along with the critically important caveat that the majority of the men in the study had their prostate cancer first detected at a later state than is seen with the current screening practices in the US.

They said the findings suggest that information on working hours \u2014 used alongside other factors like blood pressure, diabetes and smoking habits \u2014 could help doctors work out a patient\u2019s risk of heart disease. However, they also said it was not yet clear whether long working hours themselves contribute to heart disease risk, or whether they act as a \u201cmarker\u201d of other factors that can harm heart health \u2014 like unhealthy eating habits, a lack of exercise or depression. \u201cThis study might make us think twice about the old adage \u2018hard work won\u2019t kill you\u2019,\u201d said Stephen Holgate, chair of the population and systems medicine board at Britain\u2019s Medical Research Council, which part-funded the study.

Billions of dollars are spent every year on medical devices and drugs to treat them. The findings of this study support previous research showing a link between working hours and heart disease.

Consequently, people began fabricating their own out of household materials such as T-shirts, bandannas or scarves, and dish towels or fabric scraps.WMOT\u2019s article referenced an April 3 2020 press conference, and it highlighted recommendations that people wear cloth face masks:A member of Nashville\u2019s Coronavirus Task Force has called on Metro residents to begin wearing masks in public.Meharry Medical College CEO Dr. James Hildreth made the suggestion [on April 3 2020] during Nashville\u2019s daily pandemic press briefing. Dr. Hildreth noted the latest research suggests infected individuals can spread the illness before they even show symptoms.Hildreth stressed that high-quality manufactured masks need to be reserved for front line medical staff. He [recommended] that individuals using [homemade] masks [] wash their hands each time they take the mask off. He also stressed the need to sterilize the mask regularly.An April 3 2020 YouTube video, titled \u201cMayor John Cooper News Conference,\u201d was embedded in the story. Just before the 12:30 mark,\u00a0Meharry President and CEO James E.K. Hildreth Sr., Ph.D., M.D. began speaking.Hildreth first spoke about visible signs of infection with respect to other illnesses, explaining that there were, unfortunately, no visible signs for COVID-19 infection in the general population. He subsequently indicated there was a \u201creason why\u201d citizens of other countries are known to wear masks, and people in those countries have lower rates of COVID-19 transmission.Hildreth stated that if everyone wore masks, the chain of transmission of COVID-19 would decrease across the board. He emphasized it was necessary to reserve commercial PPE like disposable face masks for medical professionals and those on the front line. Then he added that if you are following recommendations, there are a couple of things \u201cyou really need to know,\u201d explaining:There\u2019s a national urgency \u2014 and I\u2019m gonna repeat this \u2014 that the PPE must be reserved for healthcare providers and those on the front line. So many people have resorted to making homemade masks out of bandanas and other kinds of materials \u2026 there are a couple of things you really need to know if you\u2019re doing this:If the mask has served its purpose, there\u2019s every possibility it\u2019s contaminated on the outer surface. What that means is that you should do two things: wash your hands when you take it off, and sterilize it or sanitize it if you\u2019re gonna use it repeatedly.If possible, wash it in soap and water. And if it\u2019s made out of cloth or has no metal staples in it, you can do what I do: stick it in a plastic bag, and microwave it for two or three minutes at the highest setting.Numerous studies show that many, many types of bacteria, fungus, and viruses are killed by microwave radiation. You must make sure that your improvised device is compatible with microwaving, and if it is, stick it in a plastic bag and zap it for two or three minutes at the highest setting.I want to emphasize as you heard earlier that our best strategy still for controlling the virus is to stay at home. My heart breaks every time I hear a new story about a nursing home where the people have gotten infected.The virus is not floating in the air \u2026 someone delivered the virus to that facility, that\u2019s how it started.Someone was a vector.

President Barack Obama said in a year-end interview with CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley that he has been \"\"consistent in saying that where we can solve problems diplomatically, we should do so.\"\" Crowley pressed Obama to respond to the charge that he is too willing to cut deals that produce little in return for the United States. \"\"The gist of it is that you're naive and they're rolling you,\"\" Crowley said, speaking of other world leaders. Obama shot back that on a couple of major fronts, his track record is looking pretty good. Russia now has a crisis on its hands as its economy stalls and the value of the ruble tumbles. On Iran, the president said there have been real gains. \"\"Over the last year and a half, since we began negotiations with them, that's probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade,\"\" Obama said. The fear that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, a charge that Iran denies, has bedeviled the international community for over 15 years. We decided to take a closer look at whether Iran\u2019s program has advanced or not. We found general agreement that in terms of curtailing the means to produce enriched uranium and plutonium, the essential fuels needed for an atomic bomb, negotiations between the United States, Iran and other United Nations countries contributed to real progress. However, some analysts define Iran\u2019s nuclear program more broadly to include suspected efforts to design nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The negotiations don\u2019t address those elements, however, and what Iran is doing or has done in that area is subject to much debate. By way of refresher, in November 2013, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany, and Iran signed an agreement that temporarily stopped or rolled back Iran\u2019s production of potentially weapons grade nuclear material. In November 2014, that agreement was extended by four months, with some additional restrictions on Iran. In exchange, Iran has been able to sell more of its oil and gain access to millions of dollars that had been frozen in overseas bank accounts. The key elements in the agreements Negotiators focused on nuclear fuel. This had three main aspects. Stopping the production and accumulation of uranium enriched to the 20 percent level of the isotope U-235 and converting a large fraction of what it had to a form harder to use in a weapon. Stop the installation of additional centrifuge machines at Iran\u2019s two enrichment facilities. Centrifuges are essential to the enrichment process. Put the brakes on construction of Iran\u2019s heavy water reactor in Arak. If it were operational, this reactor could produce enough plutonium in its spent fuel for one to two nuclear warheads. Importantly, Iran agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. That agency has found that Iran complied with the terms of the original November 2013 agreement. In its November 2014 report, the agency said, \"\"All of the enrichment related activities at Iran\u2019s declared facilities are under Agency safeguards, and all of the nuclear material, installed cascades, and feed and withdrawal stations at those facilities are subject to Agency containment and surveillance.\"\" To be clear, Iran continues to enrich uranium, but only to the level of 5 percent of U-235, a form that falls well short of the needs of weapon makers. Regarding heavy water facilities, the IAEA said that Iran had not stopped all work across all of its heavy water projects, but it had not installed any major components. What the experts say As far as nuclear material is concerned, the experts we reached said the agreements successfully, though perhaps only temporarily, curtailed production. \"\"When President Obama says that for the first time in the past decade Iran has not advanced its nuclear program he is correct,\"\" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a research group that advocates for arms control policies. \"\"Leading up to the interim deal, Iran had nearly amassed enough 20 percent enriched uranium gas, which when further enriched to weapons grade is enough for one bomb.\"\" That material is no longer available, Kimball said. Matthew Bunn, a principal investigator with the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School, also said Obama basically has it right on Iran. \"\"They don\u2019t have any more equipment in place for producing bomb material than they had a year and a half ago,\"\" Bunn said. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based group that aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, offered a more qualified view. Albright called progress on enrichment, centrifuges and the heavy water facilities in Arak, a \"\"great accomplishment.\"\" But Albright noted that, \"\"Iran continues to run almost 10,000 centrifuges, enriching and stockpiling 3.5 percent low enriched uranium.\"\" And Iran\u2019s research on advanced centrifuges, with limits, is ongoing. Albright is also concerned that Iran has so far not allowed the international inspectors the access they need to learn more about any nuclear weapons research Iran had in the past. Matthew Kroenig, a professor of international relations at Georgetown University, also focused on the weapons side of the equation. Kroenig noted that the agreements that limited and rolled back the production of nuclear-grade material were silent on this front. \"\"Iran's missile production continues, and we are uncertain about the nuclear weapons design work, although many experts believe that continues as well,\"\" Kroenig said. But Kroenig also described curtailing the production of nuclear fuel as the \"\"most important\"\" piece of the nonproliferation effort with Iran. Two notes on the time elements mentioned in Obama\u2019s comments. He said this is the first time in a decade that Iran\u2019s nuclear program did not advance. Iran restarted its uranium enrichment program in 2005. That would mean it has been a bit over nine years. Also, the president\u2019s year and a half is a bit of a stretch. The first agreement with Iran was signed barely over a year ago, although the terms were announced earlier. Our ruling Obama said that we have seen \"\"probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade.\"\" The agreement signed in November 2013 has made it harder for Iran to produce weapons-grade nuclear material. International observers report that Iran complied with the terms of the temporary agreement. The amount of enriched uranium is less, and the country\u2019s facilities to produce weapons-grade material has been curtailed. But that does not mean the country has completely stopped all activities that could produce nuclear weapons material in the future. There is also concern about broader aspects of a nuclear weapons program, such as weapons design and missile development.\" Claim: \"Since the United States began negotiations with Iran, \"\"that's probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade.\"", "output": "\"Obama said that we have seen \"\"probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade.\"\" The agreement signed in November 2013 has made it harder for Iran to produce weapons-grade nuclear material.

Indeed, the Service was begun in 1865 for that very purpose, because at the close of the Civil War counterfeiting was so commonplace that an estimated one-third to one-half of the currency then in circulation was fake. Protection of the President was added to the Service\u2019s duties only in response to the  assassination of William McKinley in 1901. These days, the Secret Service\u2019s jurisdiction in the financial crimes arena has been expanded beyond the counterfeiting of U.S. currency into forgery, theft of U.S. Treasury checks and bonds, credit card fraud, telecommunications fraud, computer fraud, and identity fraud. The Secret Service routinely rounds up and jails counterfeiters. It also each year destroys millions of dollars of phony U.S. bills, many long before they are loosed upon the public. Theirs is a quietly efficient organization geared for success, with most of the operations undertaken unfolding with clockwork precision. But this is a tale of a counterfeiting investigation that went against that norm, as it unfolded with anything but clockwork precision. This one case bedeviled the Service for a decade and came to a close only through a series of fortuitous events rather than via dogged and effective police work. In New York City in 1938, very poorly executed counterfeits of dollar bills began appearing in that city\u2019s money supply. Turning up at a rate of no more than forty or fifty a month, these bogus bucks were produced on a small hand-driven printing press from a set of plates that could best be described as abysmally crude. And, as crude as they were, they got worse in subsequent editions as their maker sought to improve his product. One of the overhauls of his plates rendered the spelling of the surname of George Washington (whose portrait appears on the one dollar bill) as \u201cWahsington.\u201d While the Secret Service was at that time routinely rounding up forgers who were doing far more damage to the money supply, they were baffled by this clumsy and unskilled counterfeiter. This hapless mystery man produced dollar bills and only dollar bills, and he never spread more than a handful of them in any given week. And he never seemed to pass his phony bucks more than once at the same place. The Secret Service dubbed him Mr. Eight Eighty, a moniker based on the file number assigned to his case. As the years passed, he came to be known as Old Mr. Eight Eighty, as his file maddeningly remained open while those of all others in its vicinity were closed, with the counterfeiters investigated in those cases being rounded up and jailed. For ten long and very frustrating years, Mr. Eight Eighty remained on the loose, his crudely rendered dollars surfacing in the New York money supply week after week. Attempting to collar him became a quest somewhat akin to the hunt for the Holy Grail for the Secret Service, because what had begun as little more than a lark had over the years escalated into a major manhunt as various agents assigned to the New York field office came to view this crossroader\u2019s continued lack of capture as their personal failure. The pursuit of Mr. Eight Eighty amounted to the most intensive manhunt in the history of counterfeiting up until that time, and it may still stand as a record. Whenever one of Eight Eighty\u2019s dollars surfaced, agents were dispatched to the business where it had been passed to question those working there about the person who might have given it to them. Time was also taken to educate shopkeepers about what to look for in spotting counterfeit currency, in hopes that if Mr. Eight Eighty came back, they\u2019d make especial note of the person passing the bill then call the Secret Service with his description. Maps were dotted with push pins, each one serving to indicate the location of where a bill had appeared. However, such maps were hardly informative because while they did indicate the preponderance of the bills were surfacing in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the bills were also appearing all over the New York area and even well beyond. The region indicated by the cluster of push pins amounted to five square miles and contained a population of approximately a million people. Although the Secret Service hunted high and low, what eventually brought Mr. Eight Eighty to ground wasn\u2019t anything they did, but rather what fate did to the sought-after mystery man. In January 1948, fake dollar bills and a few printing plates were discovered in a garbage-strewn undeveloped lot near Broadway and Ninety-Sixth Street by a group of small boys playing there. The kids thought little of their find, and ten days went by before one of their fathers caught them playing poker among themselves with the funny money and turned it over to the local police precinct. A detective at that station telephoned the Secret Service about the cash and was floored at the reception provoked by what he\u2019d thought was rather mundane news (fake dollar bills, after all). A group of Secret Service agents was there in a trice to examine the bills, confirmed that they were Eight Eighty\u2019s work, then paid a call on the man who\u2019d turned in the false currency. Through him and his young son, they tracked the other children, finally locating the lads who had the plates in their possession. Another group of agents worked on the question of how the plates and the cash had come to be in a deserted lot. From those who lived nearby, they learned that a few weeks earlier there had been a fire on the top floor of a tenement overlooking the lot. They further learned that in an attempt to battle the blaze, the firefighters called to the scene had pitched a great deal of junk from the windows of a top floor apartment into the lot below. The occupant of that flat had not been at home at the time, although his aged mongrel had been, the dog expiring of smoke inhalation. A visit to that apartment settled all questions. In it, agents found the printing press, a pile of Eight Eighty\u2019s famed dollars, and even a drawerful of misprints. They also found Mr. Eight Eighty. The mystery man, the subject of the large and relentless decade-long manhunt, was 73-year-old Emerich Juettner, better known as Edward Mueller, a senior citizen who had given up his job as an apartment superintendent in favor of becoming a junkman after his wife died. The dollars he printed and put into circulation spelled the difference between his being able to support himself and his dog and not being able to make ends meet. Mueller, a likeable and otherwise upstanding man, was charged with counterfeiting and sentenced to a year and a day in jail, but his term was knocked down to four months behind bars. Up until his arrest, neither his son nor his daughter had any idea of what their father had been up to or that he\u2019d been in financial distress. The old man had valued his independence to the point of preferring to engage in a life of crime rather than turn to his children for help, children it appears who would have been all too willing to help their aging father. It took ten years to catch the likeable old codger not because the Secret Service was inept in its pursuit of Mr. Eight Eighty, but rather because three factors inherent to the case worked against it, two having to do with Mueller\u2019s behavior and one with the denomination of the bill he chose to forge. Due to a peculiar turn of ethics, Mueller deliberately did not pass his fake bills at establishments more than once, for the express purpose of limiting the shortfall he caused any one person to no more than a single dollar. Instead of bilking the same places time and again, he spread his bogus bucks far and wide, thereby inadvertently avoiding one of the traps the Secret Service usually has going for it. Typical counterfeiters carelessly repeat their paperhanging at establishments already visited, and proprietors who have previously been burned by accepting fake bills tend to be far more observant afterwards of the currency handed to them and the people from whose hands it comes. The proprietors he left in his wake were rendered suitably alert to any future finagles, but because Eight Eighty didn\u2019t retrace his steps, the quarry they hunted never came back into their range. Also, Mueller was unnaturally frugal in his bilking of others; he never put more of his fake dollars into circulation than he needed to augment his meager earnings and provide himself and his dog with enough to live on. Typical counterfeiters are greedy, dumping large amounts of bogus cash at locations that are close together within a short span of time, thus greatly increasing the chances that someone so swindled will remember what they look like. For example, a fellow seeking to unload a sizeable wad of phonies may well paper every business establishment along a street, all within the space of one afternoon; while any one shopkeeper might not remember what the fellow who spent $500 in counterfeit bills looked like, among a whole street of defrauded businesspeople at least a few will likely produce a very good recollection of the man\u2019s appearance. Mueller was further protected by the denomination of the bill he forged. As amply demonstrated by the following trailer for the 1950 film Mister 880 that was based on this case, people pay precious little attention to the small denomination bills passed to them. As a general rule of thumb, as the value of the bill increases, so does the amount of scrutiny it is subjected to. A dollar bill, therefore, is barely glanced at, if at all:   Mister 880 starred Burt Lancaster as the Secret Service agent in charge of the investigation and Edmund Gwenn, now best remembered as the Santa in Miracle on 34th St., as the counterfeiter.

Kerala received rainfall more than 40 percent greater than normal for the monsoon season, which runs from June to September. Torrential rain in the last 10 days forced officials to release water from dozens of dangerously full dams. The Indian government classified the floods as a \u201ccalamity of severe nature.\u201d Kerala has pitched it as a national disaster, which if accepted by the federal government, is likely to prompt greater commitments of funds for relief and rebuilding efforts. But, without a yardstick for such a declaration, it could be an uphill task, state officials involved with disaster management said. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan called the flood one of the worst in India\u2019s history, displacing more than half a million people. Federal health minister J.P. Nadda said more than 3,500 medical camps were set up across a region roughly the size of Switzerland, where rains since Aug. 8 have swelled rivers and triggered landslides. \u201cThere is a requirement for 90 different medicines and the first installment has reached,\u201d he added. \u201cThe biggest challenges immediately ahead are cleaning of the flood-hit houses, rehabilitation, and prevention of water-borne diseases,\u201d said Mahesh P., a village official in Rayamangalam, about 45 km (28 miles) from Kerala\u2019s financial capital of Kochi. Mahesh oversees four relief camps in his village, which itself escaped flood damage. The camps accommodate people rescued from neighboring areas, which were among the worst affected. The villagers had all pulled together to rescue people and prevent an even bigger disaster, Mahesh said. \u201cThe flood has bonded the people like never before, sharing whatever they had.\u201d  Chlorine powder to disinfect water and other cleaning material are distributed by the camps Mahesh oversees, along with a basic survival kit consisting of a five-day supply of rice and food, toiletries and clothing. Light to moderate rain was expected across Kerala on Monday, promising respite to rescue workers, who have battled rising waters and mudslides to reach tens of thousands of stranded villagers. In one of the worst-hit areas, Chengannur, about 100 km (62 miles) from Kochi, a long queue of women snaked out of a medical camp at the main relief center. As a helicopter hovered overhead, doctors checked elderly men and women lying on wooden benches in an engineering college. \u201cPeople are being screened for respiratory infections,\u201d said a camp doctor, Rajesh Parameshwaran, adding that another infection doctors were targeted was leptospirosis, which can strike people wading through stagnant water. Those returning home from the camps as the waters recede face a difficult clean-up. The insides of many homes will have about 60 cm (24 inches) of mud, officials said. Wells, commonly used in Kerala, are contaminated and few places have electricity to pump water. Kochi\u2019s airport has suspended operations until Sunday. National carrier Air India on Monday began flying turboprop planes from the city\u2019s naval airport to the cities of Bangalore and Coimbatore in neighboring states. To assist passengers, India\u2019s aviation regulator asked domestic airlines to cap maximum fares to and from Kerala and nearby airports. Kerala faces no shortage of food, at least. Traders had stocked up before the Hindu harvest festival of Onam on Saturday, the chief minister said. Kerala has canceled all official celebrations of what is usually its biggest festive event. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Congress party, urged Modi not to discriminate between states controlled by his Bharatiya Janata Party and those such as Kerala, which it does not rule.

In Summer 2020, the so-named \u201cBenadryl Challenge\u201d dared social media users \u2014 generally teenagers \u2014 to overdose on the common allergy medication Benadryl to elicit a hallucinatory effect, record a video of the user\u2019s reaction, and share the video on the social media platform TikTok. In an email to Snopes, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed that the platform had first learned of the challenge in May 2020, at which point its moderators removed the \u201cvery small\u201d amount of content that was found at the time. In the months following, an unknown number of teenagers across the U.S. continued to participate in the digital dare, which is allegedly connected to the death of at least one teen and the hospitalization of three others, prompting warnings from health experts about the potential risk of overdose death. These warnings in turn prompted coverage by mainstream news media, which described teens\u2019 participation in the challenge \u2014 perhaps hyperbolically \u2014 as a \u201ctrend\u201d:  Internet challenges refer to social media prompts that convince users to participate in some form of (oftentimes) dangerous activity, like biting into Tide brand laundry pods (\u201cTide Pod Challenge\u201d) or convincing children to disappear for 72 hours (\u201cMomo Challenge\u201d). Although some have been well-intended, like raising money for charitable causes, and others have been downright silly, many are a masquerade for some forms of cyberbullying. Others are potentially deadly. \u201cThe Benadryl challenge is something that as parents, we need to be aware of these challenges and bring attention to how to properly use these products and make sure they are not accessible to teens. Those conversations need to explain the seriousness and long-lasting consequences of abusing products,\u201d Julie Weber, director of the Missouri Poison Center, told Snopes in an interview. Weber added that her facility saw an uptick in inquiries and online searches regarding Benadryl and diphenhydramine since the challenge was first initiated online. A majority of those who participate in the challenge are thought to be teenagers and young adults. Benadryl is an over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamine drug commonly used to treat allergies. Its key ingredient is diphenhydramine, which can be harmful in large amounts. It is also found in other OTC drugs like Nytol, Sominex, and Tylenol PM. Diphenhydramine works by blocking the histamine response in the body that causes an allergic reaction. In recommended doses, the chemical is not fatal and can cause subtle side effects like drowsiness or dry mouth, but when taken in excess, the drug can cause more serious symptoms like slurred speech and dystonic reaction that creates a stiff, rigid movement in the body. Diphenhydramine can also cause long-term harm or death when misused and abused. That\u2019s because an overdose can affect different parts of the body, according to the Mt. Sinai Health System in New York. Symptoms of overdose can include the inability to urinate, blurred vision, agitation and confusion, as well as hallucinations, seizures, depression, or nervousness, among others. \u201cWe really have a whole, wide range of toxicity,\u201d said Weber, adding that diphenhydramine overdose can also cause a person to have a dry mouth, feel flushed, and see increased body temperature. Diphenhydramine is considered an anticholinergic drug, which means that it works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that sends chemical messages between certain cells in the body. The urinary system is one that can be impacted by diphenhydramine overdose, resulting in urinary retention. This can slow down the intestines so that the body is not able to properly metabolize the drug, leading to further toxicity. At its most extreme, diphenhydramine overdose can disrupt the cardiac system and create an abnormal heart rhythm, which may lead to cardiac arrest. Jamie Favazza with the TikTok communications team told Snopes that the platform continued to remove \u201cextremely small numbers\u201d of new content related to the Benadryl challenge at least through September 2020. In an email, Favazza referred Snopes to the safety controls in the app as well as educational resources located in its safety center, and sent the following statement: The safety and well-being of our users is TikTok\u2019s top priority. As we make clear in our Community Guidelines, we do not allow content that encourages, promotes, or glorifies dangerous challenges that might lead to injury. Though we have not seen this content trend on our platform, we actively remove content that violates our guidelines and block related hashtags to further discourage participation.

Grambling\u2019s agreement would provide early admission for five Grambling sophomores a year to the Edward Via campus at the University of Louisiana at Monroe. Morrison said the 100,000-square-foot (9,300-square meter) building is the first private campus at a public university in Louisiana. He added in an interview Tuesday that the arrangements took a lot of effort to work out. The four-year medical college is hiring and expects to have about 150 students and 100 faculty and staff members when classes begin in July. Morrison said about 20 faculty and staff members are already at work. The building was completed in December but some interior fittings, such as desks and auditorium seats, are being installed, he said. Morrison said the precise opening date hasn\u2019t been set because four campuses must be coordinated. The school\u2019s other campuses are at Auburn University in Alabama, Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, and in South Carolina at a private campus developed with a regional hospital in Spartanburg. The college\u2019s collaborative partnership with Louisiana-Monroe lets medical school students use university resources such as the athletic center and student union, and join athletics and other university activities, Morrison said. The agreement also allows faculty resource sharing and collaboration on education and research. \u201cThe need for exceptional doctors in medically under-served and rural communities like North Louisiana has been on a steady increase for many years. That\u2019s a gap that our students can fill,\u201d said Connie Walton, Grambling\u2019s vice president of academic affairs and provost. \u201cThis agreement is one of the many ways that Grambling State is equipping our students for the nation\u2019s most in-demand career fields,\u201d her statement continued. The early admission program at the osteopathic medicine college will seek to bring medical training to more people from rural areas and diverse backgrounds. Grambling students would apply and interview for the Rocovich Scholars Early Admission Program during the spring of their sophomore year. They would need to have completed all required pre-medical coursework, have at least a 3.5 GPA, and have completed a required number of community service and health care volunteer hours. Morrison said doctors of osteopathy get the same training as other medical students, along with an additional 200 hours in ways to manipulate the body for diagnosis and treatment.

CBS News published an article with the headline \u201cAustralia is Trying to Kill Millions of Stray Cats by Airdropping Poisoned Sausages,\u201d which went on to report that: \u201cThe Australian government wants to kill two million feral cats by next year \u2014 and it wants to do it by airdropping poisonous sausages. There are currently an estimated 2 to 6 million free-roaming cats across the country, and officials say they are threatening native wildlife populations.\u201d\u00a0 On 29 April, the UK Independent published an article with the headline \u201cAustralia Plans to Kill Millions of Feral Cats by Airdropping Sausages Laced With Poison\u201d and on 26 April CNN reported that: \u201cAustralia is at war \u2014 with feral cats. By 2020, the government wants to kill two million free roaming cats, a large chunk of the total feral cat population, which is estimated to be between 2 and 6 million.\u201d We received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of these reports, and in particular about the claim that the primary or exclusive culling method was to be sausages laced with poison. The Australian government has indeed begun an initiative aimed at culling millions of feral cats, which they have described as \u201cone of the greatest threats to Australia\u2019s land-based mammals\u201d and blamed for driving some species into extinction. However, the culling project was first announced in 2015 and was already well underway when reports happened to emerge about it in April 2019. In 2015, Australia\u2019s government launched the Threatened Species Strategy. One of its four key strategies related to feral cats, and the policy outlined a target of culling 2 million such cats by the year 2020 and eradicating feral cats entirely from five of Australia\u2019s islands, among other goals. A government report launching the initiative stated that: \u201cThe scientific evidence is unequivocal that feral cats are one of the greatest threats to Australia\u2019s land-based mammals. They have been a major contributor to the extinction of at least 27 mammals since they were first introduced to Australia. Today, they imperil at least 142 species or more than one third of our threatened mammals, reptiles, frogs and birds. As an extinction driver for so many of our native animals, and a threat that has been relatively neglected in the past, tackling the threat of feral cats is the highest priority of this Action Plan.\u201d By the end of 2016, researchers from RMIT University in Melbourne reported that an estimated 211,000 feral cats had been culled as part of the initiative, but also estimated that 83 percent of those animals had been shot, rather than poisoned. More up-to-date figures were not included in the progress report relating to the period ending in December 2017. In order to achieve the goal of eradicating 2 million feral cats, the first action listed by the government was the \u201cdevelopment and deployment of Curiosity, the new humane feral cat bait.\u201d Australia\u2019s Department of Environment and Energy had spent years developing and testing Curiosity, a new form of sausage bait that, according to the government, is less likely than existing baits to be consumed by other animals: The Curiosity bait for feral cats has been a long-term $5.1 million project to develop a humane, broad-scale toxic bait to control feral cats in conservation areas. The Curiosity bait for feral cats comprises a small meat-based sausage containing a small hard plastic pellet encapsulating a humane toxin. Cats do not have molar teeth and tend to chew their food less so they may swallow portions of the sausage including the pellet. Most Australian native animals nibble and chew their food and are likely to reject the pellet. The pellet is designed to dissolve in the cat\u2019s stomach and deliver a rapid dose of the toxin. The Curiosity bait for feral cats uses a new humane toxin called para-aminopropiophenone, or PAPP, which is considered best-practice world-wide. In brief, the toxicant, PAPP, converts the animal\u2019s red blood cells to a form that cannot carry oxygen, causing death through oxygen starvation to the brain and other vital organs. It is considered to be humane and death takes minutes to hours. The RSPCA [Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] have indicated that PAPP is a clear improvement in humaneness over previous toxins. The mode of action means that secondary poisoning of any other animals from consuming a carcass of a cat that ate a Curiosity bait containing PAPP is much less likely than when using previously employed toxins. (Although the excerpt serves to explain the Australian government\u2019s reasoning in favoring the Curiosity bait, it does contain a factual error: cats do have molar teeth, albeit only two, and they are used for tearing flesh rather than grinding, so the overall claim that cats tend to chew less and swallow more readily than other animals, appears to stand). In government-commissioned field trials of Curiosity, the bait has been distributed on the ground in target areas using both aircraft and ground vehicles. As of April 2019, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority was still assessing the PAPP variant of Curiosity. But the national government appeared confident it would be registered as a pest-control product, because in November 2018 the Department of the Environment and Energy solicited applications for a commercial partner to manufacture and sell the bait. Although no significant developments in relation to the culling program took place in the spring of 2019, interest in the initiative was revived by a 25 April article published by The New York Times, which bore the headline \u201cAustralia is Deadly Serious About Killing Millions of Cats,\u201d and mentioned the existing use of another kind of sausage-borne cat bait containing the active ingredient sodium fluoroacetate, known as \u201c1080.\u201d\u00a0 In February 2019, a group of Australian scientists questioned the basis of the government\u2019s target of culling 2 million feral cats by 2020, in part saying the government had not given a clear metric or scientific rationale for that number; had failed to indicate how or whether the cull would lower the overall population of feral cats (given the rapid rates at which they reproduce) and also increase the populations of endangered species; and because estimates vary widely over how many feral cats actually live in Australia. In a paper published in the journal Conservation Letters, the researchers wrote: Claim: The Australian government's Threatened Species Strategy has as one of its aims the culling of 2 million feral cats by 2020, largely using a sausage bait carrying a lethal toxin.

Similar orders were imposed in New Jersey and Los Angeles last week and face coverings were recommended by Kansas Governor Laura Kelly on Tuesday. California Governor Gavin Newsom has said residents across the nation\u2019s most-populous state would likely be wearing masks in public for some time to come. \u201cWe are going to be getting back to normal; it will be a new normal,\u201d Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said, echoing a phrase used by at least two of his fellow governors in recent days. U.S. Midwest governors were also making plans together to restart their economies, said Jordan Abudayyeh, a spokeswoman for Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. In Michigan, hundreds of cars flooded the streets around the state Capitol in Lansing on Wednesday to protest Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home orders, some of the strictest in the country. Some protesters, in the demonstration organized by conservative and pro-President Donald Trump groups, left their cars to gather on the lawn in front of the Capitol building, many of them not wearing masks or practicing social distancing. As of Wednesday night, 30,885 people in the United States had died of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a Reuters tally. That includes more than 4,000 deaths newly attributed to the disease in New York City after health officials revised their counting methods to include \u201cprobable,\u201d but unconfirmed, cases. Healthcare workers have faced unique health threats while working on the front lines trying to tackle the pandemic. Reuters has identified more than 50 nurses, doctors and medical technicians who have died after being diagnosed with COVID-19 or showing symptoms of it. At least 16 were in New York state. \u201cThe emergency room is like a war zone,\u201d said Raj Aya, whose wife, Madhvi Aya - a physician\u2019s assistant in Brooklyn - was one of the healthcare workers who died in New York. As the outbreak begins to slow, political leaders have bickered over how and when to begin the process of unwinding unprecedented lockdowns that have damaged the economy and largely confined Americans to their homes. Washington state Governor Jay Inslee told an afternoon news conference the largest obstacle to a return to normalcy was a shortage of coronavirus tests. \u201cWe simply haven\u2019t had enough test kits \u2013 they simply do not exist anywhere in the United States right now,\u201d Inslee said, adding the state had purchased about a million swabs, along with vials and test medium but they were just starting to arrive. At his daily White House briefing hours later, Trump boasted that the United States had \u201cthe most expansive testing system anywhere in the world\u201d. But, he said, testing was a problem for the states and not the federal government. \u201cWe can\u2019t be thinking about a Walmart parking lot,\u201d where some testing is being done, but the states and cities should do that, he said. Senate Democrats on Wednesday unveiled a $30 billion plan to vastly increase nationwide testing for the coronavirus. Trump, citing data suggesting the peak of new infections had passed, said he would announce guidelines on Thursday for reopening the economy. The sweeping closures of businesses have left millions of Americans unemployed and store owners struggling to pay rent. Government data released on Wednesday showed that retail sales dropped by 8.7% in March, the biggest decline since tracking began in 1992. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. In addition, output at U.S. factories declined by the most since 1946 as the pandemic fractured supply chains. \u201cThe economy is almost in free fall,\u201d said Sung Won Sohn, a business economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. The United States, with the world\u2019s third-largest population, has now suffered the greatest number of reported fatalities from the coronavirus, ahead of Italy and Spain. Globally, the number of infections has crossed the 2 million mark and over 136,000 people have died, a Reuters tally shows. The pathogen emerged last year in China. Trump said on Wednesday his government was trying to determine whether the coronavirus emanated from a lab in Wuhan, China, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Beijing \u201cneeds to come clean\u201d on what they know. The official death toll released by the Chinese government stands at about 3,600. The source of the virus remains a mystery.

Felonies are considered the most serious criminal offenses. By email, the center\u2019s Marc Levin, director of its Center for Effective Justice, pointed out a January 2012 publication, the \"\"Current Offense Severity Rankings List,\"\" written by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. Henson told us by email that Levin was his source for the count when he initially wrote about the topic in 2007. He also said he would check his claim against the state\u2019s \"\"offense severity\"\" list. Among the state-listed 2,324 felonies, Levin said, some are rather similar or are enhancements of lesser offenses, though the agency \"\"presumably uses a consistent methodology to delineate each separate offense.\"\" He said the tally of oyster-related felonies aired by the foundation \"\"allows for some that the parole board counts as separate offenses which some might consider to be essentially the same offense.\"\" We spotted 16 oyster-connected felonies on the list but pruned three that appeared to be duplicates. Also, as Levin noted, two felonies appeared distinct from others only because they take into consideration repeat offenses. Theft of oysters from a private bed is a felony, as is theft of oysters from a private bed and having two or more previous convictions. Similarly, harvesting oysters in a restricted area is a felony, as is oystering in a restricted area with a previous conviction. Adjusting for the seeming duplications and near-similar felonies knocked the oyster-tied felonies in state law to 11: theft of oysters placed on a private seabed; interfering with an oyster buoy or marker with two previous convictions; oystering in a restricted area as designated by the state; night dredging of oysters; night dredging in a restricted area with a previous conviction; night dredging in a polluted area; not having an oystering license; harvesting oysters for non-commercial purposes without a license; harvesting oysters without a commercial license; selling sport oysters; and violating oyster regulations. By telephone and email, a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department official confirmed the felonies, though Brandi Reeder, the agency\u2019s fisheries law administrator, stressed that a person could be charged with each felony only if they have been convicted of similar misdemeanor violations in the previous five years--sometimes just once, in other cases two or more times, according to the relevant statutes. At our request, Reeder reviewed our identified 11 felonies, later saying by email that she would say there are seven distinct oyster-related offenses or crimes. Broadly, Reeder said, the oyster felonies are in place for a reason, to deter nefarious, potentially risky activities. \"\"An oyster can kill you,\"\" Reeder said, referring to the possible presence of viruses, bacteria and parasites in raw shellfish. \"\"That\u2019s why we take it seriously.\"\" But Texans rarely face oyster felony charges, Reeder said, because nearly all offenders stop after being charged with a misdemeanor. Statewide in the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2012, according to the agency, no such felonies were charged. By telephone, neither Henson nor Levin expressed surprise that no oyster felonies were charged in a recent year or that no one can be charged with such a felony without a prior misdemeanor conviction. With a laugh, Henson said: \"\"I guess the laws worked. They stamped out oyster crime in Texas.\"\" Henson and Levin each said, too, the oyster felonies demonstrate regulatory issues--such as having a license or fishing in restricted waters--being placed inappropriately into criminal statutes. Levin said there is an opportunity to shrink the number of state crimes starting from a Texas House proposal to create a commission that would recommend changes in advance of the 2015 legislative session. Our ruling Henson said there are 11 Texas felonies one can commit with an oyster. He could have said 16, according to the state\u2019s breakdown of felony offenses, though Parks & Wildlife suggests such\u00a0 oyster-related crimes break down to seven distinct offenses.

The researchers drew on previously published data about those variants to create a risk score. A high score didn\u2019t guarantee obesity, nor a low score rule it out. But middle-aged people with scores in the top 10 percent were 25 times as likely to be severely obese as those in the bottom 10 percent, scientists reported in a paper released Thursday by the journal Cell. Those two groups were separated by an average weight difference of about 29 pounds (13 kilograms), researchers said. Analysis showed the genetic propensity to obesity began having an effect on weight around age 3. Up to about age 8, \u201cyou might be able to make a difference in the kids who are born susceptible to obesity,\u201d said one author of the study, Dr. Sekar Kathiresan of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. But it will take further research to see whether intervening would work, Kathiresan said. The results for middle age came from a study of about 288,000 people. Overall, the risk-score research included data from more than 300,000 people at various ages. Severe obesity was defined as a body mass index of 40 or more. Results show genetic inheritance \u201cplays a large role in how heavy one gets,\u201d Kathiresan said. The risk score probably takes about half of a person\u2019s genetic propensity into account, he said, and it shows similar accuracy in predicting ordinary obesity, defined as a BMI of 30 or more. Even if one inherits a propensity for obesity, he said, \u201cyou still have control over your fate. You\u2019re not fated to be obese, but it\u2019s very clear those individuals who\u2019ve inherited susceptibility have to work that much harder to keep the weight off.\u201d Among study participants with the highest scores, he noted, 17 percent were of normal weight. Other analyses show that people who remain lean despite an inherited propensity for obesity tend to eat better and have more physical activity than others with a high score who got fat. \u201cSo you can do something about it,\u201d he said. Ruth Loos, a professor of environmental medicine and public health who did not participate in the study, said the risk score explains more of people\u2019s genetic tendency than previous studies did. But she doubted it would be useful in a doctor\u2019s office. It is \u201cnever going to be a good predictor,\u201d said Loos, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai in New York. She noted that in one test of the score\u2019s predictive power, only 58 of the 371 subjects scoring in the top 10 percent ended up severely obese. And many other severely obese people didn\u2019t score in the top 10 percent, she said. Simply asking about family history of obesity would probably work better, she said. The large role of lifestyle in obesity means a purely gene-based predictor will never be perfect, she said. Kathiresan, a cardiologist, said the risk score is best seen as a risk indicator, like high cholesterol. Most people with high cholesterol don\u2019t get heart attacks, he said, but they do run a higher risk than others. Jason Boardman of the University of Colorado Boulder said genetic variants might affect body size indirectly, through an impact on lifestyles or other social and behavioral traits. Other research suggests the effect of genes on size depends on what kind of social and physical environment a person lives in, including such factors as access to unhealthy foods, he said in an email. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

A web search found that the cost for a month\u2019s supply of the antiviral drug averages just over $1,000. For some patients, that cost may be prohibitive. The cost is an issue of particular concern for developing countries, but it is also true that the price may be much lower for them than in the United States. Many pharmaceutical companies offer their drugs at steeply discounted rates in poorer countries to expand access to life-saving medicines. The release clearly says that 68 percent of women receiving the drug reduced their viral load while only 2 percent of the women in the control group had that success. It also says that the transmission of hepatitis B from mother to newborn dropped from 18 percent to 5 percent, an important clinical outcome. The release includes a discussion of harms. It states that \u201ctenofovir was well tolerated; only one participant treated with tenofovir voluntarily withdrew from the study due to nausea.\u201d\u00a0 It also says that researchers \u201cfound no significant differences between the tenofovir-treated group and the control group with regard to fetal development and infant growth.\u201d\u00a0 Lastly, it calls for longer term, observational studies to confirm the safety of fetal exposure to tenofovir treatment. The release provides a good overview of the randomized, placebo-controlled trial which was undertaken to gauge the efficacy of the drug in both reducing the viral load of hepatitis-B-positive mothers and reducing the rate of transmission of the disease from mother to newborn. It offers solid, numerical evidence of both outcomes. It describes the number of patients (200 pregnant women), defined what constituted a \u201chigh\u201d viral load, and described the approximate length of treatment. It did omit a mention of whether the trial was blinded. This release does not commit disease mongering. The release notes that the research is funded by Gilead Sciences. It should also have mentioned that a corresponding author disclosed speaking and advising fees from Gilead, according to the published study. The release is comparing the use of an antiviral drug given to pregnant women versus the normal procedure of giving both a vaccine and immune globulin. The release doesn\u2019t mention that tenofovir (marketed as Viread), the drug being tested, is already an FDA approved drug so many readers may not know that it\u2019s available. It was approved by the FDA in 2001 for HIV and in 2008 for chronic hepatitis B. The release just barely implies novelty with this statement which suggests a change in treating infected women who are pregnant: \u201cBased on the findings, the investigators recommend that women be tested for HBV viral load at week 28 of pregnancy. Those with a high viral load should receive tenofovir treatment starting at gestational week 30 until delivery to reduce the risk of transmission to their infants.\u201d While the drug itself isn\u2019t novel, positive outcomes from a controlled trial on pregnant women carrying the virus does seem to introduce a new treatment approach.

The answers to both questions are yes, suggesting a new strategy for dealing with the spread of this disease. The release does a good job describing harms, quantifying benefits and describing the study protocol. Because the cost of hepatitis drugs has been widely debated for the past few years, a mention of the drug\u2019s cost would have made the release stronger. Almost 240 million people are infected with hepatitis B virus and about 780,000 die each year from the disease, according to the World Health Organization. The hepatitis B virus infects the liver and while many recover with treatment, it can become a chronic infection.

Asbestos.com reports: Asbestos was once marketed as artificial snow and sprinkled on trees and wreaths and ornaments. Although those products have not been produced for many years, the oldest decorations that were passed down from one generation to the next, may still have small amounts of asbestos. The most famous asbestos snow scene was used during the filming of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d the 1939 classic with Judy Garland that became the most watched film in history. There is a scene in the movie where snow, made from asbestos, falls on Dorothy and her friends, awakening them from a spell cast by the Wicked Witch of the West. The image above depicts a real item sold to consumers in the mid-20th Century. The picture was taken by Tony Rich, an industrial hygienist and amateur photographer who catalogs asbestos images on the photo-sharing platform Flickr using the moniker Asbestos Hunter. Rich, an anti-asbestos activist, originally shot the image in 2009. Rich told us he has the actual box in storage and directed us to another image that shows the product was manufactured by National Tinsel Manufacturing Company. The product was sold in the late 1940s through the 1950s, Rich said. He told us: This brand actually contains amphibole asbestos \u201camosite\u201d, very toxic. Generally speaking, asbestos was used by the tens of millions of tons for nearly over a century and a half in modern history for a wide variety of applications, mostly due to its fire resistance, insulating properties, durability/strength, inertness, could be woven, and was cheap and abundant. Major asbestos manufacturers had large [research and development] programs constantly finding new ways to use asbestos. I believe the most tragic use was in cigarette filters. Rich told us many are surprised to learn that, despite its significant link to cancer, asbestos isn\u2019t banned in the United States. Aside from raising awareness with his camera as \u201cAsbestos Hunter,\u201d he serves on the\u00a0Prevention Advisory Board for the non-profit Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization (ADAO), on whose blog he wrote in 2015: The United States has a very long history of asbestos usage, a tragic history that continues to be written to this day, to the ultimate detriment of its citizens\u2026our loved ones, neighbors, and future generations. During that time, tens of millions of tons of asbestos materials were put into our nation\u2019s buildings and infrastructure, most of which remains in place today. Eventually, laws and regulations were created in an attempt to help protect employees and the public from the toxic legacy left by asbestos. However, despite the volumes of asbestos standards, many still face ongoing problems related to regulatory under-enforcement, poor risk management or by simply failing to identify basic asbestos hazards.

The Truth-O-Meter must address a matter of Southern pride. The honor and reputation of our local groundhog General Beauregard Lee. For three decades, the South\u2019s most esteemed weather prognosticator has lived in the stout and lumpy shadow of Punxsutawney Phil. Phil makes the rounds yearly on the morning talk shows. He\u2019s made appearances with Oprah Winfrey and President Ronald Reagan. His agent even scored him a gig with Bill Murray in the 1993 movie \"\"Groundhog Day.\"\" On Wednesday, PolitiFact Georgia scribes rolled our eyes as the public fawned over Phil once again during Wednesday\u2019s annual Groundhog Day celebration. Phil never saw his shadow, news accounts said. Spring will come early. But should you really trust Phil? Beau\u2019s website says our metro Atlanta celebrity is accurate 94 percent of the time. Phil\u2019s record is a measly 85 percent, it said. That stat has been picked up by various news outlets. Does Beau really deserve second place to that Yankee glory hog? PolitiFact Georgia decided to settle this matter once and for all. For the scoop on Beau\u2019s record, we talked to Art Rilling, CEO and founder of Lilburn\u2019s Yellow River Game Ranch, an attraction featuring people-friendly wildlife northeast of Atlanta. Beau lives there in a plantation-style manse named \"\"Weathering Heights.\"\" For the past 10 years, his staff has calculated the General\u2019s accuracy by noting the number of days local temperatures hit the freezing mark during the six weeks after Feb. 2. Beau, like Phil, predicted an early spring for 2011. Sadly, Phil\u2019s staff has not tracked their groundhog\u2019s predictions so diligently. Their official stance is that their marmot is \"\"incapable of error, so his accuracy rate is 100 percent,\"\" said Mike Johnston, vice president of the Inner Circle of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. Wednesday was Punxsutawney\u2019s 125th groundhog celebration. German settlers brought the tradition, which is based on ancient myths that say hedgehogs, which resemble groundhogs, have the power to predict the weather. Phil\u2019s predictions are not site-specific. If he says that spring will come early, it will, Johnston said. Somewhere. When Phil\u2019s really wrong, Johnston added, it\u2019s the fault of poor Groundhogeese-to-English translation. \"\"People complain and tell us we\u2019re just making it up as we go along,\"\" Johnston said, \"\"but after 125 years of doing it, we don\u2019t need to.\"\" Before we go further, the staff of PolitiFact Georgia feels obliged to mention that meteorologists have officially determined that groundhogs cannot predict the weather. Really. A tongue-in-cheek analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Climatic Data Center concluded groundhogs show \"\"no predictive skill.\"\" (Why do this? To help get kids interested in the science of weather.) Or, more bluntly, \"\"you can\u2019t take any stock in a groundhog predicting the weather,\"\" said Tom Ross, a meteorologist who helped put together the NCDC\u2019s report. It showed that between 1988 and 2010, Phil gave accurate national weather predictions 10 times out of 23 for a rate of 43 percent. True, but that won\u2019t stop us. Our groundhog\u2019s honor is at stake. Since the keepers of Beau and Phil do not keep comparable statistics, we performed an independent analysis using the NCDC study and National Weather Service data for 2001 through 2010. We defined \"\"early spring\"\" as a February with above-average temperatures. We then compared each groundhog\u2019s prediction with temperatures nationally and in his respective hometown. The NWS does not keep average February temperatures for the hamlet of Punxsutawney, Pa., so a kindly meteorologist gave us figures for Putneyville, Pa., a town at a similar elevation about 15 miles away. We found that the General predicted whether spring will start early nationally with 60 percent accuracy. Phil\u2019s rate was 30 percent. Beau predicted Atlanta weather with 50 percent accuracy. Phil got Punxsutawney\u2019s right 40 percent of the time. By our analysis, Beau\u2019s staff overestimated his success, but he\u2019s still 10 to 30 percentage points ahead of Phil.

REUTERS/Anatolii Stepanov Experts say often a professional tweak can go a long way towards firming up your workout. \u201cPeople usually injure themselves on basic exercises, like a squat or a bench press,\u201d said New York-based personal trainer Tiffany Boucher. But Boucher, who works for the national chain of fitness centers Equinox, said form is relatively easy to fix. \u201cSomething is being overused, usually in tandem with some type of muscle imbalance,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s often about getting people to put their shoulders in a certain place, find their center of gravity, engage their abdominals, or tilt their pelvis in a certain direction.\u201d   She said even a small adjustment can be transformative.

Once form is corrected, relief often comes within weeks. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have that continued inflammation,\u201d she said.

The news came as Murphy announced the state\u2019s COVID-19 data is trending in the right direction, though he stopped short of specifying dates when the state might reopen its economy. Newly hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are down 44% since late April; the number of people in the hospital is down 34%; and patients in intensive care and on ventilators are down by an average of 27%, the governor said. \u201cThe road back is paved with five words: Public health creates economic health,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe will move as quickly as we can but as safely as we must.\u201d But while that data is headed in the right direction, Murphy said, New Jersey still leads the nation in positive cases, hospitalizations and deaths per 100,000 people. The state added about 900 new positive cases since Monday, bringing the total to about 141,000. It\u2019s the first time since March 25 that the number of new cases has been below 1,000, Murphy pointed out. There were 198 deaths reported since Monday, bringing the death toll to 9,508. The state\u2019s more than 500 long-term care facilities must also test all their residents for the virus by May 26 under a new health department order, Murphy said. There must also be a follow-up test a week later, and facilities must update their outbreak prevention plans by May 19, he added. Murphy unveiled a six-part plan last month aimed at reopening. Increasing testing and contact tracing were initial components of the plan. Despite calls from some protesters calling  for reopening the state immediately, Murphy\u2019s job approval ratings have been high, according to polls. Murphy repeated his calls for doubling testing to about 20,000 a day by the end of the month. He said expanding testing to first responders was an easy call and argued that expanding to people without symptoms would boost confidence that the state is ready to reopen. \u201c(It gives) everybody out there the confidence that we have the infrastructure in place and that they know we\u2019re on it, that we can spot a community spread or flareup with very short notice. That gives everybody in the state a kick in their step, a confidence to say, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m good on going to the county parks,\u2019\u201d he said. The contact tracing jobs would pay $20 to $25 an hour, and the testing and tracing program would cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars, Murphy said. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems are at higher risk of more severe illness or death. ___ CASINOS A state Senate panel on Tuesday advanced a pair of bills that would have the state Health Department set standards for Atlantic City\u2019s nine casinos to meet before they can reopen. They also would apply to hotels across the state. The Democratic-sponsored bills would have the department set standards on disinfection of rooms, elevators, surfaces, kitchens, gambling floors and other high-traffic areas, as well as training of workers on safe practices. They would also require the continuation of social distancing standards, including a prohibition of gatherings of more than 10 people. The Casino Association of New Jersey has already contracted with the AtlantiCare hospital system to do the same thing for the casinos, including developing recommendations on best operating and cleaning practices.

But she knows others aren\u2019t as fortunate as her, particularly teenagers trying to find themselves while avoiding life\u2019s pitfalls. To help, Fonda started the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential, which has sought to prevent teen pregnancy and improve adolescent health. Fonda founded GCAPP in 1995, when Georgia had one of the highest teen birth and pregnancy rates in the country. Since then, the state saw a 66 percent decrease in the birth rate for teens between the ages of 15 to 19, according to state data. \u201cTeen pregnancy is a factor of poverty and hopelessness,\u201d said Fonda, also known as a political activist. \u201cWe have to give kids hope, so they won\u2019t engage in risky behavior.\u201d Fonda\u2019s foundation will hold a fundraiser to help her cause. An 80th birthday celebration called \u201cEight Decades of Jane\u201d will be held on Saturday with hopes of raising at least $1 million for her nonprofit organization. Singer-songwriters James Taylor and Carole King will perform. Guests expected to attend include CNN founder and ex-husband Ted Turner, Sally Field, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Diane Lane and Troy Garity, who is Fonda\u2019s son. In a recent interview, Fonda, who stars in the Netflix show \u201cGrace and Frankie,\u201d spoke with The Associated Press about the reason she founded GCAPP, how she continues to grow as an actor and the continuous sexual harassment claims in Hollywood. ____ AP: What made you want to focus on teen pregnancy prevention? Fonda: In 1994, I was traveling around Georgia and taken to a maternity ward in Albany, where I saw a 14-year-old girl who was pregnant. There was nothing much I could do for her. ... I knew that there was a 90 percent chance she was sexual abused at her age. I learned she lived in a tarpaper shack with no windows or plumbing. ... I didn\u2019t say anything to her. I just kissed her forehead and left. I cried. AP: What are the misconceptions about teen pregnancy? Fonda: Middle-class kids don\u2019t get pregnant in large numbers, because they see a future compromised if that happens to them. It has nothing to do with race. White kids who live in poor areas of the country have high rates of teen pregnancy, and so does every other race and ethnicity. It\u2019s a factor of poverty, not race. AP: The fundraiser will also recognize your life achievements. How do you continue to grow as an actress? Fonda: Stay curious. Pay attention. Do the work. Get deep. ... You have to do in the work. There aren\u2019t any shortcuts. AP: You\u2019ve been around Hollywood for decades. Why do you think women are stepping forward now and making sexual harassment claims? Fonda: The reason it\u2019s happening now is because of who our president is. He\u2019s a perpetrator (President Donald Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct but has denied the allegations). Many women are horrified that a man like that has been elected into office. He\u2019s triggered a lot of memories in many women who have been victims. I think that it was white famous actresses who stepped forward and kind of opened the floodgates, and now people are realizing how much of an epidemic it is. Now, they\u2019re doing something about it. AP: How do you feel about those who have made claims in the past, but went unheard? Fonda: African-American women ... including Ida B. Wells and Anita Hill, have spoken out about this and demanded gender equality before white women did. We have to be grateful for the women who have come before us. Sexual harassment and assault is even more rife among restaurant, farm and office workers. Women don\u2019t have any power to speak out without losing their jobs. We are now reaching out in solidarity. AP: What do you want to see changed? Fonda: Where there is equality, and more egalitarian power distribution, sexual abuse is reduced. A lot of what we have to do is not just think about sexual abuse, but also have women in power across industries in decision-making power. Then you\u2019ll see the number of sexual harassment cases drop. ___ Online: www.gcapp.org www.gcapp.org/celebratingjane ___ Follow Jonathan Landrum Jr. on Twitter at www.twitter.com/MrLandrum31 .

Around 30 vehicles were stuck on a road near Aberdeen, the local council said, with many other roads closed due to snow drifts.

He said earlier efforts to develop a preventive  treatment were thwarted by the fact that available therapies  caused too much toxicity. Meyskens lead a study in which 375 patients with at least  one previous colorectal polyp, also known as adenomas, were  treated with either a combination of one-time cancer drug DFMO  (difluoromethylornithine) and sulindac, a non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), or placebo. The results, presented at a meeting of the American  Association for Cancer Research in San Diego, were so  encouraging that the study was stopped early. After three years, the overall risk of recurrent adenoma  was 12.3 percent in treated patients, compared with 41.1  percent for patients in the placebo group, or a 70 percent risk  reduction. For patients with more than one previous polyp, 0.7 percent  of treated patients had a recurrence, compared with 13.2  percent of placebo patients \u2014 a 95 percent reduction. The researchers said an analysis of side effects and  toxicity found no difference between the treatment and placebo  groups. There also was no difference in side effects requiring  overnight hospitalization, gastrointestinal side effects or  cardiovascular side effects between the two groups. DFMO is the basis of the drug eflornithine, which was  initially developed as a cancer medication, but is now used to  treat African sleeping sickness. A cream formulation of  eflornithine is marketed as a hair removal agent under the  brand name Vaniqa. Sulindac is sold by Merck & Co Ltd under the brand name  Clinoril as a treatment for arthritis and other inflammatory  conditions. Meyskens said larger trials will be needed to assess the  risk of cardiovascular and other adverse side effects, as well  as to determine whether the incidence of actual colorectal  cancer can be reduced in either patients with low stage prior  colorectal cancers or in very high risk individuals. Chronic use of other NSAIDs, such as Merck\u2019s Vioxx, has  been linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Sulindac is associated with liver toxicity. A separate large study presented at the conference showed  that Pfizer Inc\u2019s Cox-2 inhibitor Celebrex, or celecoxib,  significantly reduced the risk of colon polyps during a trial  that was cut short after too many patients developed  cardiovascular problems. \u201cFor patients without major cardiovascular risk factors,  celecoxib at low doses protects against high-risk lesions that  can lead to colon cancer,\u201d said Dr. Monica Bertagnolli,  associate professor of surgery at the Brigham and Women\u2019s  Hospital, and the lead researcher on the Celebrex study. Meyskens said the combination therapy was likely to  eventually be used in people at high risk of colon cancer,  including those discovered to have advanced adenomas, as well  as patients diagnosed with low-stage colon cancer who have had  their disease cured. \u201cAbout 30 to 35 percent of those patients will develop  another colon cancer,\u201d he said.

But in the past year Juul and Altria have emerged as the biggest supporters of the measure, blanketing Capitol Hill with lobbyists and advertisements touting their support for a national \u201cTobacco 21\u201d law. Tobacco critics contend the companies\u2019 support is calculated to head off even harder-hitting government action: a ban on all flavored tobacco products, including fruit and dessert e-cigarettes. Their stance puts them in the unusual position of criticizing a move they long supported, arguing that the sales restriction isn\u2019t enough. \u201cAltria and Juul clearly support this in order to argue that no other action is necessary,\u201d said Matthew Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cIf you don\u2019t eliminate the flavors that the industry has used to fuel the epidemic, you won\u2019t solve the youth e-cigarette crisis.\u201d The bipartisan legislation, supported by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has been attached to a package of must-pass spending bills that will keep the government running into next year. Juul and Altria \u2014 the vaping company\u2019s biggest investor \u2014 threw their support behind the bill earlier this year amid a backlash against e-cigarettes at the local, state and national levels. E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that typically heat a flavored nicotine solution into an inhalable aerosol. Current federal law prohibits sales of e-cigarettes and all other tobacco products to those under 18. But more than one in four high school students report vaping regularly, according to the latest government figures. And health officials have called the vaping trend an \u201cepidemic.\u201d Until September, Juul argued that its sweet flavors \u2014 including mango, mint and fruit \u2014 could help adult smokers switch from traditional cigarettes to vaping. But the company dropped that message as President Donald Trump announced plans to remove virtually all vaping flavors from the market, due to their appeal to children. The Silicon Valley company has halted sales of all but two of its flavors, menthol and tobacco, and pledged not to oppose Trump\u2019s plan. But momentum for the nationwide ban has faded amid pushback from vaping advocates and some conservative groups. And Trump has voiced support for alternative approaches to keep e-cigarettes away from kids, including raising the purchase age to 21. The age hike is expected to limit the supply of all vaping and tobacco products in high schools by putting them out of reach to 12th graders. Myers\u2019 group and other health advocates say Congress should both raise the age limit and ban all \u201ckid-friendly\u201d flavors. Even with most of Juul\u2019s flavors off the market, smaller companies continue to market an array of flavored products, including \u201cgrape slushie,\u201d \u201cstrawberry cotton candy\u201d and \u201csea salt blueberry.\u201d And the industry\u2019s main trade association is suing to keep e-cigarettes, including flavors, widely available. Altria, the nation\u2019s largest tobacco company, said it supports a \u201cclean\u201d Tobacco 21 bill \u2014 focused exclusively on raising the age limit \u2014 because it is the \u201cquickest and most effective\u201d way to address the recent surge in teen vaping. For decades previously, Altria and other tobacco companies aggressively defended the 18-year-old minimum purchase age. Juul has similarly supported legislation that raises the purchase age without touching flavors. And while the companies say they lobby separately, both quickly backed the Tobacco 21 bill introduced in May by McConnell and Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine. The companies\u2019 support sapped attention away from other proposals that would have gone much further. For example, a bill from New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallonewould have raised the purchase age to 21 and banned flavors from all vaping and tobacco products \u2014 including menthol cigarettes \u2014 and prohibited online sales. The bill was endorsed by a dozen health groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association. \u201cFlavors attract kids and kids are the tobacco industry \u2014 including the e-cigarette industry\u2019s \u2014 future,\u201d said Erika Sward, a vice president with the American Lung Association. But efforts to advance flavor restrictions in the Senate fell flat, including a bill sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill, that was withdrawn from committee consideration at the last minute. \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t certain that I had the votes at the time,\u201d Murkowski told The Associated Press. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to lose.\u201d The logic for hiking the purchase age for cigarettes is clear: most underage teens who use tobacco get it from older friends. An estimated 90 percent of smokers start before age 18. Delaying access to cigarettes is expected to produce major downstream health benefits, with one government-funded report estimating nearly 250,000 fewer deaths due to tobacco over several decades. Still, anti-tobacco experts say age restrictions are only effective when they are vigorously enforced, and tobacco sales can fall through the cracks amid a patchwork of local, state and federal law enforcement. They point to underage drinking as an example of the limited impact of age-based restrictions. State laws banning tobacco sales to those under 18 evolved over several decades and were reinforced by a federal law in 2009. The same law banned all flavors from traditional cigarettes except menthol, which received a special exception at the behest of tobacco lobbyists. More than a third of U.S. states \u2014 including California, Illinois, New York and Texas \u2014 and the District of Columbia have already raised their minimum purchase age to 21. Anti-smoking groups have tracked the trend with measured support, noting the role of Juul and Altria lobbyists behind many of the efforts. In several cases, anti-tobacco advocates have flagged provisions that they say undercut the state laws\u2019 effectiveness. These provisions, known as pre-emption, can stop city and county officials from imposing stricter tobacco sales limits that go beyond the state law. Juul and Altria said they supported all state Tobacco 21 laws passed this year, regardless of whether they included such provisions. In Washington, D.C., Juul\u2019s lobbying budget ballooned to more than $3.1 million in the first 9 months of 2019 year, nearly twice the company\u2019s spending for all of 2018. Altria has spent $7.4 million in 2019, roughly even with its lobbying budget for 2018. The company\u2019s political action committee and employees have given $37,000 to McConnell\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign, according to federal records compiled by the non-profit Center for Responsive Politics. Among those lobbying on Juul\u2019s behalf are Jim Esquea, who worked during the Obama administration at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Ted McCann, who was a top policy aide to former House Speaker Paul Ryan. Juul also has directly hired a number of former federal and state government officials as full-time staffers, including Tevi Troy, a former HHS deputy secretary under George W. Bush, and Martha Coakley, the former attorney general of Massachusetts. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a Trump fan or a traditional Republican conservative or a liberal Democrat, they\u2019ve got someone you know,\u201d Myers said.

Bob McDonnell\u2019s stance on funding for sex education programs. Among the claims: \"\"$400,000 -- approximate cost to Virginians to fund ineffective abstinence-only-until-marriage programs. $2.5 million -- federal funding for comprehensive sex education programs Virginia lost due to McDonnell\u2019s political agenda.\"\" Are NARAL\u2019s numbers and claims correct? We asked Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, for sources of the information. Let\u2019s start with the statement that abstinence-only education costs the state $400,000. Keene said that\u2019s a reference to match money Virginia provided to receive a federal grant for abstinence-only sex education. The payment allows Virginia to participate in the Title V Abstinence Education Grant Program administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The program promotes abstinence until marriage to prevent teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases. Last September, HHS announced Virginia would receive an $889,973 grant for abstinence education for fiscal 2010. States have until Sept. 30, 2012, to spend the money. The federal cash pays for 57 percent of the cost of abstinence programs approved by HHS. Participating states are required to provide the remaining 43 percent of cost. The match money can come from a variety of sources including from state coffers, foundation dollars and in-kind donations. Virginia was required to come up with about $670,000 to match the grant. Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, said in an e-mail that the state is paying $382,688 towards the match. The rest is coming from in-kind contributions and community organizations awarded contracts to implement the sexual abstinence programs. So NARAL is near the bull\u2019s-eye in claiming Virginia is paying an \"\"approximate\"\" $400,000 for abstinence-until marriage programs. Caldwell noted that the state received federal abstinence education funding under previous governors going back to the 1990s. But in 2007, Democratic Governor Tim Kaine cut the state\u2019s funding for abstinence-only education. McDonnell reversed that decision last year. At the same time, McDonnell chose not to seek money from another federal grant program that \u00a0teaches students about contraception in addition to abstinence -- the Personal Responsibility Education Program. Unlike the federal abstinence-only money, the comprehensive sex education grant requires no match. McDonnell\u2019s refusal to participate drew criticism from NARAL and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. That brings us to the second part of NARAL\u2019s claim, that Virginia lost $2.5 million in federal money for comprehensive sex education under McDonnell. As a source, NARAL cited an HHS 49-page announcement of the PREP grant, which was created under the 2010 health care reform law. The HHS synopsis shows Virginia was estimated to receive a total of $2,593,487 during fiscal years 2010 and 2011. That\u2019s close to NARAL\u2019s number. But NARAL is greatly understating its case. States that didn\u2019t apply for the grant in fiscal 2010 and 2011 are not eligible to seek funding for the 2012-2014 fiscal years. So Virginia potentially missed out on much more than $2.6 million. Estimates for 2012-2014 allotments are not available, said Kenneth Wolfe, an HHS spokesman. Let\u2019s recap:  A video by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia said that abstinence-only programs pursued under McDonnell have cost the state about $400,000. Meanwhile, the group says the state missed out on about $2.5 million in federal funding for comprehensive sex education. It\u2019s  the state spent about $400,000 for a federal abstinence-only grant. And it\u2019s  that the McDonnell administration did not apply for a comprehensive sex education grant that would have sent almost $2.6 million to Virginia during fiscal year 2010 and 2011. Because Virginia is now ineligible to apply for the comprehensive grant through 2014, the state will wind up declining a much greater amount of money than NARAL claimed. We won\u2019t penalize NARAL for understating its case. Its statement is .\" Claim: \"Virginia spends $400,000 on abstinence programs while losing $2.5 million in federal funds due to Gov.

He was referring to his wife, Rosalynn, and their support for the Vermont senator, an independent who identifies as a democratic socialist, over establishment favorite Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. At another point, he pointed to California\u2019s environmental policies \u2014 limits on carbon emissions, stiffer fuel-efficiency standards \u2014 as the model for combating climate change. Still, Carter stressed, Democrats nationally must \u201cappeal to independents\u201d who are souring on the current administration. Trump\u2019s job approval rating, according to Gallup, has dipped to 40 percent, mostly because of declining support among independents. Carter alluded to arguments from self-identified progressives that Democrats will sacrifice votes on the left if they don\u2019t embrace the liberal base: \u201cI don\u2019t think any Democrat is going to vote against a Democratic nominee,\u201d and he insisted that he\u2019s not asking the left to sacrifice its goals, only to see that winning elections is necessary to accomplish any of them. There is some historical irony in Carter\u2019s analysis. He came to the White House in 1976 from the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, and he clashed with party liberals, drawing a spirited primary challenge in 1980 from Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy. Carter prevailed, but he was wounded, abandoned by Kennedy\u2019s most liberal supporters and unable to win over independents who helped deliver a landslide for Republican Ronald Reagan. Carter\u2019s latest handicapping comes near the conclusion of a midterm primary season that has seen Democratic primary voters move the party to the left. In some states and districts, that means nominating full-throated advocates of single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and abolishing or at least overhauling the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. In other races, it means nominees who back more cautious moves to the left, such as background checks before certain gun purchases, a \u201cpublic option\u201d health insurance plan to compete alongside private insurance policies, step raises for the minimum wage and an immigration overhaul that offers legal status to some immigrants in the country illegally. Carter did not delve into those distinctions, instead offering a sweeping condemnation of his latest successor to remind Democrats of the stakes. He denounced the administration\u2019s latest environmental policy proposal to make it easier for energy companies to release methane gas that contributes to climate change. He singled out Trump\u2019s policy of separating immigrant families at the border, including those seeking asylum. \u201cAmerica is inherently committed to human rights, and I think in the future we will let that prevail,\u201d Carter said, \u201cbut for the next two years, I can\u2019t predict the imprisoned children are going to be any better off \u2014 unfortunately.\u201d Carter has previously criticized Trump for his repeated falsehoods, and he\u2019s chided Trump for his hardline support for Israel over Palestinians. Yet Carter has found common ground with Trump on other foreign policy fronts, and did so again Tuesday. While avoiding any mention of the special counsel\u2019s investigation into whether Trump\u2019s presidential campaign coordinated with Russia in the 2016 U.S. election, Carter said he has engaged for years with Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning the ongoing Syrian civil war. \u201cI have his email address,\u201d Carter said, adding that he and Putin share the same Russian river as their favorite spot for salmon fishing. That friendship, Carter said, means when Russia and other nations hold multilateral talks about the Syrian conflict, \u201cQuite often they invite the Carter Center. ... They do not invite the U.S. government.\u201d Carter also praised Trump for meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Carter repeated his frustrations with the last Democratic president, Barack Obama, for not engaging more directly with the insular Asian nation. Carter said he\u2019s not sure Trump has made real progress yet with North Korea, but he endorsed calls for the U.S. to formally declare an end to the Korean War and normalize relations with Pyongyang. \u201cLet them be part of the community of nations,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be enough in itself to bring an end to the nuclear program in North Korea.\u201d ___ Follow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP Claim: Jimmy Carter cautions Democrats not to scare off moderates.", "output": "Former President Jimmy Carter sees little hope for the U.S. to change its human rights and environmental policies as long as Donald Trump is in the White House, but he has a warning for his fellow Democrats looking to oust the current administration: Don\u2019t go too far to the left.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

The need for more infrastructure also was identified as a possible way to reduce venting and flaring \u2014 although the report stated flaring, or the burning off of excess natural gas during extraction, was a necessary part of the process. The state will host public meetings in the coming months to discuss the findings with community members across the state. Stronger regulations for methane emissions will be critical as the oil boom in New Mexico continues, said Hillary Hull of the Environmental Defense Fund, another member of the advisory panel. She said the state\u2019s process in developing the analysis was been inclusive, representing countless hours of research and input from a diverse cross-section of stakeholders. \u201cNext year will be the critical time for moving forward on enforceable, nationally-leading methane rules that protect our air, address the climate crisis and improve education funding for New Mexico families and future generations,\u201d she said. Earlier this month, trade groups representing the oil and gas industries in New Mexico and Texas release an analysis that showed a decline in methane emissions in both states as production tripled. The research also showed that the amount of methane burned off or emitted per barrel of oil equivalent was reduced by 64 percent in the Permian Basin during the past seven years. Meanwhile, the report cited a 210% increase in oil production in the Permian since 2011. Ryan Flynn, executive director at the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association said Permian producers are leading the industry when it comes to environmental practices and emissions reductions. \u201cAs energy markets across the globe look to America for their energy needs, we are creating the solutions of the future to deliver cleaner, more reliable energy to people and communities in every corner of the planet,\u201d he said in a statement.

This study does not aim to quantify the benefits of treatment, rather to show whether there is any difference in risk of death associated with taking hormone therapy for 5 to 7 years. The original Women\u2019s Health Initiative trial was designed to examine whether there was any benefit of hormone therapy for prevention or heart disease, which had been suggested by earlier studies. The story does a good job of outlining the complicated history of findings from hormone replacement studies, and the harms and risks, and uses numbers to explain the risks. There is great nuance in the findings, which can be interpreted differently for women of different ages seeking HRT. Women bring different life risks of cardiovascular disease or breast cancer with them into any discussion of HRT. The conclusion quoted in the story may be less-than-reassuring, but is here: \u201cHormone therapy has been in and out of favor \u2013 first it was good for all menopausal women, then it was dangerous for all women,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cThe take-home message now is that for the right patient, hormone therapy is safe and effective.\u201d The story does a good job of describing how the study was done\u00a0and establishing the high-quality of evidence from a large randomized trial. There was no disease mongering. The story included an independent source and there does not appear any conflicts of interest that should have been disclosed. The story is about alternatives, on its face, about the alternative of taking or not taking hormone replacement therapy. We wish there had been a sentence or two more on how\u00a0other methods are available to women to ease symptoms. These therapies are widely available and that\u2019s implied in the story.

The findings show that women who took combined hormone therapy (estrogen and progesterone) for approximately 5 years, or who took estrogen alone for 7 years, had the same risk of death 18 years later as those who had taken no hormone therapy. Thus the small increases in risk of developing breast cancer and (mainly in older women) heart disease with combined hormone therapy did not translate into an increased risk of death. The story does a good job describing the findings, and how the study was designed. The inclusion of an independent source also strengthened the reporting. A discussion of the costs would have made it even stronger. The subject of women and menopause and hormone therapy has been debated for decades. This new study, which shows no significant difference in death rates for women who did or did not take hormone replacement, is important. But the take-home message, which is also important, is that each woman has to talk about risk vs. benefit with her own health-care practitioner in order to understand the nuances.

Alzheimer\u2019s is a fatal brain-wasting disease that affects 44 million people worldwide, with the number set to triple by 2050, campaign group Alzheimer\u2019s Disease International says. Although there is still no treatment that can effectively modify the disease or slow its progression, a number of companies - including Roche, Eli Lilly, Merck & Co and Johnson & Johnson - are pursuing a variety of approaches to get to the root cause. It is proving an uphill battle. Over the past 15 years more than 100 experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drugs have failed in tests. Industry analysts believe that the prize for a truly effective drug could be a market worth $10 billion in annual sales. Roche\u2019s new technology works by hijacking a natural transport mechanism called receptor-mediated transcytosis, which is normally used by the body to transfer proteins inside the brain. \u201cWe have basically designed this module, called shuttle, that binds to this transport mechanism and shuttles a cargo inside the brain,\u201d Luca Santarelli, Roche\u2019s head of neuroscience, ophthalmology and rare diseases, said in a telephone interview. Results of a study published in the journal Neuron on Wednesday found the technology helped to increase the concentration of antibodies in the brains of mice, reducing the amount of amyloid plaque, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s. Roche tested a precursor of its experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drug gantenerumab in the pre-clinical trials. The amount of antibody that penetrated the brain increased more than fiftyfold. Santarelli said that the brain shuttle technology is not limited to the memory-robbing disease and could be applied to other neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington\u2019s disease. The drugmaker is in the process of evaluating which therapeutic targets and diseases to prioritize. Roche has struck a deal with U.S. biotech firm Isis to develop treatments for Huntington\u2019s and aims to engineer a shuttle to increase penetration of drugs into the brain. It is also working on a program with Irish company Prothena in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Santarelli said that all projects are still in pre-clinical testing and the company needs to undertake a few more steps before it can begin clinical trials. Turning to Roche\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s pipeline, he said that its Phase III trial of gantenerumab in patients who have yet to develop dementia is on track, with results expected in the first half of 2016. Roche has two other drugs in clinical testing, including crenezumab, which has been chosen for a U.S. government-backed trial in a group of Colombians with a genetic mutation that leads to Alzheimer\u2019s in their forties.

New protocols for victims or suspected victims of COVID-19 call for the use of coffins. As of Wednesday, Indonesia had identified nearly 3,000 cases and recorded 240 deaths. But public health experts and epidemiologists point to the relatively low frequency of testing and high death rate as indications the true infection rate is likely substantially higher. Exclusive data obtained by Reuters revealed there were nearly 4,400 burials in Jakarta this March, a 40% jump from any month in the past two years, and a sign deaths from the virus could be higher than officially reported. Data from the Jakarta governor\u2019s office further showed more than 438 people had been buried according to COVID-19 protocols between March 2 and April 6, despite the national death toll standing at just under half that figure. In some cases, victims suspected of contracting the disease have died before test results were available, seeing them buried according to COVID-19 protocols as a precaution. Whatever the true figures are, those working in the funeral industry in Jakarta, home to more than 10 million people and the epicentre of the outbreak in the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation, are preparing for a mounting toll. Sahroni\u2019s company has reopened an old coffin-making warehouse in West Java, Indonesia\u2019s most populous province, started a new line of cheaper coffins and donated 1,000 coffins to hospitals.

When he had this house built in Jackson, Mississippi, he had the window you see elevated to make it less likely his children would be shot.He had the house built without a front door for security reasons. The main entrance was at the side of the house, at the end of a car port.His house was the only one on the street that had small stones and gravel on a flat roof. That way, it would not catch fire is someone tossed a lit torch on the roof.He had his children\u2019s mattresses placed directly on the floor to make them less visible targets.He told his wife and children to sit on the floor while watching TV.In 1963, he was the NAACP\u2019s first Mississippi field director. Three times that year, someone had fired into his home.As a boy, he had witnessed the separate lynchings of a black man and a 10-year-old black boy \u2014 who had made the mistake of going to the whites-only county fair.On June 10, he was not home when someone tried to enter through the rear door of his home. His wife moved the refrigerator to block entry. They left the refrigerator there.That week, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy spoke to the nation about civil rights, justice and a more perfect union. The President said it was coming and he asked the nation to give him time that, ultimately, he did not have.Medgar Evers gave a speech in Jackson the night of June 11,1963. He returned home \u2014 to this home \u2014 lugging many T-shirts that he planned to give out at a rally the next day. They said: \u201cSay No to Jim Crow.\u201dHe was excited about the President\u2019s speech.He parked behind his wife\u2019s car in the driveway and was almost in the car port when an assassin across the street shot him with a high-powered rifle.No ambulance came.A neighbor took him to the whites-only hospital. Doctors were unsure if they should treat him. They were out of \u201cNegro blood\u201d and feared they could lose their medical licenses if they used white blood to try to save a black man.Then, a white doctor stepped in and said none of that mattered and worked valiantly to try to save the life of Medgar Evers, who had served this country at the invasion of Normandy.He died about 40 minutes after being shot.The bullet entered his back, came out his chest, went through a window, went through an interior wall leading to the kitchen and left a dent in the refrigerator.I touched that dent today. Then, I went into the bedroom and saw the mattresses on the floor with the Teddy Bears on them.I have never before felt history the way I felt it today.Medgar Evers was the first state field secretary of the\u00a0National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Mississippi. As the post describes, Evers was assassinated in the driveway of his Jackson, Mississippi home on June 12 1963 at the age of 37; nine days later, Klansman and white supremacist Byron De La Beckwith was arrested \u2014 but all-white juries failed to reach a verdict. In 1994, Beckwith was finally convicted of\u00a0first-degree murder.In May 2018, the House of Representatives passed a bill to establish Medgar Evers\u2019 Jackson, Mississippi home as a national monument with bipartisan support. To that point, the site was managed by\u00a0Tougaloo College, and its designation as a national monument allocated additional funding to maintain the home.In January 2019, Mississippi lawmakers issued a press release about the designation of Medgar and Myrlie Evers\u2019 home in Jackson, Mississippi as a national monument:Mississippi\u2019s two senators have reintroduced legislation to designate Medgar and Myrlie Evers\u2019 Jackson home as a national monument within the National Park System.\u201cThe Medgar and Myrlie Evers home is of great historic significance to the civil rights movement as well as our American history and deserves to be recognized as a national monument,\u201d U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker said in a news release [in January 2019]. \u201cThat is why I have continued to work with the members of our Mississippi congressional delegation to bring additional resources to the site. These efforts will help ensure future generations can learn about the life and legacy of the Evers family.\u201dSen. Cindy Hyde-Smith added, that \u201cThe preservation of the Medgar and Myrlie Evers home as a national monument will help future generations understand this family\u2019s important role in the pursuit of equality and justice as part of the civil rights movement.\u201dA month later, the site was one of four newly-designated national monuments included in a \u201cmassive lands bill\u201d passed by Congress. United States President Donald Trump signed the bill establishing the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home National Monument in Jackson in March 2019. NBC News reported plans for the site, enabling visitors to tour it more formally.That article also noted that the home was vacant for three decades and restored with reproduction furnishings after the family donated it to Tougaloo College in 1993:The federal government will take over the modest ranch-style home from Tougaloo College, which supports the change, bringing money for preservation. The Evers family donated the home to historically black Tougaloo in 1993, and it is open by appointment for tours. The three-bedroom home stood vacant for years after the family moved away in the 1960s, and it was restored in the mid-1990s. It is now filled with midcentury furniture, and one of the bedrooms has a display about the family\u2019s history. A bullet hole is visible in a kitchen wall.The National Park Service named the home a national historic landmark in 2016.Ben West of the National Park Service told Mississippi Public Broadcasting on [in March 2019] that the park service was waiting on the president\u2019s signature to begin planning the project, including parking, access and tour sizes, restrooms and other visitor services.The National Parks Service maintains a page about the site, but no information about its interior is included. In March 2019,\u00a0Smithsonian Magazine described pending updates to the new monument:After Evers was killed and his family moved away, the three-bedroom stood empty for many years. In 1993, the Evers family gifted the property to the historically black Tougaloo College, and tours became available by appointment. In 2016, the National Park Service named the Medgar Evers House Museum a national historic landmark. With the signing of the new bill, the federal government will take over the site, and experts who work there hope the change will enable the museum to make some important upgrades. Minnie White Watson, curator of the museum, tells WBUR\u2019s Peter O\u2019Dowd that the National Park Service can afford \u201cto do things that possibly we could never afford to do,\u201d such as installing a parking lot and restrooms.Multiple tourism-related sites showed\u00a0the interior of the house (and the boys\u2019 bedroom) in a way that indicaed that the images were accurately identified. TripAdvisor reviewers made mention of the low height of the childrens\u2019 beds in relation to the window, as did people on other tours. Some said the beds lacked frames, while others claimed that the windows were specifically raised for the same reason:\u201cApparently, when Medgar built the house, he had the foresight to have the windows raised 2 or so extra inches so they could lay on the floor. That would allow them less likely to be seen through the window for a shooter.\u201d\u201cSo sad his kids had to sleep on mattresses on the floor rather than in beds so bullets would harm them through windows.\u201d\u201cAmazing to hear and read about all that Medgar Evers endured, the sacrifices he and his family made, like: no front door, for safety reasons, beds were lower than the height of the window sills, for protection from gunshots, the safety drills for the children in case someone starts shooting. Very sobering.\u201dLike TripAdvisor reviewers, it seemed the Facebook post\u2019s author paraphrased the descriptions provided by tour guides. However, those descriptions were not entirely consistent with one another. A Wikipedia page for the site (lacking sources) stated that the Evers family chose the home, but it didn\u2019t go so far as to say they were able to modify its structure. In December 2017, Medgar Evers house museum curator Minnie White Watson discussed the childrens\u2019 beds in a profile of the site:\u201cThe first time the house was shot into, Medgar said put the kids beds on the floor,\u201d said Minnie White Watson, Medgar Evers Home museum curatorA database of historical site markers explained the Evers\u2019 family\u2019s efforts to remain safe in the face of increasing violence, as threats to Evers and his family increased greatly in the weeks leading up to his assassination:With success in [civil rights] efforts, however, came increased tension and apprehension. The children were taught precautions, such as dropping to the floor and crawling to safety in the bathtub when they heard loud noises. They avoided sitting in the living room near the large window. One evening a firebomb exploded in the carport, and Myrlie rushed outside to put out the flames with the garden hose. The police dismissed the incident as a prank. A few weeks later, Medgar Evers was murdered in the driveway, shot with a high-powered rifle by an assassin hiding across the street.The claims about Medgar Evers\u2019 home made in the Facebook post were accurate \u2014 by all accounts, the Evers family avoided sitting and sleeping near windows because gunshots had been fired and and through their home. An image circulating alongside the post showed the reconstructed bedroom of the Evers\u2019 children, with beds placed low to the floor and away from windows. Evers and his family lived in the house from 1956 to 1963; the increasing safety precautions taken by the family likely occurred in the last year or two of their time in the house.We contacted Tougaloo archivists for additional information, but have not yet received a response.

The answer will help explain whether these cells play a key role in the vaping-related outbreak that has killed seven people and sickened 530 so far. It may also reveal whether some of these cases have been occurring all along, undetected. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to partner with any lab that can assist in the identification of what those lipids (fats) are,\u201d Meaney-Delman said in a telephone interview. A group of researchers who have been studying the long-term effects of vaping told Reuters they have taken up the challenge. They have begun to re-examine lung cell samples they have collected in recent years for evidence of these oil-filled immune cells in people who vaped but didn\u2019t get sick. One possibility: The deposits are residue from inhaling vaping oils, such as those containing the marijuana ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or vitamin E acetate. Both are considered possible contributors to the current illnesses. Some researchers suspect the oils are formed inside the lungs as part of the body\u2019s natural response to chemicals found in many commercial vaping devices. One theory is that vaping these chemicals may impair the immune system, and make people who vape more vulnerable to respiratory distress, they say. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation earlier this month has fueled the latter theory. It found that mice exposed to aerosols of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin - common solvents used in conventional nicotine vaping devices - developed these same fat-clogged immune cells even though they were never exposed to vaping oils. These mice also had impaired immune systems compared to mice exposed to room air. The study set off alarm bells for Thomas Eissenberg, co-director of the Center for Tobacco Products at Virginia Commonwealth University. For years, doctors have reported isolated cases of pneumonia-like illnesses in people who vaped. In many cases, patients also had these fat-filled immune cells - called lipid-laden macrophages. Now, these same abnormalities have been found in mice, and in at least some of the people who have fallen ill recently. \u201cFor me, the implication is there may be some underlying level of disease, like what we\u2019re seeing in this cluster, that\u2019s been going on all along,\u201d Eissenberg said in a phone interview. Early last week, Eissenberg joined some 25 vaping experts on a hastily arranged conference call. At least three researchers who have already collected lung cell samples from otherwise healthy vapers told Reuters they would see whether these people also had fat-laden pockets within their immune cells. Other researchers, like Eissenberg, are seeking funding to collect new samples of their own. They want to help determine whether these abnormalities have been present for years, and whether they have made vapers generally more vulnerable to severe disease, possibly triggered by some new vaping substance. The group\u2019s members say they have been in regular contact with officials at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health on how they can best help with the multistate investigation. They include Robert Tarran, a physiologist and vaping expert at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and Dr. Peter Shields, a lung cancer specialist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, who has one of the country\u2019s largest sets of lung samples from vapers, smokers and never-smokers. \u201cIt could be that we\u2019ll see something in the general, normal population of people who are using e-cigarettes,\u201d Shields said. Investigators at the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have pointed to THC vaping oils or vitamin E, a substance used in some THC products, as a possible cause of these illnesses. But they have not ruled out anything yet, including conventional nicotine liquids. CDC pathologists are examining hundreds of lung cell samples gathered from patients in the outbreak. Meanwhile, forensic chemists at the FDA are testing more than 150 products to determine whether there is a common ingredient that may help explain the illnesses. \u201cWe need to parlay what we\u2019re seeing in product samples with what we\u2019re seeing in lung tissue,\u201d Meaney-Delman said.

The UAE, which has reported 85 coronavirus infections but no deaths, and other Gulf Arab states are intensifying measures to halt the virus as the number of cases rises. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have taken the most drastic steps, cancelling all international flights. Dubai, the UAE\u2019s regional business and transit hub, said it was cancelling all events planned in March and asked hotels to stop hosting wedding celebrations. Some shops have voluntarily closed to boost containment efforts. In the capital, Abu Dhabi, cinemas, arcades and entertainment venues have been shuttered, state news agency WAM reported. Seeking to soften the impact of the shutdowns on key sectors such as tourism and transportation, the central bank said its program would help banks and companies weather the crisis. Saudi Arabia also announced $13 billion to support small and medium enterprises. Saudi Arabia, which reported 17 new cases on Saturday bringing its total to 103, said two-week flight suspensions would start on Sunday, while Kuwait did not specify a length for its grounding which began on Saturday. Saudi Arabia has already suspended the Umrah pilgrimage and locked down its eastern Qatif region where many infections are located.

Vice President Leni Robredo, who was elected separately to the president, and recently served a brief stint as the president\u2019s drug \u201ctsar\u201d, said vast quantities of the highly addictive drug were available because seizures had barely dented the supply. \u201cIt is very clear, based on official data, despite the number of Filipinos killed and the budget spent, the volume of shabu supply curbed didn\u2019t exceed 1%,\u201d Robredo told a news conference, referring to methamphetamines. Robredo, a former human rights lawyer, has long been a critic of Duterte\u2019s flagship anti-drugs campaign, the main focus of which has been methamphetamines. Citing police data, she said annual seizures of the drug in the last three years were in a range of about 1,000 kg, compared with estimated consumption of 3,000 kg a week, which translates to 156 tonnes a year, worth about 1.3 trillion pesos ($25 billion). The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated the Asia-Pacific methamphetamine trade was worth as much as $61.4 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $15 billion just five years earlier. Duterte appointed Robredo his \u201cdrugs tsar\u201d on Nov. 5 after the opposition leader, in a Reuters interview and subsequent public appearances, expressed alarm about the death toll in the anti-narcotics campaign and said it needed a fresh approach. But 18 days later Duterte fired her after she had exposed flaws in the campaign. Robredo said the government must change its strategy and halt police anti-drug operations. \u201cInstead of chasing or killing drug peddlers in street corners, we need to pursue the source of drugs, the big suppliers.

The average cost of treating those cesarean-related infections in the hospital is $3,500 and may be much higher for severe infections.\u201d Our wish list for this release might include whether chlorhexidine is any more expensive (or cheaper) than the standard of care and what the cost is for treating an infection outpatient. These are details that would have added to the quality of the release. However, infections are costs that can be prevented, and that is the main issue which the release covers well. The story quantifies the benefits well, explaining that a randomized-controlled trial showed \u201cpatients in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group developed significantly fewer infections than patients in the iodine-alcohol group. Those who received the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination had a 4 percent infection rate, which is nearly half that of the patients who received the iodine-alcohol combination \u2014 7.3 percent.\u201d The news release includes both relative and absolute numbers \u2014 a big plus. The absolute numbers included the number of women who developed infections after being treated with either chlorhexidine-alcohol (23) or iodine-alcohol (42) and the size of their co-hort (572 vs. 575). The news release doesn\u2019t mention any harms associated with either of the antiseptics used in the study. If there were no skin reactions, or some with one but not the other, it would be good to note that. This is a minor omission. The release did a good job of explaining the quality of the evidence from this randomized controlled trial. Here is one paragraph about that evidence. \u201cThe clinical trial included 1,147 patients who underwent cesarean sections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Of 572 patients randomly assigned to receive the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination, 23 developed an infection at the site of the surgery within 30 days of the procedure. Of 575 patients who randomly received the iodine-alcohol combination, 42 developed a surgical-site infection.\u201d One thing that was discussed in the study that would have made the release better had it been included was the differentiation between minor and severe infections. There\u2019s no disease mongering here. The release clearly states the funding sources. There were no apparent conflicts. The study compares an alternative method of skin preparation to the current standard and also mentions antibiotics. Soap and water could be another alternative, as could foregoing an elective C-section, but it\u2019s probably too big a digression to mention these when reporting on a head-to-head study on antiseptics. We believe both skin-cleaning agents are widely available. So while the release never explicitly addresses availability, we don\u2019t dock points for this. The release explained that other studies have examined skin-prep, but this one was the first to directly compare dual-element preps for C-sections. Here is an excerpt: \u201cPast trials comparing antiseptics before surgery included relatively few participants and often compared a chlorhexidine-alcohol combination with iodine alone. These studies could not determine whether the worse performance of iodine alone was due to the chlorhexidine, the alcohol or the combination.\u201d The release does not resort to unjustifiable language. It uses a measured tone and acknowledged a potential weakness when pointing out that the study was limited to a single hospital. The call for a change in practice, which in our opinion may be premature based on one single-site study, is offered as an opinion expressed by the senior author: \u201cThis study is a tremendous addition to the literature on preventing surgical-site infections after cesarean. There are few circumstances when a single study should change our practice. But based on the biological plausibility and the striking reduction in surgical-site infections with chlorhexidine, this is one of those circumstances.\u201d We think experts can be given latitude to express a range of opinions in a news release. Claim: To Prevent Infection After C-Section, Chlorhexidine Better Than Iodine", "output": "Women who deliver babies via cesarean section (C-section) surgery may develop infections of the incision, and this news release describes research that shows an alternative combination of skin-cleaning agents prior to surgery may prevent those infections more effectively. The randomized study, which took place at a single hospital, included more than 1,000 patients. It showed that patients prepped for surgery with chlorhexidine-alcohol had a 4% infection rate compared with 7.3% for patients prepped with iodine-alcohol. This well-written news release meets almost all of our criteria for accuracy and includes helpful context about the price of infection care. One area of concern is the recommendation to change the standard of care based on just one study in a single hospital. While it\u2019s a strong study, perhaps it should be replicated in an unrelated setting and be blinded as well as randomized before recommending a change in practice. Like another release we recently reviewed on chocolate for preventing preeclampsia, this one focused on a study presented at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine\u2019s annual meeting. This quality of this well-crafted release is a nice contrast to the previous one that was graded 0 stars. Delivering babies via C-section is common in the United States, and an estimated 1.3 million women delivered that way in 2013. Between 5 and 12 percent of those deliveries included an infection.

In a March 13 tweet, President Donald Trump said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied its testing system for decades but wasn\u2019t prepared for a large scale pandemic, an issue that was complicated by policy changes made by former President Barack Obama. U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., retweeted Trump\u2019s remark and added his own comment: \"\"Trump is once again trying to blame the previous administration for the number of tests available. This is his #DailyLie.\"\" U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, retweeted Schumer\u2019s remark and said: \"\"It\u2019s not Obama\u2019s fault and it\u2019s not Trump\u2019s fault. We have stringent FDA regulations, long in place, that created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly.\"\" PolitiFact looked at a different Trump claim blaming Obama for a lack of testing. We also looked at a claim from Democrat Joe Biden about the Trump administration rejecting tests from the World Health Organization (they were never offered). Trump also inaccurately stated that any individual who wants to be tested for the coronavirus can get a test. We wanted to dig deeper into Crenshaw\u2019s claim, which attributes the delays in the availability of widespread testing to Food and Drug Administration regulations. Justin Discigil, spokesman for Crenshaw, pointed to articles from ProPublica, the New Yorker, The Atlantic and the Washington Post, all of which highlighted the role FDA regulations played here. He added: \"\"Just to be clear \u2013 nowhere did we say that these regulations were the sole/only reason for the testing issue, we said that they created barriers.\"\" A timeline of events The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States came at the end of January, when a man in Washington state developed symptoms after returning from a trip to Wuhan. One month later, federal health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was inevitable that the U.S. would experience a spread of the virus and urged people to take precautions. In these early days of the virus, tests were not widely distributed to local and state laboratories. Instead, testing for the new coronavirus was conducted almost entirely by the CDC \u2014 samples collected at the local level were sent to the agency. Initial test kits developed by the CDC for use in local and state labs were flawed and produced inaccurate results in some labs, meaning they couldn\u2019t be distributed. As the agency worked to correct the tests, health officials turned to the FDA. The U.S. Association of Public Health Laboratories submitted a letter asking the agency to use \"\"enforcement discretion\"\" and authorize local and state labs to develop and use their own tests. During a public health emergency, labs and drug manufacturers must seek an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA to use diagnostic tests and medical treatments that have not gone through the typical clearance process \u2014\u00a0to share them faster in the emergency. (These authorizations were begun in 2004 under President George W. Bush.) For laboratory-developed tests, like the ones in question, FDA policy has stated that they cannot be used in clinical diagnoses without the FDA\u2019s approval during an emergency. Although the goal of these regulations is to ensure only accurate lab tests are conducted, health officials have said they prevented them from quickly responding to the virus. One doctor in a Seattle lab described the process for getting an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA and said the agency asked for a level of testing that didn\u2019t make sense in the context of an emergency, according to a GQ profile. A doctor in North Carolina told NBC News that she had developed a test using the World Health Organization\u2019s protocol but had yet to receive the use authorization from the FDA, putting the state \"\"way behind\"\" in its ability to test patients. On Feb. 29, the FDA announced a change in the process: Labs would still need to seek the agency\u2019s approval for their tests, but the labs could begin testing while waiting for the official green light. On March 16, (three days after Crenshaw made his claim) the FDA announced another change to its policies and put state officials in charge of coronavirus tests developed by laboratories in their states, meaning labs would engage with state officials and not the FDA. It also removes the requirement for these labs to apply for an Emergency Use Authorization for their tests. The changes also expand which labs and manufacturers are included in FDA guidelines and which kinds of tests can be developed. \"\"We believe the unprecedented policy set forth in today\u2019s updated guidance, which addresses laboratories and commercial manufacturers, will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the number and variety of diagnostic tests, as well as available testing capabilities in health care settings, and reference and commercial laboratories,\"\" reads a release from the agency. After the changes After the FDA announced changes to its policies, Labcorps and Quest Diagnostics both announced plans to start testing for the new coronavirus, crediting changes in federal policy with their ability to do so. \"\"We applaud the FDA for providing the flexibility for innovative, quality lab developed tests to be brought to patients and providers quickly to advance effective response to the coronavirus outbreak,\"\" said Steve Rusckowski, chairman and chief executive officer of Quest Diagnostics, in a statement. But even as state and local authorities move to ramp up testing, the number of available tests is still lacking. In Austin, for example, there is still a gap between available test kids and demand for testing, as officials prioritize testing for health care workers, people living in nursing homes and people at high risk for complications from the virus. Our Ruling Crenshaw said in a tweet that longstanding FDA regulations \"\"created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly\"\" for the coronavirus. Crenshaw\u2019s statement is accurate. FDA procedures adopted in 2004 meant laboratories had to seek the agency\u2019s approval before developing and using tests in communities, a policy many health care officials have said prevented the country from taking early action in response to the novel coronavirus. It is important to keep in mind that other factors have contributed to the low levels of testing for the virus, beyond the FDA regulations.

A DGHS study identified a six-fold increase in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in four months in Dhaka as the primary cause of the larger-than-average outbreak. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization said the dengue situation in Bangladesh was \u201calarming but not out of control.\u201d Other countries in Asia are also facing a surge in dengue cases this year, including Thailand, where 53,699 cases and 65 deaths were reported as of July 23. Nevertheless, with dengue cases soaring in recent weeks, Dhaka hospitals have been running out of room and manpower to treat new patients. Prof. Abul Kalam Azad, director general of DGHS, said they had asked the hospitals to increase beds for dengue patients and to open dengue wards. The government also halved the charges for diagnosing dengue and directed public and private hospitals, clinics and diagnostic centers to do the same. Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the largest hospital in the country, opened a special ward for dengue patients, said A.K.M. Nasir Uddin, its director general. Prof. Uttam Kumar Barua, director of Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, another major public hospital in Dhaka, said they were relying on senior medical students to assist doctors in the face of so many patients. \u201cWe don\u2019t have manpower, logistic support and technicians as much as needed. That\u2019s why we are having too much pressure. We have three times more patients than our bed capacity,\u201d Barua said. He said they were admitting every dengue patient who entered the hospital but could not provide beds or even seats for everyone, adding that many had been asked to wait in hospital corridors and verandas. Champa Begum took her 8-month-old to Shaheed hospital on Wednesday. \u201cI have other kids. I go to work leaving this one to another child. I have no way but to work,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t take care of this child properly. This child is laid down anywhere. My home is above dirty water. That how this one was bitten and got dengue.\u201d On Tuesday, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called for concerted efforts to fight the illness. \u201cThe government is working to tackle dengue,\u201d she told an emergency meeting of her ruling Awami League party via teleconference from London, where she was on an official visit. \u201cI urge everyone to keep their houses and surrounding areas clean. That will save us from the disease,\u201d she said. The country\u2019s opposition parties and urban planning experts blamed the central and local government\u2019s lack of preparedness for the rise in dengue cases. People have taken to Facebook to vent their anger about city authorities\u2019 failure to control dengue-carrying mosquitoes.

REUTERS/Yannis Behrakis The study shows the benefits of genetic tests that give women with a family history of cancer the chance to take steps to increase their chances of survival, they said. \u201cThis is the first study to prove women survive longer with these preventive surgeries and shows the importance of genetic testing when there is a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer,\u201d Dr. Virginia Kaklamani of Northwestern University in Chicago wrote in a commentary about the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Women with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have a 56 to 84 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetimes. Those with the BRCA1 mutation also have a 36 to 63 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer and those with the BRCA2 mutation have a 10 to 27 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer. Because of this, many women make the difficult choice to have their breasts or ovaries and fallopian tubes surgically removed to reduce their risk. Dr. Susan M. Domchek of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and colleagues studied the effectiveness of these procedures in 2,482 women with BRCA mutations, including 247 women who had risk-reducing surgery to remove their breasts and 993 who had risk-reducing surgery to remove their ovaries. No woman who had a mastectomy developed breast cancer during the three years of follow-up testing. Seven percent of women who decided against a mastectomy were diagnosed with breast cancer in the same period. \u201cOur results confirm that risk-reducing mastectomy is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer risk,\u201d Domchek and colleagues wrote. Women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations who had their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed had similar results. About 10 to 20 percent of breast and ovarian cancers are due to BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. \u201cMost of these women will die of ovarian cancer, so you can save 20 percent of them with the prophylactic surgery,\u201d Kaklamani said. \u201cAnd you can save the majority of women who would have died of their breast cancer,\u201d she added. She said primary care physicians, gynecologists and women \u201cneed to be more aware that these tests exist.\u201d   Dr. Sandhya Pruthi, a breast cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who counsels women with BRCA mutations, said the study adds more evidence that the surgery can help save lives, but the choice is never easy. \u201cIt\u2019s not cookie-cutter medicine,\u201d Pruthi, who was not involved in the study, said in a telephone interview. She said women need to come to terms with the psychological issues involved in having their breasts removed, and younger women who have their ovaries removed must contend with early menopause symptoms. \u201cIt\u2019s not a decision made on a single visit,\u201d she said. According to the American Cancer Society and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, 1.3 million new breast cancer cases are diagnosed around the world every year and it kills 465,000 women annually, making it the leading global cancer killer of women.

He says he did kill the animal but believed the hunt was legal and that the necessary permits had been issued. Local hunter Theo Bronkhorst appeared in a courthouse in Hwange, 800 km (500 miles) west of Harare, and was charged with \u201cfailing to supervise, control and take reasonable steps to prevent an unlawful hunt\u201d. He pleaded not guilty to the charge and was set free after posting $1,000 bail and depositing his passport with the court. He will return to court on Aug. 5 for trial. Game park owner Honest Ndlovu, who is also accused of assisting Palmer, was not charged on Wednesday and parks officials said he would first testify for the state and be charged later. While Bronkhorst appeared in court in Zimbabwe, Palmer, who is accused of killing Cecil with a bow and arrow, was being pilloried on the Internet, with many people wishing him dead. \u201cThis is disgusting. I hope you get thrown in a cage with hungry lions,\u201d Julie Lu wrote on the Facebook page of his dental practice. Palmer said on Tuesday he had hired professional guides who secured hunting permits and deeply regretted taking the lion. He added that he had not been contacted by authorities in Zimbabwe or the United States and would assist in any inquiries. The Zimbabwe police and government have not commented. If found guilty, Bronkhorst could be fined $20,000 and possibly jailed for up to 10 years. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service expressed its concern about the killing. \u201cWe are currently gathering facts about the issue and will assist Zimbabwe officials in whatever manner requested,\u201d said Vanessa Kauffman, a spokeswoman for the government agency. \u201cIt is up to all of us - not just the people of Africa - to ensure that healthy, wild populations of animals continue to roam the savanna for generations to come.\u201d  Cecil was fitted with a GPS collar for a research project by scientists from Oxford University and was one of the oldest and most famous lions in Zimbabwe. The British university\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit said it had been tracking Cecil since 2008 and was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by his death. \u201cInsofar as this happened illegally we consider it deeply reprehensible,\u201d it said in a statement. It was working closely with Zimbabwe\u2019s National Parks authorities to support their \u201cmeticulous work\u201d in prosecuting the case. The unit also said Cecil\u2019s death would be likely to trigger a power struggle in the pride, resulting in the death of other male lions as well as Cecil\u2019s offspring. \u201cWhen a male lion is killed, because of the way their society works, a likely consequence is the overthrow and death of other adult male members of his weakened coalition, and the subsequent infanticide of his cubs,\u201d it said. Palmer\u2019s hunting has attracted scrutiny in the past. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to lying to a U.S. wildlife agent about a black bear he killed in Wisconsin two years before. He was accused of killing it 40 miles outside a permitted zone, hauling the carcass back into the approved area and certifying falsely that it was killed there. He was  sentenced to one year probation and fined $2,938. In the Hwange case, Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force chairman Johnny Rodrigues said Cecil was lured out of the park with bait before being shot. The incident has triggered fierce debate over the commercial \u2018trophy\u2019 hunting of African big game. Like many countries, Zimbabwe issues annual permits that allow foreign hunters to kill wildlife such as elephant, buffalo and lion legally, arguing that the funds raised allow the government to fund conservation efforts. \u201cSustainable trophy hunting is part of well-managed wildlife conservation. It creates incentives for people to look after wildlife,\u201d said Adri Kitshoff, chief executive of the Professional Hunters\u2019 Association of South Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of emotions and not focus on facts.\u201d  However, Edward Bourke, chairman of the Australia-based Saving The Lion Foundation, said Cecil\u2019s death showed the dangers of legal hunting. \u201cThere is enough global pressure to push for change. There is an opportunity to offer alternatives, including international aid for establishing safe haven environments like national parks or eco-tourism zones,\u201d he said. One of the few countries to avoid Cecil hysteria was Zimbabwe, where most people are more preoccupied with putting food on the table and finding work in an economy suffering 80 percent unemployment. To the state-run Herald newspaper, the most remarkable aspect of the case was the lion\u2019s name, which it linked to British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, after whom the former Rhodesia named. \u201cHow someone thought it such a good idea to christen a lion after the infamous plunderer and murderer who roamed dangerously across Africa can only be a matter of conjecture,\u201d it said in an editorial.

Asked about criticism that severely injured people will no longer have gold-plated treatment because their regular health insurance will impose caps on rehabilitation visits and other services, Whitmer said medical providers may have to deliver care \u201cin different mechanisms but it will still be there, and I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d She said the Republican-backed bills as initially proposed and a ballot initiative threatened by Detroit businessman Dan Gilbert \u201cwould have been devastating. This is a result where we can shore up the safety net.\u201d Michigan \u2014 home to the country\u2019s highest car premiums \u2014 is the only state to require unlimited personal injury protection, or PIP, benefits, which on average make up half of auto premiums. They cover medical treatment, rehabilitation expenses, lost wages for three years and up to $20 daily for assistance with things like cooking, cleaning and other services people can no longer carry out due to their injuries. Under the measure, starting in mid-2020 people will be able to forego PIP entirely if they have health insurance such as an employer plan or Medicare. Other options will include sticking with unlimited coverage or choosing either $250,000 or $500,000 worth. Those on Medicaid will have to carry at least $50,000 in PIP. The measure won overwhelmingly bipartisan support from the Republican-led Legislature on Friday. Speaking by phone from the Detroit Regional Chamber\u2019s Mackinac Policy Conference, Whitmer said the legislation originally would have been \u201cdevastating\u201d to hospitals with trauma centers. It would have cut reimbursements to workers\u2019 compensation levels, while the bill heading to her desk would require that providers be paid at roughly 200 percent of the Medicare fee schedule. \u201cIt\u2019s not just emergency rooms for people with auto injuries,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s losing access for any parent who\u2019s got an asthmatic child who has gone to the ER because their child is having a hard time breathing or had a contusion. It would have been a lack of care for people that have a heart attack. When these trauma centers are at risk like this, every single one of us loses that access.\u201d Unlike several other no-fault states, hospitals, doctors and rehab facilities treating crash victims have effectively been able to charge auto insurers far more than they do for patients covered by private or government health plans. Whitmer added that PIP rates will be cut for eight years under the pending law, calling it \u201creal relief for consumers.\u201d She said the new law will require \u201cquite a bit\u201d of public education, because \u201cit\u2019s a very complicated system that we are trying to address in a very thoughtful way.\u201d The landmark deal left Whitmer optimistic about the potential for confronting other major issues such as deteriorating roads, which she has proposed fixing with a 45-cents-a-gallon fuel tax increase. She said she and the four legislative leaders \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 \u201cgot more done in the first five months of this year than has been done on this issue in the last five years.\u201d The Michigan Chamber of Commerce, municipalities and the state\u2019s leading road-construction industry group on Tuesday urged lawmakers to make infrastructure a priority. Whitmer said she will put \u201c110%\u201d emphasis on roads this week at the business conference on Mackinac Island. Asked if she secured commitments from GOP legislative leaders for a long-term road-funding plan as part of the car insurance negotiations, Whitmer said: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this: The way that we worked together on this first issue is something that every one of us is eager to continue as we pivot into roads and getting the budget done.\u201d ___ Follow David Eggert on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 Claim: Whitmer: Care for injured drivers will \u2018still be there\u2019.", "output": "Gov.

But early statistical signs the crisis might be peaking provided little comfort to weary doctors and nurses on the front lines of the outbreak, as hospital emergency rooms and intensive care units overflowing with COVID-19 patients. \u201cPeople are just so incredibly sick ... incredibly sick in a way that I\u2019ve never experienced or seen before,\u201d said Jacqueline Callahan, 33, a New York City nurse who spoke to Reuters on condition she not identify the hospital where she works. \u201cSo every day is, honestly, the hardest day,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to change, and you just hope it keeps getting better, but - you know - we haven\u2019t turned that corner fully yet.\u201d  In Wisconsin, voters on Tuesday braved the coronavirus outbreak to wait 6 feet (1.8 m) apart in lines for hours and cast ballots in the state\u2019s presidential primary and local elections. For the United States, the tally of known coronavirus infections approached 400,000 on Tuesday, with the number of deaths surpassing 12,700 in a record single-day jump of more than 1,800 nationwide. New York state accounted for more than a third of U.S. confirmed coronavirus cases to date, and nearly half the cumulative death toll - 5,489 as of Tuesday. But Cuomo said the rising number of deaths was a \u201clagging indicator\u201d coming days or weeks after the onset of infections. He pointed instead to slowing rates of coronavirus hospitalizations, intensive care admissions and ventilator intubations as signs social distancing measures imposed last month were working. The governors of Illinois and Louisiana - two other hot spots in the U.S. pandemic - likewise paired reports of record jumps in COVID-19 deaths with data suggesting the contagion may be reaching a plateau. The messages seemed calibrated to convey a sense of hope while urging the public to abide strictly by stay-at-home orders imposed by governors of 42 states. \u201cLet\u2019s not get complacent,\u201d Cuomo told a news conference. \u201cSocial distancing is working. ... That\u2019s why you see those numbers coming down.\u201d    Across the country, California Governor Gavin Newsom said  the infection curve in his state - the first to impose stay-at-home orders - was \u201cbending but it\u2019s also stretching,\u201d with the virus outbreak there expected to peak in mid- to late May. \u201cThe curve continues to rise, but now it is slower,\u201d he told a news briefing. In another glimmer of good news, the U.S. surgeon general, Jerome Adams, said on Tuesday the pandemic may end up killing fewer Americans than the range of 100,000 to 240,000 projected earlier by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest research model from the University of Washington - one of several cited by leading health authorities - has forecast U.S. coronavirus deaths totaling fewer than 82,000 by Aug. 4. Adams, who is black, also acknowledged early data showing African Americans more likely to die from COVID-19, highlighting longstanding disparities in health and inequalities in access to medical care. The steps to curb the pandemic have hammered the U.S. economy, closing many businesses while unemployment soars. Trump reiterated at a White House briefing he wanted to reopen the U.S. economy soon. \u201cWe want to get it open soon, that\u2019s why I think maybe we\u2019re getting to the very top of the curve,\u201d Trump said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose city is the focal point of the state\u2019s outbreak, said it was too early to declare a corner had been turned but cited encouraging developments. \u201cThe number of people showing up in our hospitals who need a ventilator - that situation has improved a bit in recent days,\u201d he said. In the nation\u2019s second-largest city, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti on Tuesday ordered workers providing \u201cnon-medical\u201d essential services, such as supermarket employees, wear face coverings while on the job. The order, which takes effect on Friday also requires customers of grocery stores and other essential businesses to likewise wear face coverings. That will come as some relief to Tomas Flores, a grocery worker at Northgate Market in Los Angeles, who like many delivery workers, grocery staff and cleaners, doesn\u2019t have a stay-at-home option. \u201cI do worry,\u201d Flores said, hours before Garcetti\u2019s order. \u201cI ask God to watch over me when I leave my home and to take care of me at work, but I feel the need to come because many families depend on us,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only my family depends on me because I must earn money to bring home, but many people depend on the work that I do.\u201d   Graphic: U.S. coronavirus, tmsnrt.rs/2w7hX9T Claim: 'Hardest day': New York's Cuomo sees virus slowing despite record death toll.", "output": "Even as medical teams struggled to save an onslaught of gravely ill coronavirus patients and deaths hit new highs, the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations seemed to be leveling off in New York state, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

ESA published an animation https://www.esa.int showing how NO2 emissions fluctuated across Europe from Jan. 1-March 11, using a 10-day moving average, clearly showing pollution levels dropping over northern Italy. Italy has been hardest hit by the outbreak in Europe, with more than 15,100 confirmed cases and more than 1,000 dead, and the government has imposed the most severe controls placed on a Western nation since World War Two. Researchers studying the impact of emissions from industry and transport on climate change and human health are scrambling to understand the possible implications of the pandemic as economies slow, flights are disrupted and quarantines imposed. In China, Finland\u2019s Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air says CO2 emissions fell by a quarter, or an estimated 200 million tonnes in the four weeks to March 1 - about half the amount Britain emits in a year. Satellite data also showed a sharp fall in Chinese emissions of NO2, starting in Wuhan and then spreading over other cities, including the capital, noticeable over a fortnight in mid-February. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday that Europe had now become the epicenter of the pandemic, which has claimed 5,000 lives worldwide.

Anthony List, which backs political candidates who oppose abortion. \u201cAnd as president, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve done. And I have kept my promise, and I think everybody here understands that fully.\u201d Most of the changes involve rules and regulations under the administration\u2019s direct control, such as a proposal to forbid federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions and separately allowing more employers who cite moral or religious reasons to opt out of no-cost birth control for women workers. Trump also is appointing numerous new federal judges endorsed by anti-abortion groups. Justice Neil Gorsuch, the president\u2019s only appointment to the Supreme Court so far, has a sparse record on abortion, but has drawn praise from anti-abortion groups and criticism from abortion rights supporters. Unlike regulatory changes, judicial appointments cannot be reversed by a future president. Democrats say Trump is changing policy in ways that could disrupt access to family planning for some women. A recently proposed rule would make major changes to Title X, the family-planning program, including banning clinics from sharing physical space and financial resources with abortion providers. Providers like Planned Parenthood could be forced out. \u201cIt\u2019s across the spectrum of women\u2019s health services,\u201d said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Col. \u201cThey\u2019re proposing abstinence-only sex education \u2014which study after study has shown doesn\u2019t work\u2014 restrictions to family planning, and more and more restrictions to abortion.\u201d Title X serves about 4 million low-income people, mainly women. Disruptions could affect women\u2019s access to long-acting contraceptives, such as implants and IUDs. Those are more effective than daily pills that can be forgotten but also much more expensive up-front. Eight professional groups representing doctors, nurses, midwives and physician assistants say the administration\u2019s Title X proposal \u201cdangerously intrudes\u201d on the patient-provider relationship. \u201cThe strange thing about this is that people who want to decrease the number of abortions are taking away access to the very services that help prevent them,\u201d said Dr. Hal Lawrence, CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, one of the eight groups. Among the others are the American College of Nurse-Midwives and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Speaking at a recent rally organized by women\u2019s health advocates in Phoenix, Karina Romero recalled how she had no health insurance and about $20 in her bank account when she sought birth control at a Planned Parenthood clinic in the city\u2019s suburbs. The federal program enabled her to get a long-lasting contraceptive implant. \u201cThey have allowed me to pursue a higher education without having to worry about how I\u2019m going to pay for my birth control, or how I\u2019m going to pay for just a regular check up every year,\u201d said Romero, who studies online at Northern Arizona University. The administration says it supports family planning and isn\u2019t cutting funding \u2014 merely drawing a \u201cbright line\u201d between birth control and abortion. Officials say the doctor-patient relationship is protected because if a woman asks for an abortion referral, Title X doctors could offer a list of pregnancy services providers, including some who perform abortions. Abortion is legal, but under longstanding law and regulations, taxpayer money cannot be used to pay for abortions. Planned Parenthood, a major provider of both kinds of services, can receive federal family-planning grants while separately providing abortions. Trump\u2019s changes come at a time when U.S. rates of births overall, births to teens, and abortions are low. \u201cIf we were seeing skyrocketing abortion rates and wildly high numbers on teen births, you could say we have a crisis, but this is just the opposite,\u201d said Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of Health and Human Services under President Barack Obama, and a supporter of abortion rights. \u201cThis is playing politics and putting people in a very precarious situation.\u201d In addition to the proposed changes to Title X, other regulatory actions include: \u2014 Proposing a shift in the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program to emphasize an abstinence-only approach. \u2014 Proposing new criteria for federal family-planning grants that would favor applicants who promote \u201cnatural family planning\u201d and abstinence. \u2014 Expanding a ban on U.S. funding to foreign organizations that promote or provide abortions. Professor Michael New, who teaches economics at Ave Maria University in Florida, agrees there\u2019s a major policy shift. But New, who opposes abortion, dismisses claims of dire consequences as \u201cfalse and frankly absurd.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump is decidedly pro-life and it is his administration\u2019s prerogative to use federal funding rules to incrementally build a culture of life,\u201d said New. \u201cThe administration is seeking to redirect tax dollars away from entities like Planned Parenthood that treat abortion as a method of family planning and toward entities that affirm life and provide more holistic health care services.\u201d Planned Parenthood, which survived attempts by congressional Republicans to deny it funding, says the administration\u2019s proposed changes to Title X could be another way of achieving the same goal. Planned Parenthood serves 41 percent of program clients, and operates 13 percent of the clinics. Such facilities have become a specialized niche. Research from Texas after that state moved to oust Planned Parenthood showed that other local providers like community health centers were not able to easily fill the gap. Dr. Stephanie Ho works for Planned Parenthood at a clinic in Arkansas that will have to stop offering medication abortions because of a state law that the Supreme Court this week allowed to take effect. The combination of state restrictions and administration actions worries her. \u201cThey\u2019re pushing their views on everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re ignoring scientific evidence and expert medical opinion.\u201d Top Planned Parenthood officials say they will fight to remain in Title X, and will consider litigation if necessary to challenge new rules. HHS is expected to announce funding awards for the $260-million program this fall. At a time when social mores on human reproduction continue changing across the world, some see the U.S. in a time warp. \u201cA lot of social conservative activists are still fighting the battles from the \u201960s and the sexual revolution,\u201d said Adam Sonfield, policy manager at The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. \u201cThat\u2019s their ultimate goal \u2014 that some people will just give up and stop having sex.\u201d But Kristi Hamrick, spokeswoman for Students for Life of America, said one result of the policy changes \u201cmay be that American women will find that life goes on without Planned Parenthood.\u201d ___ Crary reported from New York.

The costs of intensive medical therapy can easily be identified. Using an online pharmacy we calculated the costs to be about $1,500 to $2,000 annually for medical therapy, using generic drugs. Using the Health Care\u00a0Blue Book, we found the average cost of coronary artery bypass sugery and hospitalization to be about $62,000. We think that this is important information for readers that should have been included. The quantification here was presented in such a way to make it clear to readers that there was no significant benefit found to surgical intervention, which is a fair conclusion to draw from the study. The story says, \u201cIn the Stich study, 41% of patients assigned to treatment with drugs alone died during the follow-up period, which averaged five years. That compared with a mortality rate of 36% among patients who received bypass surgery plus medication. Although the relative reduction in risk of death was 14%, the result didn\u2019t meet tests for statistical significance, meaning it could have resulted from chance alone.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s a great way to describe the lack of statistical significance. It would have been even more powerful to show readers the actual number of patients who died in each group. The story provides great information about the study itself and about the overall state of the evidence supporting heart surgery. \u201cHow best to treat these patients has been fraught with uncertainty,\u201d is one of the more notable phrases from the story. It also says, \u201cMany patients aren\u2019t evaluated for heart surgery to treat diseased arteries because they don\u2019t suffer classic chest pain or because doctors worry that hearts weakened by heart failure won\u2019t benefit from the procedure. Other doctors recommend immediate bypass surgery despite a lack of vigorous studies to support that strategy.\u201d The story does not engage in disease-mongering and takes a very careful approach to describing the types of patients who would be affected by this study\u2019s results. We also like the way they provided snapshots of patients who were in both arms of the study \u2014 surgery and non-surgery \u2014 at the end of the story, making it clear, as the study did, that both routes can be equally successful. The story brings in some strong independent voices who help make sense of this complicated study: James Fang, a cardiologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, Raymond Gibbons, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, and Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine. Rarely do you see a story that spends as much time with independent experts as it does with the authors of the study. The story does a great job showing how the standard interventions for heart disease stacked up against each other in this study. We wish that some mention had been made of diet and exercise and that at least a sentence had been included about whether there might be differences in outcomes seen as a result of different medication patterns. The story doesn\u2019t make it clear what exactly the patients were taking. The story makes it clear that the range of treatments studied by the authors are widely available. The story makes it clear that there is a great need for more evidence in this field and that this study will be surprising to many clinicians because of a long-held assumption that surgery is the superior option. tudies published in the early 1990s supported the view that bypass surgery provided a better long term outcome. The story does not rely on a news release. Claim: More Options Before Bypass Surgery, Study Finds", "output": "The piece gave readers some powerful information to help them sort through the range of factors that should be considered for any medical intervention. The only weakness our reviewers found with the story is the lack of comment about cost. Too often stories present medical options as false choices of best versus worst. They don\u2019t take into consideration the very real differences between patients\u2019 medical histories, diagnoses and expectations. This story should be applauded for giving readers a clear understanding of the complexities of shared decision-making between providers and patients. As noted by one of the experts quoted in the story, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a good therapy and a bad therapy, you have a choice.\u201d This is a message that the story gets across very well and is an important one for readers.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}]
