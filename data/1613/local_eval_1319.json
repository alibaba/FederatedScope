Not knowing if I'd be the Prestige or the man in the box.\"  My interpretation is that the machine makes a clone and his consciousness ends up in one and he doesn't know which one. This means some days he dies.  Can somebody clear this up for me? Because there is something wrong with this explanation: The clones in The Prestige are sentient.    So how does that work? Which clone is real Angier? Is his consciousness split among the various clones and he feels both dying and being the Prestige?", "output": "The clones are sentient paradox", "category": "Question Generation 734.json"}, {"instruction": "Given scene/plot descriptions from movies or TV shows, and given a specific question about the scene, summarize the question into a title", "input": "In the movie A Christmas Story, the Mother (name unspecified) is suspect in the breaking of the Leg Lamp, because she never liked it. She seems believable when she says it was an accident and she doesn't know how it happened. However, while The Old Man (name unspecified) is trying to repair it, in the background she seems giddy that it is broken, and when his attention is returned to her, she immediately goes solemn and concerned.
