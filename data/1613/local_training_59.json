She and others clearly saw what was an opportunity. Before the war  women's colleges had taught women math and science but they were reluctant to train very many women because they knew they couldn't get jobs. And so when the war started  they were still skeptical about putting too many women into math majors because they just worried that all of this was going to be yanked away after the war. But I also thought Virginia Gildersleeve was very crafty. She and some of the other leaders did see this as a way to try to persuade MIT and Columbia and other places to open up some more slots in graduate school for women.

White: For sure  but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue those aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even representative of Brooklyn in this moment. Brooklyn is not the Brooklyn of the \u00e2\u0080\u009980s or \u00e2\u0080\u009990s (so  Lee  keeps reminding us).

Fazlalizadeh put up a series of posters around Brooklyn with similar anti\u00e2\u0080\u0093street harassment messages she drew from women she interviewed about their experiences.

She's technically only \"leaning\" no  but that's tantamount to a hard no; I'm fairly certain she'd vote against her own Obamacare replacement plan at this point.
