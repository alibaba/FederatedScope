Moreover, we checked expression of an ER stress marker in lung tissues isolated from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.', 'Af-exposed mice showed that ER stress markers, unfolded protein response (UPR)-related proteins, phosphorylated Akt, generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), eosinophilic allergic inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were increased in the lung. Similarly, glucose-regulated protein 78 was increased in lung tissues of patients with ABPA. A PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor reduced Af-induced increases in ER stress markers, UPR-related proteins, allergic inflammation and AHR in mice. However, dexamethasone failed to reduce Af-induced allergic inflammation, AHR and elevation of ER stress. Administration of an ER stress inhibitor or a mtROS scavenger improved Af-induced allergic inflammation. The PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor reduced Af-induced mtROS generation and the mtROS scavenger ameliorated ER stress. In primary cultured tracheal epithelial cells, Af-induced ER stress was inhibited by blockade of PI3K-\u03b4.", "output": "Does phosphoinositide 3-kinase-\u03b4 regulate fungus-induced allergic lung inflammation through endoplasmic reticulum stress?", "category": "Question Generation 1471.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

Recent studies have shown that HNK has antitumor activity with relatively low toxicity. In this study, we demonstrated that the growth inhibitory effects of HNK on melanoma and melanoma cancer stem cells were mediated through the activation of AMPK and hence AMPK signaling in melanoma cells.', 'We determined the effects of HNK treatment on various melanoma cell lines. HNK-induced cell growth inhibitory effects were determined using hexosaminidase assay. Protein expression studies were done by immunoblotting. Primary spheroid assay was used to assess stemness by growing single suspension cells in ultralow attachment plates.', 'HNK is highly effective in inhibiting melanoma cells by attenuating protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin and AMPK signaling. HNK showed significant inhibition of the spheroid-forming capacity of melanoma cells and, hence, stemness. HNK significantly decreased the number and size of melanospheres in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analyses showed enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK in melanoma cells. Furthermore, HNK decreased the cellular adenosine triphosphate pool in a dose-dependent manner with maximum effects observed at 48\\xa0hours.", "output": "Does honokiol affect melanoma cell growth by targeting the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway?", "category": "Question Generation 1471.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs can be released through ceramide-dependent secretory machinery regulated by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) enzyme encoded by the smpd3 gene that triggers exosome secretion. However, whether exosome-mediated microRNA transfer plays any role in cell invasion remains poorly understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the exosomal microRNAs involved in breast cancer invasion.', 'The expression level of endogenous and exosomal miRNAs were examined by real time PCR and the expression level of target proteins were detected by western blot. Scanning electron and confocal microscopy were used to characterize exosomes and to study its uptake and transfer. Luciferase reporter plasmids and its mutant were used to confirm direct targeting. Furthermore, the functional significance of exosomal miR-10b was estimated by invasion assay.', 'In this study, we demonstrate that microRNA carrying exosomes can be transferred among different cell lines through direct uptake. miR-10b is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to non-metastatic breast cancer cells or non-malignant breast cells; it is actively secreted into medium via exosomes. In particular, nSMase2 or ceramide promotes the exosome-mediated miR-10b secretion whereas ceramide inhibitor suppresses this secretion. Moreover, upon uptake, miR-10b can suppress the protein level of its target genes such as HOXD10 and KLF4, indicating its functional significance. Finally, treatment with exosomes derived from MDA-MB-231 cells could induce the invasion ability of non-malignant HMLE cells.", "output": "Does exosome-mediated transfer of miR-10b promote cell invasion in breast cancer?", "category": "Question Generation 1471.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

In contrast to the activation of SIPK and elevation of JA in specific systemic leaves, increases in the activity of an important anti-herbivore defense, trypsin proteinase inhibitor (TPI), were observed in all systemic leaves after simulated herbivory, suggesting that systemic TPI induction does not require SIPK activation and JA increases.

Once DNA-bound, PARP-1 becomes catalytically activated synthesizing PAR polymers onto itself and other repair factors (PARylation). As a result, BER repair proteins such as XRCC1 and DNA polymerase \u03b2 (pol \u03b2) are more efficiently and rapidly recruited to sites of DNA damage. In the presence of an inhibitor of PARP activity (PARPi), PARP-1 binds to sites of DNA damage, but PARylation is prevented. BER enzyme recruitment is hindered, but binding of PARP-1 to DNA is stabilized, impeding DNA repair and leading to double-strand DNA breaks (DSB). Deficiencies in pol \u03b2(-/-) and Xrcc1(-/-) cells resulted in hypersensitivity to the PARP inhibitor 4-AN and reexpression of pol \u03b2 or XRCC1, in these contexts, reversed the 4-AN hypersensitivity phenotype. BER deficiencies also showed evidence of replication defects that lead to DSB-induced apoptosis upon PARPi treatment. Finally, the clinically relevant PARP inhibitors olaparib and veliparib also exhibited hypersensitivity in both pol \u03b2(-/-) and Xrcc1(-/-) BER-deficient cells.

Macro-reentry around the ischemic region and early afterdepolarizations (EADs) caused by electrotonic current have been suggested as potential mechanisms in animal and isolated cell studies. However, ventricular and human-specific arrhythmia mechanisms and their modulation by repolarization reserve remain unclear. The goal of this paper is to unravel multiscale mechanisms underlying the modulation of arrhythmic risk by potassium current (IKr) block in human ventricles with acute regional ischemia.', 'A human ventricular biophysically-detailed model, with acute regional ischemia is constructed by integrating experimental knowledge on the electrophysiological ionic alterations caused by coronary occlusion. Arrhythmic risk is evaluated by determining the vulnerable window (VW) for reentry following ectopy at the ischemic border zone. Macro-reentry around the ischemic region is the main reentrant mechanism in the ischemic human ventricle with increased repolarization reserve due to the ATP-sensitive potassium current (IK(ATP)) activation. Prolongation of refractoriness by 4% caused by 30% IKr reduction counteracts the establishment of macro-reentry and reduces the VW for reentry (by 23.5%).

A subset of serum samples from healthy and polyp-bearing patients (n = 163) were analyzed by ELISA for anti-H. pylori and anti-CagA antibodies. The crude and adjusted effect of H. pylori on the risk of colorectal adenoma and polyp were computed by logistic regression models.', \"The prevalence of colorectal polyps and adenomas were 456 (36%) and 300 (24%) respectively. Colorectal polyps were more prevalent in gastric H. pylori infected than non-infected subjects [43% vs. 34%; Odds Ratio (OR) (95% CI): 1.5 (1.2-1.9), P = 0.001]. Patients with H. pylori-associated chronic active gastritis were at high risk to have adenomas [Unadjusted OR (95% CI): 1.3 (1.0-1.8); P = 0.04]. There was no difference in histopathology, size, or location of polyps with respect to H. pylori status. Gastric H. pylori infection, age, male gender and high risk clinical presentations were independent risk factors for colorectal polyps.

These include activation conditions (using mitogens or monoclonal antibodies), culture conditions (including media composition and cytokine addition), timing of viral exposure, retroviral receptor selection (ecotropic, amphotropic, or vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) glycoprotein receptor), and viral titer.', 'We show that efficient gene transfer can be achieved in murine T-lymphocytes, provided that a number of favorable conditions are met, in particular optimized T-cell activation conditions, optimal timing of infection, adequate interleukin-2 concentration and T-cell density, and a high viral titer. On a particulate basis, we find that ecotropic particles are more effective than amphotropic or VSV-G-pseudotyped particles, and recommend the use of a specifically selected retroviral packaging cell line. CD4+ T-cells are equally or more infectible than CD8+ lymphocytes, depending on the activation conditions. The Th1 and Th2 subsets are comparably susceptible to retroviral infection, in contrast to what has been reported in some instances of human T-cell infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).", "output": "Do activation conditions determine susceptibility of murine primary T-lymphocytes to retroviral infection?", "category": "Question Generation 1471.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

The function of miR-18a in regulating HIF1A expression, as well as cellular responses to hypoxia and metastasis, were then studied in vitro and in vivo by assessing ectopic miR-18a expression or miR-18a inhibition. miRNA-mRNA interactions (AGO2 immunoprecipitation and 3' untranslated region Luciferase reporter assays), gene expression (quantitative PCR and microarray), cell migration and invasion, and cell growth were assessed under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, complemented by orthotopic xenograft of tumor cells to the mammary fat pad to investigate the effect of modulating miR-18a expression on primary tumor growth and lung metastasis.

We identified HIF1A as a direct target of miR-18a. Modulating miR-18a expression significantly affected hypoxic gene expression, cell invasiveness and sensitivity to anoikis and hypoxia in vitro in a HIF1A-dependent manner. Analysis of previously published data revealed that higher expression of HIF1A and a panel of hypoxic genes is associated with shorter DMFS interval in patients with basal-like breast tumors, and that, within this subtype, miR-18a expression is inversely correlated with hypoxic gene expression.

Finally, the contacted group was separated into 2 further groups: (1) reminder calls that resulted in direct conversation with an appropriate person at the patient\\'s listed telephone number, and (2) reminder message left on an answering machine.', 'Data were collected from 515 consecutive outpatient appointments; 45 (8.7%) of these patients did not show up for testing. The absentee rate was 4.7% (n = 10) in the called group and 11.6% (n = 35) in the not-called group (p = 0.0066). In the called group, 6.5% (n = 14) could not be reached. The absentee rate was 4% (n = 8) in the contacted group and 11.7% (n = 37) in the not-contacted group (p = 0.0021). We found no difference in absenteeism between patients who received reminders via direct conversation (4.2%) and those who had a reminder message left on an answering machine (3.7%) (p > 0.05).", "output": "Does the effect of telephone appointment-reminder call on outpatient absenteeism in a pulmonary function laboratory?", "category": "Question Generation 1471.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

The inclusion criteria included bilateral thyroid nodules, pressure symptoms or cosmetic problems, cytologic confirmation of benignancy without atypical cells, and patient refusal of surgery. We used an RF generator (Cool-tip RF system [Covidien, Boulder, Colorado] or SSP-2000, Taewoong Medical Co, Ltd [Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea]) and an 18-gauge internally cooled electrode with 1-cm active tips (Cool-tip [Covidien] or Well-Point RF electrode [Taewoong Medical Co, Ltd]). RF ablation was conducted using the moving shot technique and a trans-isthmic approach. RF ablation was performed in separate sessions for nodules in each lobe. Follow-up ultrasound examinations were performed at 1-6 months, 6-12 months, and during the last month of follow-up. The diameter and volume of the nodule and clinical problems including cosmetic and symptom scores were evaluated before and after the procedure.', 'The mean initial nodule size was 4.1 cm \u00b1 1.9, although there was a significant decrease by the time of the last follow-up examination (range, 1-48 mo; mean, 18.1 mo \u00b1 12.8; P < .001, 2.5 cm \u00b1 1.4). The initial nodule volume was 24.4 mL \u00b1 32.2 and was decreased at the last follow-up (6.3 mL \u00b1 19.0, P < .001), with a mean volume reduction of 75.9% \u00b1 19.0. The symptom (P < .001) and cosmetic (P < .001) scores were decreased. Serum hormone levels did not differ significantly before treatment and at the last follow-up (P > .05).", "output": "Is radiofrequency ablation a thyroid function-preserving treatment for patients with bilateral benign thyroid nodules?", "category": "Question Generation 1471.json"}]
