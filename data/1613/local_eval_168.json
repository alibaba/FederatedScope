It's been over twenty years since then - Bikini Kill frontwoman and Riot Grrrl icon Kathleen Hanna scrawled the word SLUT across her stomach . In the years since, there's been a book called Slut! , countless feminist debates over the reclamation of the word \"slut\" and, in 2011, thousands of women took to streets across the globe in anti-rape marches called SlutWalks - a reference to how victims of sexual assault are often blamed for the violence done to them . Like \"cunt\" and \"bitch\", many feminists have long tried to wrest away from its original users the power and harm of the word \"slut\" and to give it new meaning . Increasingly, though, it's seeming like we might not succeed any time soon . Take Leora Tanenbaum: in 2000, she wrote Slut!: Growing up Female with a Bad Reputation chronicling girls' and women's experiences with the word . She herself was called a \"slut\" as a high school student in the 1980s - long before the term \"sexual harassment\" was coined - and told me\"I had no vocabulary to understand what happened.\" Now, 15 years later, Tanenbaum is about to publish another book: I Am Not a Slut because, in part, the sheen of reclaiming \"slut\" seems to have worn off over the years . When she spoke to women who called themselves \"sluts\" with a \"positive and defiant\" spirit, all told her the decision had turned against them later- and all regretted it . Tanenbaum told me that, when women are in closed circle or close-knit community - like a protest with like-minded people, or among friends who understand the cheeky appropriation of the word - identifying as a \"slut\" can be empowering . But what inevitably happens, especially in today's digital culture where revenge porn, stolen pictures and cyber harassment is the norm, is that \"it always spills outwards.\" For them it was an amazing feminist experience , but it didn't last . Every single person I spoke to who intentionally embraced a \"slut\" persona ended up being treated terribly by people outside of her circle , because the culture we live in is so dominated by the sexual double standard . But beyond women who tried to reclaim \"slut\" for themselves, other feminists have rightfully asked why we should all try to reclaim a word with so much baggage - especially a word that impacts different women differently, and brings them a lot more pain than righteous justice . SlutWalks, for example, are no longer the cause celebre they once were because some women of color spoke out against the ways in which the protests and the reclamation of \"slut\" focused on the ability of white women to simultaneously embrace the word and reject its meaning . A group of black female academics, activists, and writers wrote an open letter explaining that \"as Black women, we do not have the privilege or the space to call ourselves 'slut' without validating the already historically entrenched ideology and recurring messages about what and who the Black woman is.\" Rutgers professor and writer Brittney Cooper wrote at the time,\"To organize a movement around the reclamation of a term is in and of itself an act of white privilege.\" In response, some SlutWalk organizers changed the name of their protests ; today , while a handful of SlutWalks remain , the excitement over the movement has waned noticeably . But women everywhere are still being actively, physically hurt by the stereotypes that lead people to call them \"sluts\" . Just look to the high profile deaths of young women who were slut-shamed and a mass shooting where the killer said he was targeting \"blonde sluts\" : we're still being targeted because of our identities and sexualities , and it has, perhaps appropriately, put a damper on the once-celebratory reclamation of the word . Maybe that the wounds inflicted by \"slut\"- and the culture that encourages people to define women that way - that we once hoped were superficial are just too raw and too deep . Maybe the speed of the internet is too fast for us to control a word with so much potential to damage . There' s a poster on my living room wall by artist Favianna Rodriguez that reads:\"I'm a Slut. I Vote. So Does Everyone I Sleep With. And You're About to be More Fucked Than I Am.\" For me, it captures the brash, in-your-face spirit that the feminist movement I've loved is known for . But in this time of unprecedented feminist power, the conversation about \"slut\" can be more reflective than fevered . Women who want to call themselves \"sluts\" shouldn't stop, or be made to stop - I love that women can embrace that which is meant to hurt them and find power in it . But I also know that we can still claim our sexuality and agency without using a word meant to denigrate- a word that still hurts so many people . Besides , we don't need \"slut\" to tell us what we already know: women have sex , some people don't like that and we're going to continue to do it anyway .", "output": "Like \"cunt\" and \"bitch\", many feminists have long tried to wrest away from its original users the power and harm of the word \"slut\" and to give it new meaning, , countless feminist debates over the reclamation of the word \"slut\" and, in 2011, thousands of women took to streets across the globe in anti-rape marches called SlutWalks - a reference to how victims of sexual assault are often blamed for the violence done to them", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

Lebanon has just done the apparently unthinkable and placed visa control on the entry of Syrians into the country . Before, the situation was effectively a free flow that had resulted in Syrians, mostly refugees, amounting today to 20 percent of the population on Lebanese soil . Imagine 12 million French in the UK today . The Lebanese government has assured international agencies that it will still permit and facilitate humanitarian cases , but the step is a telling one . The real story behind this is the annihilation of borders from Baghdad to Beirut . ISIL is one stark and ugly manifestation of that reality but so are the refugees, a tragic event that has also affected Turkey and Jordan . This zone that once facilitated trade is now closer to scenes from Road Warrior - or the sad march of the displaced . The disintegration of Sykes Picot has blurred nation-states as cross border allegiances fight it out on a series of fronts and through a myriad of forces from Jubhat al-Nusra, Shia militias, Peshmergas, to the Lebanese Armed forces to the now infamous ISIL . Borders don't seem to mean much in this Middle East , if they ever did . The refugees are the terrible consequence and victims of these conflicts that plague this area . The best response to them is not visas but a proper joint response by the Lebanese government assisted by international insititutions . The reality however is that the former is incapable , and the latter insufficiently funded to deal with such a massive influx . As a result, many refugees are living in terrible conditions . The other harsh reality is that the Lebanese government has said that this will not affect Syrian \"visitors\" to Lebanon . There are six classes of visitors in the new system and the Syrian middle class and rich are unlikley to be affected . Walid Jumblatt stated that his country should differentiate between \"refugees who are fleeing death and destruction in Syria after they lost their homes,\" and those who intend to be politically active , but the reality is that the poorest will be most affected . Indeed ,  it's a large question mark whether Lebanon has the capacity to even implement the measure it has just taken . The Syrian presence in Lebanon is so pervasive it may well be impossible to manage the situation, except to manage some future inflow . Furthermore ,  the idea of Lebanon, a country barely treading water, being able to manage such a problem is unrealistic . Only a regional and international effort of significance can manage such a scale , and regional powers are busy carving their fiefdoms and creating the very problem rather than solving it . The plight of the refugees is key but it is also important to perceive this event from the perspective of the host country; a small nation with very poor governance and infrastructure in the midst of regional turmoil . In a way, this is Lebanon's very small response to the erosion of Sykes Picot . Syrians are indeed everywhere in Lebanon . In Beirut, and in every village and town one visits . Flights from Beirut to Europe are one-third to half full of Syrians . Indeed ,  given this massive presence and Lebanon's already poor infrastructure and socio-economic state, it is an achievement that the Syrian crisis has not led to further deterioration in the country . The relations in Lebanon between the two peoples, despite some racism and ugly incidents, could have been far worse . Until now, Lebanese hosting of the refugees is characterised by neither generosity nor enmity, but by a passive acceptance of fate . This is partially driven by the fact that Syrians are culturally and linguistically akin , and some sectors of the Lebanese economy, e.g  construction, remain highly dependent on Syrian workers . How this will square with the new visa rules is unknown . More importantly, this step can be seen as part of a series of recent indirect actions that attempt to strengthen the Lebanese state, or at least make the pretense of doing so . Minister of Health Abu Faour has been on an intense and mediatic campaign to clean up the food industry in Lebanon, cracking down restaurants, slaughterhouses, and airport storage sites . Despite complaints, this clean up, if it lasts, is a welcome step for Lebanese ; it is national, potentially affects everyone positively, and is an act of government . Second ,  in an echo of the Nahr el-Bared campaign, the Lebanese army is taking responsibility in the Northern Bekaa and Hermel areas against the radical groups who are effectively fighting the Syrian war on Lebanese soil . Pride in the Lebanese army is rising . There are also rumours that the Lebanese government will also take on the murderous Indie-500 speeders on Lebanse highways in the spring . If this does occur in addition to bold step of visas for Syrians , a move that would have been unheard of when Lebanon was effectively a vassal state of Damascus, then indeed Lebanon could see the bare beginnings of emerging out of chaos through these small attempts . The political realities in Lebanon are of course more complicated and illusory than this . Many only see in all of the above feeble attempts to deflect from the reality of a total political vaccuum . Indeed , the Lebanese visa step is obviously not humanitarian , it is a self- interested attempt to stem the tide, put a thumb in the dyke, and avoid the emergent chaos in the Middle East . It would be better if the Lebanese had the magnamity, or much more importantly, the capacity , to continue simply receiving all Syrians , but they are barely running their own country . Compassion requires an orderly method and capacities in order to be effectively pursued , i.e the Lebanese need a functioning state of their own to handle such a crisis properly . Indeed ,  Lebanon has mostly escaped the wars next door not out of wisdom or discipline, or any energetic international diplomacy, but because the memories of that conflict are still vivid in the minds of Lebanese adults . No one will go to war because they remember what war costs , and because they know how little they derived from the devastation . The result of 15 years of fighting was that the state was further weakened in favour of sectarianism, cronyism and corruption , while the Lebanese kept on doing what they do best, make money and enjoy life, living for today and certainly not tomorrow . Meanwhile, social and environmental erosion make the country less and less livable by the day . The recent steps however, triggered by political challenges and health risks, signal some early and feeble attempts at a return of the state, or at the very least preserving the semblance of the old order, the shadow of a nation-state, amidst the dark fluidity and chaos surging from there to Kurdistan . It took the Lebanese 40 years and external pressures to begin to think about getting their house in order , if that is indeed what is happening today . Hopefully, it won't take their neighbours that long to start to address the necessary basics of life .", "output": "Lebanon has just done the apparently unthinkable and placed visa control on the entry of Syrians into the country", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}]
