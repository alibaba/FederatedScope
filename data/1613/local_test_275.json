The downfall is that the on earphone controls give you the option of being volume controls OR a pause play button. But not both. The big NO NO for me with these earbuds is that the bluetooth pairs with the right ear and from the right ear to the left, there is a delay in sound, which isn't too noticeable when just listening to music or taking phone calls, but is impossible to ignore when watching a video or making a video call. The sync is off by half a second and it makes videos nearly unwatchable.
