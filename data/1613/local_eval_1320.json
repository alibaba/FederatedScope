So all the travel documents including documents required for the USA Visa were collected and uploaded to the website. My brother is handing all this, and we've had to delay the Visa Interview Appointment once in May this year\u2026\n\nNow I've been travelling within India a lot this year\u2026 and have to travel again in July. My dad's not been feeling alright lately, so we've decided to plan this tour for next year\u2026 or only my brother and his wife will be going, we'll stay back this year. \n\nI'm planning to travel somewhere again within India next month, but the visa interview appointment is making me wait until post-15th July. I asked my brother why this interview cannot be delayed, he said money will be charged if we delay the interview again. Previously also I had requested a delay, and he replied the same thing. And still it was delayed, due to my father's health. I'm trying to convince him to delay the interview until October this year, but he's keen on getting the visa before that. \n\nMy question is: If only my brother and his wife are going to the USA, is it necessary for me to apply for a visa too? I'm an Indian resident, and maybe they ask questions like \"Whole Family WAS going? Why now only you two are going?\" due to which, I'm being told, the visa can be denied. \nAlso, Can I opt of out this Interview? I don't want the visa this year\u2026 It'll be raining there in USA until October, after which it'll be snowing\u2026 I was thinking of writing a opt out email to the embassy, but guess that's not a good idea. \n\nCould anyone suggest of what I could do to avoid wasting my time for an interview which for sure is again going to be delayed. I'm only asking if I can opt out, without interfering with my brother's visa approval.\n", "output": "Whom to contact for opting out of a Visa Interview for USA?", "category": "Question Generation 735.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a travel related situation, and given a specific question about the situation, summarize the question into a title", "input": "I happened to be looking at a flight from yesterday (as writing) which was drastically delayed...\n\nhttps://flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL48 (choose \"Sept 2\")\n\nNow, on the many excellent flight info sites, you can quickly determine if a flight is delayed.\n\nBut - is there a way to find out WHY that flight was delayed?\n\nThis becomes quite critical if you're on the same flight the next day!\n\n(Indeed for that specific flight, I notice the next day's one is unfortunately already marked as going to be delayed many hours; now I wonder about the next day.)\n\nIf you can know why a delay happened, it would surely be useful info if you're on the following versions of a flight.\n\nIs there a way to do this?\n\n(Often if you just \"call the airline and ask\", the staff in reservations often really don't know specifically.)\n\n\n\nThe sense of my question is, \"If you're on one of the next flights of that flight number, to try to find what the heck is going on...!\"\n", "output": "Find what caused a current big flight delay?", "category": "Question Generation 735.json"}]
