Darn. There goes my approach. This Harvard M.B.A. and New York Times best-selling author advocates a better way -- being proactive and approaching your dating life like a job search. Sure, there has to be an intersection of luck, timing, and opportunity, to find love,\" she says, \"But you increase your odds when you do something about it. If you have a strategic organized plan, something will come through faster.\" So, uh, what should this plan be? Her new book, \"Have Him at Hello: Confessions from 1,000 Guys About What Makes Them Fall in Love ... Or Never Call Back,\" just hit bookstores and has some ingenious ideas for us. I had the opportunity to chat with Rachel and get a singles state of the union. Here's eight interesting tips I learned. The Frisky: Online dating is making me depressed . 1. The \"no effort mentality\" is crazy. We are officially the instant gratification dating generation. If love doesn't happen instantly, we're out of there. But anything worth having takes work. Rachel points out that we are willing to put effort into other things in our lives -- our careers, our friendships, our hobbies, our living space --but we expect our love lives to come effortlessly. \"You wouldn't expect to be a CEO in five seconds,\" Rachel points out. 2. It takes a village to find Mr. or Mrs. Right. An important step in working on your love life is letting people know that you're looking. A lot of us are embarrassed to reach out for help when it comes to finding love. We think it seems desperate to admit that we would like to find someone to spend the rest of our lives with. I'm totally not talking about myself, by the way. \"The stigma is all in your head,\" says Rachel. \"That's like someone saying 'I'm unemployed but too embarrassed to find a job.'\" Rachel suggests thinking of all the people in our lives as possible networking opportunities. The Frisky: I slept with your husband and here's why . 3. Stop asking \"Where?\" Ask \"How?\" Asking a friend, co-worker, family member, or acquaintance where you can meet a great guy is a dead-end question. When you mention in casual conversation to your \"village\" that you are looking to meet someone this year, ask \"how.\" That way you are enlisting them in your search. \"How?\" is a far more proactive and empowering question. It implies suggestions and solutions. 4. Get online. There's no stigma about dating online anymore -- one-fourth of the people who got married last year met online. So, if you don't already have a rocking online profile ... make one. But Rachel also recommends Twitter as an alternative source. \"Why not throw a Twitter party?\" she suggests. \"Send out a tweet to your friends and tell them that you're having happy hour drinks on Friday at your favorite bar. Tell them to bring friends.\" Rachel's also a big fan of Meetup.com. \"It's much more sophisticated then it was a few years ago,\" she says. You can search something like \"Singles, New York, film lovers,\" and find groups that meet in your area. You can even click through the groups and see mini-profiles and pictures of the members. 5. Don't forget about Facebook! One-third of married people met through introductions by friends. Following that logic, Facebook may be our single most underused resource. \"Treat Facebook like an online dating profile,\" says Rachel. \"Take it seriously. If a guy sees a bad photo of you on Facebook or weird things on your profile, he may not give you a chance.\" Rachel suggests crafting the image you want to project on Facebook. \"Pick five words that represent you and make sure your Facebook profile reflects those five words,\" she says. Once you're satisfied with your profile, she suggested playing a game she calls \"I Spy a Facebook Guy.\" Here's how it works: Give yourself 10 days to cruise around your friends' Facebook pages and find 50 guys that you think are interesting. Then scope out their profiles and write them a message. Hey, you already know someone in common. 6. Married people are a great resource. They know a thing or two about relationships, but more importantly, they know other single people who are marriage-minded. Plus, they're much more eager to see you settle down than your single friends. The Frisky: Why women should ask men out on dates . 7. You may have tried it all, but have you tried it well? Trying something once or twice isn't enough. \"Doing online dating with a bad profile picture or going to a singles event and leaving after you scanned the room once is like looking for a job with a poorly written resume or applying for a sales job [when] you're an accountant,\" says Rachel. Instead, take a look at what you've been trying and how, and think of ways to do it better. 8. It's OK to outsource. How do we know what we're doing wrong in our dating lives? Rachel says that there's no shame in hiring a dating coach. Hey, we have personal trainers, therapists, and head hunters. Outsourcing is part of our culture -- yet we feel we can tackle the dating thing on our own. Why? OK, I'm sold. I will definitely be trying out some of this advice.

That's the lowest number ever recorded for that question in a CNN survey. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, released Tuesday, indicates that only 34 percent feel that current federal lawmakers deserve re-election, with 63 percent saying no. According to the survey, 51 percent feel their own member of Congress should be re-elected -- also an all-time low in CNN polling -- while 44 percent say their representative doesn't deserve to be returned to office in November. Full poll results (PDF) The numbers on both questions are even lower than in 1994, when an anti-incumbent fever helped Republicans win back control of both the House and the Senate from Democrats. The trend line on those questions goes back to 1991, when they were first asked. \"This is not a good year to be an incumbent, regardless of which party you belong to,\" said CNN polling director Keating Holland. \"Voters seem equally angry at both Republicans and Democrats this year.\" Fifty-six percent of people questioned in the survey say that most Democrats in Congress do not deserve to be re-elected. An equal percentage say that most congressional Republicans don't deserve re-election. The poll suggests Americans are split when it comes to their vote this November, with 47 percent of registered voters saying they will support the Republican candidate in their district for the House of Representatives and 45 percent saying they will back the Democrat. Republicans trailed the Democrats by 6 points in November. The voters' cool view of incumbents of both parties \"may hurt the Democrats more because there are more Democratic incumbents,\" Holland said. \"It's a change from 2006, when voters concentrated their anger at GOP members of Congress.\" The generic ballot question asked respondents if they would vote for a Democrat or Republican in their congressional district, without naming any specific candidates. The Democrats currently hold a 255-178 advantage in the House, with two vacant seats that the Democrats once held. Republicans need to win 40 seats to take back control of the chamber. While President Obama is not up for re-election this November, he will be in 2012, if he decides to run for a second term. According to the poll, 44 percent of registered voters say Obama deserves re-election, with 52 percent saying the president does not deserve a second term in office. The survey also indicates that 49 percent of Americans approve of the job Obama's doing as president, with half of the public disapproving of his job in the White House. \"One problem Obama faces may be the perception that Obama is not a middle-class kind of guy,\" Holland said. \"Only 4 percent of Americans describe themselves as upper class. But a 45 percent plurality say that Obama belongs to the upper class, with 42 percent saying he is from the middle class and 12 percent describing him as working class.\" The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted Friday through Monday, with 1,023 adult Americans, including 954 registered voters, questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points both for all Americans and for registered voters.

Franz Beckenbauer, a member of FIFA's executive committee, criticized football's governing body after the amount of votes each bidder received was made public. Beckenbauer was one of the 22 FIFA members who voted in the process and claims he was assured that the details would remain private. Yet soon after it was announced that Russia had won the right to host the 2018 competition, and Qatar had secured the 2022 version, media were reporting that two of the favorites, England and Australia, attracted just two votes and one vote respectively. It led to an angry reaction from representatives of the England and Australia bid teams and Beckenbauer acknowledges his faith in FIFA has been shaken as a result. \"I am disappointed with the way FIFA dealt with the result. The seven losing countries were treated disgracefully, particularly England and Australia, Beckenbauer told German newspaper Bild. \"All of us ExCo members were told ahead of the ballot that neither we nor the public would ever know the exact number of votes for each country. After each round of voting we were told only which country had been ruled out. \"Then, a few hours later, I was hearing from journalists what the exact voting had been. It's certainly affected my confidence in FIFA.\" England were particularly vociferous in their criticism of FIFA and claimed several committee members promised them votes that didn't materialize. Ron Walker, a member of the Australian Football Federation, claimed the voting process had been \"contaminated\" in the year leading up to the announcement on December 2. Beckenbauer was instrumental in taking the World Cup to Germany in 2006 having won the tournament as a player in 1974 and as a coach in 1990.

A Chinese aircraft took off at 6:20 a.m. local time (6:20 p.m. ET). Other aircraft, including a South Korean P-3 Orion and a U.S. P-8 Poseidon, were preparing to depart from Perth. Ten planes will fly over 123,167 square miles (319,000 square kilometers) located about 1,150 miles (1,850 kilometers) west of Perth, the AMSA said. Weather in the search area is forecast to worsen with light showers and low clouds, though search operations are expected to continue, the authority said. Eight ships will join the search by the end of the day, including the Australian Ocean Shield, which will be fitted with a \"black box\" detector and an autonomous underwater vehicle, AMSA said. All ships will seek to locate and identify objects sighted by aircraft over the past two days. Search experts said the clock is ticking. Michael Kay, a former adviser to the UK Ministry of Defence, said on CNN that the batteries on the flight data recorder, sometimes called the black box, are designed to last only about 30 days. The plane disappeared March 8 -- three weeks ago. Eight planes and a number of ships scoured some 97,000 square miles of water Saturday for signs of the plane, with aircraft reporting sightings of objects similar to those reported Friday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. Two vessels -- one of them a Chinese warship -- retrieved objects, \"but so far no objects confirmed to be related to MH370 have been recovered,\" the authority said. Crew members aboard a Chinese plane dropped buoys to mark three suspected debris sites, China's state-run CCTV reported. \"After entering the search area, the airlifter flew for about 20 minutes,\" crew member Wang Zhenwu told the television network. \"We found an L-shaped debris in orange color right below the plane's right wing. Then within around three minutes, we found a stripe-shaped object. We immediately reported our findings to the captain.\" The captain, Liu Jun, said buoys containing dye were dropped on each of the suspected sites, according to CCTV. Relatives complaining . Relatives of the 239 people on board the plane have complained about receiving mixed messages. Earlier this week, they heard this: \"All lives are lost.\" But Saturday, a Malaysian official met with relatives and then told reporters he had not closed the door on the hope of relatives that survivors may exist among the 239 people aboard the Boeing 777-200 ER that went missing March 8. \"Even hoping against hope, no matter how remote, of course, we are praying and we will continue our search for the possible survivors,\" said Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's acting transportation minister. \"More than that, I told the families I cannot give them false hope. The best we can do is pray and that we must be sensitive to them that, as long as there is even a remote chance of a survivor, we will pray and do whatever it takes.\" Chinese relatives in Kuala Lumpur told CNN that Malaysian authorities are restricting their movement and access to information . When a briefing for them was not held Saturday, the Chinese relatives said they were deterred from attending a briefing for Maylasian relatives. They ended up talking to a Malaysia Airlines official after the briefing. 'They're still alive' In Beijing on Saturday, some of the relatives of the missing vented their anguish in the streets. \"They're all still alive, my son and everyone on board!\" yelled Wen Wancheng, 63, whose only son was among the passengers. \"The plane is still there, too! They're hiding it.\" He held aloft a banner that read: \"Son, mom and dad's hearts are torn to pieces. Come home soon!\" Many relatives doubtless remember the speculation from early in the search that the plane may have landed somewhere. They implored Hishammuddin to redouble the efforts, and he said Malaysian authorities would do so. \"What they want is a commitment on our part to continue the search, and that I have given,\" Hishammuddin said. \"For me, as the minister responsible, this is the hardest part of my life, at the moment,\" he told reporters. \"Miracles do happen, remote or otherwise, and that is the hope that the families want me to convey -- not only to the Malaysian government, MAS (Malaysia Airlines), but also to the world at large,\" he said. He said the effort was still to find survivors. Sea objects . On Saturday that meant hunting again for plane debris in an ocean awash in debris -- including odds and ends from passing ships -- in hopes that among it are pieces of the jet. After the latest data analysis, experts says they believe that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared three weeks ago, ended up in the southern Indian Ocean. Investigators concluded this week that, during the flight's initial phase, the plane was traveling faster -- and therefore burning fuel faster -- than they had thought. Authorities have concluded that it could not have traveled as far south as they had thought earlier. The new search area is 1,100 kilometers (680 miles) northeast of the previous one and closer to Australia's coast, so it's easier to reach. It's also marked by calmer waters. Ships plowed the waters of the search area and eight planes searched from above. \"Unfortunately, we didn't find anything of significance out there,\" flight captain Russell Adams said after returning to Perth. Malaysia plane saga: Your questions answered . Pieces of debris spotted Friday were hundreds of miles away from each other, but given the ocean conditions and the time passed since the airplane's purported crash, they could be part of the same object. Friday's sightings included 11 small objects spotted by a military P-3 plane. CNN's Kyung Lah, who went out on a U.S. Navy P-8 search plane Friday, said its crew spotted white objects, orange rope and a blue bag. \"At one point, sure, everybody on board got a little excited, but it's impossible to tell from that distance what anything is,\" she said. If and when the jet is found, the key question would remain: Why did it go down? That may not be answered until investigators retrieve the aircraft and try, literally, to piece together what happened to it. Vast, shifting search . The shifting hunt for Flight 370 has spanned vast bodies of water and continents. It started in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam, where the plane went out of contact with air traffic controllers. When authorities learned of radar data suggesting the plane had turned westward across the Malay Peninsula after losing contact, they expanded the search into the Strait of Malacca. When those efforts proved fruitless, the search spread north into the Andaman Sea and northern Indian Ocean. It then ballooned dramatically after Malaysia announced March 15 that satellite data showed the plane could have flown along either of two huge arcs, one stretching northwest into the Asian land mass, the other southwest into the Indian Ocean. The search area at that point reached nearly 3 million square miles. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that further analysis of the data led authorities to conclude the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean, far from land. Malaysian officials then told the families of those on board that nobody would have survived. On Saturday, after confronting relatives' grief, they made that conclusion seem less final.

And more than half of those attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates, an international maritime watchdog group said Wednesday. The increase in attacks has forced many countries to patrol pirate hotspots such as the Gulf of Aden. \"The increased activity in Somalia is the major reason for the spike,\" said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes. From January 1 until September 30, pirates worldwide mounted 306 attacks, compared with 293 in all of 2008, the Bureau said. Of the incidents this year, Somali pirates accounted for 54 percent: they launched 168 attacks. Most of them took place off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia. They successfully hijacked 32 vessels and took 533 hostages. Eight others were wounded, four more killed and one is missing, the Bureau said. Somali pirates are still holding four ships for ransom with 80 crew members as hostages. Somalia's transitional government, which has a tenuous grip on power, has been unable to stop the pirates -- many of whom are based in the port cities. This has prompted Europe and other Western countries to step up maritime patrols. \"In the Gulf of Aden, the number of attacks have gone up. But because of the presence of naval vessels, the success rate of the pirates have decreased,\" Mody said. \"The navies are responding very very effectively.\" Today's pirates are a far cry from the eye-patched, peg-legged swashbucklers of Hollywood. They don night-vision goggles, carry rocket launchers and navigate with global positioning devices. Many pirates are trained fighters; others are young thugs enlisted for the job. Experts say they often sail out to sea in a mother ship and wait for a target. When they find one, the pirates board smaller boats and move in, typically with five to seven armed hijackers per boat. Two recent trends have led to a rise in piracy: access and opportunity. As global commerce picks up, more and more of the world's fuels, minerals and other crucial commodities travel by ship. Ninety-five percent of America's foreign trade, for instance, moves by water, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. That cargo is an easy target for robbers in countries that lack the resources to secure their shorelines, such as Somalia. Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in Somalia in the 1980s, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast. Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms. Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. With the ransoms they collect, pirates can earn up to $40,000 a year, analysts say. That's a fortune for someone from an impoverished country. Some analysts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the piracies. \"Yes, the ransoms have probably caused the piracy to become a bit more rampant. But at the same time, from the owner's point of view, there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo,\" Mody said. \"It's basically a cycle.\" Other trouble spots this year were waters off Nigeria, with 20 attacks; Malaysia with 14; and Bangladesh with 12.", "output": "Somali pirates accounted for 54 percent of all attacks this year .\nMost of them took place off east coast of Somalia and in Gulf of Aden .\nSomali pirates are still holding four ships for ransom .\nOther trouble spots were waters off Nigeria, Malaysia and Bangladesh .", "category": "Summarization 648.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given news articles and you need to generate a highlight, i.e., a short summary, with a maximum length of 10 lines.", "input": "Hong Kong (CNN)A daring cross-border raid by one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's associates has -- so far -- yet to sour Sino-Russian relations. According to Chinese state media, Ustin, one of three rescued  Amur tigers released by the Russian leader earlier this year, has attacked a herd of goats on Heixiazi Island in the northern province of Heilongjiang. The region shares a border with Russia's far-eastern Amur region, and it is thought that the tiger crossed the Heilongjiang river to hunt. Russian conservationists rescued five cubs in 2012, and the Russian president was on hand for their release following rehabilitation and hunting training. The animals were fitted with tracking devices and in October, Ustin, along with another released tiger, Kuzya, were found to have made their way to China. A wildlife protection expert from China's Northeast Forestry University, Zhu Shibing, said that footprints and other traces left near the goat's shelter belonged to Ustin. Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that the skulls of the two dead goats were crushed and had puncture wounds the \"size of a human finger\" -- a testament to the power of the tiger's bite. Three further goats remain missing. \"Our monitoring data and this attack all tell that Ustin is in good physical condition, and has a large range of activities on Heixiazi Island,\" Xinhua quoted Zhu as saying. He also warned villagers to keep their distance, should they spot the goat killer, and to not throw food at it. Kuzya, the other tiger known to have crossed into China, was previously blamed for an attack on a Chinese hen-house. The Russian leader has been involved in conservation efforts of the species. He is often photographed with tigers and other wild animals, and takes part in a number of outdoor activities in an apparent effort to bolster his image as a strong, intrepid leader.

Last week, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other politicians expressed concern over the costs and disruption of holding the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four accomplices at a New York City courthouse. David Axelrod, the senior adviser to President Obama, and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday that Obama believes the trial should take place in a criminal court instead of before a military commission, as permitted for some terrorism suspects. However, Axelrod and Gibbs acknowledged that Obama and the Justice Department were considering moving the trial from New York City. \"We've made no decisions on that yet,\" Axelrod said on the NBC program \"Meet the Press.\" Gibbs, speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" also said the location of the trial was under discussion, but he expressed certainty that Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks, \"is going to meet justice and he's going to meet his maker.\" Gibbs and Axelrod criticized Republican opposition to the plan to hold the trial in a criminal court, saying no one complained when the previous administration of Republican President George W. Bush put terrorism suspects such as \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid on trial in U.S. criminal courts. \"Now we have a Democratic president and suddenly we hear these protests,\" Axelrod said. \"What has changed between now and then that would cause people to reverse positions?\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told the CNN program that the Bush administration was wrong to hold terrorism trials on U.S. soil. Instead, trials for dangerous terrorism suspects should be held by military commissions at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility where they currently are held, McConnell said. Obama intends to shut down the Guantanamo facility by transferring the roughly 200 suspects to the United States to stand trial or face indefinite detention, or to third countries. McConnell said Sunday he would fight that plan by trying to withhold federal spending for it. \"'I think that will be done on a bipartisan basis,\" McConnell said of congressional opposition, adding that \"whatever domestic support they had for this is totally collapsing.\" White House officials say the decision about any possible alternate sites to try Mohammed and the others will come from the Justice Department. New York police estimated that the cost to the city would be more than $200 million per year in what could be a multi-year trial and that more than 2,000 checkpoints would need to be installed around Lower Manhattan. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said additional protection would have to be deployed for the city, not just \"the core area of Manhattan.\" Bloomberg initially supported the move, saying \"it is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the World Trade Center site where so many New Yorkers were murdered.\" However, Bloomberg used different rhetoric last week when asked about a community agency's proposals to relocate the trial, saying he would prefer the trial be held elsewhere, perhaps at a military base where it would be easier and cheaper to provide security. \"It's going to cost an awful lot of money and disturb a lot of people,\" Bloomberg said. On Thursday, several New York Democratic politicians urged the Obama administration to thoroughly re-examine locating the trial in downtown Manhattan. Julie Menin, chairwoman of a city community advisory agency, proposed four alternative locations for the trial within the Southern District of New York: Governors Island, Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the Bureau of Prisons jail complex at FCI Otisville. The latter three are in Orange County, New York, less than an hour from New York City, county executive Edward Diana told CNN. Diana thinks the trials should not be held anywhere in New York, and definitely not in Orange County, which lost 44 residents in the terror attacks, he said. \"I've contacted my legal department and I'll tell you I'll do whatever it takes to stop those trials from coming here, even if it means closing down our roads,\" Diana said. \"I'll sue the federal government if need be.\" Diana said he'd be worried about the safety of Orange County residents if the trial comes there. Diana, who shot down an offer from Newburgh to host the proceedings in their new courthouse, said the suspects should not be tried in civilian courts. But Newburgh Mayor Nick Valentine said the boost in media presence and police funding during the trial would help his \"very poor, very urban\" city. Newburgh's new $22 million courthouse is safe and has \"every security you could want,\" Valentine said. An alternate proposal at the West Point location has not been fully reviewed. A West Point spokesman said no one has officially requested a review of demands for such a trial, which would require in-depth study of legal and security concerns. U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Dean Boyd said the Justice Department \"can safely prosecute this case in the Southern District of New York while minimizing disruptions to the community to the greatest extent possible, consistent with security needs.\" New York Gov.

It is a case of international naval intrigue off the Swedish coast that brings back memories of the Cold War. The Swedish military on Monday intensified a search in the ocean off Stockholm for an underwater mystery vessel, but stopped short of calling it a submarine. Civilian vessels were ordered to stay at least six miles (about 10 kilometers) away from the Swedish warship conducting the search, the English-language website The Local reported. The search began Thursday after Swedish intelligence picked up an emergency radio call in Russian, reported The Local, citing the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. The radio transmissions were being sent to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, 330 miles (530 kilometers) south of Stockholm on the Baltic's southern shore, according to The Local report. There were also reports that a foreign vessel was spotted in the waters near Stockholm. Russia on Sunday denied it has any vessel in Swedish waters. Moscow suggested the vessel may belong to the Netherlands and have been involved in naval exercises off Sweden, according to a report from Russia's Itar-TASS news agency. The Dutch were quick to respond, saying a sub involved in the exercises was anchored in Tallinn harbor of NATO-ally Estonia for the weekend, according to a report from Agence France-Presse. 'We have good stamina' On Monday, the Swedish military vowed to continue searching at least for the next few days, according to The Local. \"We have good stamina,\" The Local quoted defense spokesman Dag Enander. \"We're using the sensors we have and are searching both from land and water,\" Enander was quoted as saying. To confuse matters even more, the Swedish military said Monday that it purposely provided incorrect information on Sunday about where the mystery vessel was sighted to keep the search area secure. U.S. officials told CNN there are no U.S. submarines or surface ships in the immediate area. U.S. intelligence doesn't know of any Russian assets in that area, the officials said. All the activity begs the question, why would a Russian sub need to snoop around in Swedish waters anyway? Johan Wiktorin of the Swedish Royal Academy of War Sciences gave three possibilities to The Local: . \"They could be mapping the waters in order to be able to navigate them in the event of hostilities,\" Wiktorin is quoted as saying. \"They could also be installing equipment, like sensors, that could track or get an observation of our units in that area,\" he goes on. \"Or they could also possibly reconnoiter our (defense) systems.\" Russian military around the world . Whether there is a Russian sub in Swedish waters or not, there is no question that Russian forces have been active in the Baltic and around the globe this year. In fact, the Swedish military said Sunday that it has monitored suspicious activity for several years, according to another report in The Local. In July, a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance plane fled into Swedish airspace after the Russians took the unusual action of beginning to track it with land-based radar. The Russians then sent at least one fighter jet into the sky to intercept the U.S. aircraft. And on April 23, a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet buzzed within 100 feet of the nose of a U.S. Air Force RC-135U reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan, a Defense Department official said. Also on April 23, Dutch fighter jets scrambled to intercept a pair of Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers that entered a half-mile into Netherlands airspace. On June 4, according to U.S. defense officials, four long-range Russian Tu-95 bombers, accompanied by an aerial refueling tanker, flew into the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone, an area extending 200 miles (320 kilometers) from the North American coast, off Alaska, where they were intercepted by U.S. F-22 fighter jets. Two of the Russian bombers peeled off and headed west, while the other two flew south and were identified by U.S. F-15 fighters within 50 miles of the California coast. And last month, two Alaskan-based U.S. Air Force F-22 fighter jets intercepted two Russian IL-78 refueling tankers, two Russian MiG-31 fighter jets and two Russian Bear long-range bombers, according to Capt. Jeff Davis of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. More than six hours later, two Canadian CF-18 fighter jets intercepted two Russian bombers in the Beaufort Sea, Davis said. Those Russian planes came within about 40 nautical miles of the Canadian coastline, he said. Earlier this year, a top U.S. Air Force general said Russia was stepping up its military activities in the Asia-Pacific region as tensions increased over Ukraine and Russia's move into Crimea.", "output": "Emergency radio call picked up by Swedish military, report says .\nRadio transmissions sent to Russian enclave on Baltic Sea, report says .\nRussia denies any vessel in Swedish waters .\nRussian military has been active around world this year .", "category": "Summarization 648.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given news articles and you need to generate a highlight, i.e., a short summary, with a maximum length of 10 lines.", "input": "(CNN) -- \"These types of patients have such disfigurement beforehand they can't eat, they can't breathe properly. It's about functionality,\" says Dr. Richard Luskin, CEO of the New England Organ Bank. Luskin is referring to the small group of people worldwide who are on waiting lists in hope of a new face, and in the United States at least, they may now have one donated to them more readily. Last month the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS), a non-profit organization managing the U.S. organ transplant system, approved the first national policies for the transplantation of limbs, faces and other structures collectively known as \"vascularized composite allografts\" (VCAs) -- which should make it easier to find donors. As of April 2014, there had been 28 face transplants across the world. Animal attacks, severe burns and gunshot wounds had left these recipients scarred for life, literally, in the one place their scars cannot be hidden -- their face. \"Anyone with this disfigurement would argue they're not living, they're surviving,\" says Luskin. Face transplant recipients: New findings . A growing field . The first face transplant was performed in France in 2005 on Isabelle Dinoire, whose mouth, nose and chin had been chewed away by her dog. Since then the field has grown and transplants involving varying combinations of facial parts have been performed in six other countries, including the United States. As the procedures improve and their safety grows, donor registries and collaborating hospitals will increasingly be asking the question: Would you like to donate your face? Or in the case of the UNOS approval, asking family members of potential donors the sensitive question of whether they will donate the face of their loved one. The UNOS approval will initially be in place temporarily for 15 months to enable public comment, but families of donors will receive extra guidance when it comes to making the decision. \"Face transplants remain unique and require very specific criteria such as hairlines and ethnic components,\" explains a UNOS spokesperson. \"Therefore consent should be distinct and individual.\" \"(This) will broaden the donor pool for wait-listed patients across a number of regional and national organ procurement organizations,\" explains Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, professor of reconstructive plastic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"A major component for a successful procedure is patient selection on both the recipient and donor,\" he adds. \"The likeliness of a perfect match can be very challenging.\" But this once-experimental procedure is becoming more widespread and accepted. Richard Norris, from Virginia, received a new face in March 2012 and last month his face was featured on the cover of the U.S. edition of men's magazine GQ. Norris lost most of his facial features after a gun blast, and lost abilities such as his sense of smell. But after surgery at the hands of Rodriguez and his team he can live his life once again. Face transplant patients: Where are they now? Risk of rejection . However, as this mode of surgery becomes a norm, the side effects and risks that come with the life-changing operation are still a concern and a question of ethics. Like any other transplant, there is a risk of the new organ being rejected by the patient's immune system and recipients have to take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives, putting them at risk of infections and cancer. But unlike many other transplants, replacing a face is not a matter of life and death. The surgery is classed by some as life-changing, not life-saving, which raises questions as to whether this risk is justified. \"For heart transplant patients they need a transplant or they will die. These (face transplant) patients are not in organ failure but are having to take anti-rejection medication and have lifelong repression,\" explains Dr. Maria Siemionow, from the University of Illinois, who performed a near-total face transplant in 2008 on American Connie Culp, who was shot in the face by her husband. But Siemionow is working to solve this problem. \"We need new therapies which will be less harmful,\" she says. The Polish surgeon is developing chimeric cells, which bring together the cells from a donor and the recipient during transplantation. \"We are fusing together cells from the bone marrow of donors and recipients so these cells will be recognized by the recipient's immune systems as their own,\" she explains. Not an easy task. By combining the two cells and delivering them into patients receiving a transplant, their immune system will learn to recognize the donor's cells, which are present throughout their new face, making their immune cells less likely to attack the face. \"If the (immune system) can recognize more cells as 'self' the patient will need less anti-rejection drugs,\" says Siemionow, whose experimental therapy is hoped to enter clinical trials in a few years and when it does, may make face transplants more acceptable to critics. \"Immunosupression is the main ethical concern and new therapies are crucial for the future of this field,\" she says. Luskin feels the benefits of a new face counter ethical doubts. \"There is no ethical issue,\" he concludes. \"I saw a patient walking down a crowded hospital hall a few years after surgery and no-one noticed them. He looked like a normal guy. To me, that's the point of these surgeries.\"", "output": "The first face transplant was performed in France in 2005 .\nU.S. has approved policies that will make it easier to find donors .\nScientists are developing techniques that will reduce risk of transplant rejection .", "category": "Summarization 648.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given news articles and you need to generate a highlight, i.e., a short summary, with a maximum length of 10 lines.", "input": "(CNN) -- Hating the Internal Revenue Service is an American pastime that transcends political affiliation. This past May, disgust for the IRS reached an all-time high when Lois Lerner, director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations unit, disclosed the agency had improperly targeted social welfare organizations seeking special status under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code based on their political ideology. This revelation resulted in more than three months (and counting) of congressional hearings and investigations. Read the IRS inspector general's report on targeting . But in typical Washington fashion, the manufactured congressional outrage and grandstanding has served to do little more than obfuscate the real scandal at the IRS: that the agency allows social welfare organizations to manipulate federal tax law by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on political ads. Anyone who watched television in the lead-up to the 2010 and 2012 elections undoubtedly noticed the slew of vitriolic, misleading campaign ads. Some of these ads were sponsored by federal candidates, but many more were produced by groups with innocuous sounding names -- such as Crossroads GPS or the American Action Network -- but massive bank accounts. Crossroads GPS, for example, a nonprofit organization cofounded by former George W. Bush administration official Karl Rove, spent more than $70 million on the 2012 election. Like the groups targeted by the IRS, Crossroads GPS is a section 501(c)(4) organization, which affords certain tax benefits and -- most importantly -- the ability to keep the names of donors secret. Federal law requires these groups to operate \"exclusively for purposes beneficial to the community as a whole.\" IRS regulations, however, create a loophole in the law by allowing groups \"primarily\" engaged in these types of activities to benefit from this tax status. Many 501(c)(4) groups have interpreted this regulation to mean they can spend up to 49% of their funds on political activities -- mostly negative, deceptive political ads. Adding to the confusion, the IRS has said there is no specific percentage the agency uses to gauge whether a group has engaged \"primarily\" in social welfare activities, but rather that it considers all facts and circumstances. What does that mean exactly? No one knows. When directly confronted about the problem and the agency's record of inaction, the IRS has said only that it is \"aware\" of the issue. But the IRS has been aware of and has chosen to ignore this problem for more than 50 years. If the agency had revised its regulations at any point in the past as my organization and others requested, the agency might have avoided the quagmire in which it is drowning. Frustrated with the IRS's inaction, in May CREW filed a lawsuit against the IRS for flouting the law barring 501(c)(4) organizations from engaging in political activity. The case is pending in District of Columbia district court. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and other public interest groups filed a similar lawsuit last month. Because social welfare organizations are not required to disclose their donors, 501(c)(4) groups have become the de facto vehicle for millionaires, billionaires, and even corporations who want to remain anonymous while influencing our elections. As a result, politically active nonprofit groups spent more than $300 million on the 2012 election. Americans should not only be outraged that our elections are being flooded with anonymous cash, but because of the nonprofit status of these groups, taxpayers are subsidizing their activity. With more and more groups seeking to participate in federal elections using money raised from donors who want to remain anonymous, applications to the IRS for 501(c)(4) status more than doubled between 2010 and 2012. To manage the deluge, Lerner said the agency relied on code words and other shortcuts to single groups out for extra review. While the scrutiny of tea party groups has received the most attention, the IRS \"Be on the Look Out\" (BOLO) list also included the words \"progressive,\" \"occupy,\" and \"Israel.\" Flagging any group for further screening because their applications included specific words or phrases was wrong. The impact, however, of such misguided actions on our democracy was negligible, particularly compared to that wrought by the IRS's failure to stop hundreds of millions of dollars from flooding our electoral system to influence our votes. For all of the abuse heaped upon the IRS and for all the concern about the BOLO list, the same thing could happen again if the disparity between the language of the statute and regulation is not addressed. Agents processing applications of groups seeking social welfare status in the future will remain as confused about the standards as those whose decisions have been questioned this year. Nevertheless, Congress has shown no appetite to pass legislation clarifying the requirements for these nonprofit groups. As the 2014 election cycle gets under way, the super rich and corporations with deep coffers will continue to buy our elections, and Congress will continue to spend time and resources on a never-ending cycle of investigations into a problem with a fairly easy solution: as Congress intended when it first passed the law, prohibit 501(c)(4) organizations from spending money on anything other than social welfare activities. As long as members of Congress do nothing other than one-up each other's disdain for the IRS, nothing will change. And that really is a scandal. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.
