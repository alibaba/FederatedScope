It comes after Momentum increased its hold on Labour's executive committee. Some critics in the party said it was a sign it was run by a \"leftist clique\". Blackadder star and Labour member Sir Tony Robinson accused supporters of Mr Corbyn of \"undermining\" Ms Black, whom he described as \"a radical voice for ordinary members on the NEC with an awesome work rate\". But a Momentum source said there had been widespread frustration with Ms Black and that trade unionists and shadow cabinet members had also voted to replace her. Ms Shawcroft has been a Labour member for 20 years, holding several officer roles within the party. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Elections to rather obscure internal Labour committees rarely make the headlines. But people who describe themselves as moderates are arguing that Momentum has now increased its grip on the party's levers of power. And they say it's significant that the group has moved against someone who is regarded as being on the left, not the right, of the party. The disputes panel had been chaired by Ann Black - who was popular with many at the grassroots. But she had upset some in Momentum when she'd backed rules which would have made it harder for newer members to get a vote in the last Labour leadership election. They believed this favoured Jeremy Corbyn's opponent. Momentum sources argue that they could not have changed the chair of the disputes panel without the backing of key shadow cabinet and union members, too. Momentum was formed from Mr Corbyn's successful Labour leadership campaign and has since become a major player in the direction of the party. On Monday its founder, Jon Lansman, was among three new members voted on to the ruling National Executive Committee. As Labour's supreme decision-making committee, the NEC plays a key role in the overall direction of the party as well as helping set the rules for leadership contests.", "output": "Momentum's Christine Shawcroft voted on to Labour disputes panel", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

An eruv is a symbolic boundary that allows orthodox religious Jews to carry or push certain items outside of their homes on the Sabbath. Planning of the eruv, which has taken 10 years, has cost \u00a3350,000. Under Jewish law (Torah), it is forbidden to carry everyday items such as reading glasses or house keys or push a wheelchair or pushchair between sundown on Friday and sundown on Saturday. These are allowed within an eruv although carrying money or a mobile phone or going to shops, the cinema or taking part in sport are still prohibited. 'Major difference' Organisers said the Manchester eruv is \"the largest in the country\" and will enhance the observance of Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest. \"It is going to make a major difference to the life of very many people including people wheeling children,\" said Rabbi Yahuda Brodie, chief executive of the Manchester Beth Din. \"Mothers with young children for example find it very difficult to get out of the home on Sabbath days and attend synagogue.\" The eruv must be \"completely enclosed\" by existing natural boundaries such as garden walls, fences and Metrolink lines as well as sections of thin wire connecting poles along the perimeter.

Cancer deaths There could be more than 3,500 avoidable cancer deaths in England in the next five years as a result of the pandemic, according to researchers. Fewer people have sought advice for potential symptoms due to fears of catching the virus, and some cancer services, like routine screening, have been disrupted. But study leader Prof Clare Turnbull said taking fast action now could still turn things around. 4. Herd immunity The BBC has spent months speaking to scientists advising the government to try to find out how important the concept of herd immunity was to the strategy adopted at the beginning of the outbreak. Herd immunity is achieved when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, either because they've caught it or been vaccinated.

A woman has been arrested on what police described as an unrelated matter but she is said to be \"a person of interest in the inquiry\".

She was wearing a dark woolly hat and a dark jacket. Supt Brian Shaw said: \"I am urging anyone who witnessed the attack to get in touch with us.

That inquiry, led by a former High Court judge, took six years and cost about \u00a312m to complete. So, what are the key issues round the new inquiry? Why are we having a new inquiry when Scotland has already had one? Although Penrose was the first statutory inquiry in the UK that looked into the scandal, its powers and terms of reference were limited. It examined the systems and procedures in place in Scotland during the period, but it did not have power to compel witnesses outside Scotland to attend. This was a major drawback, since health policy before 1999 was controlled by Westminster and many crucial decisions were made by England-based politicians and civil servants. Ultimately, the Penrose report was labelled a \"whitewash\" when it was published in March 2015. It estimated 3,000 patients in Scotland were infected with tainted blood products but the Department of Health has gauged the figure was 30,000 UK-wide. Many more questions remain about what happened in other parts of the UK, which campaigners hope will be answered by the new hearing. Greater Manchester mayor and former health secretary Andy Burnham has repeatedly called for a probe into what happened. The government ordered the inquiry last July after it faced a possible defeat in a vote on an emergency motion. What did the Penrose Inquiry conclude? The Penrose Inquiry said few matters could have been done differently and made only a single recommendation. That was that anyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before 1991 should be tested for Hepatitis C if they have not already done so. There was an angry response to the report from victims and relatives who had gathered at the National Museum in Edinburgh to see its publication. It concluded: \"The legacy of the period when viral transmission via blood and blood products was occurring continues to be severe for many people, whether due to ill-health or loss of a loved one. \"There is one respect in which the Inquiry can recommend action to prevent suffering from being greater than necessary - the detection of those whose transfusion transmitted Hepatitis C infection is still undiagnosed.\" What has happened in Scotland since the Penrose Inquiry? A working group was established by former health secretary Shona Robison in the wake of the report. It was charged with assessing the number of people who contracted Hepatitis C, and how many could still be undiagnosed. It also looked at whether uptake of blood tests had increased after the publication of the Penrose Inquiry report, and if any further action was needed to trace undiagnosed people. The group estimated there could be \"a small number\" of undiagnosed people still alive in Scotland who were infected with Hepatitis C by pre-1991 blood transfusions. It said the risk of infection was small, but anyone who was seriously ill in hospital before September 1991 and believed they might have had a blood transfusion were encouraged to seek further advice. What will the new inquiry mean for Scottish victims? The new inquiry is UK-wide and will look again at what happened to patients in Scotland. The new inquiry may come to Scotland at some point to gather evidence but may call witnesses to London too. If the fresh inquiry throws up new findings, it will have implications for Scottish victims who are still demanding compensation for what they went through. Thompson's Solicitors are representing 250 Scottish families and victims at the public inquiry. Also, the likelihood of further recommendations from a new hearing may compel Scottish ministers to act and make changes to the system. Are the issues the same for victims across the UK? According to campaigners, the background to the disaster in Scotland is very different to what happened in the rest of the UK. While England and other areas were relying on imported blood products during the period because of shortages at home, Scotland was largely self-sufficient in its supplies. This poses question why centres in Scotland decided to use commercial products when there was a free alternative available to them, according to Haemophilia Scotland. The new inquiry may explore these differences when it begins taking evidence in the spring.", "output": "Contaminated blood: Why a new inquiry after Penrose?", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Detective work by David Tattersfield, of the Western Front Association, identified the major to be an Alexander Soutar, a minister's son. Maj Soutar was born in Cullen and grew up in Glasgow and Thurso. He fought at the Somme in 1916 and Passchendale in 1917, before being shot and killed by a sniper on 28 May 1918 while helping to defend the village of Hermonville, near Jonchery-Sur-Vesle, from an attack by German soldiers. One hundred years after his death, Maj Soutar's descendants have gathered at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery where he lies to honour him. A new headstone with his name has been erected. The soldier's great nephew, James Soutar, said: \"My great uncle died exactly 100 years ago and nobody knew where his final resting place was. \"It's great for us to come and see his final resting place. I think his soul feels happy that his family is with him again.\" Mr Soutar, who named his son after his great uncle, said he and his family were grateful to Mr Tattersfield. Mr Tattersfield began his investigation following a visit to the cemetery, a place he describes as small, rarely visited but well cared for. Intrigued by the grave to an unknown Royal Engineers major, Mr Tattersfield checked the Commonwealth War Graves Commission database. He knew that British troops had only been in the area of France where he found the grave for a short period of time in 1918. Of more than 70 Royal Engineers killed across France at the end of May and early June 1918, Mr Tattersfield found two men who had held the rank of major. One of the majors was buried near Boulogne and the other, Maj Alexander Henderson Soutar, MC, had been killed on 28 May 1918, and was commemorated on the Soissons Memorial, near the cemetery in Jonchery-Sur-Vesle. With this information, the Ministry of Defence assisted in tracing the Scottish officer's relatives. From them, and also the official war diary of the company Maj Soutar served with, Mr Tattersfield was able glean more information on the soldier's life before and during the war. Maj Soutar was the eldest of six children and, though christened Alexander, was known by his family and friends as Alastair. The siblings' parents were Mary and Alexander, a United Free Church minister. During World War One, Maj Soutar's brother, Frank, was killed while serving in Mesopotamia with the 2nd Black Watch. Another brother, David, was a prisoner of war and survived the conflict. A letter from a friend to Maj Soutar's parents tells of him being shot and killed as he raised his rifle while defending Hermonville, where British soldiers were billeted. The friend described the officer as a man \"admired immensely\" by all who knew him. Following the fighting in which Maj Soutar was killed it is thought that there was enough to distinguish his rank, but nothing more of his identity. This led to him being buried in an unmarked grave.", "output": "World War One unknown soldier found to be Scottish major", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Nintendo is expected to announce a new Super Mario game for its upcoming Wii U console, as well as provide more details about at least two titles featuring the character for its 3DS handheld games machine. The revelations at the E3 event in Los Angeles will mark the latest evolution of the company's 31-year-old mascot. Mario originally started life as Jumpman, a carpenter with a blue shirt and red overalls whose girlfriend was kidnapped in the game Donkey Kong. He was renamed Mario by his creator Shigeru Miyamoto ahead of the sequel Donkey Kong Jr's launch in the US - a rare instance in which he portrayed the villain. Legend has it he was named after Mario Segale, landlord of a US warehouse rented by the firm. Mario art He has since appeared in more than 200 games, including educational titles, sports simulations and, most famously, in a series of side-scrolling platformers alongside his brother Luigi. But Mario's influence extends far beyond his video game cartridges, making him an unlikely cultural icon. Tim Augst, a 24-year-old living in Melbourne, set up a website in 2006 to document all things Mario. Mario Mayhem currently receives about 100,000 unique visits a month, with a cross-section of individuals contacting him to pay homage. \"I get a lot of younger kids sending in their Mario drawings and other kinds of art, and then I get the older kids, and even 30-year-old adults, sending in everything from videos to pictures of their tattoos,\" Mr Augst says. \"There are probably a few more guys contacting me than girls, but not by much.\" Name change The Australian curator and his visitors aren't the only ones with a Mario obsession. Some take it to a deeper level. '\"Except for cartoons, Mario was my only escape from the problems at home,\" Mario Brotha, a New York-based contemporary artist, tells the BBC. Mr Brotha says changing his name to echo Nintendo's protagonist has helped attract attention, giving him a competitive advantage when it comes to winning commissions for magazine fashion shoots and advertising campaigns. \"I remember racing home from school everyday just to be Mario for a couple hours. Mario Bros was my first experience with the digital-electronic world. So I chose Mario Brotha as a name to represent how far technology has come in the last 20 years.\" The character also proved influential to one of the men behind another hit video game series. \"Mario is a great character,\" says Peter Vesterbacka, the chief marketing officer - or \"mighty eagle\" - at Angry Birds' developer Rovio. \"But it's not just about him - it's the whole world that Nintendo has built, with the other great characters and the stories told through its games. \"Like Angry Birds, it's a game that both kids and parents can enjoy, and a great example of how games can connect generations.\" Block buster Mario's original design was the result of technological limitations. He was given a big nose and moustache because early video games' graphics were limited to blocky pixels. He has a hat as Mr Miyamoto was not a fan of drawing hair, and the colours red and blue were selected to help him stand out from the background. Since then, little details have been added, such as buttons and the logo on his cap. \"As far as things go, there isn't a lot of depth to him,\" says Professor Jose Zagal, a game designer and academic at DePaul University, Chicago. \"He's defined by a few traits and characteristics: Italian-American, a bit tubby, sports a moustache, and is cheerful and brave. That's about it really.\" Despite his appearance it would be foolish to underestimate Mario's power, says Ed Barton, director of digital media at Strategy Analytics. \"He is the most iconic video games character - Super Mario is to games what Mickey Mouse is to cartoons,\" he says. \"Nintendo has been very careful with the intellectual property he represents, keeping the quality of his games not just high but industry-defining. \"Super Mario games are a benchmark for all platforming games.\" So how much is the little guy worth? \"A quick back of the envelope calculation comes to around 250 million unit sales, which even with a conservative average sales price comes out at around $10bn (\u00a36.5bn) in new games sales,\" says Mr Barton. \"Obviously the series has generated more through second-hand games sales and licensing.\" Smartphone boycott Mario shouldn't need to worry that he will ever have to go back to unblocking drains. But there are some clouds over his future. Nintendo posted a net loss of 43.2bn yen ($553m, \u00a3360m) over its last financial year, and some question the firm's refusal to release Mario games on iPhones and Android handsets. \"Smartphones are already the biggest device category, but gaming will be on all connected screens,\" says Mr Vesterbacka. Prof Zagal suggests the character's fate may depend on the success of Nintendo's hardware. \"While Nintendo's 3DS sales have picked up, it got off to a rocky start and the upcoming Wii U console seems to have created more confusion than excitement,\" he says. \"On the other hand, Nintendo's Wii was met with great derision when it first launched but ended up soundly trouncing everyone else in terms of sales numbers.\" But one thing the experts and fans are resolute about is that Mario should keep at his most lucrative activity. \"Princess saving is what he seems to do most often and most successfully,\" states Prof Zagal. But Mr Augst says he wishes he could ask his hero one question: \"Is Princess Peach really worth it?\"", "output": "Nintendo's mascot: from Donkey Kong to Super Mario lovers", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

He said individuals who are involved in violence will have many aspects of their lives heavily scrutinised. \"There are consequences for individuals who perpetrate such extreme violence. \"This is the most serious form of criminality. Therefore, you cannot be in a position of trust in our society. \"We have licensing, regulations in terms of people who have a trusted place in our society.

Chief Superintendent Steve Martin insisted the public had a vital role to play in helping the police. \"I am grossly disappointed in our detection rate against RAAD,\" he said. \"Trust us and tell these people to stop doing what they are doing.\" Chief Superintendent Martin said the organisation was a small group made up of former paramilitaries who intimidated people. Five men were shot and wounded in Strabane since 2010, while another three were shot in Donegal including Derry man Andrew Allen who was murdered in Buncrana in February. Vigilante group Republican Action Against Drugs claimed responsibility. The number is significantly lower than estimates quoted in recent media reports which suggested that 85 men have been shot and wounded in the past three years. John McPoland from the Northern Ireland Ambulance service said he had thought the days of such attacks had been left behind. \"A lot of the shootings tend to be in around the knee cap and more recently shotguns have been used to inflict pain and maim the victims. \"There has been great a reduction in these types of attacks in comparison to 20 years ago,\" said Mr McPoland.

The research, published in Science, suggests there was a sophisticated network of cultural links across Europe. The grain was found at what is now a submerged cliff off the Isle of Wight. Farming of plants and animals first appeared in the Near East, with the technology spreading along two main routes into Europe. The accepted date of arrival on the British mainland is around 6,000 years ago, as ancient hunter gatherers began to grow crops such as wheat and barley. The DNA of the wheat - known as einkorn - was collected from sediment that was once a peat bog next to a river. Scientists think traders arrived in Britain with the wheat, perhaps via land bridges that connected the south east coast of Britain to the European mainland, where they encountered a less advanced hunter gatherer society. The wheat may have been made into flour to supplement the diet, but a search for pollen and other clues revealed no signs that the crop was grown in Britain until much later. Cultural connection Dr Robin Allaby of the University of Warwick, who led the research, said 8,000 years ago the people of mainland Britain were leading a hunter-gatherer existence, while at the same time farming was gradually spreading across Europe. \"Common throughout neolithic Southern Europe, einkorn is not found elsewhere in Britain until 2,000 years after the samples found at Bouldnor Cliff,\" he said. \"For the einkorn to have reached this site there needs to have been contact between mesolithic [the culture between paleolithic and neolithic] Britons and neolithic farmers far across Europe. \"The land bridges provide a plausible facilitation of this contact. As such, far from being insular, mesolithic Britain was culturally and possibly physically connected to Europe.\" The research shows that scientists can analyse genetic material preserved within the sediments of the landscapes stretching between Britain and Europe in prehistoric times. Co-researcher Prof Vincent Gaffney, of the University of Bradford, said the find marked a new chapter in British and European history. \"It now seems likely that the hunter-gather societies of Britain, far from being isolated were part of extensive social networks that traded or exchanged exotic foodstuffs across much of Europe,\" he said. Tangible link And Garry Momber of the Maritime Archaeology Trust, which collected the samples from the site, said work in the Solent had opened up an understanding of the UK's formative years in a way that he never dreamed possible. \"The material remains left behind by the people that occupied Britain as it was finally becoming an island 8,000 years ago, show that these were sophisticated people with technologies thousands of years more advanced than previously recognised. \"The DNA evidence corroborates the archaeological evidence and demonstrates a tangible link with the continent that appears to have become severed when Britain became an island.\" Follow Helen on Twitter.", "output": "Scientists find evidence of wheat in UK 8,000 years ago", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The estate claimed the suit \"worn\" by the gorilla breached copyright. It asked the Freddie \"Radio Go Go\" Gorilla sculpture, which Norfolk artist Mik Richardson took three days to create, to be \"taken off the streets\". The sculpture was removed from Millennium Plain, outside The Forum, at 11:00 BST. 'Dreadful and petty' Mr Richardson, 50, of Aylsham, Norfolk, said the decision to order its removal was \"absolutely shocking\". He said: \"It's dreadful. It's petty, really. The night I was told I couldn't sleep.\" Mr Richardson was paid \u00a3800 to design and paint the gorilla. \"I'm a mural artist and I have to be very careful about copyright,\" he said. \"I didn't copy the suit exactly. I alter enough so that it's fan art, rather than a copy of it. The \"Radio Go Go\" gorilla is one of 53 life-size gorillas decorated by Norfolk artists and displayed on the streets of Norwich over the summer. An additional 67 baby gorillas, painted at local schools, made up the 120-strong public art trail. The Freddie Mercury estate contacted Wild in Art, the company that supplied the gorilla glass-fibre canvases, according to director Charlie Langhorne. 'Enjoy a gorilla' \"They just said that they own the copyright on the suit and asked us to change it,\" Mr Langhorne said. \"That's being sorted. To save any bother we will change it. \"We do quite a few bits and pieces for them but it's no great shakes. \"We would rather not have to do it but it's not the end of the world.\" He said the gorilla would be repainted with a \"new and exciting design\" and should be back in place within 10 days. \"People in Norwich will have a new gorilla to enjoy soon,\" he said. Martin Green of Break, one of two charities that will benefit from the auction of the gorillas once the exhibition is over, said: \"It's a disappointing position they have put us in. \"Freddie is one of our most popular gorillas on the trail and now we've got to remove him from the streets. \"It's a sad story, but the positive news is that we'll end up with another gorilla on the streets.\" The Born Free Foundation, which counts Queen guitarist Brian May among its celebrity supporters, was also set to benefit from the October auction of the Freddie Mercury gorilla to help support conservation projects in the Congo.

As the nights draw in, production of a transporter protein ramps up in Sad, lowering available serotonin. The work will be presented this week at a neuropsychopharmacology conference. The University of Copenhagen researchers who carried out the trial say their findings confirm what others have suspected - although they only studied 11 people with Sad and 23 healthy volunteers for comparison. Using positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans, they were able to show significant summer-to-winter differences in the levels of the serotonin transporter (SERT) protein in Sad patients. The Sad volunteers had higher levels of SERT in the winter months, corresponding to a greater removal of serotonin in winter, while the healthy volunteers did not. Winter depression Lead researcher, Dr Brenda Mc Mahon, said: \"We believe that we have found the dial the brain turns when it has to adjust serotonin to the changing seasons. \"The serotonin transporter (SERT) carries serotonin back into the nerve cells where it is not active - so the higher the SERT activity, the lower the activity of serotonin. \"Sunlight keeps this setting naturally low, but when the nights grow longer during the autumn, the SERT levels increase, resulting in diminishing active serotonin levels. \"Many individuals are not really affected by Sad, and we have found that these people don't have this increase in SERT activity, so their active serotonin levels remain high throughout the winter.\" Prof Siegfried Kasper, of the European College of Neuropsychophar\u00admacology, which this year is holding its annual congress in Berlin, said: \"SERT fluctuations associated with Sad have been seen in previous studies, but this is the first study to follow patients through summer and winter comparisons. \"It seems to offer confirmation that SERT is associated with Sad.\" Sam Challis, information manager at mental health charity Mind, said: \"We don't yet know enough about how serotonin levels can be affected by light levels so this is quite an interesting, albeit small, study. We would welcome more research.\" She said there was a range of treatments available for Sad, such as light therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy. \"We know that eating a balanced diet, cutting down on caffeine and getting some exercise can help, as can spending as much time as possible outdoors because - even when it's overcast - light will be higher than indoors.\" Sad affects about two million people in the UK, and more than 12 million people across northern Europe.", "output": "Brain scans show cause of seasonal affective disorder", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

After just two dates, the new couple went on holiday together to Botswana, camping out under the stars. They fell in love \"so incredibly quickly\", proof the \"stars were aligned\", said Harry. To the British press, their romance was catnip. Here was a golden couple who were able to draw vast crowds, speak the language of younger generations and sprinkle royal stardust on any cause. For months the couple avoided the cameras and it wasn't until the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto that the the two were first photographed holding hands in public, smiling and laughing. But there had been signs early on that the fairytale was some way off a \"happily ever after\". When Harry first confirmed the relationship in late 2016, it came with a stark attack on the media, accusing them of subjecting his girlfriend to \"a wave of abuse and harassment\". He spoke of nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers, attempts by reporters and photographers to get into Meghan's home and the \"bombardment\" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. It was a problem that was only going to get worse. Despite that - or perhaps because of that - the two grew ever closer and in September 2017, Meghan declared to Vanity Fair magazine: \"Personally, I love a great love story.\" The two of them had been enjoying a special time together and were really happy and in love, she said. The media was now on high alert for the sound of royal wedding bells - and they didn't have to wait long. In November 2017, Harry got down on one knee to propose to Meghan as they made roast chicken together at their home in Kensington Palace. Harry had designed the ring, made with two diamonds which had belonged to his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. At the centre was a diamond from Botswana. The couple shared their story in a candid interview with the BBC, and appearing brimming with positivity for the future. They revealed Meghan would give up acting to focus on causes close to her heart, working alongside her husband-to-be. \"I know that she will be unbelievably good at the job part of it,\" said Harry. Things began to shift as preparations got under way for a May 2018 wedding in Windsor. It quickly became clear that this was a royal couple who wanted to do things differently - their way. The wedding, which much of the world tuned in to watch, had all the traditions - a stunning dress, cheeky bridesmaids and heartfelt vows. But, as our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said at the time, the service with its gospel choir, young black cellist and breathtaking address from Bishop Curry, marked it out as a modern, diverse wedding for a modern, diverse couple, which seemed to point to a different future for the Royal Family. Married life brought with it new titles - the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and a new home at Windsor in Frogmore Cottage. In October of that year, the couple embarked on their first royal tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, over 16 days. It was there that they shared the news that they were expecting their first baby. Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, seventh in line to throne and the Queen's eighth great-grandchild, was born on 6 May 2019. To Harry, who was by Meghan's side at the birth, little Archie was \"absolutely to die for\". Throughout Meghan's pregnancy, the continual redrawing of battlelines had gone on between the press and the couple. This was to be no repeat of the Duchess of Cambridge's birth with the circus of journalists and photographers lying in wait outside hospital doors for days on end. The press had been told there would be no information about the birth, beyond that it was happening. Such scrutiny and pressure proved to be a struggle for the newly-wed Meghan during her pregnancy and in early motherhood, she later admitted in an ITV documentary filmed during their tour of southern Africa in September. \"Not many people have asked if I'm OK,\" she said, looking lost. She spoke of her vulnerability during pregnancy and the challenges of having a new-born - \"it's a lot\". Asked if she could cope, she said she had long told Harry it was not enough to just survive - \"that's not the point of life - you have got to thrive\". There were further signs that the couple were not happy, when the prince opened up about his mental health. He said it was under constant management and he lived with the pressures of avoiding a repeat of the past that took his mother, the Princess of Wales, from him. She died in a car crash in Paris when Harry was just 12. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes. \"Everything that she went through, and what happened to her, is incredibly important every single day, and that is not me being paranoid,\" he said. \"Part of this job is putting on a brave face but, for me and my wife, there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue,\" he added. It has also been suggested the scrutiny of Meghan has been greater because of her African-American heritage. Former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she wanted to hug Meghan for the British media's \"racist\" treatment of her, while Harry has highlighted how \"unconscious bias\" can lead to racist behaviour even if people do not consider themselves to be racist. The couple's frustration and anger with some sections of the press has gone from being a matter between the palace and editors into the full glare of the public spotlight. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters and Harry filed proceedings at the High Court against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking. As such a dramatic year came to a close, the royal couple took an extended break from royal duties over Christmas, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped their bombshell announcement. Neither Harry's father, Prince Charles, nor his older brother, Prince William, with whom Harry has said he has \"good days\" and \"bad days\", were consulted. Harry and Meghan were, they told their Instagram followers, planning to leave their royal duties - and the royal purse - behind. They hope their next chapter, spent in North America as well as the UK, will see the two of them, together with baby Archie, make their own path to the future.", "output": "The Harry and Meghan story", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

They warn the \"well meaning\" proposals could have \"unintended consequences\" for artistic expression. The government says the bill will offer greater protection to victims of hate. And Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf insists that the government has been \"absolutely explicit\" that freedom of expression is not under attack. But the open letter says the legislation could see people being prosecuted for \"stirring up\" hatred - even if they did not intend to do so. It adds: \"This offence could even be applied to being in possession of materials produced by someone else, where sharing the material could stir up hatred. \"The unintended consequences of this well meaning bill risk stifling freedom of expression, and the ability to articulate or criticise religious and other beliefs.\" It has been signed by more than 20 individuals and organisations from the world of arts, journalism, literature, comedy, politics and human rights advocacy. They include novelist Chris Brookmyre, actor Elaine C Smith, playwright Alan Bissett and comedian Rowan Atkinson. The letter goes on to claim that the bill could \"frustrate rational debate and discussion\" in society, including in the arts. It says: \"The right to critique ideas, philosophical, religious and other must be protected to allow an artistic and democratic society to flourish.\" The letter was organised by the Humanist Society Scotland, which has called on the bill to be amended to strike a \"sensible balance\" between protecting victims and safeguarding freedom of expression. Its chief executive, Fraser Sutherland, said: \"The failure of the bill to require intent to be proven in court on some offences risks a significant chilling effect on free expression.\" Many opponents of the bill have drawn parallels with the highly-controversial Offensive Behaviour at Football Act, which was eventually repealed by the Scottish Parliament. Libraries and bookshops There have been suggestions, for example, that it could lead to author JK Rowling facing a seven-year prison sentence for expressing her concerns about the impact of trans rights on women. There have also been concerns that the laws on possessing \"inflammatory material\" could even lead to libraries and bookshops being prosecuted for stocking books that are deemed to be offensive. And the Scottish Police Federation has warned that the legislation would force officers to \"police what people think or feel\" which it says would \"devastate the legitimacy of the police in the eyes of the public\". What does the Scottish government want to do? Scotland already has various laws in place that offer additional protection to people from crimes based on their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation and transgender identity. It means that crimes can be treated more seriously by the courts if the offender has shown \"malice and ill-will\" towards the victim based on their membership - or association with - one of the protected groups. The Hate Crime and Public Order bill was introduced by the government in response to recommendations made by senior judge Lord Bracadale, who had been asked to examine the existing hate crime laws to make sure they were fit for purpose in the 21st Century. The bill aims to simplify and clarify the law by bringing together the various existing hate crime laws into a single piece of legislation, and adds hate crime based on a person's age to the list of protected groups. It also creates a new crime of \"stirring up hatred\" against the protected groups - which is defined as \"behaving in a threatening or abusive manner, or communicating threatening or abusive material to another person\". This can either be \"with the intention\" of stirring up hatred against someone from a protected group, or \"where it is a likely consequence that hatred will be stirred up against such a group\". New offences of \"possessing inflammatory material\" are also created which covers people who \"have in their possession threatening, abusive or insulting material with a view to communicating the material to another person.\" Finally, the bill formally abolishes the offence of blasphemy - which has not been prosecuted in Scotland for more than 175 years. The government says the bill \"makes it clear to victims, perpetrators, and communities and to wider society that offences motivated by prejudice will be treated more seriously and will not be tolerated by society.\" It has also said it will consider making changes to the bill before it is finally passed by parliament. Mr Yousaf, the justice secretary, has insisted that the bill \"will not prevent you expressing controversial or offensive views. Just don't do it in a threatening or abusive way that is likely or intended to stir up hatred.\" In a series of tweets, Mr Yousaf said it was not the case that someone could be prosecuted purely because someone else took offence at what they said. And he said it would be for the courts to decide whether behaviour was threatening or abusive, and was likely or intended to stir up hatred. Figures released in June showed that the number of people charged with hate crimes in Scotland has increased over the past year. Racial offences remain the most commonly reported hate crime, with a total of 3,038 charges last year - an increase of 4% on the previous year, but still the second lowest since comparable records began in 2003/04 and 33% lower than the peak recorded in 2011/12.", "output": "Author Val McDermid says hate crime bill threatens free speech", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Thomas began his broadcasting career in 1989 as a producer of AM at LBC Radio. He then joined the Today programme as a junior producer in 1991, progressing to assistant editor from 1995.

She couldn't understand it - she was fit, healthy and training six times a week for long-distance triathlons. But within three months, she went from preparing for Ironman events to \"needing a snooze every single day\". The personal trainer went to the doctor several times over the following four years and was repeatedly given conflicting advice. \"I just wasn't getting any answers. I was told I was stressed, that they needed to change what [contraceptive] I'm on, I needed to exercise more, I needed to lose weight.\" Emily says not knowing what was wrong with her was \"scary\" and that every couple of months, she would have \"episodes\" where she didn't feel like herself. \"I didn't understand what was happening and I was really scared about why I wasn't me any more,\" she says. \"I had episodes of just being psycho... It wasn't just being a bit ratty but proper angry and I would keep going back for arguments. Then afterwards, I would feel totally wiped out. \"It was terrifying, as I felt totally out of control. It's like you've been body-snatched and you're watching another person.\" Emily had \"endless\" hormone tests that all came back normal. She ended up conducting her own research and told the doctor she thought she either had chronic fatigue syndrome or perimenopause. Together, they identified that her symptoms seemed to run in conjunction with her menstrual cycle and at 42, she was finally diagnosed with perimenopause - a phase that can last up to 10 years and cause hot flushes, night sweats and mood swings, similar to the menopause. \"I didn't know perimenopause even existed [but] I felt such a relief because I now knew what was going on,\" she says. \"I didn't know there was this transition, I just thought you toddled along happily and one day you had a few hot flushes, your periods finished and you were done.\" For most women in the UK, the average age of reaching the menopause is 51, but decreasing levels of oestrogen can cause perimenopausal symptoms. Emily struggled at first with the impact of the condition. She had been used to training for 12 to 15 hours a week through swimming, cycling and running, but felt too tired to exercise - something that had brought her social benefits as well as fitness. Many of her friends were from the Norwich-based triathlon club Tri-Anglia and the Bungay Black Dog running club, so she saw them less frequently. She also didn't finish the 2017 Outlaw Half Holkham - an event consisting of a 1.2-mile (1,900m) swim, 56-mile (90km) bike and 13.1-mile (21km) run - due to her symptoms and she pulled out of Ironman Vichy in France as the distances were double and she felt \"there was simply no point\" going. \"A huge part of [training] was socialising and catching up with people; I would run with one of my friends which was an opportunity to chat and I would do long runs with my dogs,\" she says. \"I felt lost not being able to do that.\" You may also be interested in: What is perimenopause?

Cardiovascular exercise still \"wipes me out for days\" so instead she has taken up power-lifting. \"Now I know what it is, I feel happy to ride it out,\" she says. \"I don't take PT clients in the evening any longer, I allow time for naps, I make sure I get early nights when I need to.\" She has also channelled the years she spent trying to get answers into an online support service called Perimenopause Hub, where women with the condition all over the world can find out more about symptoms and get support. It has a Facebook group with more than 1,200 members and experts on hand to give advice. Emily, who says the project has \"grown and grown\", will also be hosting a three-day online summit on 20-22 March. \"The feedback has been phenomenal. People have been in contact and said they feel they are 'no longer alone', 'I'm not different', 'I'm not the only one going through this',\" she says. \"It's been lovely creating this community.

It is not unusual for the Royal's A&E department to be extremely busy. But according to some members of staff, including ambulance crews, the last couple of days have been like shifts at the height of the winter pressure. It is understood approximately 20 patients had to wait more than 12 hours to be seen, while two vehicles sat with patients for up to two hours as there was no room inside the department. At one stage a seriously ill man had to be treated in the ambulance triage area as the resuscitation bays were full. A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) confirmed the spike in demand and said the past 48 hours were 20% busier compared to the same days last year. Of the 92 patients brought by ambulance to the A&E department on Tuesday, 73 ambulances were able to hand over their patient to staff within 30 minutes; a further 14 within 45 minutes, three within one hour and two between one and two hours. A source within the ambulance service said while the figures showed a positive turnaround, on the ground it was \"very frustrating\" having to wait with patients for anything more than 20 minutes \"when the radio is going off asking you to respond to another call\". 'Extraordinary' A NIAS spokesperson said there was a \"notable improvement\" in the delivery of patients to hospital. \"This improvement on turnaround times is the result of collaborative work between NIAS, Belfast HSC Trust and HSC Board, which has resulted in hospital ambulance liaison officers being placed in the emergency department to liaise effectively with staff and bed managers to improve the flow of patients throughout the hospital.\" The pressure was also felt in the South Eastern Health Trust at the Ulster Hospital, whose director of hospital services, Seamus McGoran, described Monday as \"extraordinary\" and \"an early signal that winter is coming\". He also said that Tuesday was much busier than usual. \"There was a huge increase in patients, way above the normal,\" he said. \"Staff did an incredible job meeting this demand.\" Over the two-day period, there were 570 patients - 110 more than the daily average attendance. The hospital also received 50% more ambulance cases than would normally be expected. Mr McGoran said 50% more beds were required on Monday night, and as emergency ambulances bring seriously ill patients, this had a knock-on effect on Tuesday.", "output": "Excessive waiting times at Royal Victoria Hospital", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The national clinical director says Scots may have to change their ways with more sizzling summers likely. Not wanting to be a \"killjoy\", he said the \"taps aff\" culture might not be something that we should encourage too much\". Prof Leitch was commenting as temperatures again hit the mid-20s across Scotland - and with record readings into the 30s in England. He said good weather brought many positive health benefits, such as exercise and greater physical activity. But he warned the prospect of further hot summers should make people think twice about over-exposure to the sun. He said: \"We don't want to be the killjoy national health service telling everybody not to do anything, but maybe as you walk around Glasgow the 'taps aff' culture might not be something that we should encourage too much. \"As soon as the sun comes out we wear shorts, no tops and flip-flops - we might have to reconsider that if we're going to have consistent hot weather over the next few years.\" Prof Leitch had spoken earlier on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme about the need for a change of attitude. Later he added: \"Reasonable exposure to the sun is a good thing. \"We want people to be physically active in the parks and play football with their kids, of course. \"But we also want them to be cautious, we want them to use common-sense rules that they already know. \"I think the joke of Scotland being the taps aff culture, particularly here in the west perhaps, needs a little bit of a cultural change. \"We should be slightly more cautious in the sun, if the sun is going to be a consistent challenge over our summers.\" Prof Leitch said young children, older people, and those with underlying conditions were particularly vulnerable to the conditions.

The mother-of-four then set out to walk 150 miles from the remote County Cork village of Aghabullogue to the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) in Dublin. In a Facebook post, she begged the Irish health minister to listen to her, and invited anyone who wanted to \"walk a mile of the road\" with her to do so. \"I was shaking with fear as I left the house, not knowing whether or not I was doing the right thing, but I couldn't in my wildest dreams have imagined we would get the support we got, from Wexford, Blarney and beyond,\" Ms Twomey told BBC News NI. Nine hours and 21 miles into her journey, as she was approaching the town of Mallow, Health Minister Simon Harris contacted Ms Twomey to say he would meet her next week. Mr Harris then announced plans to review the policy on medicinal cannabis. Component of cannabis Ms Twomey had previously petitioned the Republic of Ireland legislature for the legalisation of a substance she believes would save her daughter's life, but to no avail. That is because the drug, known as THC, is a component of cannabis. Although available legally in parts of the US and Australia for medical use, it remains illegal in the Republic of Ireland and the UK. Clinical trials indicate that Ava's rare condition - Dravet syndrome - can respond well to THC. None of the many pharmaceutical drugs prescribed for Ava have helped her since she was diagnosed as a baby. Then, her parents were told the seizures could cause her death. 'Talking more, smiling more' But last month, a legal form of cannabis oil, known as CBD or Charlotte's Web, had a dramatic effect on the child. \"From the time Ava began taking it on 2 October until the end of the month, she only had seven seizures - usually she would have hundreds. We just couldn't believe the difference,\" Ms Twomey told BBC News NI. \"Suddenly, she was talking more, smiling more, she wasn't in as much pain and even in school they said she was interacting more with staff and pupils.\" Given its success, Ms Twomey believes that combining the Charlotte's Web with THC could reduce her symptoms by up to 99%. \"She has astonished doctors with her progress over the past month, but imagine what she could achieve if we accessed medication that has been proven to work even more effectively in the US and elsewhere? \"In the US, children who were having up to 300 seizures a day were reduced to two a month, in some cases it eliminated seizures completely.\" Scientific evidence When she heard from the health minister, Ms Twomey postponed her walk. \"I have to take the minister at his word, give him time to hear us out and trust that he will take action,\" she said. \"I just want Ava to be a healthy child with a normal life - she's a great little girl who deserves it.\" In a statement on Thursday, Mr Harris's department announced that he wanted to \"review Ireland's policy on medicinal cannabis with the best clinical advice and expertise\". It added: \"As part of this review, the minister has asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (formerly the Irish Medicines Board), to provide him with their expert scientific advice. \"This is not a discussion about decriminalising cannabis in any way shape or form, it is about reviewing current policy and seeking to inform ourselves of the latest medical and scientific evidence on the potential medical benefits of cannabis for some people with certain medical conditions.\"", "output": "Cork to Dublin: Mum's walk sparks cannabis policy review plans", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

After reports that the agreement has now been cancelled, the Scottish government highlighted a \"climate of hostility\" from opposition parties. Opponents of the deal called for a full statement on the \"sorry episode\". The agreement, said to be worth up to \u00a310bn, was signed with representatives of SinoFortone Group and China Railway No. 3 Engineering Group (CR3) at Nicola Sturgeon's official Bute House residence in Edinburgh. However opposition parties voiced fears about the deal, amid concerns CR3's parent company China Railway Group had been named in an Amnesty International report on human rights abuses and had been blacklisted by Norway's oil fund. Ms Sturgeon said no specific deals would be done with the Chinese consortium if legitimate concerns were uncovered, with all actual investments to be scrutinised by the Scottish Parliament. 'Climate of hostility' The Sunday Times newspaper reported the deal had collapsed in August and claimed it had become known in China as the \"Scottish shambles\". A spokesman for Economy Secretary Keith Brown said the government was aware of some concerns but had not thought the deal was off. He also said opposition parties should be \"ashamed\" for putting potential investments at risk. The spokesman said: \"We did not consider that the MOU had been cancelled but were aware that SinoFortone felt they could not move ahead at that time in the climate of hostility they faced from other parties. \"However, they continued to believe in the benefits for Scotland of an infrastructure partnership with China and we remained committed to pursuing these opportunities. \"The MOU is about building relationships with a view to investment and we remain committed to it. We are sorry if the partners consider the MOU to be cancelled and we remain open to working together on projects in the future.\" Opposition parties maintained their stance, with Labour's Jackie Baillie demanding the government \"come clean\" about the fate of the agreement \"as a matter of urgency\". She said: \"Scotland deserves answers on this backroom deal - the whole affair poses serious questions about the transparency and competence of SNP ministers. The SNP government's handling of this has been cackhanded from the very beginning, so it is no wonder it has been branded a shambles. \"The SNP tried to hush up this deal throughout the election, and now we find out that it fell apart months ago, and yet the Scottish people - once again - were none the wiser.\" Scottish Conservative economy spokesman Dean Lockhart added: \"This whole episode has shown the SNP just can't be trusted with economic matters. It thought it had struck gold, tried and failed to keep it a secret, and now doesn't seem to know what's going on. \"We now need a calm assessment of all this to see if a potentially lucrative deal with China can be reached. These things can't be allowed to fall through because of SNP bungling.\" 'Clouded in secrecy' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who lodged 28 parliamentary questions about the MOU on the first day of the new Holyrood term, also called for an \"urgent statement\" from Mr Brown about the affair. He said: \"They must explain what recent discussions they have had with these Chinese companies, what lessons they have learned from this sorry episode and what new arrangements will be put in place to attract ethical investment for Scotland. \"The SNP has a chance to inject some much needed transparency for something that has been clouded in secrecy. Throughout this whole process groups such as Amnesty International and Transparency International expressed concerns but the SNP covered their ears and ploughed on regardless. The showed a casual disregard for human rights.\" The Scottish government spokesman said opposition parties should be \"ashamed\", accusing them of \"doing Scotland down\". He said: \"The opposition should be ashamed of themselves if their actions, in search of cheap headlines, have put up to \u00a310bn of investment at risk. \"The Scottish government will do everything we can to make sure that Scotland is open for business.

The 82-year-old travelled to the UAE on 3 August \"and he remains there\", a spokesman said, giving no more details. The ex-king's finances are under scrutiny in a major corruption probe. He denies any wrongdoing and has said he is available if prosecutors need to interview him. Earlier this month, he announced the move in a letter to his son, Felipe, to whom he handed the throne six years ago. He said at the time was making the decision \"in the face of the public repercussions that certain past events in my private life are generating\" and in the hope of allowing his son to carry out his functions as king with \"tranquillity\". It was first reported that he had travelled to the Dominican Republic, but Spanish media later said he had arrived in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. However until now, neither the palace nor the government had confirmed his whereabouts. The former king is said to have travelled to the UAE on several occasions since his abdication in 2014. He is reported to be close to a number of key figures including the UAE's de facto leader, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan Why did Juan Carlos leave? Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014 after close to 40 years in power and handed power to his son Felipe. His decision to give up the throne came after a corruption investigation involving his daughter's husband and a controversial elephant hunting trip the monarch took during Spain's financial crisis. The controversies however did not stop there. In June this year, Spain's Supreme Court launched an investigation into Juan Carlos's alleged involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, after the ex-king lost his immunity from prosecution following his abdication. Juan Carlos played a pivotal role in Spain's transition to democracy after Gen Francisco Franco's death in 1975, but his popularity and his health declined in the final years of his reign, leading him to pass the baton to his son.", "output": "Juan Carlos: Spain's former king confirmed to be in UAE", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Mr Johnson also said \"people should be going back to work if they can now.\" Responding to a question about extending the furlough scheme the prime minister said: \"I think everybody has sort of taken the 'stay at home if you can' - I think we should now say, well, 'go back to work if you can'. \"I think it's very important that people should try to lead their lives more normally.\" The UK government was initially hesitant about advising people to wear face coverings, arguing that evidence that they reduce transmission was \"weak\". However, rules compelling people to wear face masks on public transport in England were introduced on 15 June. And speaking on Friday Mr Johnson said \"the balance of scientific opinion seems to have shifted more in favour of them than it was, and we're very keen to follow that\". \"I don't think we are going to get to a world where we say everyone has to wear face coverings the whole time everywhere,\" he said, but added \"We need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they don't usually meet. \"The future for the country has got to be a world where we are managing the virus so effectively with local lockdowns, test and trace that we don't need ultimately to have some of these social distancing measures.\" The messaging on face masks has evolved, to put it mildly. And Labour's calling on the government to offer some speedy clarity on the matter. Of course some will suggest that the position has evolved as the science has evolved. But perhaps something to consider here too; the economy. Today Boris Johnson urged people to go back to work. He also hinted at a stricter policy on face masks. Lo and behold he was pictured, out and about at a shop and takeaway, wearing a face mask. It doesn't take a detective to spot an overarching theme. Ministers want people to start embracing the new normal; leaving their homes, spending money and helping businesses get back on their feet - but yes with mitigation measures, like masks, in place. Those mitigations are of course there to help suppress transmission but can also play their part in in helping people feel confident. Because public confidence is important; you can urge someone to do something but they may well resist unless they feel safe. Currently people in England are advised to wear a face covering if possible in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is not possible. Those exempt from wearing face coverings include children under 11, people with disabilities, those with breathing difficulties and anyone travelling with someone who relies on lip reading. The rules on face covering vary across the nations. In Scotland face coverings are mandatory in shops and on public transport. People in Wales are being asked to wear non-medical face coverings where social distancing is not possible - including on public transport - but the government in Cardiff stopped short of making their use mandatory. While in Northern Ireland, plans to make wearing face coverings on public transport compulsory have been put on hold, pending legal clarification. Is the science on face coverings changing? Right from the early weeks of the crisis there's been concern about \"silent spreaders\" - people who don't realise they're infected passing the virus to others. It was that fear that led the US government and many others, back in April, to recommend that people cover their faces when in crowded indoor spaces. And since then the evidence has become stronger that in the 24-48 hours before symptoms show, people can be at their most infectious. Many others may never show symptoms at all, as I reported back in May. So as lockdowns are eased, and there's more mingling on public transport and in shops, the logic is that a barrier over the mouth and nose - even one that's homemade - can trap much of the virus that an infected person may release. According to Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, the UK's leading science academy, masks help to reopen economies because they make it easier for people to go about their normal lives and \"they're a very small price to pay\". 'Way behind' The World Health Organization says non-medical face coverings should be worn where social distancing is not possible. Homemade cloth face coverings can help reduce the spread of coronavirus from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms. Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan expressed concern that the UK is \"way behind\" other countries in terms of face mask usage. A recent report by the Royal Society said that as of April 2020, 80% of Italians wore masks, 70% of Americans and 65% of Spaniards. In the UK that figure was just 25% - although it is likely to be higher now. Prof Ramakrishnan said the government's guidelines had been inconsistent adding: \"What we would like for the government is to be a bit stronger and clearer about the messaging and require it whenever you are in crowded public spaces where you cannot get more than 2m away from the next person. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has written to Mr Johnson urging him to make face coverings mandatory in public places where it is not possible to keep a safe distance from others.

Mr Trump has come under fire for not making his tax returns public like his predecessors. His lawyers had argued that he enjoyed total immunity while in office and that Congress had no valid justification to seek the records. Two Democratic-controlled House of Representatives committees and New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance - also a Democrat - had demanded Mr Trump's tax documents over several years in order to determine whether current conflict-of-interest laws on a US president were tough enough. Mr Trump, a Republican, denies wrongdoing and has called the investigation into his tax affairs a \"witch hunt\". \"The Supreme Court sends case back to Lower Court, arguments to continue. This is all a political prosecution,\" he wrote in a series of tweets following the court rulings. What do the rulings mean? In the case regarding the request from the New York prosecutors, the Supreme Court ruled by a majority of seven to two that the president did not have absolute immunity from criminal investigation. \"Two hundred years ago, a great jurist of our Court established that no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,\" the court said. \"We reaffirm that principle today.\" But the two cases regarding Congressional committees were closely watched, as they could have had implications on how far US lawmakers could scrutinise the activities of a sitting president. The court ruled that Congress had significant, but not limitless, power to request the president's personal information. In this case, the court returned the case to the lower courts. A political win for Trump Those wanting to see President Donald Trump's tax returns before the November presidential election shouldn't hold their breath. In a series of high-stakes rulings on Thursday, the US Supreme Court swatted down the president's defence that, by dint of his high office, he was somehow above the law when it came to state-level criminal subpoenas. That's good news for the president's critics, advocates of limited executive power, and New York prosecutors seeking to investigate Trump's personal finances. The opinion is not-so-good news for anyone wanting a quick resolution to this case, however. Chief Justice John Roberts sent the lawsuit back down to the lower courts and offered a few new legal avenues for Mr Trump's lawyers to pursue that could continue to put off a day when the president's accounting firm ultimately hands over the documents. And if that day comes, there's still no guarantee that the request, by a secret grand jury, will ever lead to a public disclosure. In the other case, involving a request by congressional Democrats for Mr Trump's financial records, the court was even more circumspect. It simply punted the case down to the lower court with instructions to further balance presidential privileges with legislative power. The gears of justice will grind even more slowly there. While legally these decisions may have been, at best, a draw for the president, by pushing the final day of reckoning further down the road, it's a political win. Why do Trump's tax returns matter? Two of the cases centred on the ability of the House intelligence, oversight and financial services committees to compel Deutsche Bank and Mazars USA, Mr Trump's long-time accounting firm, to turn over his tax and financial documents. The committees argued that they needed this information to determine whether current conflict-of-interest laws on a US president were sufficiently rigorous. The case of Trump v Vance was based on on Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's criminal subpoena - an order to hand over evidence. Mr Vance argued Mr Trump's documents were needed to determine if financial records had been doctored to cover up hush-money payments to two women in 2016 who say they had affairs with Mr Trump. Following the ruling Mr Vance said the investigation into Mr Trump's financial affairs would resume. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said she would continue to campaign for Mr Trump's financial records to be handed over to Congress. \"Congress will continue to conduct oversight for the people, upholding the separation of powers that is the genius of our constitution,\" she told reporters. Will we get to see his tax returns? It is not clear whether this will happen. Even if Mr Trump's financial records are turned over to prosecutors, they may remain hidden from public view until charges are filed.", "output": "Trump taxes: Supreme Court says New York prosecutors can see records", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The contest has been marred by personal attacks, accusations of plots and claims of underhand voting tactics. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the result could lead to Scottish Labour becoming \"a real force for change\". Mr Leonard spoke immediately after the announcement in Glasgow. He said he hoped a \"new generation\" would help lead a new movement that was also \"founded on our old and enduring idealism\". \"That is the unity we can rally around, not simply a call for unity but around a renewed unity of purpose,\" he said. \"Our purpose today is not just to elect a leader. My aim is to be the next Labour first minister of Scotland.\" Mr Sarwar commented: \"I congratulate Richard on his victory. \"He has my full and unwavering support, and I look forward to campaigning with him to return a Scottish Labour government.\" In a vote which saw a 62.3% turnout, Mr Leonard won a 56.7% share, with Mr Sarwar on 43.3%. Mr Corbyn congratulated Mr Leonard on being elected. He said: \"There is much to do to continue our party's revival in Scotland and many who still need to be persuaded to put their trust in the Labour Party. \"But Richard's campaign offered a challenge to the rigged system that has benefited a wealthy elite and showed how he will lead Scottish Labour to transform society.\" He added: \"I am confident that under Richard's leadership, Labour will once again be a real force for change in Scotland.\" Who is the new leader? Bookmakers made Richard Leonard as the clear favourite to become the party's next leader after he secured the support of all the major trade unions, including Unite - which has run a concerted campaign to encourage as many of its members as possible to back him. The Central Scotland MSP is widely respected within the Labour movement, but had a relatively-low public profile before being persuaded to stand for the leadership. He has argued that people are \"hungry for change\", but believes that can only be delivered through \"socialism and democracy\" rather than \"nationalism or patriotism.\" And he has firmly ruled out any prospect of a future coalition with the SNP, saying \"there will be no ground ceded to nationalism at the expense of progressive socialism under my leadership\". The former GMB union official was born and raised in England, and had a private education - which some critics have claimed could prove problematic for him. What sparked the leadership contest? Ms Dugdale became the third Scottish Labour leader to quit since the independence referendum in September 2014 when she resigned suddenly on 29 August - almost exactly two years after succeeding Jim Murphy in the role. At the time, Ms Dugdale said she wanted to \"pass on the baton\" to someone else, and denied suggestions that she had been forced out by supporters of Mr Corbyn, who she had openly criticised in the past. But she later said it would be right to assume that \"a lot of internal problems\" were the reason she did not tell her deputy, Mr Rowley, that she was quitting until just a few minutes beforehand. What challenges does the winner face? The final week of the leadership contest was overshadowed by Mr Rowley stepping down from his interim and deputy leader roles after the Scottish Sun published allegations that he had sent abusive text messages to a former partner. Mr Rowley denies the claims, but has been suspended by the party while an investigation is carried out. He had been absent from the Scottish Parliament for the previous two weeks, with party bosses citing a chest infection as the reason. There have been claims that the party knew of the allegations against Mr Rowley for several weeks, but only suspended him once they appeared in the media. War of words The leadership contest itself suggests that Scottish Labour - which is now the third largest party at Holyrood behind the SNP and Conservatives - remains deeply divided. A public war of words erupted between the rival camps in September after Mr Rowley was secretly recorded discussing the leadership election with a party member while queuing for a fringe event. The row unfolded as Mr Corbyn was telling the UK party's conference that Labour was \"on the way back in Scotland\" thanks to its \"unifying socialist message\". Meanwhile, supporters of both candidates have raised concerns over the sign-up process for those eligible to vote, with accusations of unfair tactics on both sides. Whoever ultimately wins the contest looks to have a tough task on their hands to unite the rival factions and make the party a credible challenger to the SNP in time for the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021. Even surviving in the job that long would be something of an achievement, given that the winner will become the party's fourth leader in little over three years.", "output": "Richard Leonard to lead Scottish Labour", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The vast pit now being excavated is a burial site from Spain's civil war. In August 1936, dozens of Republican supporters - and anyone suspected of it - were shot and flung there. Now uncovered, their bones lie sprawled as they landed: an arm above a head, a skull face down, the soles of shoes still eerily intact on skeletons. Luis Pobrito was five when his father was taken away by nationalists loyal to General Franco. All Luis has today is one photograph and the conviction his father was killed here. \"I just want to find him and bury him over on that side, in a proper grave,\" Luis says, gesturing towards the flowers. \"That's all I want. Nothing more.\" Rights for victims It is 10 years since relatives of Spain's \"disappeared\" uncovered the first mass burial site from the war, and broke an unwritten pact of silence over the past. More than 150 Republican graves have been found since then - in ditches, down wells or at the edge of cemeteries. But it is just a fraction of the total. After Emilio Silva discovered the grave of his own grandfather in northern Spain he created an association to help others, doing what he argues is the duty of the Spanish state. \"We are talking about crimes of kidnap, torture, (people) killed - and it's difficult to understand that a group of relatives have to resolve the question. We are the victims,\" Emilio says. His own grandfather was trying to set up a secular school in his village when he was killed. \"State intervention would show that the victims have rights, and in a democracy there should be rights for all,\" Emilio argues. The government has granted close to 6m euros (\u00a35m) for exhumations since 2006, and the budget has increased this year despite the economic crisis. But it is estimated there are more than 2,000 unmarked graves across the country and much of the work locating and unearthing them is still done by volunteers. A national map of grave sites, prescribed in the Historic Memory Law three years ago, has still not materialised. \"So many people disappeared during the civil war. It's a wound that's still open,\" explains Elena Vera, the archaeologist in charge of the Cazalla site. More used to ancient Roman remains, she found excavating her country's traumatic, recent past deeply moving. It is estimated that 300 men and women were buried here. The round holes in the nearby cemetery wall are thought to be the marks of gunfire, from their execution. \"I think to talk about that history, to exhume the bodies for the relatives - or at least locate their graves - that's a way of sealing the wound. We have to let people cry for those who died at last. To mourn the disappeared,\" Elena believes. But in this quiet Andaluz town, the opening of the mass grave has unearthed suppressed memories too: of a bitter, divided past that no-one discussed openly here for seven decades. \"We never used to speak about the war here. But it's starting now that they've discovered the bodies,\" says Anna, a local woman in her 80s. \"Some people agree with it, some don't. But we never spoke about all this until now.\" 'Leave them be' Ms Vera, the archaeologist, discovered that her own uncle and great-grandmother had been \"taken for a walk\" during the war, and never returned. And in the centre of Cazalla, a man claims he actually witnessed the killings. \"They brought them there in a truck, under armed guard,\" Carmelo Guillen recalls. Now 83, he lived near the cemetery as a child. \"They shot them, then dragged them like dogs, threw them in the hole and just shovelled earth on top,\" he says, gesturing with his walking stick. It is no wonder that some people are wary of digging too deep, even now. \"It should be left in the past,\" insists a local woman named Luisa, chatting on the wall by the church. \"Nothing can be fixed now, we can't bring the dead back. We should leave them be,\" she says forcefully, then turns away. But it is an unconvincing argument for relatives of the missing when those who died fighting for Franco in Cazalla were buried in individual plots in the church graveyard, beneath a huge stone cross engraved with their names. Now, 74 years later, there are still more than 100,000 people missing from the losing side in Spain's civil war, scattered in unmarked graves across the country. Many of the relatives now searching for their remains are already in their 80s. And the process - so late to start - is painstakingly slow. \"It's hard to tell the relatives they have to wait,\" says Emilio Silva. \"In this past decade, a lot of people have died waiting for us.\"", "output": "Digging up Franco-era truths in Andalucia", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Gowarikar had earlier made the smash hit Jodhaa Akbar (2008), a fictitious romance between the 16th Century Mughal Emperor Akbar and a Hindu princess, Jodhaa. The ancient city that's crumbling away His new adventure-romance film is set in the Indus Valley civilisation, which began nearly 5,000 years ago in an area which is now in Pakistan and northern India. The biggest cities here were Harappa and Mohenjo Daro, where some 80,000 people are believed to have lived. Historical fiction Mohenjo Daro - or Mound of the Dead - was one of the world's earliest major urban settlements. It is also one of the world's largest archaeological excavation sites, located in modern day Sindh province in Pakistan. Gowariker's film is set in 2016 BC. The hero, Sarman played by Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan, is a farmer of indigo textiles. The heroine, played by south Indian actress Puja Hegde, is a priest's daughter. The hero dances and serenades the heroine who wears plumes in her headgear. Wild horses are tamed at the speed of a rodeo show. Characters speak a strangely accented Hindi. An evil king played by Kabir Bedi, throws the hero into a Roman coliseum-like arena in a gladiatorial fight. (Historians say there is no evidence of such practices.) Critics found the actors looked \"more like Aryans\" than the dark skinned Proto-Australoids who possibly inhabited the ancient city. The film's epic climax is a devastating flood that submerges the city, with the hero valiantly saving the citizens with a Noah's Ark trick to take them to safety across the swollen river. (Theories about the city's decline include devastating floods in the Indus Valley, droughts, or an Aryan invasion that led to the inhabitants abandoning the city for the Ganges plains.) All this has not gone down well with critics and historians alike. \"Creating fiction in an authentic historical setting is what historical fiction is about, but Bollywood seems to throw the authentic setting to the winds in favour of a better story,\" says Diptakirti Chaudhuri, author of Bolly Book, The Big Book of Hindi Movie Trivia. 'Sick Orientalism' \"And the liberties - while acceptable under the guise of fiction - often make one wonder why link it to a particular historical episode or era at all?\" Mr Chaudhuri says the film \"had the additional disadvantage of being released in an era of hyper-promotions and people knew the makers had messed up many aspects of accepted history right from the time the first trailer came out\". He's right. Social media began criticising the glamourised version of an ancient historical city even as the film's trailer was released. Ruchika Sharma, a student of archaeology in Delhi, tweeted that the heroine's glamorous costumes were nothing but \"sick Orientalism\" and condemned \"Bollywood depicting tribal societies in stereotypical terms with feathers in their hair and paint on their faces\". Film critic Anupama Chopra called the film \"a mess\" and an \"unintentional comedy\". The New York Times said Mohenjo Daro \"isn't really interested in how the city worked, or in its ancient bells and whistles\". Parents who took their school going children to watch Mohenjo Daro have returned disappointed to find more romance that history in the movie. \"Movies have a big impact on school students and misrepresenting history can lead to confusion,\" says Vasav Dutta Sarkar, a Delhi-based history teacher. She points out how the 2001 Bollywood film Asoka, the great Indian warrior king, was \"riddled with historical inaccuracies and many students confused the movie for historical facts\" in classrooms. In her book Reel History: The World According to Movies, British historian Alex von Tunzelmann writes that a \"lot of people can and do believe some of the things they see in the movies\". \"Many of us will know that a particularly outlandish claim is tosh when we watch it, but years later it may have taken root in our imaginations - and we don't always remember that we first saw it in a fictional film.\" 'Suspend disbelief' Now Mohenjo Daro's makers and cast have defended the film as historical fiction. They claim that the film is a fictitious tale of people of a bygone time. \"Hindi cinema is entertainment cinema not realist cinema\", says Rachel Dwyer, a professor of Indian Cultures and Cinema of London University's School of Oriental and African Studies. In his defence, Gowarikar told an interviewer to \"suspend disbelief\" while watching the film and ignore the history and authenticity part of the film. He also said he had \"taken plenty of artistic liberties with the looks of the characters\". Gowarikar's supporters have also pointed out that Hollywood has also slipped with regard to history with movies like 300, Rise of an Empire or 2000 BC. \"Popular history is more important than academic history in films. It's not just cinema. Popular narratives of the Tudors are similar in Britain.

Earlier on Friday, politicians and officials had to be escorted out of the Congress building in the city of Valparaiso, after anti-government activists tried to force their way in. What happened at the march? Santiago Governor Karla Rubilar said a million people had marched in the capital - more than 5% of the country's population. On Twitter she said the protesters \"represent a dream for a new Chile.\" Protesters also took to the streets in every major Chilean city. \"We're asking for justice, honesty, ethical government,\" 38-year-old Francisco Anguitar told AFP news agency in Santiago. Many participants were calling for the resignation of Mr Pi\u00f1era. What is the background? The protests were originally sparked by a now-suspended increase in metro fares but grew to take in wider grievances over living costs and inequality. In the days of demonstrations, there have been outbreaks of looting and arson. At least 16 people have died since the unrest began a week ago, hundreds have been injured and more than 7,000 people have been detained. Chile's military has taken over security in Santiago, which is now under a state of emergency with night-time curfews and 20,000 police on the streets. Chile is one of Latin America's wealthiest countries but also one of its most unequal - it has the worst levels of income equality among the 36 member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Since then, 356 children have been searched by police. Two thirds of these searches were consensual, and 91% recovered no items. Following the publication of these figures, the Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson Alison McInnes announced she would be seeking to recall Mr Mawson to the justice committee. She said: \"People deserve to know why Police Scotland haven't kept their word on scrapping this unregulated and illiberal position. \"If it is the case that this practice is continuing, it would be reasonable to question if the police misled parliament.\" How many like me? Use the INTERACTIVE CALCULATOR developed by BBC data journalist Marc Ellison to see how many people like you have been stopped and searched by Police Scotland. There were 436,288 stop-searches between January and November last year, with 654 involving children aged under 12. By comparison, London's Metropolitan force - which polices a population greater than that of Scotland - searched 19 children under nine in the last year, compared to 159 by Police Scotland. However, the number of searches by officers in Scotland, on children aged eight to 12, has decreased from the 2,912 carried out between April and December 2013. 'Fairly indefensible' Police Scotland has said the tactic has contributed to crime being at a 40-year low, with violent crime down by 10%. Mr Mawson met a Scottish parliamentary committee in June to discuss the controversial policing tactic. He also announced a pilot scheme in Fife in which the parents of all children subject to stop and search would be given a letter explaining why. Mr Mawson told the justice committee: \"From here on in, we should not search young children who are under the age of consent. \"That must stop - that is the message that I will be putting out. \"However, we cannot delay - I am not going to wait six months for the Fife pilot to end because the current position is fairly indefensible.\" Since the committee hearing, stop and searches on children have actually increased from 45 in July, to 74 in November. Children were most often searched for weapons (288), alcohol (152) and stolen property (125) between January and November 2014. A dozen searches for firearms resulted in the recovery of three weapons - one of the children was as young as eight. The majority of searches on children took place in Wishaw and Motherwell (48), Govan and Craigton (43), and the southeast of Glasgow (42). 'We're just used to it': A stop search case study Chloe Campbell was 11-years-old the first time she was stopped and searched. Now 18, she is not sure why she was targeted by police in Glasgow. \"It might be just a group of young people out playing with their friends or playing football - doing things young people should be doing. \"I think they judge people by what they're wearing - like if they're wearing tracksuits, got their hoods up, or got a cap on. \"It makes me feel like, why did you just do that? I was just going somewhere and you just stopped and searched me for no reason. \"They just stopped me and started asking questions - they interrogate you, they patronise you.\" Chloe, who is now getting support from Who Cares Scotland, says she has been searched another four times since then, with officers coming up empty-handed each time. The officers have never told her what they were looking for in the consensual searches. \"I think the police like stopping young people, and I think they get something out of it,\" claims Chloe. She says a young person may get wound up, and then mouth off at, or assault, an officer. \"But it was the police's fault for stopping and searching them.\" Chloe says she has have never bothered to complain. \"[Young people] are just used to it - it happens all the time.\" Professor Alan Miller, chairman of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, told BBC Scotland that consensual stop searches should be abolished as they are \"almost certainly unlawful.\" He said: \"Children are very vulnerable and they can't be expected to know what their rights are, or to be able to stand up for themselves. \"And it doesn't create a good relationship going forward between these young people and the police as they get older.\" The data also revealed: Assistant Chief Constable Nelson Telfer told BBC Scotland stop-search was a valuable tool in helping officers keep people safe. He said: \"Our data shows that a small number of under 12s were stop searched. \"Police officers will positively engage with young people and children and there are times when that engagement may move to a search which can result in the use of stop and search and often the removal of alcohol, cigarettes and other items. \"These interventions are vital in protecting the health and wellbeing of young people and children, and parents would expect us to remove alcohol and other harmful items from their children to keep them safe and prevent them becoming an offender or a victim.\" He added: \"Last year Police Scotland announced an undertaking to cease consensual searching of children less than 12 years of age. To support this decision, we have been reviewing searches of those aged between ages one and 11.

It says the way in which the UK leaves the EU and on what terms is critical for jobs and investment in the UK. It says defaulting to trading by World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would leave 90% of UK goods trade with the EU subject to new tariffs. The letter says that would mean 20% in extra costs for the UK's food and drink industry and 10% for car producers. These significant costs would affect British exporters and importers, as well as those in their supply chains, it adds. \"We respect the result of the referendum, but the government must make sure that the terms of the deal to leave ensure stability, prosperity and improved living standards,\" the groups write. \"Every credible study that has been conducted has shown that [the] WTO option would do serious and lasting damage to the UK economy and those of our trading partners.\" The letter calls for the government to \"give certainty to business by immediately ruling this option out under any circumstances\". 'Safeguard prosperity' One of the signatories, CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn, said the letter called for \"ruling out of the really worst options, to reassure investors that the UK was still a really good place to invest\". \"There is a negotiation that's going to take place, and I think businesses completely understand that,\" she said. \"But falling into WTO rules in only 29 months from now, would mean up to 90% of goods could potentially have tariffs on them, there would not be the passports for our services industries.\" Analysis: Theo Leggett, business correspondent It increasingly looks as though Britain is heading for a so-called \"hard Brexit\" - and business leaders are becoming very worried. At the Conservative Party conference, Theresa May made it clear the country would not remain in the EU's single market if doing so meant losing control of immigration. Yet European leaders insist that free movement of goods and services comes hand in hand with the free movement of people. The uncertainty - and the prospect of trade with the EU becoming subject to tariffs and other trade barriers - has been driving down the value of the pound, which has been trading against the dollar at a level not seen in more than three decades. So this letter offers a stark warning. The UK, it says, needs access to the single market. Leaving the EU and reverting to international trade rules would do serious and lasting damage to the UK economy. Costs for businesses would go up. Jobs could be lost. But this message isn't new - and the evidence suggests the prime minister has other priorities. So will she be listening? The letter she signed also says there is a wealth of evidence to suggest EU negotiations will not be completed within the Article 50 two-year timeframe. \"Many areas of regulation now up for discussion are highly complicated... The government should therefore secure agreement of a transitional period, to ensure that businesses can continue to operate with no 'cliff edge' change to current circumstances until regulatory and legal changes can be implemented,\" it says. It concludes that the UK voted to leave the EU but not to cause living standards to decline: \"We want a Brexit that safeguards future prosperity for everyone across the UK.\" Mike Cherry, Federation of Small Businesses chairman, said the effect of uncertainty on the market was reflected in its quarterly index, showing confidence at its lowest level since 2012, and causing problems for small businesses. But he added: \"On the other side of that, there are many small businesses looking to overseas markets to export their goods, products and services. For them, this does present a tremendous opportunity to grasp more of the market overseas.\" 'Sovereign country' At the Conservative Party conference last Sunday, Prime Minister Theresa May said she would trigger Article 50, the clause needed to start the process of exiting the EU, by the end of March 2017. She said a \"trade-off\" between controlling immigration and trade with Europe was the \"wrong way of looking at things\". Britain, Mrs May said, had voted to become a \"fully-independent, sovereign country\" and would \"decide for ourselves\" how immigration was controlled alongside \"the best deal possible\" with the EU.", "output": "Business leaders plead against 'hard' Brexit", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The University of California scientists tested human prostate cells in the lab. They found a sex infection called trichomoniasis aided cancer growth. More research is now needed to confirm the link, they say in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Sex infection Trichomoniasis is believed to infect some 275 million people worldwide and is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection. Often, a person will have no symptoms and be unaware that they have it. Men may feel itching or irritation inside the penis, burning after urination or ejaculation, or a white discharge from the penis. Women may notice itching or soreness of the genitals, discomfort with urination, or a discharge with an unpleasant fishy smell. This latest research is not the first to suggest a link between trichomoniasis and prostate cancer. A study in 2009 found a quarter of men with prostate cancer showed signs of trichomoniasis, and these men were more likely to have advanced tumours. The PNAS study suggests how the sexually transmitted infection might make men more vulnerable to prostate cancer, although it is not definitive proof of such a link. Prof Patricia Johnson and colleagues found the parasite that causes trichomoniasis - Trichomonas vaginalis - secretes a protein that causes inflammation and increased growth and invasion of benign and cancerous prostate cells. They say more studies should now follow to further explore this finding - particularly since we still do not know what causes prostate cancer. Nicola Smith, health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: \"This study suggests a possible way the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis could encourage prostate cancer cells to grow and develop more quickly. \"But the research was only done in the lab, and previous evidence in patients failed to show a clear link between prostate cancer and this common sexually transmitted infection. \"There's been a lot of research into prostate cancer risk and we're working hard to piece together the puzzle. \"But there are still no known lifestyle factors that seem to affect the risk of developing the disease - and no convincing evidence for a link with infection. \"The risk of prostate cancer is known to increase with age.\" Prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in men in the UK - about one in nine men will get it at some point in their lives. It is more common in men over 70, and there appears to be some genetic risk since the disease can run in families.", "output": "Prostate cancer 'may be a sexually transmitted disease'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

One requirement unique to Scots Law is the need for corroboration of the essential facts in the case against the accused. In other words that there must be two separate sources of evidence before a case can proceed to trial. It means that the accused cannot be convicted on the word of one person alone with no supporting evidence. Corroborated evidence does not have to come from forensic science or witness testimony: it can be circumstantial or in certain cases can relate to the previous convictions of the accused. For prosecutors, corroboration is a particular problem in rape cases, especially where the accused claims that sexual activity was consensual. The debate is hampered by a lack of recent reliable statistics but campaigners from Rape Crisis Scotland have claimed that the rate of rape convictions in Scotland was as low as 4.6% in 2009/10. In 2010 Lord Carloway, now the Lord Justice Clerk, Scotland's second most senior judge, was appointed to lead a wide-ranging review of Scots Law, including corroboration. Lord Carloway's appointment followed the case of a man who in 2009 successfully appealed against an assault conviction on the grounds that he had been denied access to a lawyer while being interviewed by the police. This was standard practice: until the Cadder case, suspects could be questioned in Scotland for six hours without a lawyer present. That has now changed after Mr Cadder won his case in the UK Supreme Court, which ruled that denying a suspect access to a lawyer contravened the European Convention on Human Rights. Suspects in Scotland now have a right to a lawyer from the point at which they are \"detained\" although the time they may be detained without charge has been extended to 12 hours or, in certain cases, 24 hours. Rape Crisis Scotland claims that Cadder will further push down rape convictions because suspects are now more likely to take the advice of a lawyer and remain silent during police interviews. Lord Carloway's report recommended, among other things, that corroboration be abolished. As part of his review, research carried out by Scotland's prosecuting authority, the Crown Office, found that between July and December 2010, no criminal proceedings were taken in 141 of the cases involving allegations of serious sexual offences which were reported to the National Sex Crimes Unit. Prosecutors argued that 95 of those cases could have gone to trial if corroborative evidence had not been needed. The recommendation to scrap corroboration is supported by the Scottish government, the Crown Office, Police Scotland and campaigners for victims of domestic violence and rape. It is opposed by all of Scotland's other high court judges, led by Lord Gill, Scotland's most senior judge. Making particular reference to rape cases, the judges have warned that \"the abolition of corroboration may result in miscarriages of justice\". It is also opposed by many criminal lawyers. Some have even argued that the proportion of rape convictions might fall if corroboration is removed because police investigations might be less rigorous. Nonetheless, the justice secretary in the Scottish Government, Kenny MacAskill, is now pressing ahead with a bill to remove the requirement for corroboration, arguing that, \"the rule stems from another age, its usage has become confused and\u2026it can bar prosecutions that would in any other legal system seem entirely appropriate.\" The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill is now before the Scottish Parliament where it is expected to pass the first of three stages - consideration by MSPs on the Justice Committee - at the end of February. The bill includes a proposal to increase the majority of jury members required to return a verdict from a simple majority to a two-thirds majority. Billed as a safeguard for the accused, this would mean that a jury with its full complement of 15 members would require at least a 10-5 split for a guilty verdict rather than a minimum of 8-7 at present. Lord Hamilton, who was Scotland's top judge until 2012, has suggested that a split of 12-3 would be safer. At least one alternative to abolishing corroboration has been suggested: allowing juries to take a suspect's refusal to answer questions into account when considering a verdict. At present, in Scotland - unlike in England - no inference can be drawn from an accused exercising his right to silence. For example, if a suspect does not mention during a police interview that he had consensual sex with his accuser but later relies on this as his defence when, say, DNA evidence emerges, then, at present, a jury cannot take this into account. At present it appears that the Criminal Justice Bill has the necessary support from MSPs to become law. Whether it does or not, the controversy about such fundamental redesign of a centuries-old legal system is unlikely to abate.", "output": "What is corroboration?", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

If you are hungry in Hungary, you could do a lot worse than tucking into one of Judit Szilagyi's dishes. When the 26-year-old student gets home from university, she spends her evenings roasting spicy vegetables, mashing creamy potatoes or frying sweet pancakes. She posts photos of her food on Piqniq, a new Budapest-based app, which allows her followers to request a portion for themselves. \"My biggest hobby in the world is to cook,\" she says. \"It's not the same if you don't have someone to share your food with. And if you've made too much to eat by yourself then why not give it to someone else who wants it?\" Nosy neighbours Gorging on someone else's half-gobbled goulash or snacking on their surplus sausages certainly won't be to everyone's taste, but Hungary's venture into the food-sharing economy follows the rapid success of similar start-ups around Europe. Greek company Cookisto began as a community to connect family cooks hoping to make some extra money with busy business people looking for an affordable hot dinner. In just 12 months it has attracted 40,000 members in Greece and the UK. Other similar sites include Shareyourmeal.net, which has 62,000 home cooks in the Netherlands and 20,000 in the rest of Europe - making food with influences from as far afield as Indonesia, Afghanistan, Japan and India - and Leftoverswap, which started in the US last year and now has an expanding base in Europe. Piqniq was co-founded by Tamas Kiss who used to travel a lot through his previous job as a consultant and missed Hungarian home cooking when he on the road. \"I wanted to build an app to allow me to peek into my neighbours' kitchens and see what they are eating, what they are making, what's in their fridge and then somehow connect with them,\" he explains. The start-up currently asks users to share meals free, although there are plans to allow cooks to sell their food to strangers in future. \"Our data shows that early adopters seem to be engaging either because they don't want to eat the same food every day or because they feel proud and want to show off about what they make. For others it is just about being social and having fun,\" adds Mr Kiss. Cutting waste In the not-for-profit sector, German-language sites lead the way, with a focus on stopping people throwing away leftovers at a time when a third of all our food ends up going to waste. Foodsharing.de and its sister initiatives in Austria and Switzerland have attracted more than 50,000 users since 2012. Analysis: Dr Lisa Ackerley, Chartered Environmental Health Practitioner The idea of sharing food to avoid waste is great, but my advice is to stick to non-perishable goods, such as sealed jars, packets or tinned items. Unprocessed fruit or vegetables are also a great option because you can see they are fit to eat. Sharing home-cooked food is more of a risk - even if you are swapping dishes between friends or colleagues - unless you can be sure that they follow hygienic practices. Even in the cleanest houses, good cooks can make mistakes when preparing meals, because of ignorance about simple food safety measures: for example, how to cool food down quickly after cooking and how to store it safely. In Germany alone, Foodsharing.de claims to have saved at least 35,000 tonnes of food that would otherwise have ended up in the bin. \"We find a wide range of users from those struggling with everyday food needs, [to] also those who are just happy to offer and share and end up getting nice things back,\" says co-founder and web developer Jean Wichert. He believes that the idea will gain further popularity as more Europeans embrace the sharing economy, which is currently strongest in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. From a recent global survey, Nielsen interviewed more than 30,000 internet users and found that 54% of European respondents embraced the idea of selling or exchanging items online, compared with 68% globally. Those living in southern and eastern Europe were most receptive to the concept. \"For years people have swapped food informally and done things like car-pooling or finding a lodger for a spare room. And now mobile technology is helping us to take things a step further,\" Mr Wichert says. But just as ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft and the apartment-loaning service Airbnb have faced questions about regulation and quality control, so food sharing sites are starting to attract criticism from those worried about health and safety standards. Social glue One food-sharing site that does offer checks is Casserole club, which encourages people to share meals with neighbours who are unable to cook for themselves. All of its 4,000 members in southern and central England must complete an online hygiene course and have a criminal record check before they prepare their first meal. Most-shared foods Source: Founders of each site Piqniq's co-founder Tamas Kiss has defended its open-door membership policy. \"If you go to a barbecue, you don't ask the host how they prepared their hamburgers. You don't question someone who brings a cake baked by their grandmother into the office.\" He says that photo posts and online \"high fives\" (similar to liking something on Facebook), should give app users a good indication of what they can expect from chefs. And he has high hopes that his business model is set for success. \"We want to reach that stage where if you are hungry, you can turn to our app wherever you are in the world.

The reason for this embrace, simply, is the single market. Initially, there had been little-to-no interest in the UK election in German business circles. Most, like the polls, assumed a comprehensive win for Theresa May, and the size of her majority was seen as being of negligible consequence to the direction of Brexit negotiations. As one chief executive of a German-based multinational put it: \"A weak or strong UK government still really has no negotiation power in the Brexit. The EU will still set the agenda and terms.\" Indeed, many firms, especially those in the Mittelstand - Germany's small and medium-sized businesses that often have close links to the UK - had been working on the assumption of a so-called \"hard Brexit\" for months. Quite a few mentioned that they were courting other growing EU export markets - Poland, for example. But as the polls began to narrow, there was a last minute scurry to understand what a Jeremy Corbyn-led approach to Brexit would be - with some privately concluding that the chances of keeping Britain in the single market might be higher under Mr Corbyn, even as they disagreed with many parts of his economic platform. What seemed like a last ditch effort by the head of the BDA, the German Employers Association, to find a solution that would enable the UK government to negotiate some form of single market access after Brexit, suddenly didn't seem as far-fetched. This morning, Ingo Kramer, the BDA's president, wasted no time in declaring that the UK election results showed \"nationalism and anti-EU rhetoric\" could not lead to majorities, before adding, somewhat triumphantly: \"We can only hope that more realism and pragmatism will now be injected into the Brexit negotiations.\" Jorg Kramer, Commerzbank's chief economist, reacted with similar cheer, saying Thursday's result was a \"vote against a hard Brexit\". The head of the BDI, Dieter Kempf, said a \"hard Brexit\" had been voted out, and that it was time for the UK government to \" de-escalate its rhetoric\". The Dax share index in Frankfurt rose by almost 1%. Yet the reaction has not been unanimously favourable. Some, including the quietly influential VDMA - which represents German engineering firms, said they feared a hung parliament or minority government would derail negotiations for months, or kick them into the long grass, leading to far greater uncertainty. \"The unclear political situation after the elections in the UK will make the Brexit negotiations even more difficult,\" said Thilo Brodtmann, VDMA's chief executive. Mr Brodtmann added that the result was \"bad news\" for German mechanical engineering firms, who export 7.3bn euros worth to the UK every year, and that there was now an increased risk of no agreement being reached by the 2019 deadline. Martin Wansleben, who leads the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, or DIHK, struck a similarly downbeat tone. The lack of a clear majority had led to an increase of uncertainty in the German economy, he said, and the \"road map for Brexit negotiations is now obsolete\". A handful of small business owners, whose trade links with the UK are less vital, suggested a swift and smooth Brexit resolution remained paramount, as the act itself had long been priced in, whether hard or soft. But regardless of the reaction, one thing seems certain.

This may not be the same message we hear from Boris Johnson on Sunday. That means we could soon see different parts of the UK operating under different lockdown rules. Already there has been some variation between the UK's four nations. The Scottish government have advised everyone to wear a face covering in busy places where social distancing is not possible, like on public transport or in supermarkets. All non essential building sites in Scotland have been closed but housebuilders have reopened sites in England. Nicola Sturgeon announced school closures before the UK government. And it is very likely that Scottish schools will return to normal operations after those in England. Despite these differences UK politicians often talk about a \"four nations\" approach to dealing with coronavirus. They seem to agree it is desirable that the whole of UK operates under the same rules. But it's clear that if they can't agree on what those rules should be then some divergence is inevitable. Nicola Sturgeon is obviously concerned that the prime minster may lift some lockdown restrictions earlier than she believes would be wise for Scotland These decisions are, she says, quite literally a matter of life and death. So she will not be rushed or pressured into moving more quickly than she believes is safe. Her view is that if we are to maintain a UK-wide approach then all parts of the UK will have to agree to move at the pace of the slowest nation. If the prime minister wants to move faster he can do so for England but he can't make any of the other UK nations do the same. Despite her caution Nicola Sturgeon has already made public more details of how lockdown could eventually be lifted. These include proposals for allowing more outdoor activities, allowing people to meet up with others from outside their households and getting the NHS back to normal operations, while simultaneously saying the rule for now remains \"Stay Home\". She doesn't seem to be concerned that this sends mixed messages about what we are and are not allowed to do.

The legal papers also reveal the American supplier of the PPE called the deals \"lucrative\". The Department of Health said proper checks are done for all contracts. A legal dispute playing out in the courts in Miami has helped shine a light on the amount of money some companies have made supplying the NHS with equipment to protect staff from Covid infection. Earlier this year, as the coronavirus pandemic was spreading rapidly around the world, Florida-based jewellery designer Michael Saiger set up a business to supply PPE to governments. He used his experience of working with factories in China to land what are described as \"a number of lucrative contracts\" supplying protective gloves and gowns to the NHS. Mr Saiger signed up a Spanish businessman, Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson, to help with \"procurement, logistics, due diligence, product sourcing and quality control\" of the PPE equipment. In effect, Mr Andersson was expected to find a manufacturer for deals that had already been done. Further $20m pledged Mr Andersson was paid more than $28m (\u00a321m) for his work on two government contracts to supply the NHS. He was described in court documents as having done \"very well under this arrangement\". In June, Mr Saiger signed three more agreements to supply the NHS with millions of gloves and surgical gowns. When the UK government paid up, his go-between, Mr Andersson, would have been in line for a further $20m in consulting fees. But the court documents allege that once the agreements had been signed, Mr Andersson stopped doing any work for Mr Saiger. It's not clear whether Mr Andersson received any of the money for this second batch of deals. This led to PPE deliveries being delayed to NHS frontline workers, Mr Saiger claims, and the company \"scrambling\" to fulfil the contracts by other means. So far the UK's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has published contracts with Mr Saiger's company, Saiger LLC, totalling more than \u00a3200m. These were awarded without being opened to competition. 'Huge profits' Alongside the legal dispute in Florida, the deals are set to be challenged in UK courts, by campaign group the Good Law Project. It accuses government ministers of not paying \"sufficient regard\" to tax-payers' money over a contract with the firm. \"We do not understand why, as late as June, government was still making direct awards of contracts sufficiently lucrative as to enable these sorts of profits to be made,\" Jolyon Maugham, the project's director told the BBC. \"The real criticism that is to be made here is of the huge profits that government allows to be generated.\" This is not the first time concerns have been raised about PPE contracts the DHSC signed during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year, the BBC revealed that 50 million face masks the government bought could not be used in the NHS because of safety concerns. And last week, it exposed concerns that the government had leaned on safety officials to certify PPE which had been wrongly classified. A DHSC spokesperson said the department had been \"working tirelessly\" to deliver PPE, with more than 4.9 billion items delivered to frontline health workers so far and nearly 32 billion items ordered \"to provide a continuous supply\". They added: \"Proper due diligence is carried out for all government contracts, and we take these checks extremely seriously.\" The BBC asked Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson for comment but he has not so far responded. Saiger LLC said: \"At the height of the pandemic, and at a time when the NHS was in need of high-quality PPE that met the required safety standards, we delivered for Britain, on time and at value. \"At no time have we ever used any 'middlemen'.
