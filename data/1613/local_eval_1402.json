In 1995, on the night of their high school graduation, Chris attends Jamie's graduation party, and confesses his feelings to her by writing them in her yearbook; when he tries to return her yearbook to her, however, it is swiped by Jamie's ex-boyfriend Tim (Ty Olsson) and he reads it aloud at the party. Chris is then publicly humiliated when she doesn't reciprocate his feelings, instead giving him a kiss on the cheek and saying she loves him like a brother. After Jamie yells at their classmates for making fun of him, Chris storms away humiliated from the party on his bicycle, vowing to leave town and become more successful than all of them.Ten years later, Chris is handsome and successful with a thriving career as a record producer in Los Angeles and a reputation as a ferocious womanizer. Just before Christmas, his boss (Stephen Root) orders him to take up-and-coming pop singer Samantha James (Anna Faris) to Paris so that she will sign with their company. Chris goes reluctantly, as he has a history with the self-obsessed James. On the duo's \"business\" trip to Paris, Samantha sets her private jet on fire by neglecting to remove the aluminum foil from her microwave dinner. This necessitates an emergency landing in New Jersey, not far from Chris's hometown. He takes her to his mother's house for the night, causing him to face the humiliating high school years he left behind and his unresolved feelings for Jamie.Stepping out to the local bar, Chris runs into some old friends, including Jamie, who is working her way through graduate school as a bartender. Thinking that he can finally get his high school love out of his system, Chris plans to woo and seduce Jamie. However, a number of unexpected problems and the growing realization that his friendship with Jamie actually did mean something to him keep getting in the way. He bonds with Jamie on several occasions. But Dusty Lee Dinkleman, an even nerdier kid in school has now become a successful musician, and plans to have sex with Jamie and publicly humiliate her like she did to him when she told him she didn't like him. Jamie and Dusty bond and eventually he turns her against Chris when Samantha destroys Jamie's family's Christmas decorations thinking that Chris was sleeping with Jamie behind her back (she thinks that she and Chris are in a relationship). Angry and disappointed with Jamie and her family, Chris returns to LA only to realize that Jamie is the one for him. He leaves for his hometown again, goes to Jamie's house, and declares his love for her. And the film ends with some neighborhood kids watching Jamie and Chris kiss and a little boy gives one of the girls a cookie he made for her and she says \"Thanks, you're a good friend'\" suggesting that he may go through the same experience.(Source: WikiPedia.

They divided the universe into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors on the planet, feeding off of their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor.Hal Jordan, a cocky test pilot working at Ferris Aircraft, is chosen by the ring and transported to the crash site, where the dying Abin Sur appoints him a Green Lantern, telling him to take the lantern and speak the oath. At home he says the oath and is later whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with veteran Corps members Tomar-Re and Kilowog and Corps leader Sinestro, who believes he is unfit and fearful. Jordan quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern.Meanwhile, scientist Hector Hammond is summoned by his strikingly attractive, muscular[3] father, Senator Robert Hammond, to a secret government facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body, under the watchful eye of Amanda Waller. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers, at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his father's influence, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a party. Jordan saves the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris. Later, Hammond successfully kills his father by burning him alive, and telekinetically slams Waller into the ceiling, presumably killing or gravely injuring her. During the encounter Jordan learns of Parallax coming to Earth.Back on Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was once one of their own until he desired to control the yellow essence of fear, only to become the embodiment of fear itself. Arguing that the way to fight fear is by fear itself, Sinestro requests that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing to concede Earth's destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. Jordan appears and tries to convince the Guardians that fear will turn the users evil if its power is used, but they reject his pleas, and he returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax alone feeling defeated.Upon returning to Earth as the Lantern, Jordan saves Ferris from Hammond after a brief showdown with him. Parallax arrives, consumes Hammond's life force, killing him and then wreaks havoc on Coast City. After a fierce battle, with new-found strength, Jordan lures Parallax away from Earth and toward the Sun, destroying and killing Parallax. He loses consciousness after the battle and falls toward the sun, but is saved by Sinestro, Kilowog, and Tomar-Re. Later, the entire Green Lantern Corps congratulates him for his bravery. Sinestro tells Jordan he now bears the responsibility of protecting his sector as a Green Lantern.In a mid-credits scene, Sinestro, for some reason, steals the yellow ring and places it on his finger, causing his green suit and eyes to change yellow.", "output": "Question: What does Sinestro request?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: who loses consciousness after the battle?, Answer: Jordan, Question: Who is saved bysaved by Sinestro, Kilowog, and Tomar-Re?, Answer: Jordan, Question: who kills Parallax?, Answer: Jordan, Question: Who saves Ferris?, Answer: Jordan, Question: What does Hammond lose in exchange for special powers?, Answer: Sanity, Question: How money Lantern was per sector?, Answer: 1 Lantern per sector, Question: How many sectors is the universe divided into?, Answer: 3600, Question: How money sector they divide into the Universe?, Answer: 3600 sector, Question: Who does Jordan save after a showdown with Hammond?, Answer: Ferris, Question: What does Jordan try to convince the Guardians?, Answer: that fear will turn the users evil if its power is used, Question: What kind of power is the green essence?, Answer: Willpower, Question: What is the name of the intergalactic police force?, Answer: Green Lantern Corps, Question: What emotion does the yellow essence contain?, Answer: Fear., Question: Who is the Green Lantern?, Answer: Jordan, Question: What does sinestro steal?, Answer: Yellow ring, Question: What procedure is performed on Abin Sur?, Answer: Autopsy, Question: Who kills Hammond?, Answer: Parallax, Question: What is Hector Hammond's job?, Answer: Scientist, Question: Who tries to kill Robert?, Answer: Hector, Question: What do the Guardians tell Sinestro?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who appoints Hal Jordan a Green Lantern?, Answer: Abin Sur, Question: Where is Parallax going?, Answer: Earth, Question: How did the Guardians respond to Jordan's pleas?, Answer: they rejected them, Question: How to the Guardians explain how to fight fear?, Answer: with fear itself, Question: What planet was Parallax imprisoned on?, Answer: Ryut, Question: Where is Hal Jordan employed?, Answer: Ferris Aircraft, Question: Who is the evil villin?, Answer: Parallax, Question: Who imprisoned Parallax?, Answer: Abin Sur, Question: Who does Hammond try to kill?, Answer: Father, Question: What does Jordan do after his pleas are rejected?, Answer: returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax alone, Question: Who kills Parallax?, Answer: Jordan, Question: What planet did Abin Sur ceash land?, Answer: Earth, Question: What profession did Hector have?, Answer: scientist, Question: What does Sinestro believe can fight fear.?, Answer: fear., Question: Who's body was autopsied?, Answer: Abin Sur, Question: Who kills Hammond?, Answer: Parallax, Question: Who gives Jordan the title of Green Lantern?, Answer: Sinestro, Question: which color used to create an intergalactic police force?, Answer: green color, Question: What is the profession of Hector Hammond's father?, Answer: Senator", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Richard has returned home from the army to exact revenge on the tormentors of his mentally disabled younger brother Anthony. In the opening line of the film, Richard narrates \"God will forgive them. He'll forgive them and allow them into Heaven. I can't live with that.\" Richard and Anthony camp at an abandoned farm near the town, their reminiscences of childhood interspersed with flashbacks to Anthony's ordeal at the hands of the gang youth, and Richard's subsequent revenge. This revenge starts when the gang and their leader Sonny find out about his presence. He confronts Richard in a failed attempt to intimidate him. Richard's revenge begins with the older members of the gang. While they are asleep he sneaks into their house, wearing a green boiler suit and a gas mask. He spray paints one of the two men's hair multi-coloured and paints a target on the back of the other's suit. On the same evening he enters Sonny's house and applies make up to Sonny's face.However things soon turn nasty as Richard sneaks into a club where the gang are hiding out and playing cards and kills one of their members with an axe, using his blood to scribble the words \"One Down\" on the wall. The gang take their car and go to the farm where Richard is staying with Anthony. Sending in Big Al (one of their members) to draw Richard out, Sonny prepares to shoot him with a rifle. However, he misses and kills Al. With no bullets remaining in the gun he decides to quickly retreat and return back to town.The surviving members return to a local petrol station where Tuff runs off, scared of Richard's revenge. The other three return home, they search the house expecting Richard to be there. However while they are upstairs Richard laces their kettle with a sizeable amount of drugs (LSD/Ketamine) taken from the gang earlier in the film. The three men become too intoxicated to properly react to Richard's presence and he kills them one by one. He shoots Sonny in the head, palm-strikes Soz at such an angle that he is killed, and finally stabs Herbie. Before killing Herbie he reveals he has already killed Tuff, although it is not revealed how, by producing his corpse in a suitcase.With one member of the original gang left - a reformed character with a wife and children - Richard abducts him and takes him to an old outbuilding. It is now revealed that Anthony died long ago, hanging himself after the gang abandoned him with a noose around his neck. The Anthony that is seen with Richard throughout the film is, in fact, a hallucination. During this confrontation, Richard confesses to his heinous crimes, describing the blood on his hands, saying \" Now I'm the monster...\", and \"You were supposed to be the monster...now I'm the fucking beast.\" He describes the crimes he's committed and is unsure of what else he's capable of doing, he also says that all he wants is to lie down with his brother, and demands the final gang member kill him, which he does, after Richard tells him to think of his children and begging him to kill him. The gang member is then shown distraught, with his hands covered in blood.

She moves into apartment 1303 on the thirteenth floor of a downtown Detroit apartment building. A 9-year-old neighbor, Emily, explains to Janet that a previous occupant of her new apartment killed herself. Strange things begin to occur in the apartment and when Janet appears bruised at work, she rebuffs concerns that her boyfriend, Mark, is abusing her and blames the marks on sleepwalking.Janet is shaken by the strange events that are happening preferring to stay late at the office rather than return to apartment 1303. She calls her sister, Lara, to ask if she can return home but Lara informs her this would be a bad idea as their mother is having another \"drunk psycho rant\". Janet suggests going to a hotel but this is quickly dismissed as Lara is not able to pay for it. Janet then calls Mark who is back in town and he agrees to call round. Later that night, Janet is awoken by strange supernatural elements in the apartment but unfortunately Mark is no longer around. An invisible ghost possesses Janet leading to her own depression and suicide. Her sister, Lara, later arrives to gather the possessed Janet's belongings and begins to experience the same terrors.A detective that was on the case talks to Lara and she believes Janet was murdered. He agrees since he's been investigating unknown suicides with other tenants. Lara discovers the name of the first tenant from 20 years back, Jennifer Logan. The detective tells Lara the sad story of what happened to Jennifer. At the age of 12, she moved in to apartment 1303 with her mother, Mary, a respectable school teacher and recently divorced. For the first few years in the apartment, they lived in peace and Mary was a loving mother to Jennifer.However, the peace was shattered when Mary lost her job as a teacher during a dispute with a parent in a parent-teacher conference. She found work as a prostitute to pay for the apartment, became an alcoholic and brutally abused Jennifer. This leads to Jennifer murdering Mary and burying her in a built in closet. Soon neighbors complained about the smell of the apartment, causing the police and the health department to investigate. By the time they got to the apartment to confront Jennifer, she had already committed suicide by jumping out the window and the police found the decomposed body of Mary. In the years that followed, more tenants were thought to have committed suicide with Janet being the recent one.While taking a bath, Lara gets a cryptic warning from Janet to leave the apartment and never come back. However, another dispute with Maddie has Lara moving into the same apartment and unintentionally ignoring Janet's warning. Jennifer soon arrives and kills Mark by throwing him out the window. Horrified, Lara tries to escape the apartment complex to avoid Jennifer trying to kill her and permanently stay away from the complex for good. However, she catches Emily and the landlord, O'Neill in front of her. He finally reveals the truth to Lara about his and his daughter, Emily's fate.

When Jennifer starts to close in on her, Lara grabs a knife to try to defend herself. As Maddie tries to talk some sense to Lara, Jennifer pushes her towards the knife and kills her. Just before she can finish the job to kill Lara, the police arrive and Jennifer disappears. Lara is arrested for both Maddie and Mark's murder and is taken away to be booked.

Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman), a former boxer, owns \"Ambush\", but loses it in an arranged fight against a bull belonging to promoter and carnival owner Ricky (Kevin Durand), who sees Charlie as a joke, partially because he beat Charlie the last time they competed in the ring. Having made a bet that Ambush would win, Charlie now has a debt to Ricky\u00e2\u0080\u0094which he runs out on.After the fight, Charlie learns that his ex-girlfriend died and he must attend a hearing deciding the future of their son, Max (Dakota Goyo). There, Max's aunt, Debra (Hope Davis), and her wealthy husband, Marvin (James Rebhorn), request full custody, which Charlie concedes for $100,000, half in advance, on the condition that Charlie retains Max for three months. Thereupon, Charlie, Max, and Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lilly), the daughter of Charlie's former boxing coach, acquire the once-famous \"Noisy Boy\" and arrange a fight, where he is destroyed by \"Midas\". Attempting to scavenge parts of a new robot from a junkyard, Max discovers \"Atom\", an obsolete but intact sparring robot designed to withstand severe damage, and capable of mirroring its handler's movement due to its rare \"shadow function\" module.At Max's behest, Charlie pits Atom against \"Metro\", whom Atom overcomes. Max convinces Charlie to control Atom, resulting in a series of victories and culminating with the defeat of national champion \"Twin Cities\". Elated by their success, Max challenges global champion \"Zeus\". After the fight, Ricky and his two henchmen attack and rob Charlie of his winnings, which prompts him to return Max to Debra. While talking with Bailey about the events, the two kiss, revealing their attraction to each other. Persuaded by Bailey, Charlie arranges the challenge offered by Max and convinces Debra to allow Max to witness the fight.During the fight, Atom's vocal-respond controls are damaged, forcing Charlie to activate its \"shadow function\" to make it mimic his boxing skills.

Howie, a devout Christian, is disturbed to find the islanders paying homage to the pagan Celtic gods of their ancestors. They copulate openly in the fields, include children as part of the May Day celebrations, teach children of the phallic association of the maypole, and place toads in their mouths to cure sore throats. The Islanders, including Rowan's mother (Irene Sunters), appear to be attempting to thwart his investigation by claiming that Rowan never existed.While staying at the Green Man Inn, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the annual harvest, each featuring a young girl as the May Queen. The photograph of the most recent celebration is suspiciously missing; the landlord tells him it was broken. The landlord's beautiful daughter, Willow (Britt Eklund), attempts to seduce Howie, but he refuses to have premarital sex.After seeing Rowan's burial plot, Howie meets the island's leader, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), grandson of a Victorian agronomist, to obtain permission for an exhumation. Lord Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in Scotland's climate, and encouraged the belief that old gods would use the new strains to bring prosperity to the island. Over the next several generations, the island's inhabitants fully embraced the pagan religion.Howie finds the missing harvest photograph, showing Rowan standing amidst empty boxes. His research reveals that when there is a poor harvest, the islanders make a human sacrifice to ensure that the next will be bountiful. He comes to the conclusion that Rowan is alive and has been chosen for sacrifice. During the May Day celebration, Howie knocks out and ties up the innkeeper so he can steal his costume and mask (that of Punch, the fool) and infiltrate the parade. When it seems the villagers are about to sacrifice Rowan, he cuts her free and flees with her into a cave. On exiting it, they are intercepted by the islanders, to whom Rowan happily returns.Lord Summerisle tells Howie that Rowan is not the intended sacrifice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Howie himself is. He fits their gods' four requirements: he came of his own free will, with \"the power of a king\" (by representing the Law), is a virgin, and is a fool. Defiant, Howie loudly warns Lord Summerisle and the islanders that the fruit-tree strains are failing permanently and that the villagers will turn on him (Lord Summerisle) and sacrifice him next summer when the next harvest fails as well; Summerisle angrily insists that the sacrifice of the \"willing, king-like, virgin fool\" will be accepted and that the next harvest will not fail. The villagers force Howie inside a giant wicker man statue, set it ablaze and surround it, singing the Middle English folk song \"Sumer Is Icumen In\". Inside the wicker man, a terrified Howie recites Psalm 23, and prays to Christ. He curses the islanders as he burns to death. The wicker man collapses in flames, revealing the setting sun.", "output": "Question: What has a phallic association?, Answer: the Maypole, Question: Who tries to seduce Howie?, Answer: The landlord's beautiful daughter,Willow., Question: Who plays Sergeant Howie?, Answer: Edward Woodward, Question: Who saves Rowan ?, Answer: Howie saves Rowan., Question: Where does Howie stay?, Answer: At the Green Man Inn., Question: How do the Islanders cure sore throats?, Answer: put toads in their mouths, Question: What does Howie find ?, Answer: Howie finds the missing harvest photograph., Question: Who has been chosen for sacrifice ?, Answer: Rowan has been chosen for sacrifice.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Travelling there with Marsh, his colleague (Bryan Forbes), Quatermass finds a huge complex under construction, based on his lunar colony plans. Marsh finds an undamaged meteorite is shaped like a small stone rocket. It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd V-shaped mark on his face. Black-clad guards from the complex arrive, armed with machine guns and sporting similar V-shaped marks, and take Marsh away, knocking down Quatermass and ordering him to leave.Trying to discover what happened to Marsh, Quatermass contacts Inspector Lomax (John Longden), who had previously assisted him (see The Quatermass Xperiment). Lomax puts him in touch with Vincent Broadhead (Tom Chatto), a Member of Parliament, who has been trying to uncover the veil of secrecy surrounding Winnerden Flats. Quatermass joins Broadhead on an official tour of the complex, which he is told has been built to manufacture artificial food. Slipping away from the visiting party, Broadhead attempts to get inside one of the large domes that dominate the skyline. Quatermass later finds him dying, covered in a poisonous black slime.Shot at by guards as he exits, Quatermass rushes to Inspector Lomax, explaining that he believes that the complex is indeed making food but not for human consumption. Its purpose is to provide a suitable living environment for small alien creatures being housed inside the huge domes. Lomax attempts to alert his superiors, but when he meets the Commissioner of Police, he notices that he, too, is sporting the V-shaped mark; the aliens have taken control of the government.Quatermass and Lomax then turn to journalist Jimmy Hall (Sid James), who is skeptical of their story but asks to visit Winnerden Flats. At the local community centre, they receive a hostile reception from locals employed to do heavy construction and other work at the complex. The mood changes, however, when one of the meteorite-missiles crashes through the building roof, injuring barmaid Sheila (Vera Day). Armed guards arrive and gun down Hall after he telephones the press. The villagers form a mob that marches on the complex. Rushing the gates, Quatermass, Lomax, and the villagers barricade themselves in the pressure control room.Realising that earth's atmosphere must be poisonous to the aliens, Quatermass sabotages their life support system, pumping oxygen into the large domes. Simultaneously, Quatermass' assistant, Brand (William Franklyn), sacrifices his life by launching a Quatermass rocket at an asteroid believed to be the invasion's staging point. The individual creatures combine their small bodies to create huge 150-foot tall creatures that soon burst from the domes. The rocket destroys the asteroid with a nuclear explosion. Their base gone and now fully exposed to earth's atmosphere, the giant masses of combined creatures collapse and die. The V-shaped marks disappear from those affected, leaving them with no memory of having been under alien control. As they head back to the village, Lomax wonders aloud how he'll make a believable report on all that's happened.

At work, Hal's co-workers accuse him of being shallow and caring about nothing but physical appearance, and ask him \"when he's gonna get it.\" Hal wants to see women for their inner beauty, but his appreciation of physical beauty gets in the way. While going to work one day, by an unexpected twist of fate, Hal meets the famous American life coach Tony Robbins while stuck in an elevator, and has a talk with him about himself and Tony. Robbins, understanding Hal's situation, hypnotizes him into seeing people's inner beauty, not their external selves. Subsequently he falls in love with Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), a woman who appears to him to look slender and beautiful due to her kind, generous nature, but is, in actuality, morbidly obese. At first, she accuses him of being childish, because she thinks he's pretending to date her, but later realises his feelings for her are genuine.His concerned friend Mauricio is worried about Hal's new taste in women, especially when he finds Hal dancing with a fat woman, thinking he's gone crazy. Mauricio believes what Robbins did to him was deceitful and wrong, and he talks to Robbins. One night, while Hal is on a date, Mauricio catches him after having confronted Robbins and says the trigger phrase,\"Shallow Hal wants a gal\", to break Hal's hypnosis. Discovering that his own sight had misled him, Hal, with Mauricio's assistance, begins to avoid Rosemary, whom he initially fails to recognize. She becomes melancholic without him around. Still distraught, Hal decides to get to know his neighbor, Jill, and the two get together at a restaurant and have a nice chat. Rosemary, suspicious of Hal's staying away, goes to the same restaurant where Hal and his friend are. Making assumptions about his relationship with Jill, she calls him a 'psycho' over the phone, which depresses Hal greatly. The day after, he meets a girl at a hospital where Rosemary works. Previously, due to Robbins' hypnosis, he saw her as a perfect looking little girl, he is now seeing her as a pretty little girl with severe burn marks on her face. This experience clarifies that he doesn't need hypnosis to see people's true inner beauty. Meanwhile, Rosemary decides to leave the country to re-join the Peace Corps. During his search for Rosemary to tell her the truth, he finds that Mauricio himself has his own reason for stopping Hal's hypnosis: he has a vestigial tail which has prevented him from ever getting close to a woman, and he was jealous that his friend found someone with whom he was happy. Hal eventually makes up with Mauricio, comes to terms with his feelings and his true love for Rosemary and decides to talk to her again.

Moments later, Alicia finds her body and contacts the police, resulting the body removed and stationed two officers on the outside premises.Meanwhile, the director creates an idea by altering the play's script; he renames the show's antagonist to Irving Wallace instead of an ambiguous killer, and insists that everyone stay the night to begin immediate rehearsals with the new material.

After a visit to his informant Booty (Anthony Mackie) (who is later gunned down), he sets up a buy. He is to go to a diner and be reading a USA Today. Unfortunately, Andy is in the diner, and his favorite newspaper is USA Today. A menacing Englishman (Luke Goss) sits next to him and hands him a paper bag with his taste in it then leaves. Andy pulls a cell phone out of it, then a gun, which the waitress sees and thinks Andy's holding the place up. That's when Vann walks into the diner and cuffs him. Soon, Vann realizes that the gun traffickers mistook Andy for him, and drags Andy along with him. The cell phone that Fiddler receives rings, with the menacing Brit, whose name we later find out is Joey, is on the other end of the line. He wants Turk (the pseudonym that Vann used when setting up the buy) to drop $20,000 dollars in a certain trash can. Vann reveals that he has the money, and needs Fiddler to drop it.Andy tries to perform the drop plain and simple. Unfortunately, a homeless guy screws this up, and the traffickers just drive by. Andy gets another call asking him what happened. He tells them that there were complications. Joey says he will call back in about an hour. Meanwhile, Andy tries to get away, only to have Vann graze him with a gunshot to the rear. Before Vann picks him up, Andy gets word to 9-1-1 via the cellphone, running a make on Vann's license plate numbers. Vann then suggests Andy use the taco sauce in his glove compartment to ease the pain of the bullet wound. Andy's 9-1-1 call proves effective and a group of squad cars pull them over, much to Vann's dismay, and he is furious at Andy for running a make on his plate. The police discover that Vann is ATF and move aside.Vann tells Andy that he is going to make a stop at a friends house. The friend is a gun dealer that Vann knows named Manny Cortez. He finds Manny shot dead on his toilet seat. The killer was Joey. At the same time, Andy, who is handcuffed to the passenger door, attempts to drive the car with one hand. Vann chases after him in a car he borrows and eventually pulls him over.When back in the car, Andy complains that he is hungry. Vann takes him to a burger joint, where Fiddler complains that red meat doesn't agree with him, but he eats the burger anyway. Back in the car, Fiddler gets extremely gaseous. After quickly exiting the car, Vann gets a call from his ex-wife Dara (Rachael Crawford), who reminds him about his daughter Kate's (Tomorrow Baldwin Montgomery) dance recital in a few hours. Vann takes a quick break from the gun busts for this brief visit. On the way there, Andy teaches him how to curb his use of the word \"fuck\".When they arrive, Vann explains to Kate that he's on assignment, and can't come. She is dismayed. Then Andy shows Kate some pictures of his family. Vann gets distracted when the phone that Joey gave to Fiddler rings.Joey says he wants to meet Turk in a restaurant, where they will make the exchange. However, Joey says he wants $500,000 for the whole batch. Vann goes to his confiscated items buddy Santos (Horatio Sanz), who eventually gives into his requests. They head to the restaurant, and Andy enters. Fiddler sits down with Joey and discusses the deal. After some questions from Joey about how he got the money so fast he throws Joey the money saying it means nothing to a powerful trafficker like him. He also gives Joey back the cell and tells him that he makes the calls now. When Andy tells Vann what he did, he is furious, but Andy explains that they now get to decide where the meeting takes place, and get backup there. He also tells Vann that they should let Joey simmer for a bit before calling him. Fiddler suggests that they go to Vann's daughter's dance recital, which they do.After that, they leave and call Joey. They arrange for a meeting which they attend with no backup. Upon meeting Joey and his cronies, Joey asks who Vann is. Andy tells him that Vann will do anything that is told. After an embarrassing confession to this by Vann, they are taken to Joey's residence, where, for some reason, they are put in the pool. Joey tells them that he still thinks Vann is a cop. Vann admits this, and tells them that he is betraying the service to make some money. Joey is convinced, and Vann takes Andy to his hotel, and they say goodbye.The next day, Andy gives his speech, and it goes well. When he exits the building, Internal Affairs agent Peters (Miguel Ferrer) grabs him and throws him in a surveillance truck. They tell him that Vann was lying to both him and them, and that he is actually trying to buy the guns and killed Booty, Cortez, and Vann's partner himself. They need him to wear a wire and get a confession out of Vann.Meanwhile, back at ATF offices, Vann is suspended for his actions of the past day, and his boss (Susie Essman), distrustful of Andy from the start, tells him that Andy was setting him up. At the same time, Andy, now wired, enters Vann's office and says they need to talk. Vann says that they should talk in his car. Vann starts driving to the exchange with Andy in tow. Recognizing Andy's nervousness, Vann asks him straight out if he's wired. Andy admits he is but doesn't reveal whose wire it is.They enter the barn where the exchange is going to go down. After Joey asks where the money is, Vann tells him he'll show the money when Joey shows him the guns. Joey is skeptical and pulls a gun on Vann. That's when the police enter, after hearing everything through Andy's wire. Joey and most of his goons get mowed down, and Vann gets shot in the buttocks. Andy says he will get the taco sauce.

All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects that the military is covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright (Graves), who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that there have been a number of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo.Gigantic mutant locusts rampage over the countryside. Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes begin to track down the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly discover that the locusts which ate the grain have grown to the size of a city bus. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now are seeking human beings as a means of sustenance. It is also clear that they are headed for the city of Chicago. Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson (Ankrum), Colonel Sturgeon (Henry), and Captain Barton (Seay) to strategize a solution. Machine gun and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once. The United States Army and Illinois National Guard are called upon to help protect the city. But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and began to feast on human flesh as well as several buildings.General Hanson concludes that the only way to destroy the beasts en masse is to use a nuclear weapon and destroy Chicago. However, Dr. Wainwright realizes that the locusts are warm-weather creatures. He concludes that he might be able to lure the locusts into Lake Michigan. There, the cold water will incapacitate them, and they will drown. The lure itself will be a decoy locust mating call, generated electronically with test-tone oscillators. The plan is put into effect, and it works at the last possible moment. The monstrous locusts drown, but Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes wonder if other insects or animals might have eaten other radioactive crops.

They seem genuinely in love with each other even after 11 years of marriage. Ed runs his own trucking company; Connie does charitable fundraising which requires occasional commutes into New York City.On one of these trips it is so windy that people are literally being blown around, and Connie collides with a young man named Paul Martel, and falls and scrapes her knee. Paul invites her to his apartment for a band-aid. This leads to a phone call and visit next time she is in the city, then trips into the city for the sole purpose of seeing Paul, and soon they are having a full-blown affair.Ed notices the awkwardness in the relationship almost immediately, and his suspicions are further aroused when he catches Connie in a lie, and when a fired employee insinuates that there are things about Ed's family that he is not aware of. Finally he hires a private investigator, who soon furnishes pictures of Connie and Paul together.Ed goes to Paul's apartment, and during the discussion that follows, he sees a gift he had once given Connie that she recently gave Paul.

While he is doing this, Connie calls and leaves a message on Paul's answering machine that she wants to end the affair. Ed loads the carpet with Paul's body into the trunk of his car, and later dumps it in a landfill.Now it is Connie who senses awkwardness in their relationship. Cops visit investigating Paul's disappearance, because they found Connie's name and address in his apartment. Some time later, after the body is found, they come again.

Nearby, in a luxurious house, a famous opera singer named Giovanni Jones is rehearsing \"Largo al factotum\" from The Barber of Seville. However, Jones is distracted by Bugs' singing, and goes over and smashes his banjo over his head in a fit of anger. Bugs remarks, \"Music hater.\"Later, Jones is rehearsing again, but is again distracted by Bugs playing the harp and singing \"My Gal is a High Born Lady\" (with re-written lyrics). Jones destroys the harp and jams Bugs' head in it, causing him to remark, \"Also a rabbit hater. Oh, well.\" Bugs then decides to loudly play the tuba, but this does not impress Jones any more than previously. He ties Bugs' ears to a tree and beats his head against the branch. Fed up, Bugs makes his trademark Groucho Marx comment: \"Of course you know, dis means war!\"That night, Jones is performing a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, and begins by singing \"Chi mi frena in tal momento\". Bugs is sitting on top of the large stadium, and taps it with his fingers, the reverberation causing Jones to tremble slightly when he hits a certain note in the song. Bugs remarks, \"Acoustically perfect,\" and bangs on the stadium with a mallet, resulting in a much more violent reverberation & causing Jones to wildly shake and move around the stage, until he falls into a tuba player's instrument. Bugs takes Jones back stage, informing the audience of an interruption in the program, and orders the maestro to play a vamp. Bugs fixes Jones up backstage, and sprays liquid alum into his mouth. Jones goes back on stage and proceeds to sing the \"Figaro\" section of \"Largo al factotum\". With each singing of \"Figaro\", his head shrinks to an extremely small size and his voice grows extremely high in pitch.Later, Jones is due to go on stage again, but Bugs, dressed in a bobby soxer outfit, begs him to stop. Bugs showers Jones with praise, and asks for his autograph, giving him a pen which turns out to be a stick of dynamite. It explodes as Bugs sneaks away, and Jones steps onto stage, bows and faints.Finally, Bugs enters disguised as famous conductor Leopold Stokowski. Greatly in awe, all the orchestra members, Jones and the conductor immediately stop what they are doing, so Bugs can take over. He snaps the conductor's baton in half, and proceeds to conduct Jones through a bizarre performance with his hands. He receives rapturous applause, but Bugs is not finished. He then persuades Jones to hold a high note for an extremely long period of time. While Jones is holding the note, his clothes unravel and his face changes from one colour to another. Bugs slips his hand out of his glove for a brief period, and steps outside to order a pair of earmuffs, which he puts on to block out the noise. He returns to find Jones still holding the high note and pounding on the floor, but continues to have him hold the note. Eventually, this causes the Hollywood Bowl's dome to crack and fall apart. The debris crashes onto the stage, burying Jones.Bugs receives massive applause, and bows to the audience. The ravaged Jones also emerges from the rubble and bows. Just then, Bugs notices a large boulder suspended on a rafter. He gets Jones to hold the high note again, as the boulder tumbles off the rafter and hits Jones, finishing him off.

Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, The UK government built a massive 60-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of Britain. The quarantine was deemed a success; however, the extreme method employed by the government destroyed diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a dystopia.In 2035, 27 years after the quarantine, during a raid, police discover several people infected with Reaper Virus. The Prime Minister John Hatcher shares with domestic security chief Captain Nelson satellite footage of survivors in Scotland. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair to lead the team.Sinclair's team crosses the wall and goes to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals. Sinclair is interrogated by the gang's leader, Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall and leave Scotland. He leaves and joins the rest of the gang, who grill Dr. Talbot and eat him. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's dedicated partner. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol left to create his own army.Meanwhile, Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the central London area because of the infection. However, an infected man breaks into his office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Michael Canaris, Hatcher's right-hand man, quarantines him and takes his place as de facto Prime Minister. Hatcher later commits suicide.After leaving the train, Sinclair's group are arrested by soldiers armed with archaic weapons and armor. They are taken to a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, the rest of the group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.Sinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the forest and find an intact 2007 Bentley Continental GT, which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On the way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper's death. After a high-speed chase, Sol and many of his men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.The car is tracked down by a government gunship. Canaris arrives and reveals he will let the virus continue as a form of population control and profit. Cally's blood is to be used as a vaccine for the virus. Calley and Stirling board the gunship, while Sinclair chooses to stay behind. Nelson flies into the quarantine zone to speak with Sinclair and she gives him a recording of the conversation, the evidence to bring down Canaris.

The money iscurrently hidden in the Fleming family crypt in Zenith, he explains. Wellsrecalls a time, however, when Fleming was very sick and, in fever, talkedabout hiding the money in a hidden room in The Oaks. When Flemingannounces that, if Wells doesn't go for the deal, he'll kill Wells andcall it a \"hunting accident,\" Wells turns his shotgun on Fleming.I ain't afraid of ghosts, Lizzie tells Cornelia when they read in thepaper of John Fleming's death. Although the rest of the staff, except forWarner [John Sutton], the chauffeur, have quit their jobs, Lizzie intends to stay with\"Miss Corny\" under any circumstances. Because there's a storm brewing,Lizzie and Cornelia check to be sure all the doors and windows are shut.Lizzie suddenly sees a black-clawed hand reach through the front door,just about to grab Cornelia's throat. Lizzie's screams scare him off;Cornelia calls the police. They send someone over to check the grounds,but no one is found.Cornelia and Lizzie go upstairs and lock themselves in a bedroom.Meanwhile, The Bat has cut a hole in the front-door window, unlocked thedoor, and entered the house. As Cornelia and Lizzie try to sleep, he opensthe transom into their room and releases a bat that flits around for amoment, lands on Lizzie's arm, and bites her. Concerned that the bat maybe rabid, Cornelia phones Dr Wells. He's in his laboratory conducting anexperiment (on a bat!), but he comes over to look at Lizzie. He dressesher arm and gives her a sleeping pill. After examining the bat, heproclaims that it doesn't look sick but that he won't know for sure untilhe examines its brain under a microscope. Meanwhile, Lt Andy has takenadvantage of Dr Wells' absence and let himself into the lab where hesnoops around and notices the experimental bat and a figure of a large batin one of the windows. Andy then drives over to The Oaks, arriving just asWells is leaving. Andy points out the hole in the glass where The Batgained entrance and assures Cornelia that an officer will keep watch onthe house for the rest of the night.Several days/weeks? have gone by, and Victor Bailey's trial is comingup. His secretary, Judy Hollister [Darla Hood], apparently has some information thatwill help to acquit him, so people are beginning to suspect that JohnFleming robbed his own bank. Lt Anderson, concerned that his holdings atthe bank will be wiped out if the money isn't found, pays a visit to MarkFleming. Mark reveals that he hasn't received a dime of his inheritancefrom his uncle because the money is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile,Cornelia has managed to retain John Fleming's old maid, Jane Patterson [Riza Royce].When Dr Wells, Dale Bailey, and Judy Hollister drop by for tea, they alldiscuss the possibility that it was John Fleming who actually robbed thebank. Cornelia suggests that Fleming may have hidden the money in TheOaks, and Dale phones Mark to see whether there are any floorplans of thehouse. Mark isn't sure why she would want the floorplan, so Lt Andysuggests that maybe Uncle John DID steal the money and hid it in thehouse. Mark agrees to come over that evening and help look for the plans.Come over Mark does, but he lets himself into the house with his ownkey while Cornelia, Dale, and Judy are eating dinner. He moves aside agrandfather clock and opens a panel to a secret closet. While he looksover the floorplans, The Bat enters the house and sneaks up behind,clobbers Mark, and makes off with the floorplans. After dinner, Corneliais amazed to hear the grandfather clock striking the hour, when it hasn'tdone so in years. They notice that the clock has been moved, then Dalesees the panel behind it. They open the panel to find Mark Fleming...dead.Lt Anderson and Dr Wells are notified after the police are called. Afterseeing the claw marks on Mark's throat, Anderson proclaims it the work ofThe Bat.Later that night, after the police have combed the house for cluesand Mark's body has been taken to the morgue, Lt Anderson remains to makesure all the windows and doors are locked. As he checks the rooms, hedoesn't notice that Warner is watching him. After the ladies have gone tosleep, Cornelia and Lizzie in one room, Judy and Dale in another, The Batcomes in through the unlocked front door. First, he cuts the phone line.He then goes up to the third floor and into a storage room where he startstapping on the walls. The noise wakes up Judy and Dale. Thinking she maybe able to find the hidden money and clear her husband, Dale sneaks up tothe third floor. The Bat locks her in the room and runs downstairs. On theway down, he runs into Judy and kills her, then he flees out the frontdoor, after first being struck in the neck by a poker thrown by Cornelia.Shortly thereafter, Lt Andy comes in the front door. He explains thathe was chasing someone on the grounds and asks as to the whereabouts ofWarner the chauffeur. Warner suddenly comes in the front door and explainsthat he was following Anderson when he was suddenly hit on the head. It'sthen that Anderson remembers seeing a wanted poster with Warner's pictureon it, but Warner says that he was tried and acquitted. He vehementlydenies being The Bat. Suddenly, Dr Wells walks in the front door. He hadan accident about a mile down the road, he says, and walked back to thehouse to use the phone. Andy notices blood on Wells' neck. Hmmm, could DrWells be The Bat?Several nights later, after the house had been searched from top tobottom without finding any money or a hidden room, Cornelia decides toconduct an investigation of her own. When the detective on duty fallsasleep in his chair, Cornelia goes up to the third floor to look around inthe storage room where The Bat was tapping on the walls. Measuring thedistance between the storage room and the room next to it, Cornelianotices a loss of about five feet between the two rooms. She pounds on thewalls, then on the panels of a fireplace. Suddenly, one of the panelsopens up, revealing a switch that allows the fireplace to swing open.Cornelia has found the hidden room. It is empty, except for a safe in thewall. As she kneels before the safe, the fireplace swings closed, trappingher in the room.Meanwhile, The Bat has gone to Dr Wells' lab where he hangs a note onthe wall. It says: \"Here lies The Bat -- threatened with exposure hedestroyed himself.\" As The Bat turns around, Wells walks into the room withhis gun drawn. The doctor taunts The Bat with the fact that he knows wherethe money is hidden and that he's going to shoot The Bat and put his ownsign on his own chest. Just as Wells cocks the gun, The Bat leaps at him.They struggle, the gun goes off, and it is Wells who is shot.Cornelia's pounding on the walls wakes Lizzie, who notices thatCornelia's bed is empty. She goes down to the parlor and tries to wake upDetective Davenport [Robert Williams], only to find him drugged into sleep. Lizzie wakesthe maid who goes to get Warner, only to find him missing. The detectivecalls headquarters to alert Lt Anderson only to find that he's been sentto investigate the death of Dr Wells. The three of them -- Lizzie, Jane,and Davenport -- look outside for Cornelia, but she doesn't answer theircalls. Suddenly, Lizzie notices a light on the third floor and redirectseveryone up there. The air in the hidden room is rapidly depleting.Cornelia can barely manage call out. She tells them to hit the panels overthe fireplace and then passes out. Lizzie gives each panel a pound, findsthe switch, and opens the fireplace just in the nick of time.Outside the house, The Bat is slinking around in the bushes. He hasstarted the garage on fire, but Cornelia is wise to him. That fire was setto get us out of the house, she tells everyone. Instead of leaving, theyturn out the lights and wait. A few minutes later, The Bat appears. WhenThe Bat enters the hidden room, Davenport fires a shot. But The Bat isquicker and shoots Davenport. He then turns to the ladies who are hidingbehind some boxes. Just as he's about to open fire on the ladies, he isshot from behind. Warner enters the room, his gun smoking. They remove thehood from over the Bat's face to find ... Lt Anderson.

Concerned parents are lined up outside the schools waiting to escort their kids home for lunch. Signs along the street ask \"Wer ist der Morder?\" (Who is the murderer?) of eight children killed over the past year. Little Elsie Beckmann [Inge Landgut] has just become victim number nine.Who is the murderer? It could be anyone (the viewer knows that it is Hans Beckert [Peter Lorre]). Neighbors are turning in neighbors and fingering strangers in the street just for talking to a child. The police are on the job 24 hours a day, but all they have turned up so far is some Ariston cigarette butts, some sugar grains, and a bag that held candy. They have investigated over 1,500 clues and have compiled 60 volumes of documents. Every thicket, every bush, every hole in the area has been combed. Every place from flop houses to underworld hangouts are being raided every night.In fact, the police investigation has been so thorough that the Underground is getting worried about the shakedowns. Underworld boss Schr\u00e4nker [Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens] has come to the conclusion that the child killer must be found before the police ruin business. After a lengthy discussion with all the Underworld bosses in attendance [there is a wonderful scenario where the Underworld bosses discuss strategies while the police do the same, such that it hard to tell the difference between Gangsters and Police], they decide that the best solution is to monitor all children at all times and that the best persons to do that, the only ones who can be seen on the streets without arousing suspicions, are beggars. So, every street has its beggar sitting in a doorway, having a smoke on the corner, watching the children and noting anyone following or with a child.A break comes in the person of a blind balloon peddlar [Georg John] who hears a man whistling a tune and remembers the same tune being whistled by a man who purchased a balloon on the day Elsie Beckmann was murdered. He alerts his block's beggar, who follows the Beckert, who is leading a little girl into a candy store. When Beckert makes the mistake of throwing an orange peel on the sidewalk, the beggar pretends to slip on it and, while clutching Beckert for support, he transfers onto the back of Beckert's shoulder a big \"M\" that he previously chalked on his palm. The beggars are now able to follow the man with the \"M\" on his coat.Meanwhile, the police have been attempting to trace the origin of a postcard sent by the child killer to the local newspaper. While investigating released criminals and mental patients that fit the profile of the killer (lazy, indolent, and of strong and pathological sexuality), the police come to Hans Beckert's apartment. Beckert isn't home, but the landlady shows them in. Searching Beckert's room, they find some Ariston cigarettes and a red pencil, the likes of which was used to write the postcard. Certain that Beckert is the killer, the police lay in wait for Beckert to return.But Beckert is on the make. The little girl that he is with suddenly notices the \"M\" on his shoulder and offers to wipe it off. Certain that he has been caught, Beckert runs into an office building. The beggars contact Schr\u00e4nker who sends a group of gangsters to comb the building and capture the child killer. Unfortunately, the night watchman sounds an alarm, alerting the police. In the minutes before the police arrive, the gangsters find Beckert, and everyone, except for burglar Franz [Friedrich Gnass], manages to get out before the police arrive. To make Franz sing, Detective Lohmann lies to him that the night watchman at the building was killed during the gangsters' raid. The strategy has the desired effect. Fearing that he is going to face a murder rap, Franz tells how the gangsters have captured the child killer and taken him to an abandoned distillery to stand trial.Meanwhile, in the basement of the abandoned distillery a kangaroo court is in session, comprising of the leaders and the members of the various criminal organizations. When Beckert explains to Schr\u00e4nker that he is driven by a voice and an evil impulse he can't control, it is voted to eliminate him so that there is no chance of him ever getting free to murder another child. Only Beckert's appointed defense counsel [Rudolf Blumner] argues that, since Beckert is driven by an uncontrollable impulse, he cannot be held responsible for his actions and should be turned over to the police so that the state can render him harmless. At that moment, the police enter the distillery and escort Beckert away.Epilogue: As Beckert's real trial progresses, the mothers of the slain children listen to the verdict. The ultimate and final comment comes from Frau Beckmann [Ellen Widmann] who says that none of this will bring back the children and that mothers must keep a closer watch over them.

Roxanne speaks with Max and agrees to go with him to a party where Powerline's concert will be aired live. However, Mazur exaggerates the day's events to Goofy and forewarns him that Max's actions may result in him facing capital punishment, leaving Goofy anxious.Goofy decides to take Max on a fishing trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho, following a map route he and his father took years ago, and the two go into his station wagon. However, he is oblivious to what Max is planning to do with Roxanne, as Max finds himself constantly interrupted in his attempts to let Goofy know. Out of options, Max stops by Roxanne's house to call off their date, upsetting Roxanne so much that he is unable to explain why. When Roxanne says she will just have to go with someone else, Max desperately fabricates a story about his father knowing Powerline; he tells her he will be on stage at the concert.Despite his son's objections, Goofy plans his own trip, with initially disastrous results. Max hurts his father's feelings after his father humiliates him at an opossum-based theme park. While camping, Pete and P.J. join them.

However, when Jeff tells Gidget that he thinks it's great and that she should go to Hawaii, Gidget gives him back his pin, runs home and tells her folks she has changed her mind.On the plane en route to the Aloha State, Gidget meets Abby Stewart (Vicki Trickett) and popular dancer Eddie Horner (Michael Callan) who is en route to a performance at a theater-restaurant next to their hotel. They also meet three more men named Judge Hamilton (Joby Baker), Larry Neal (Don Edmonds), and Wally Hodges (Bart Patton). Abby enjoys the fact that they will all be at the same hotel but Gidget barely reacts. Abby figures out that Gidget has just broken up and asks her to tell the story. Gidget does, but in an overly dramatic way. She says it was love at first sight then she went overboard and \"surrendered herself completely,\" which Abby misinterprets as \"she went all the way\". As the kids mingle, Gidget's parents and Abby's parents Monty Eddie Foy Jr. and Mitzi Peggy Cass are enjoying each others company.On the beach, Abby toys with all the boys' emotions, but appears to like Eddie best. Eddie, however, finds an interest in Gidget, who is still in a foul mood. Russ feels bad and decides to send a message to Jeff, suggesting that he come out to Hawaii to surprise Gidget and make her feel better. He immediately accepts.That night, Abby visits Gidget and invites her to dine with her and Eddie and the rest of the gang. Gidget declines at first, then agrees after her mother convinces her that she should enjoy her time there and have fun with Abby and the boys.At the restaurant, Abby is annoyed that she can't be alone with Eddie, so she finds two other girls named Barbara Jo Wells (Jan Conaway) and Dee Dee Waters (Robin Lory) to accompany them. At another table where Gidget's and Abby's parents are, Russ receives a telegram that Jeff is taking the first plane out to Hawaii. Gidget finally arrives, all dressed up, and joins the group. All the guys are completely drawn to her and when the dance music starts Eddie automatically grabs Gidget's hand. Later that night, Abby lets Gidget know how annoyed she was about her making such an entrance.The next day, we see Gidget surfing with a very annoyed Abby (who is afraid of the water) looking on from the beach. The guys watch in amazement as Gidget shows off her surfing moves, prompting Eddie to ask her for surfing lessons. After Eddie wipes out on his first attempt, he and Gidget run back on shore where they kiss. Jeff, having just arrived from the mainland, sees this and walks off in disgust. Gidget runs after him, the two argue and finally decide to go their separate ways with Jeff threatening to \"get a game of his own going\".The \"game\" begins that night at dinner when Jeff arrives with Abby (who is unaware that he is Gidget's boyfriend as Gidget had only identified him as \"Moondoggie\"). For this, Gidget tries to make Jeff jealous by flirting with Eddie. The gang begins a conversation about things being tame with Judge suggesting to Gidget that she should try water skiing (which at the time was really risky). Gidget accepts.The next day, the kids gather at the ski jump and try to persuade Gidget not to attempt it, but she does anyway. She starts off well, but during the jump she lets go of the handle and crashes into the water. Jeff and Judge jump into a speedboat and save her. Still desperate to make Jeff jealous, Gidget flirts with Judge who agrees to go with her to Eddie's performance that night... all in the presence of Jeff.The following day, the kids are sailing the ocean on a catamaran. Jeff soundly chides Gidget for letting the \"game\" get out of control, but he backs off when she tells him that she won't tolerate such a scolding from anyone...except a husband.Meanwhile, Abby is fed up with Gidget and decides to take her down a notch by spreading a wanton rumor about her. She implies to her mother that Gidget has slept with Eddie and other guys, rationalizing that it is half-true because Gidget had said that she gave herself \"completely to that Moondoggie person\". Mitzi relays this to Dorothy, who refuses to believe it. Even after Gidget herself denies even the thought of such a thing, arguments about it break out between the adults. Russ and Mitzi end up down at the hotel bar where they realize they see eye-to-eye on things; they decide to go to the Mauhana Room. At the same time, Monty and Dorothy (who had been talking upstairs in the hotel room) also decide to go to the Mauhana Room.At the Luau that night, Abby is the center of attention and is happy about it, especially since Gidget isn't there. Eddie decides to go for a walk and runs into Gidget. He tells her of the rumor then confesses he's in love with her. A crestfallen Gidget tells him that she doesn't love him but they agree to be friends. However, Gidget still can't bring herself to go to the Luau since she doesn't know how far Abby's rumor has spread, so she goes for a walk alone on the beach and pictures herself promiscuous and pregnant.Back at the Luau, Abby tells Jeff about the rumor that Gidget sleeps around, admitting that it's a lie and that Gidget only had one affair with a guy named \"Moondoggie\". Jeff then realizes how much he cares about Gidget, so he puts Abby in her place by telling her that he likes her and to call him what everyone at home calls him: \"Moondoggie\". Jeff and Gidget reconcile on the beach and head back to the hotel to straighten everything out with the adults. When the hotel clerk informs them that Russ and Mitzi left the hotel from one way and Monty and Dorothy left from another exit, Gidget and Jeff wait for them in her parents' suite.At the Mauhana Room, the adults also reconcile after discussing the situation; Mitzi assures Russ and Dorothy that Abby will be punished for her misdeed. They return to the hotel and find that Gidget is not in her suite. Word of Gidget's disappearance gets around to her friends and Abby, who shows deep regret for the trouble she has caused. Soon, everybody is gathered in Gidget's room; they express deep worry and concern, completely unaware that Gidget is just down the hall in her parents' suite with Jeff.Worried that her parents are cheating on each other, Gidget and Jeff make up a plan. As she and Moondoggie embrace and kiss on the couch, Russ enters and expresses shock, then relief. Gidget tells her father that Mom is asleep but she fixed it so his bed looks slept in; she suggests that he stay in Jeff's room for the night and come back in the morning so she won't suspect anything. Russ plays along and goes to tell Dorothy to \"get your half of what I got\". Gidget tells her mother the same thing she just told her father, but Dorothy goes into the bedroom anyway. To Gidget's surprise, her father is in bed and appears to be asleep. She taps him and he jumps up and yells \"Boo!\" Jeff and the rest of the gang come in. Gidget embraces Jeff and all seems to be well now...with the exception of some unfinished business which is taken care of the next day.In the final scene, the guys drag a screaming Abby into the ocean and place her on top of Gidget's surfboard.

Arthur reflects on the sad circumstances which have led him to this situation, and asks his childhood mentor, Merlyn, for advice. Merlyn appears to him and tells Arthur to think back.Arthur thinks back to the night of his marriage to his now-estranged wife, Guenevere. It is an arranged marriage, and he has never met her before. He is understandably afraid of what lies ahead (\"I Wonder What the King is Doing Tonight\"). His solitude is broken by Guenevere and her entourage. Guenevere is also worried about marrying a man she has never met, and longs for an easier life (\"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood\"). Like Arthur, she flees from her entourage to reflect on her future. Arthur (overhearing Guenevere and realizing who she is) accidentally falls out of the tree in which he is hiding. He and Guenevere converse, as she does not know his true identity, and realize they have things in common. Arthur tells her what a wonderful place his kingdom is (\"Camelot\") and they almost kiss, but are interrupted by men sent to find Arthur. The king's identity is revealed, and although Arthur gives Guenevere the chance to leave she gladly goes back with him to be married.The plot shifts to five years later. Arthur confides to Guenevere his idea for a \"Round Table\" that would seat all the noble knights of the realm, reflecting not only a crude type of democratic ideal, but also the political unification of England. Knights are shown gathering from all over England. The plot shifts another five years, and word of Arthur's Round Table spreads to France. Inspired by Arthur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideas, the self-righteous French knight Lancelot makes his way to England with his squire Dep, boasting of his superior virtues (\"C'est Moi\"). Lancelot's prowess impresses Arthur and they become friends, but many of the knights despise Lancelot for his self-righteousness.Guenevere also dislikes Lancelot at first, and, to Arthur's chagrin (\"How to Handle a Woman\"), incites three of the best knights \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sir Lionel, Sir Sagramore, and Sir Dinadan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to challenge him to a joust (\"Then You May Take Me To The Fair\"). However, the plan goes awry as Lancelot easily defeats all three, almost killing Sir Dinadan (Sir Lionel in the stage version). A horrified Lancelot pleads for Sir Dinadan to live, and as he lays hands on him, Dinadan miraculously recovers. Guenevere is so impressed that her feelings for Lancelot begin to change. Soon afterwards, it is revealed that, despite his vows of celibacy, Lancelot is in love with Guenevere, leading to the famous love triangle involving Arthur, Guenevere, and Lancelot. Guenevere knows it is wrong and tries to get Lancelot out of her life, but he refuses to leave (\"If Ever I Would Leave You\"). Arthur realizes something is going on between Lancelot and Guenevere but cannot bring himself to alienate either of them, and so turns a blind eye. Mordred (David Hemmings), Arthur's illegitimate son from an affair with Morgause (Arthur's unknown half-sister in some versions of the legend), arrives at Camelot, bitter at Arthur's refusal to recognize him and determined to bring down the fellowship of the Round Table by stirring up trouble. All this takes its toll on Arthur's disposition, and Guenevere tries, but fails, to cheer him up (\"What Do the Simple Folk Do?\").Mordred cunningly convinces Arthur to stay out hunting all night as a test, knowing Lancelot will visit Guenevere in her bedchamber. Everything happens as Mordred expected. Guenevere admits her feelings for Lancelot but still feels guilty (\"I Loved You Once In Silence\"). Mordred rouses several knights and they catch the lovers together, as he planned. Lancelot escapes but Guenevere is arrested and sentenced to die at the stake. Arthur, who has promoted the rule of law throughout the story, is now bound by his own law\u00e2\u0080\u0094he can make no special exceptions for his own wife. Preparations are made for Guenevere's burning (\"Guenevere\"), but Lancelot rescues her at the last minute, much to Arthur's relief.In the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final scene, we return to the opening. Arthur is preparing for battle against Lancelot, at the insistence of his knights who want revenge, and England appears headed into the Dark Ages. He suddenly receives a surprise visit from Lancelot and Guenevere, who has become a nun. Arthur and Guenevere share an emotional farewell. The battle must continue, however. Prior to the battle, Arthur stumbles across a young boy named Tom, who wishes to become a Knight of the Round Table. Arthur is skeptical at first, but Tom espouses his commitment to Arthur's original ideal of \"Not might makes right, but might for right.\" Arthur realizes that, although most of his plans have fallen through, the ideals of Camelot still live on in this simple boy. Arthur knights Tom and gives him his orders\u00e2\u0080\u0094run behind the lines and survive the battle, so he can tell future generations about the legend of Camelot. Watching Tom leave, Arthur regains his hope for the future (\"Camelot (reprise)\").", "output": "Question: How did they meet?, Answer: An arranged marriage., Question: What did Guenevere become?, Answer: A nun., Question: What does Guenevere long for?, Answer: An easier life., Question: who shifts to five years later?, Answer: The plot, Question: Who convinces Arthur?, Answer: Mordred, Question: who confides to Guenevere his idea for a \"Round Table\"?, Answer: Arthur, Question: Who does escape?, Answer: Lancelot, Question: Who is in love with Guenevere ?, Answer: Lancelot is in love with Guenevere., Question: Who was Tom knighted by?, Answer: Arthur., Question: Who is Arthur's childhood mentor?, Answer: Merlyn., Question: Who is arrested?, Answer: Guenevere, Question: who impresses Arthur ?, Answer: Lancelot's prowess, Question: Who is Arthur battling against?, Answer: Lancelot., Question: Where is Authur's kingdom?, Answer: Camelot., Question: Who incites three of the best Knights to challenge him to a joust ?, Answer: Guenevere incites the three knights to a joust., Question: Who is King Arthur preparing a great battle against?, Answer: Sir Lancelot., Question: Who is Arthur's illegitimate son from ?, Answer: Arthur's illegitimate son is from an affair with Morgause", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

To prepare for a work day at MGM Studios, she rises at 4:00 a.m. and engages in a strict morning ritual: scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling hot water, then plunging her face into a bowl of rubbing alcohol and ice to close the pores. When Helga (Alice Nunn), a new maid, thinks she has Joan's living room in spotless condition, Joan finds one minor detail that she overlooked and loses her temper.Joan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt (Steve Forrest), but her career is in a bit of a downswing. Despite desperately wanting a baby, she is unable to get pregnant: seven pregnancies when she was married to actor Franchot Tone have all ended in miscarriages. When she is denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl whom she names Christina (Mara Hobel), and later a boy, Christopher (Jeremy Scott Reinholt). Joan sometimes lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a very stern code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with gifts, Joan allows her to choose only one she likes best that she can keep, then donates the rest to charity.As Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming-pool race and laughs at the child. Joan becomes enraged when Christina reacts with anger and locks her in the pool house. Later, Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her. Even though Christina openly denies it and despite her protests, Joan - thinking that Christina is making fun of her, always rummaging through her drawers, trying to find a way to make people look at her, and always looking at herself in the mirror - hysterically cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her.Joan resents Gregg's allegiance to studio boss Louis B. Mayer (Howard Da Silva) and argues with Gregg after a dinner at Perino's restaurant. Joan guzzles down glasses of vodka and throws a drink in Gregg's face after he tells her she is getting old. A physical altercation ensues and Gregg breaks up with Joan. The next day, Joan cuts Gregg out of the family photos. Joan's tantrums grow more bizarre and violent; when Mayer forces Joan to leave MGM after theater owners brand her \"box office poison\", she hacks down her prize rose garden with a pair of large gardening shears and an axe.On another occasion, Joan, her face slathered in cold cream, goes into Christina's bedroom in the middle of the night, meaning to return a dress to her closet, but discovers one of Christina's dresses hanging on a wire hanger. Enraged, she screams at the girl, waking her up in horror, then yanks dresses from Christina's closet, throwing them all over the girl's room and beating her with the hanger. Afterwards, Joan wrecks the bathroom as well. Believing the perfectly clean floor is still dirty, Joan throws cleaning powder all over the bathroom before striking Christina across the back with the can of cleanser and then screams at her to clean it up. Christopher offers to help but Christina tells him to return to his own bed as she fears Joan will kill her if she finds out.Later, Joan sends Christina to the Chadwick School. Years later, when a teenage Christina (Diana Scarwid) is caught in a compromising position with a boy, Joan brings her home. Barbara Bennett (Jocelyn Brando), a reporter from Redbook magazine, is writing a puff piece on Joan's home life. After Joan lies about Christina being expelled from Chadwick, Christina confronts her in front of the reporter. In the ensuing argument, Joan slaps Christina twice across the face. Christina questions her mother as to why she was adopted, and Joan confesses that it was partially a publicity stunt, but then says that she did not really mean it. After the outraged Christina yells, \"I am not one of your fans!\" Joan throws her to the floor, then throttles Christina, who pleads with her to stop. Joan's live-in assistant and the reporter pull her away.Joan sends Christina to Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy; under the academy's strict rules, Christina can have no contact with the outside world. Joan then marries Alfred Steele (Harry Goz), CEO of Pepsi Cola, moves to New York City and pressures him to shoulder a great deal of debt to fund their lavish lifestyle. After his death, the all-male board tries to force her to resign, but Joan coerces them into letting her retain her seat by threatening to publicly condemn Pepsi.After graduating from Flintridge, Christina rents an apartment in Manhattan, where she acts in a soap opera. When Christina is hospitalized for an ovarian tumor, she is temporarily replaced on the show by her visibly drunken mother. Joan dies of cancer in 1977, whereupon Christina and Christopher (Xander Berkeley) learn their mother has disinherited them in her will.

Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, he escapes from Smith's Grove Sanitarium in a car that was to take him to a court hearing, the verdict of which was for him to be locked up forever.The next day, 21-year-old Michael (Nick Castle), now wearing a mechanic's uniform and a white mask, returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois and begins stalking high school student Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) after she drops off a key at his old house (where the murder took place) so her father can sell it. Her two best friends Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda van der Klok (P. J. Soles) dismiss Laurie's concerns that someone is following her. Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), having anticipated Michael's return home, goes to the local cemetery and finds Judith Myers' headstone missing. Loomis meets with Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) and monitors the local neighborhood to keep an eye out for Michael.When Annie's boyfriend Paul calls her to come pick him up, she takes Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) to the Doyle house, just across the street, to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews). Michael strangles Annie after she gets into her car. While playing hide-and-seek with Lindsey, Tommy sees Michael carrying Annie's body into the Wallace house, and, believing he's the \"boogeyman\", tries to tell a skeptical Laurie about what he saw. Later, Lynda and her boyfriend Bob enter the Wallace house to spend the night together. After having sex, Bob goes downstairs to get a beer for Lynda, but Michael ambushes and impales him. He then poses as Bob in a ghost costume and confronts Lynda, who kids around with him. After no response, she calls Laurie; just as Laurie answers the phone, Michael strangles Lynda with the telephone cord. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis discovers the car Michael had stolen, confirming his beliefs that his former patient is in the neighborhood.Getting suspicious, Laurie goes over to the Wallace house to see what her friends are up to and is horrified after finding them dead in the upstairs bedroom. Michael suddenly appears and slashes her arm, causing her to fall over the railing. She recovers and barely escapes. Running back to the Doyle house in a panic, she finds that the keys are gone and the door is locked. When Laurie sees Michael coming, she throws a potted plant up at the window to wake Tommy up and desperately asks him to open the door quickly. He opens the door just in time and lets her in and she tells him to hide upstairs with Lindsey. Michael, who got in through an open window, attacks her, but she stabs him in the neck with a knitting needle and he collapses.Laurie goes upstairs and tells Tommy and Lindsey she killed the \"boogeyman\"; Tommy says \"You can't kill the boogeyman\" as Michael appears behind her. Tommy and Lindsey lock themselves in the bathroom while Laurie hides in a bedroom closet. Michael destroys the closet door to get to her, but she undoes a metal clothes hanger and sticks him in the eye with it. He drops the knife and she stabs him with it and he collapses again. Laurie exits the closet and asks the kids to go to the neighbor's house and have them call the police. Michael gets up again. Dr. Loomis sees Tommy and Lindsey flee the house, screaming in terror, and enters the house to find Michael tussling with Laurie upstairs. Laurie pulls off Michael's mask and he stops attacking her to put it back on. Loomis shoots Michael six times and he falls over the second story balcony ledge.

They encounter a beautiful French woman, Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner), and that night Nigel meets her while dancing alone in the ship's bar. Later Nigel meets her much older and crippled American husband Oscar (Peter Coyote), who is acerbic and cynical, having been jaded and a failure as a writer.Oscar invites Nigel to his cabin where he tells Nigel in great detail how he and Mimi first met on a bus in Paris and fell passionately in love. Nigel relates all to Fiona. Both are appalled by Oscar's exhibitionism, but Nigel is also fascinated by Mimi, who provokes him. Later, Oscar narrates how they explored bondage, sadomasochism, and voyeurism. As a contrast to their sexual adventurousness, we see Nigel and Fiona meeting a distinguished Indian gentleman, Mr. Singh (Victor Banerjee), who is traveling with his little daughter Amrita (Sophie Patel).Invited by Mimi, Nigel, escaping from a bridge game, goes to meet her in her cabin, but it turns out she and Oscar have played a joke on him. Nigel wants to leave, but another session unfolds, with Oscar describing how their hate/love relationship developed. Bored, he tried to break up, but Mimi begged him to let her live with him under any conditions. He complied, but started to explore sadistic fantasies at her expense, humiliating her in public. When Mimi became pregnant, he made her have an abortion, saying that he would be a terrible father. When he visited her in hospital, he was shocked by her condition and almost relented in his attempts to drive her away. He promised her a holiday in the Caribbean, but he managed to get off the plane just before take off. Mimi departed alone, crying.Leaving Oscar's cabin, Nigel meets Mimi and they kiss. Afterwards, he finds Fiona in the bar flirting with a young man. She warns Nigel not to stray too far, and that anything he can do, she can do better. Nigel goes to Oscar, who continues his narration. After two years of parties and one-night stands, he drunkenly stepped in front of a vehicle. To his surprise, Mimi came to visit him in the hospital where he was recovering from minor injuries and a broken leg. Mimi shook hands with him, then pulled him out of his bed and left him hanging in his traction device. Having become paraplegic this way, Oscar had no choice but to let Mimi move in with him again and take care of him. She reveled in dominating and humiliating him, seducing men in front of him. When Oscar was desperate and wanted to die, she gave him a gun as a birthday present. Having experienced highs and lows together, they realized they needed each other and actually got married.Nigel clumsily tries to woo Mimi, encouraged and coached by Oscar. Things come to a head at the New Year's Eve party, when Fiona sees them dance together. Fiona tells him that Oscar had made her come to the party. She goes on to dance erotically with Mimi, cheered on by the other partygoers. A stormy sea interrupts the party and the two women leave together. Nigel goes outside clutching a bottle of liquor and screams his frustration into the wind and waves.Nigel finds Fiona in Oscar's cabin, sleeping naked side by side with Mimi. Oscar claims the women have had sex together. Enraged, Nigel grabs his throat, but Oscar points a gun at him and he backs off. Oscar shoots the sleeping Mimi several times, then kills himself.

Having to recuperate there, Dave asks his aunt Jackie to look after the Chipmunks, Alvin, Simon and Theodore. Arrangements are also made for them to go to school at West Eastman High School. After Jackie also causes an accident, the Chipmunks are left in the care of Toby, Jackie's grandson.Meanwhile, Ian Hawke lives in the basement of JETT Records. Three singing female chipmunks, Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor, also known as The Chipettes, emerge from a FedEx package and Ian hires them as plot to get back at the Chipmunks and revive his career.While at school, the Chipmunks are ridiculed by jocks, who threaten to kill them for drawing their girls' attention away from them. They chase the Chipmunks around the school and try to drown Simon in a toilet. They visit the principal's office, only to discover that the principal, Dr. Rubin is a huge fan, and enlists their help to raise money for a music program by participating in a contest. Meanwhile, Ian is shocked to find the Chipmunks on the front page of his newspaper. After he reads a story about them, he quickly sends the Chipettes to school.When the Chipmunks meet the Chipettes, a rivalry forms after the former group learns that the latter group are with Ian. Meanwhile, Alvin becomes popular with the jocks and joins the football team, not realizing that the next game is during the concert. At the concert, Theodore and Simon tell the fans that Alvin did not show up and that they cannot perform, leading to a victory for the Chipettes. When Alvin finally shows up after the concert is over, he finds the auditorium empty, Brittany calls him out for lacking responsibility and is ignored by his brothers at home.Soon the Chipettes are hired, but learn that the concert they are to perform as an opening act for a Britney Spears concert at the Staples Center is on the same night as the school contest. Ian convinces them to blow off the battle and perform at the concert, but refuses to give the same credit to Jeanette and Eleanor that he gives Brittany. She demands that they all perform together or not at all, until Ian threatens to send them to a barbecue restaurant unless they perform.Before the Battle Of The Bands, Alvin receives a call from the Chipettes who tell him that Ian has locked them in a cage, so Alvin races off to rescue them while Simon tells Jeanette how to open the cage over the cell phone. Simon and Theodore are on the verge of going out to perform until the others arrive just in time to perform at the contest. The Chipmunks and the Chipettes perform together and receive the money for the music program. Dave, who had left the hospital upon learning that Toby was looking after the Chipmunks, returns during the contest happy to see his boys again. Meanwhile, Ian gets into more trouble at the concert of Staples Center he set up for the girls when he attempts to imitate them only to be taken away by the security guards. After the contest, Dave allows the Chipettes to stay with them.In the mid-credits, Dr. Rubin has the jocks scrape the gum off from under the bleachers in the gymnasium.

In order to settle the lawsuit, the league agrees to add an additional team - the Bears - which is composed of the worst players in the whole Little League. Buttermaker becomes the coach of the unlikely team, which includes (among others) a near-sighted pitcher, an overweight catcher, a foul-mouthed shortstop with a Napoleon complex, an outfielder who dreams of emulating his idol Hank Aaron, and a motley collection of other \"talent\". Shunned by the more competitive teams (and competitive parents), the Bears are the outsiders. They play their opening game, and do not even record an out, with the score at 26 to 0 before Buttermaker forfeits the game.Realizing the team is nearly hopeless, he recruits a couple of unlikely prospects: First up, is sharp-tongued Amanda Whurlizer (Tatum O'Neal), a skilled pitcher (trained by Buttermaker when she was younger) who is the 12-year-old daughter of one of Buttermaker's ex-girlfriends. At first, she tries to convince Buttermaker that she has given up baseball, but then she reveals that she had been practicing \"on the sly\". Before agreeing to join the team, Amanda makes a number of outlandish demands (such as imported jeans, modeling school, ballet lessons, etc.) as conditions for joining. Upon hearing her demands, Buttermaker asks, \"Who do you think you are, Catfish Hunter?\" Amanda responds by asking, \"Who's he?\" Rounding out the team, Buttermaker recruits the \"best athlete in the area,\" who also happens to be the local cigarette-smoking, loan-sharking, Harley-Davidson-riding troublemaker, Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley). With Whurlizer and Leak on board, the team starts gaining more confidence, and the Bears start winning games.Eventually, the unlikely Bears make it to the championship game opposite the top-notch Yankees, who are coached by aggressive, competitive Roy Turner (Vic Morrow). As the game progresses, tensions are ratcheted up as Buttermaker and Turner engage in shouting matches, directing their players to become increasingly more ruthless and competitive against each other, going as far as fighting, spiking on slide, or the batter getting hit on purpose.The turnaround point of the game comes after a heated exchange between Turner's son (and Yankees pitcher) Joey (Brandon Cruz) and the Bears at-bat catcher Engelberg (Gary Lee Cavagnaro). Turner orders his son to walk Engelberg, the only Bears hitter he cannot overcome, despite Joey's wish to give it a try. In response, Joey intentionally throws a wild beanball nearly striking Engelberg in the head. Horrified, Turner goes to the mound and slaps his son. On the next pitch, Engelberg hits a routine ground ball back to Joey who exacts revenge against his father by holding the ball until Engelberg has an inside the park home run. Joey then leaves the game dropping the ball at his father's feet.Buttermaker - realizing that he has become as competitive as Turner - puts the benchwarmers on the field, thus giving everyone a chance to play. In spite of this, the finish-up brings up the best team-play from the Bears. After loading the bases with smart tactics (two walks and a bunt) they nearly recover a four run difference, with the last runner getting taken out at the last moment.Having narrowly lost the game at 7 to 6, Buttermaker gives the team free rein of his beer cooler. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of having come a long way. The condescending Yankees congratulate the Bears (in a sarcastic tone implying that they really not mean it) telling them that although they are still not that good, they have \"guts.\" Tanner, the shortstop, replies by telling the Yankees where they can put their trophy. The Bears cheer and Lupus overcomes his chronic shyness enough to yell \"Wait 'til next year!\", then they spray their beers all over each other.

They undergo a series of rigorous physical and psychological tests, during which Stanton becomes attracted to the beautiful Dr. Jane Flynn (Martha Hyer), one of the scientists testing the candidates. After most of the candidates have been eliminated from consideration, the four remaining are told about the purpose of the project.Stanton's father, Dr. Donald Stanton (Herbert Marshall), is the man in charge. He and his colleagues are working on manned space travel. They have found, however, that even the best quality metal alloys available eventually turn brittle in the harsh environment of outer space. Since metal-based meteors are not subject to these metal fatigue stresses, the scientists want to recover samples before they enter the Earth's atmosphere to discover how the meteors' \"outer shell\" protects them. To accomplish this, they need to send men into space, something that has never been done before. Stanton, Lockwood, and Walter Gordon (Robert Karnes) accept the dangerous assignment, while the fourth candidate quits.Three one-man rockets are launched a couple of hundred miles into space in order to intercept an incoming meteor swarm. Gordon makes the first run to capture a meteor; it turns out to be too large for his spaceship's nose scoop, and the ship is destroyed in the collision that follows. Lockwood suffers a mental breakdown when his view screen shows Gordon's still space-suited but now skeletal and weightless body floating toward him. Panicked and delusional, he fires his rocket engines and blasts away from Earth, heading into deep space to his doom. Stanton then misses the main swarm, but a stray meteor crosses his orbital path. He decides to pursue it, despite a warning from ground control that he may use too much fuel in the attempt and burn up upon re-entry. Stanton snags the meteor in time and manages to survive a crash landing with the now captured meteor safely intact. He is rewarded for his heroism with a kiss from Dr. Flynn.When the meteor is examined, it is discovered to have an outer coating of crystalline pure carbon. With this discovery, the U.

L.\" Travers reluctantly travels from her home in London to Los Angeles to work with Walt Disney at the urging of her agent, Diarmuid Russell. Disney has pursued the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters that he would produce a film based on them. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts because she fears what he would do to her character. However, she has not written anything in a while and her book royalties have dwindled to nothing, so she risks losing her house. Still, Russell has to remind her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations\u00e2\u0080\u0094no animation and unprecedented script approval\u00e2\u0080\u0094before she agrees to go.Travers' difficult childhood in Allora, Queensland, Australia, is depicted through flashbacks, and is the inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. Travers idolized her loving, imaginative father, Travers Robert Goff, but his chronic alcoholism resulted in his repeated firings, strained her parents' marriage, and caused her distressed mother to attempt suicide. Goff died at an early age from tuberculosis when Travers was seven years old.In Los Angeles, Travers is irritated by what she perceives as the city's unreality and the inhabitants' intrusive friendliness, personified by her limousine driver, Ralph. At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Travers meets the creative team that are developing Mary Poppins for the screen: screenwriter Don DaGradi, and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view she also holds of the jocular Disney.Travers' working relationship with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, given the nature of the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, they grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to her and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.The team realize Travers has valid criticisms and make changes, though she becomes increasingly disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking to understand what troubles her, Disney invites Travers to Disneyland, which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, and the addition of a new song and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins working with the team; however, when Travers discovers that there is to be an animation sequence, she confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.Disney learns that Travers is actually her pen name, taken from her father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff, and she's actually Australian, not British. This gives Disney new insight into Travers, and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her door, Disney tells her that he also had a less-than-ideal childhood, but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges Travers to not let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. Travers relents and grants Disney the film rights.Three years later, in 1964, Mary Poppins is to have its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches Mary Poppins with a lack of enthusiasm, particularly during the animated sequences. She gradually warms to the rest of the film; however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis and redemption.", "output": "Question: where Pamela travels?, Answer: To Los Angeles, Question: What is Robert Sherman's role in the creative team?, Answer: Music composer., Question: What does the team realize Travers has ?, Answer: Valid criticisms., Question: In what theatre is Mary Poppins to have it's world premiere?, Answer: Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Question: who working relationship with Disney?, Answer: Travers, Question: Where is the Theatre located?, Answer: Hollywood, Question: what are two major stipulations Disney had agreed?, Answer: no animation and unprecedented script, Question: whom team is difficult from the outset?, Answer: Disney, Question: what year this movie takes place?, Answer: 1961, Question: What is Travers realy name?, Answer: Helen Goff, Question: who is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy?, Answer: Mary Poppins, Question: How old was Travers when her father Goff died of tuberculosis?, Answer: Travers was just seven years old, Question: where does Disney invite Travers ?, Answer: Disneyland., Question: What played a major role in the attempt at suicide of Travers mother?, Answer: Travers' father chronic alcoholism, Question: Who is the screenwriter for Mary Poppins?, Answer: Don DaGradi, Question: What is Helen Goff's true nationality?, Answer: Australian", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

He takes the Tramp back to his mansion and gives him a change of clothes. Early the next morning, they return to the mansion and encounter the Flower Girl en route to her vending spot. The Tramp asks The Millionaire for some money, which he uses to buy all the girl's flowers and then drives her home in the Millionaire's car.After he leaves, the Flower Girl tells her grandmother (Florence Lee) about her wealthy acquaintance. When the Tramp returns to the mansion, the Millionaire has sobered-up and does not remember him, so he has the butler order him out. Later that day, the Millionaire meets the Tramp again while intoxicated and invites him home for a lavish party. The next morning, having sobered again and planning to leave for a cruise, the Millionaire again has the Tramp tossed out.Returning to the Flower Girl's apartment, the Tramp spies her being attended by a doctor. Deciding to take a job to earn money for her, he becomes a street sweeper. Meanwhile, the grandmother receives a notice that she and the girl will be evicted if they cannot pay their back rent by the next day, but she hides it. The Tramp visits the girl on his lunch break and sees a newspaper story about a Viennese doctor who has devised an operation that cures blindness. He then finds the eviction notice and reads it aloud at the girl's request. He reassures her that he will pay the rent. But he returns to work late and is fired.As he is walking away, a boxer persuades him to stage a fake fight, promising to split the $50 prize money. Just before the bout, however, the man receives a telegram warning him that the police are after him. He flees, leaving the Tramp a no-nonsense replacement opponent. Despite a valiant effort, the Tramp is knocked out.Some time later, he meets the drunken millionaire who has just returned from Europe. The Millionaire takes him to the mansion, and after he hears the girl's plight, he gives the Tramp $1,000 to give to the girl for her operation. Unbeknownst to the Millionaire and the Tramp, two burglars were hiding in the house when they entered. Upon hearing about the cash, they knock out the millionaire and take the rest of his money. The Tramp telephones for the police, but the robbers flee before they arrive, and the butler assumes he stole the money. The Millionaire cannot remember the Tramp or giving him the $1,000. The Tramp narrowly escapes and gives the money to the girl, saying he will be going away for a while. Later, he is arrested in front of the newsboys who taunted him earlier, and he is then jailed.Months later, the Tramp is released. Searching for the girl, he returns to her customary street corner but does not find her. With her sight restored, the girl has opened up a flourishing flower shop with her grandmother. When a rich customer comes into the shop, the girl briefly wonders if he is her mysterious benefactor. But when he leaves with no acknowledgement, she realizes again she is wrong. While retrieving a flower from the gutter outside the shop, the Tramp is again tormented by the two newsboys. As he turns to leave, he finds himself staring at the girl through the window. His despair turns to elation and he forgets about the flower. Seeing that he has crushed the flower he retrieved, the girl kindly offers him a fresh one and a coin. Embarrassed, the Tramp tries to shuffle away, but the girl stops him and hands him the flower, which he shyly takes. When the girl takes hold of his hand to place the coin in it, she recognizes the touch of his hand and realizes he is no stranger. \"You?\" she says, and he nods, asking, \"You can see now?\" She tearfully replies, \"Yes, I can see now\", and holds the Tramp's hand close to her chest.

One of the guards informs the escort chief, Yang Hu Yun (Sun Chien) that two mercenary fighters named Yen and Fang, are ready for them on the road and will act as scouts. Yang Hu Yun says that the local governors are relying on them to make sure the gold reaches the famine-stricken area, as the people there need it desperately to obtain food. They are awaiting the arrival of a special government agent named Hai To, but he has not arrived yet.One of the guards suddenly comes rushing in, mortally wounded. On his back, in his own blood, are painted the characters for the party responsible for the killing-- the Che Sa gang, a ruthless group of bandits. Yang Hu Yun orders his men to notify Yen, Fang, and a swordsman named Li (Wei Pai) and his girlfriend, who will also be assisting with the gold escort. The Che Sa gang are sending the guards a message that they are after the gold and intend to steal it for themselves.Yang Hu Yun orders his men to prepare to move out. He warns everyone that their group, and the mercenary fighters who will be aiding them, are very powerful, but the Che Sa gang is as well, and are partcularly ruthless. They are led by four Chiefs.The opening credits begin with a montage that shows the fighting style of each Chief. Number 1, Golden Arm (Lo Meng), is muscular and stocky, a master of unarmed hand and arm techniques. Number 2, Silver Spear (Lu Feng), has an acrobatic fighting style and wields a specially crafted spear in battle, which appears to be sculpted out of a single piece of solid silver. Number 3, Iron Robe, wields a steel fan with razor edges in battle, and his robe is covered with iron studs that act as armor against sword-slashes. Number 4, Brass Head, fights unarmed and wears a brass plate over his forehead, which makes his head butts lethal.The Chiefs are ranked by skill, not age. All of them are relatively young, and Golden Arm is the youngest of them. Despite this, all of them are infamous for their success. has also heard that the Che Sa have recently acquired some mercenaries of their own... a group known as the Seven Hooks, who are known for their cruelty and viciousness.Yen and Fang are scouting ahead on the road. They encounter the Seven Hooks, so named for the hook-like weapons they wield. But Yen and Fang prove superior in their teamwork and use of the weapons they wield; Yen uses a heavy poleaxe, while Fang wields paired hand axes. This has given them the nickname of 'Longaxe and Short axe.' Yen and Fang kill all Seven of the Seven Hooks.Miss Leng (Helen Poon), Swordsman Li's girlfriend, is walking ahead on her own when she encounters Iron Robe. He questions her on why she has been sent ahead alone. Leng says nothing, only holding her sword at the ready. But Iron Robe says he will not attack women, and says that he is letting her pass. But Iron Robe quickly shows his true colors, as a few of the Che Sa grunts are waiting in ambush. They strike at Leng as she starts to move past, but she slays them with a quick sword-draw maneuver, calling Iron Robe despicable. Iron Robe is unrepentant, caring only about winning. Several more Che Sa grunts come out of hiding as Iron Robe himself engages Leng in battle.But Iron Robe's fan is pushed aside by a hurled wine jug. The owner of this jug (Kuo Chui) quickluy leaps out of nearby bushes to catch it. He complains, mostly to himself, about only having drank three jugs of wine so far, and he couldn't be drunk. Unamused and not caring about drunkenness, Iron Robe attacks the man, who fends him off and slays the henchmen using only the wine jug as a weapon. No sooner is Leng safe when the mysterious man who saved her leaps back into the bushes, leaving her once again alone.Yang Hu Yun is leading his main body of men with the wagon containing the gold. Several of the escort service's scouts report in to say that Yen and Fang have slain the Seven Hooks, and that Leng was ambushed by Iron Robe, when a mysterious drunken man rescued her and promptly disappeared. Yang is thoughtful for a moment and realizes that the man must be Hai To, the government agent they'd been awaiting. Hai To is a drunk, who regards wine as his only friend, and that he fights best when he's intoxicated. Thinking another brief moment, he signals to the wagon driver and the convoy begins moving again.Leng meets Li at a tavern in a small town that the escort convoy must pass through. He is concerned about her being late, and she tells him that Iron Robe ambushed her and nearly killed her. The two sit, and the tavernkeeper and the head waiter are seen looking at Leng and Li intently. The head waiter signals to a table attendant who begins to pour wine for them, but suddenly grabs a sword from behind another table. But Li has anticipated this, quickly slaying the waiter with a single lightning sword stroke. The tavernkeeper feigns ignorance, outraged at the killing, until Li produces the sword the waiter used to try and ambush him. Continuing to feign ignorance, the tavernkeeper castigates the head waiter, who was responsible for the conduct of the lesser attendants. But as this is going on, the tavernkeeper is stealthily passed a spear which he uses to attack Li and Leng. The tavernkeeper and head waiter are Silver Spear and Brass Head in disguise, and the other attendants are all Che Sa grunts. As a battle breaks out, Silver Spear is seen glancing at a man standing outside the tavern.Li and Leng fend off the grunts, slaying several in the process, but Li is slowly backed up against one of the tavern walls. When he is close enough, the hidden man outside bursts his hands through the walls of the tavern, striking Li in the back. The man's hands are covered with a sandy substance that have administered a contact poison to Li-- the Sand Palm. Li slays the Sand Palm but is wounded. He and Leng slay several more of the grunts and escape from the tavern. Silver Spear orders his men in pursuit.But the grunt at the head of the pursuit runs smack into Hai To, who blithely walks into the tavern and seats himself as if having no idea what is going on. He gestures to Brass Head and orders a jug of wine. Brass Head glances at Silver Spear, who gestures to the wine racks, directing Brass Head to bring Hai To a jar. Brass Head does so, and Hai To quickly begins to guzzle it down. Growing impatient, Brass Head attacks Hai To, who parries the attack with the wine jug, causing it to shatter against Brass Head's metal headdress, which is covered with a cloth one to hide it.Seemingly more annoyed at the wine jug being wasted, than anything else, Hai To nonetheless reveals Brass Head and Silver Spear for who they really are. Silver Spear, not recognizing Hai To but seeing that he is exceptionally skilled in combat, condescendingly offers him a place among the Che Sa gang. But Hai To presents some outrageous conditions, among them his being the Number 1 Chief and that all the grunts must be done away with. He starts to recite a third condition, but can't seem to remember what it is. Knowing he is simply taunting them, the remaining grunts attack Hai To, but he kills one and escapes from the others.On the road, Leng is begging Li to rest while she finds a doctor to help him. But Li refuses the offer. He says his internal body control can fend off the Sand Palm poison for at least two days, which should be enough time for the mission to be accomplished. Fearful of losing Li, Leng accuses him of only caring about his own heroism, but Li again counters, saying he is willing to die for the sake of both Yang Yu Jun and the famine victims, while Leng wants to save Li only out of her own love for him-- who then, he asks, is being selfish.The whole guard convoy is resting at the town. Several scouts report in to Yang Hu Yun. Many rival gangs know of the gold shipment, but none dare try to steal it because they all know that the Che Sa gang is pursuing it, and the other gangs, being no match for Che Sa, are afraid of trying to compete with them. Yen and Fang also have a prisoner, who they caught loitering around the area where the convoy is resting, and who they suspect of being a Che Sa member. They try to interrogate him, but the loiterer tells them to go ahead and kill him-- he is not afraid, and he knows that torture is against their morale code. Acknowledging that attempting to learn anything would be futile, Fang gives the loiterer a quick and clean death.A secret panel in the floor suddenly opens up and Brass Head emerges, attacking the guard convoy. Yang Hu Yun realizes that the panel conceals a hidden tunnel through which the Che Sa have spirited the gold chests back onto the wagon and are preparing to spirit it away. He orders his men to stop them, but more Che Sa arrive in force, engaging them all in battle. As Brass Head and the Che Sa grunts battle the guard convoy, Iron Robe climbs in the wagon and starts to drive it off. Hai To stealthily stows away on the wagon, clinging to its underside and axles. When Iron Robe is out of both sight and earshot of his reinforcements, Hai To breaks the rear axle of the wagon, bringing it to a standstill. Iron Robe quickly lights a signal flare. Hai To comes out of hiding and casually taunts Iron Robe about nobody answering the signal flare.But one of the Che Sa grunts, back in the town, has seen the flare, and hurries to inform Brass Head. He signals a full retreat, but Yen, Fang, Yang Hu Yun and the remaining guards cut Brass Head off and mortally wound him.The rear door to the meeting place is smashed open; Golden Arm has arrived. Brass Head tells Golden Arm that Iron Robe has driven the gold off, but has just sent up a signal flare. Golden Arm says he will go investigate, and then when the time is right, he will avenge Brass Head, killing all of the guard convoy. Brass Head expresses his gratitude for the promise before he dies.Golden Arm almost casually begins to walk toward the other exit to investigate the signal flare. All of the guard convoy attack him... but fighting unarmed, he fends all of them off, blocking every shot thrown at him; his bare arms stopping the slashes of swords and axes. He reaches the front exit completely unscathed and continues on his way. The guard convoy is in awe of Golden Arm's fighting ability. Yang mentions that Golden Arm never uses weapons, having proven that he does not need any; his arms are the only weapons he needs. He could have killed all of them then and there, but let them go-- for now-- because of the signal flare that Iron Robe sent up.And Iron Robe does have his hands full. He recognizes Hai To for who he is, knowing that only he would behave the way he is. Knowing that Hai To has arranged to catch him alone, he engages the agent in hand to hand combat. A group of Che Sa reinforcements arrive. Making quick work of them, Hai To seizes a spear to use as a weapon, but Iron Robe's metal-studded robe protects him from the spear's sharp point. But Hai To finally outwits Iron Robe, placing the wagon between them. Rather than allow Hai To to try and circle around for a rear attack, Iron Robe leaps over the wagon... but Hai To has gotten right under where he will land, bracing the butt of the spear on the ground with the point up, which gets under the metal-studded robe, dealing the third Che Sa chief a terrible death. Hai To quickly leaves the scene of the battle-- and the wagon-- after finishing Iron Robe and the last of his henchmen.Golden Arm arrives, surveying the scene. Speaking to himself, he knows that Swordsman Li is hurt, and Leng is with them. Yang, Yen and Fang, and the remaining guard convoy grunts, are not a problem. Only Agent Hai To could have caused this much trouble. Nonetheless, Golden Arm is unafraid, and looking forward to fighting him at the right time. Knowing he cannot fix the wagon and take it away on his own, Golden Arm decides to let Yang Yu Hun recover it and keep it a few more days. As Golden Arm walks off, he is unaware of Hai To lurking among the foliage, having eavesdropped on Golden Arm's monologue.Li encounters Silver Spear on the road. The two fight, and Silver Spear twirls his weapon around in a way that causes Li to become dizzy from the Sand Palm poison. Hai To arrives before Silver Spear can finish Li. Hai To and Silver Spear fight it out until Leng arrives, and Hai To warns Silver Spear to retreat, or Leng will be able to help finish him off. Knowing Hai To is right, Silver Spear withdraws. Hai To picks up the unconscious Li and carries him off, Leng following and yelling in protest.Hai To brings Li to a blacksmith forge where some acquaintances of his are working. He pays them some silver and they place Li into the forge, locking him inside. Leng, outraged, tries to attack Hai To, but he fends her off easily, telling her nothing. She is forced to stand outside and wait.The smith workers put more wood into the fire to feed it. Li comes to from the intense heat and tries to break out of the forge, but cannot. His fists hurting from the effort, he screams in anger and anguish.Scouts are reporting in to Yang Hu Yun, who is leading the wagon again. The scouts have checked ahead ten miles and have found a small town where they can rest. Yang Hu Yun agrees, but says the convoy will also rest where they are now, for a while.But this proves a deadly mistake, as the Che Sa have anticipated that the convoy would pass through the area, and have set booby-trap poison needles everywhere. All of the convoy guards who have leaned or sat near trees and bushes are dead. Yen sweeps the ground with his poleaxe and finds a near minefield of poison needles sticking out of the ground. He has everyone break pieces of wood directly off the wagon and nowhere else, to attach to the soles of their shoes. Everyone must move standing completely upright and must touch nothing, and lean against nothing.At the forge, Leng is vowing to exact vengeance on Hai To if it takes the rest of her days, and Hai To, guzzling wine again, simply laughs her off, saying he's right in front of her. Despite her anger, she is no match for him in combat and grows more and more frustrated.Inside the forge, Li has ripped off his tunic and shirt, to find that the intense heat has caused his body to drive out the Sand Palm poison through perspiration. He understands now that he was not placed into the forge to kill him or cremate his body... but to save his life. Hai To signals to the workers to open the forge, and Li emerges, alive and completely healthy again. As Leng marvels at this, Hai To leaves again... without paying the workers. He tells them it was Li they saved, they should hand him the bill.Golden Arm and Silver Spear confer at their headquarters. Silver Spear says that their poison needle traps have decimated a large number of the guard convoy, and when the convoy arrives at the next town to spend the night, the Che Sa will be ready. The convoy has sustained considerable losses, though the ones remaining are the toughest yet.Golden Arm grows thoughtful as he remembers fending off Yang's forces the previous night when Brass Head and Iron Robe were killed. He had had time to observe Yang Hu Yun's fighting style and is sure that he is not a skilled fighter... which makes no sense to Golden Arm because he is famous as a swordsman. A little over a year ago, on a different escort duty, he killed seventeen would-be bandits, using his sword, in a single battle.Silver Spear is unconcerned, feeling that Yang, like the rest of the guard service, will all be slain soon and the Che Sa will have the gold. Golden Arm concedes the point, and asks about rival gangs that might also try to get the gold for themselves. Silver spear says that all the other gangs are too scared of trying to compete against the Che Sa. Only one name is any cause of concern to either Golden Arm or Silver Spear... a fighter named Iron Feet, who was also renowned a short time ago, but simply disappeared shortly after Golden Arm formed the Che Sa gang.The guard convoy has arrived at the next town and is preparing to sleep for the night. It takes very little time before several more of the grunts fall prey to the next Che Sa trap... they have driven off or killed all the town's inhabitants and poisoned the water supply for miles around. They must consume only the food and water rations brought with them from the start, and be doubly alert on guard shifts throughout the night.Hai To arrives, guzzling wine from a jar as he is always doing. He knows the water has been poisoned, so he is fortunate he only drinks wine. He confers with Li and Yang, who understand that even the candles may be poisoned, so they are only using their own torches. But Hai To notes the iron bracket rings placed on the walls for holding the torches. He ushers everyone outside and pulls the windows shut just as the heat from the torches causes the bracket rings to release poison gas. Hai To notes that they will all have to sleep outside tonight, on the very streets of the town.Later at night, the Wang Brothers, two of the senior guards in the convoy, decide that they can't stay with the convoy because they're sure to die if they do. They make an agreement to sneak into the building where the gold chests are, steal whatever they can carry, and hurry off. But it turns out that even the chests, themselves, are coated with contact poison, which kills the two guards, and baffles the rest of the convoy, including Yang Hu Yun and even Hai To. The Che Sa couldn't have possibly known that any of the escort convoy was going to turn coat. And even if they somehow could have known, why place poison on the chests? Yang and Hai To wrestle over the possibility of a traitor in the escort service.The convoy leaves the town at dawn to get on the road. Hai To has already left. Silver Spear and his spearmen find Hai To at another tavern and quickly kill all its employees. Silver Spear tells Hai To that Golden Arm is offering him a deal: if he backs off from the convoy, they'll give him a 20% cut of the gold's value. Instead of answering, Hai To questions Silver Spear on the poisoning of the Wang Brothers. The blank look from Silver Spear, showing he doesn't know what Hai To is talking about, the answer Hai To expected.Silver Spear tells Hai To that if he doesn't accept Golden Arm's terms, then Golden Arm wants to settle with him, hand to hand, in a duel. Hai To asks for the time and place, and seems remarkably unconcerned. Silver Spear withdraws, but Hai To tells the spearmen grunts that they are under arrest, and kills them all.On the road, fear of the Che Sa has broken the morale of all the remaining convoy grunts. They approach Yang Hu Yun and tell him that they want to leave. Yang starts to pull his sword, but Li says to let them go. If they wish to run like cowards, it will catch up to them in time. The grunts are hurry off, and Li, Yen, and Fang are thoughtful. They understand the grunts losing morale, as all their co-workers and friends are dead. As for the three of them... their loyalty is to Yang, to the end.Yen and Fang go ahead on the road to scout, leaving Yang, Li and Leng with the wagon. Arriving at a clearing, Yen and Fang are thoughtful. The Che Sa must know that the convoy's strength is nearly broken, and Yen has also seen that Yang is barely competent as a fighter. He and Fang wonder if he is injured, but they are too mindful of his feelings to ask.The ambush that they are expecting strikes at that moment; a contingent of spearmen under Silver Spear. Separating Yen and Fang, Silver Spear takes Yen down with several thrown darts just after Yen finishes off all but one of the spearmen. Fang and Silver Spear fight it out until Silver Spear gets Fang in a grapple and the last spearman skewers Fang from behind. Breaking free of the grapple, Fang swings his axes over his head, killing the spearmen, and then, as Silver Spear is off-guard, Fang grabs the spearhead that is poking through his chest, and with his last breath, pulls the spear completely through his body and drives it into Silver Spear, taking the Che Sa Chief number two, with him.Yang Hu Yun, Li and Leng arrive at the site of the battle. That Yen and Fang managed to kill Silver Spear is small comfort in light of their also being lost. Only Yang, Li, Leng and Hai To remain... and Li thinks poorly of Hai To as an escort member. He stalks off alone, Leng realizing he probably is going to seek out and challenge Golden Arm.Hai To is leaving the tavern, hauling a small wagon loaded with wine jars. He happens across Li and tries to warn him from proceeding where he's headed. Li pays no attention.Hai goes to meet Yang and Leng on the road. Finding out about the loss of Yen and Fang, Hai To says that he was set to meet Golden Arm at Chi Li Hill, but he suspects that Li figured this out and has gone there himself. Leng is outraged that Hai To didn't try to stop Li, even though Hai To points out that if he tried, Li would fought to his own death trying to get through Hai To. Li's sense of duty and honor mean far more to him than anything, including Leng's love for him.Just as both Leng and Hai To predicted, Li finds his way to Chi Li Hill and challenges Golden Arm. The lead Che Sa chief sees no threat in Li, even allowing him to recover his sword after disarming him. Good as Li's swordsmanship is, Golden Arm's unarmed technique is better. The bare skin of his arms does not yield to the razor edges of Li's steel sword. Golden Arm finally tires of the bout and kills Li.Leng arrives in time to see Li struck down. Drawing her own sword, she starts to advance on Golden Arm, but she knows she cannot hope to take him and starts to backpedal when he advances on her in return. Golden Arm gives her three days to leave the area and give up her role in escorting the gold shipment. After that, if he sees her again, she admits defeat.As Golden Arm turns away, Leng notices a bamboo pole poking against her ear; it is Hai To, using the pole to discretely whisper to her without Golden Arm hearing. He tells her to leave the area and return in two hours, whereupon she will be set to take revenge for Li's death.Golden Arm meets up with Hai To. He tells Hai To that his men are giving Li an honorable burial, and that he gave Leng three days to run. Hai To is unafraid of his own death, shrugging it off as a risk of his work.Yang Hu Yun arrives with the gold wagon. He is now alone in escorting it. Seeing Golden Arm, he removes his cloak and draws his sword... in a manner that even Golden Arm, trained only in unarmed fighting technique, can see plainly that Yang barely knows how to use a sword, despite his fame as a swordsman. Hai To tells Golden Arm to forget about Yang. Golden Arm acknowledges and they begin their duel.Hai To and Golden Arm are almost evenly matched. They battle to a stalemate before Yang throws his sword to Hai To, who catches it and resumes the battle without missing a stride. Even Yang's sword has no effect on Golden Arm's arms, and he shatters the sword to pieces between his hands. Finally Hai To produces two metal hooks that prove to be attached to long chains. Getting Golden Arm's arms snared up in them, Hai To suddenly conforts and regurgitates a gullet full of wine, spewing it full force into Golden Arm's unprotected eyes.Golden Arm is blinded by the attack; the one part of his body that Hai To knew had to be vulnerable. With the leader of Che Sa incapacitated, it seems that the gold shipment is safe for the short distance remaining for it to be escorted.But it just seems that way. A man emerges from the interior of the wagon, having been in hiding there from the very beginning. He looks exactly like Yang Hu Yun (also played by Sun Chien) and wields an identical nine-ring broadsword. He strikes from behind, mortally wounding Hai To.Hai To quickly pieces everything together. Yang's double and the true leader of the escort service, is also the traitor from within. He can easily kill Golden Arm, pass him and Hai To off as having killed each other, and then kill his stand-in, and everyone will think that the remaining Che Sa gang members have the gold. Yang stares in horror as his employer gives him a wicked smile, before advancing and killing him with a swift sword-stroke.Hai To points out two weaknesses in the escort leader's plot. First, he didn't know about the contact poison on the chests, so he didn't have to kill the Wang Brothers. Also, his stand-in, although a near perfect resemblance to him, was not a competent swordsman, as the real Yang himself is famed as.But the escort leader says that his swordplay is no better than his stand-in's had been. What he IS extremely skilled at, however... is a fighting style that makes heavy use of kicking techniques. He is extremely good with his feet. The last piece of the puzzle falls into place as he reveals that he is the missing fighter Golden Arm had been concerned about... Yang is Iron Feet.Shortly before Golden Arm formed the Che Sa gang, he and Iron Feet had been equals. But after the gang was assembled, Iron Feet was sorely outnumbered and could not overcome them. He went into hiding, and began biding his time leading a crew of escort guards, waiting for a major job as this where he could finally see the Che Sa dismantled through attrition, kill Golden Arm, and turn coat, starting his own gang of outlaws. To hide his identity, Iron Feet even established a false reputation as a swordsman; the seventeen men he killed at a lake while on escort duty, died from his kung-fu kicks, and while the bodies were still warm, he then slashed them repeatedly with his sword so it would appear that he killed them with the sword. Nobody survived to tell the truth.To finish his plan, Iron Feet must also kill Golden Arm. Golden Arm knows that Iron Feet has no choice in this. Straining his ears to listen, he is able to fend off Iron Feet's attack and counter effectively. Iron Feet happens to notice Golden Arm's ears twitching, straining to listen. Iron Feet backs off, stepping very slowly and carefully to deaden the sound of his footfalls. This allows him to seize the advantage and land a number of punishing kicks.But before Iron Feet can finish Golden Arm, Hai To suddenly leaps into the fray. Iron Feet's sword slash never actually hurt Hai To... his wine flask stopped the blow. As he's always said, wine is his best friend. Iron Feet and Hai To battle it out until Hai To is able to knock Iron Feet back... right into a waiting Golden Arm, who lands a lethal blow from behind.Golden Arm is still blind, however. He is no longer effective as leader of a criminal gang. Seeing no other option, and in a sign of gratitude for Hai To showing mercy to him, he tells Hai To he will find his way to the next town to live out the rest of his days quietly.But Leng has returned, as Hai To has told her to, and she is ready to take her revenge. Coming up behind Golden Arm, she drives her sword through his back, the point crashing out through his chest. Acting on pure reflex, Golden Arm breaks off the front of Leng's sword, and she is in shock finding the bloody point at her own neck in a heartbeat.But Golden Arm chooses to spare her life. The clean death Leng has given him, in the end, is much better than the fate he had been facing. He tosses the broken piece of her sword aside and accepts his death.Hai To tells Leng that the famine-stricken area is close enough that she can reach it quickly. There are no further obstacles to her bringing the wagon safely there, even if she is alone. Bidding her farewell, he goes off to find more wine and get drunk.

Baffled by the request, he agrees. The two arrive at the justice of the peace's home late in the night, and pay him to marry them. Emily then savagely murders the justice of the peace during the ceremony, and flees. She later gloats to a mute, invalid elderly woman named Helga (for whom Emily is a nurse and works for a wealthy family) of her deed.The police investigate the crime and learn that the nurse was given the name of a local flower shop owner Miriam Webster (Breslin), who has an alibi of the night of the murder. It is revealed that Miriam and her brother Warren, who has recently returned from Denmark after the death of his last surviving parent, are heirs to Warren's father's estate. The two talk about how Warren's father was abusive to Warren growing up and the details of the will. Miriam stands to inherit the estate if Warren dies before marrying, as Warren's father was a misogynist who went out of his way to make Warren his sole heir so that only a male child of his could inherit. Miram also confesses to Warren good news of her own, that she is engaged to be married to her boyfriend.That evening, Emily breaks into Miriam's flower shop and wrecks the store. She is interrupted by Miriam's boyfriend, who comes to the store because he did not know that Miriam had left early that evening. Miriam and her boyfriend arrive at Warren's house the next day to visit Helga and confront Emily. Helga frantically tries to communicate with Miriam, who later finds out from Warren that Emily is actually his wife; he had hired her to take care of Helga and ultimately married her. Miriam later overhears Warren and Emily talking in the next room but does not see them together.Miriam's boyfriend learns of the murdered justice of the peace and that Emily resembles the suspect. Miriam ultimately goes to visit Warren and Emily, having realized that Emily is a murderer. She enters the house, and sees Helga descending the staircase on the stairlift. As she nears the bottom of the stairs, Miriam witnesses Helga's severed head fall off her body. She is then attacked by Emily; the two fight, and Emily removes her wig and prosthetic teeth, revealing herself to be Warren.Afterward, the police talk to Miriam as the truth about Warren is revealed: Warren was really a girl. The secret of the child's gender was known only to the child's mother, Helga the housekeeper, and the county clerk (who later became a justice of the peace), who had been bribed to enter the birth of a boy. This was done mainly to avoid the murderous wrath of Warren's father, who wanted a boy and would have harmed the child. \"Emily\" was an alternate identity Warren had created overseas to be able to live as a woman away from those who knew him. When Warren's father died and he learned of the clause in the will that would have denied him his inheritance if it was known he was a female, he resumed the alter ego of Emily in order to kill and silence those who would know the truth about him.", "output": "Question: Who murders a justice of the peace?, Answer: Emily, Question: Who is Emily's husband?, Answer: Warren, Question: Who does Emily reveal herself to be?, Answer: Warren, Question: Who is the actor playing the bellboy?, Answer: Richard Rust, Question: What was the name of the local flower shop owner?, Answer: Miriam Webster, Question: Who interrupts Emily when she is breaking into Miriam's store?, Answer: Miriam's boyfriend, Question: Whose flower shop does Emily break into?, Answer: Miriam's, Question: Who is revealed to be a girl?, Answer: Warren, Question: Who was both a housekeeper and a justice of the peace?, Answer: Helga, Question: Who does Warren create as an alter ego?, Answer: Emily, Question: What is Miriam's good news to Warren?, Answer: She is engaged, Question: Miriam's brother Warren recently returned from which country?, Answer: Denmark, Question: Who resembles the suspect?, Answer: Emily, Question: Who is a mute, elderly woman?, Answer: Helga", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Two years later, on August 23, 2000, a massive earthquake strikes Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley floods, and the Los Angeles area turns into an island from Malibu to Anaheim. An American presidential candidate who is also an outspoken theocrat has been saying that L.A. is sinful and has been punished by God.When he is elected President for life, he declares that anyone not conforming to the new \"Moral America\" laws he creates, which ban such things as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, recreational drugs, red meat, firearms, profanity, atheism, freedom of religion and extra-marital sex, will be stripped of their citizenship and deported to Los Angeles Island unless they repent and choose death by electrocution. A containment wall is built around the island, armed guards and watchtowers are posted, and those sent to the island are exiled permanently.In 2013, Cuervo Jones, a Shining Path Peruvian Revolutionary, seduces the President's daughter, Utopia, via a holographic system and brainwashes her into stealing her father's remote control to the \"Sword of Damocles\" super weapon\u00e2\u0080\u0094a series of satellites capable of rendering all electronic devices anywhere on the planet useless. The President intends to use the system to destroy America's enemies' ability to function and eventually dominate the world. While traveling aboard Air Force Three, Utopia leaves the plane in an escape pod and lands on L.A. Island to join with Cuervo.With the satellites under his control, Cuervo promises to take back America with the assistance of an allied invasion force of third world nations that are standing by to attack. Cuervo claims that if the President tries to stop him, he will \"pull the plug\" on the country and black out the capital. Cuervo also knows the secret world code that can knock out power for the entire planet.Snake Plissken is captured for another series of crimes and is scheduled to be exiled to Los Angeles Island. Upon his arrival for deportation, Snake meets the President and is offered the mission of retrieving the weapon. The President says he will give him a full pardon if he is successful. The President indicates he does not care if Utopia is returned or not, declaring her a traitor. To ensure his compliance, Snake is infected with the man-made Plutoxin 7 virus that will kill him within ten hours. If he completes the mission, Snake will be cured.Snake is given an assault rifle, a personal holographic projector, a thermal-camouflage overcoat, and a countdown clock for how long he has to live. Los Angeles is in ruins and a hotbed of crime. Snake sneaks into the city with a mini submarine that he loses when the platform it landed on crumbles, causing the sub to sink. Making his way across the island, Snake meets \"Map to the Stars\" Eddie, a swindler who sells interactive tours of L.A.Snake defeats Cuervo at his staging area of The Happy Kingdom By The Sea in Anaheim and takes the remote control. Snake leaves the island with Utopia and some other Cuervo resistors in a helicopter. Cuervo shoots at it with a rocket launcher just before Eddie kills him, but seeing the incoming rocket, Eddie leaps off the chopper, landing on an awning. The rocket hits the chopper and kills those in the back of the chopper but also causes a fire; Snake and Utopia bail out before it crashes. When the President's men reach the crash site, Snake intentionally hands off the wrong remote to the President while Utopia is taken to the electric chair despite her pleas for forgiveness. The Plutoxin 7 virus is revealed to be nothing more than a fast, hard-hitting case of the flu. The President tries using the satellites to stop a Cuban invasion force threatening Florida.

Malena's husband, Nino Scordia, leaves to serve in the military. Malena feels sad and tries to cope with her loss, as the town she has just moved to tries to deal with this beautiful woman who gets the attention and lustful stares of all the local men, including the 12-year-old Renato. However, in spite of the villagers' gossip, she continues to be faithful to her husband. Renato becomes obsessed with Malena and starts fantasizing about her while masturbating.The silent, distractingly beautiful outsider learns one day that her husband has been killed. Renato continues to watch as she suffers from loneliness and grief. Malena is shunned by the townspeople and the unattractive, jealous women of the Italian village, who begin to believe the worst about her, simply because of her beauty.She visits her father, an almost deaf professor of Latin, regularly and helps him with his household chores. When a slanderous letter about her sexual morals reaches his hands, their relationship suffers a catastrophic blow. In the meanwhile, the war worsens. The village is bombed and Malena's father is killed.She falls on hard times and eventually has no money. The wife of the local dentist takes her to court, but Malena is acquitted. The only man Malena does have an innocent romance with, an army officer, is sent away because of the trial.Malena's poverty finally forces her to succumb to the greed and malice of the town and she becomes a prostitute, making the wives' fantasies about her a reality. When the German army comes to town, Malena gives herself to Germans as well. Renato sees her in the company of two German officers and faints.His mother and the older ladies of the town think that he has been possessed by the devil and take him to church to exorcise the \"demons.\" His father however understands that he is suffering from sexual hunger and takes him to a brothel; Renato has sex with one of the prostitutes while fantasizing that she is Malena.When the war ends, the women of the village gather and, out of jealousy and hatred, publicly beat and humiliate Malena, who shortly after leaves for Messina. A few days later, Nino Scordia returns to town, to the shock of all the residents. He finds his house occupied by people displaced by the war. Renato tells him through an anonymous letter about Malena's whereabouts.Nino goes to Messina to find her. A year later, they return. The villagers, especially the women, astonished at her courage, begin to talk to \"Signora Scordia\" with respect.

Afterwards he wishes her \"Buona fortuna, Signora Malena\" (good luck, Mrs. Malena) and rides off on his bicycle, looking back at her for a final time, as she walks away, with the retrospective thought that he has not forgotten her, even after a few years.

The wealthy retired general wants to resolve gambling debts his daughter, Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), owes to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger. As Marlowe is leaving, General Sternwood's older daughter, Mrs. Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall), stops him. She suspects her father's true motive for calling in a detective is to find his young friend Sean Regan, who had mysteriously disappeared a month earlier.Philip Marlowe (Bogart) and Vivian Rutledge (Bacall) square up to each other.Marlowe goes to Geiger's rare book shop. Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), Geiger's assistant, minds the shop, which is the front for an illegal operation. Marlowe follows Geiger to his house, where he hears a gunshot and a woman scream. Breaking in, he finds Geiger's body and a drugged Carmen, as well as a hidden camera with an empty cartridge. Marlowe picks up Carmen and takes her home. He goes back to the house, but discovers the body is no longer there. Marlowe later learns that the Sternwoods' driver (Owen Taylor) has been found dead, with his car driven off a pier.Vivian comes to Marlowe's office the next morning with scandalous pictures of Carmen she received with a blackmail demand for the negatives. Marlowe returns to Geiger's bookstore, where they are packing up the store. Marlowe follows a car to the apartment of Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who previously blackmailed General Sternwood. He returns to Geiger's house and finds Carmen there. She initially claims ignorance about the murder, then insists Brody killed Geiger. They are interrupted by the owner of the home, small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely).Marlowe follows Vivian to the apartment of Joe Brody, where he finds Brody armed, and Agnes and Vivian initially hiding. They are interrupted by Carmen, who wants her photos. Marlowe keeps the pictures and sends Vivian and Carmen home. Brody admits he was blackmailing both General Sternwood and Vivian, then he is suddenly shot and killed; the assailant flees. Marlowe chases and apprehends Carol Lundgren, Geiger's former driver, who has killed Brody in revenge for Geiger's death, not knowing the chauffeur killed Geiger. He takes Lundgren back to Geiger's house, where Lundgren has returned the body. He calls the police to the house to clear up both the Geiger and Brody murders.Marlowe visits Mars' casino, where he asks about Regan, who is supposed to have run off with Mars' wife. Mars is evasive and tells Marlowe that Vivian is running up gambling debts. Vivian wins a big wager and then wants Marlowe to take her home. A stooge of Mars' attempts to rob Vivian, but Marlowe intervenes and knocks him out.While driving home, Marlowe unsuccessfully presses Vivian on her connection with Mars, saying he knew the money she won and subsequent robbery were staged for Marlowe's benefit. Vivian admits to nothing. Marlowe returns home to find a flirtatious Carmen waiting for him. She admits she did not like Regan and mentions that Mars calls Vivian frequently. She attempts to seduce Marlowe, who throws her out of his apartment. The next day, Vivian tells him he can stop looking for Regan; he has been found in Mexico, and she is going to see him. Mars has Marlowe beaten up to emphasize the point.Harry Jones (Cook), an associate of Brody's who wants to marry Agnes, conveys an offer from her to reveal the location of Mars' wife for $200. When Marlowe goes to meet Jones, Canino, a killer hired by Mars, is there attempting to find Agnes himself. Canino poisons Jones after he discloses Agnes' location (which turns out to be false). Agnes telephones the office where Jones was killed while Marlowe is still there. He arranges to meet her anyway.Agnes reveals that she has seen Mona Mars near a town called Realito behind an auto repair shop. When he gets there, Marlowe is attacked by Canino. He wakes to find himself tied up, with Mona watching over him. Vivian then comes in. Mona angrily leaves after Marlowe tells her that Mars is a gangster and a killer. Vivian fears for Marlowe's life and frees him, allowing him to get to his car and his gun. She distracts Canino, who is shot by Marlowe. During the drive back to Geiger's bungalow, Vivian unconvincingly tries to claim she killed Sean Regan.When they arrive, Marlowe calls Mars and lies that he is still in Realito. They arrange to meet at Geiger's house, giving Marlowe ten minutes to prepare. Mars arrives with four men, who set up an ambush outside. Mars enters and is surprised by Marlowe, who holds him at gunpoint. Marlowe reveals he has discerned the truth: Mars has been blackmailing Vivian, claiming that her sister Carmen had killed Regan. As soon as Mars threatens Marlowe with his men outside, Marlowe retaliates by firing shots that just miss Mars, causing him to run outside, where he is mistakenly shot by his own men.Marlowe then calls the police, telling them that Mars is the one who killed Regan. In the process, he tells them that Vivian helped him with Eddie Mars, exempting her from criminal prosecution, and tells Vivian that her sister Carmen needs psychiatric care.", "output": "Question: Who attacks Marlowe?, Answer: Canino, Question: In which town Agnes reveals that she has seen Mona Mars?, Answer: Realito, Question: Who goes to Geiger's rare book shop ?, Answer: Marlowe., Question: Who was watching over Marlowe when he woke up?, Answer: Mona watching over him., Question: Who shoots Mars when he runs outside?, Answer: His men., Question: Who poisoned Jones?, Answer: Canino., Question: What does Marlowe lie to Mars about?, Answer: that he is still in Realito, Question: What does Camilla try to get back from Brody?, Answer: her pictures, Question: Who was previously blackmailed by gambler Joe Brody?, Answer: General Sternwood, Question: What did the wealthy retired general want to resolve?, Answer: Gambling debts, Question: Who killed Brody?, Answer: Carol Lundgren, Question: Where Did Agnes see Mona Mars?, Answer: Agnes saw Mona Mars near a town called Realito behind an auto shop., Question: Where does Marlowe and Mars arrange to meet?, Answer: at Geiger's house, Question: Who wants to marry Agnes?, Answer: Harry Jones., Question: What does Marlowe tell Vivian that her sister needs?, Answer: psychiatric care, Question: Who is running up gambling debts?, Answer: Vivian, Question: Who was waiting for Marlowe when he returned home?, Answer: Carmen, Question: Where does Marlowe tell Mars he is?, Answer: Realito, Question: Who was Brody blackmailing?, Answer: General Sternwood & Vivian, Question: Why did Vivian let Marlowe free?, Answer: Viviam feared Marlowe's life so she set him free., Question: Behind which shop Agnes sees Mona?, Answer: Auto repair shop, Question: Who was at Geiger's house when Marlowe returned to Geiger's house?, Answer: Carmen, Question: Where was Regan found?, Answer: Mexico, Question: What does Mars do when he arrives at geiger's house?, Answer: set up an ambush, Question: Who did Marlowe shot?, Answer: Marlowe shot Canino., Question: How much time does Marlowe have to prepare?, Answer: 10 minutes, Question: Who is Geiger's former driver?, Answer: Carol Lundgren, Question: Who has Mars been blackmailing?, Answer: Vivian, Question: What is Geiger's rare book shop in reality ?, Answer: A front for an illegal operation., Question: Who supposedly ran off with Mars wife?, Answer: Regan, Question: Who unconvincingly tries to claim, she has killed Sean Regan?, Answer: Vivian, Question: Is Mars married?, Answer: Yes, Question: Whom did Marlowe not liked?, Answer: Regan, Question: Who is Charlotte's missing husband?, Answer: Rusty Regan, Question: Who does Philip Marlowe square up against?, Answer: Vivian Rutledge, Question: Why was Marlowe surprised?, Answer: Mars enters, Question: Who attacked Marlowe?, Answer: Canino attacked Marlowe., Question: Who minds Geiger's rare book shop ?, Answer: Agnes Louzier, Question: What happened to his young friend Sean Regan?, Answer: Disappeared, Question: What made Mona leave angry?, Answer: Mona left angry after discovering that Mars is a ganster and a killer, Question: How many men are in the ambush?, Answer: five", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

While not complete strangers, the five are all from different cliques or social groups: John Bender (Judd Nelson) \"The Criminal\"; Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald) \"The Princess\"; Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) \"The Brain\"; Andy Clark (Emilio Est\u00e9vez) \"The Athlete\"; and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) \"The Basket Case\". The school's disciplinary principal, Mr. Vernon, gives them all an assignment; they will write an essay about \"who you think you are\" and the violations they committed to end up in Saturday detention.They pass the hours in a variety of ways: they dance, harass each other, tell stories, fight, smoke marijuana, and talk about a variety of subjects. Gradually they open up to each other and reveal their secrets, for example, Allison is a compulsive liar, and Brian and Claire are ashamed of their virginity and Andy got in trouble because of his overbearing father. They also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents and are afraid of making the same mistakes as the adults around them. However, despite these evolving friendships, they're afraid that once the detention is over, they will return to their respective cliques and never speak to each other again.In the end, some of their more hidden character traits emerge: Claire emerges as a natural leader. Bender develops a softer attitude and becomes more friendly with everyone. Claire even kisses him and it seems the two will try a romantic relationship. Andrew becomes interested in Allison after she allows Claire to give her a makeover.At Claire's request and the consensus of the group, Brian agrees to write the essay Mr. Vernon assigned earlier, which challenges Mr. Vernon and his preconceived judgments about all of them. While Brian accedes, instead of writing about the actual topic, he writes a very motivating letter that is in essence, the main point of the story. He signs the essay \"The Breakfast Club\", and leaves it on the table for Mr. Vernon to read when they leave. There are two versions of this letter, one read at the beginning and one at the end, and they differ slightly; illustrating the shift in the students' judgments of one another, and their realization that they truly have things in common. The beginning of the letter is as follows:\"Saturday, March 24, 1984Brian Johnson [although unknown at this point]Shermer High SchoolShermer, Illinois 60062Dear Mr. Vernon:We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong. What we did was wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write this essay telling you who we think we are. What do you care? You see us as you want to see us... in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Correct? That's how we saw each other at seven o'clock this morning. We were brainwashed.The letter read before the closing credits reads as follows:\"Dear Mr. Vernon:We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong, but we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us... In the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain......and an athlete... ...and a basket case......a princess......and a criminal.Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.The letter is the focal point of the film, as it demonstrates and illustrates the changes the students undergo during the course of the day; their attitudes and perspectives have changed and are now completely different. The movie ends as the characters leave detention. The final shot shows Bender walking near the goal post of the football field, freezing as he raises his hand triumphantly and fading to a dark frame as the credits roll.", "output": "Question: What is Allison's problem?, Answer: The basket Case, Question: What time will the students be released from detention?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Which student is a compulsive liar?, Answer: Allison, Question: Which member is a virgin?, Answer: Brian and Claire, Question: What does Vernon lock John in?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who did Claire kiss in the closet?, Answer: Bender, Question: Which character has an antagonistic relationship with Mr. Vernon?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who gives John a diamond earring?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Where is John supposed to be?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What is the topic of the essay Mr. Vernon assigns the students?, Answer: Who they think they are, Question: For whom does Brian leave the written essay to be read by in the library?, Answer: Mr. Vernon, Question: Where are the students gathered?, Answer: They are gathered at their high school for Saturday detention., Question: What did the students smoke?, Answer: Marijuana, Question: Does Mr. Vernon stay in the library the entire day with the students?, Answer: No, Question: What the does the group request Brian to complete?, Answer: Essay, Question: Who gets the marijuana from their locker?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who completes the essay by himself?, Answer: Brian, Question: What sport is Andrew involved in?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who throws his fist in the air?, Answer: John Bender, Question: What does Vernon assign them?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What did Allison receive from Claire?, Answer: Makeover, Question: Who does John return to the storage closet?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What school did the students go to?, Answer: Shermer High School, Question: Who doesn't kiss anyone?, Answer: Brian Johnson, Question: Which student is a virgin?, Answer: Brian and Claire, Question: What is the assistant principal's name?, Answer: Mr. Vernon, Question: What does Allison take from Andrew?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What weekday did the students report for all-day detention?, Answer: saturday, Question: What sort of household does John come from?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Does John get more detention after today?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: How was Brian planning to kill himself?, Answer: <No Answer>", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

During their escape, they find themselves on an airfield, where they hide the rocket pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord, whose Gee Bee racer was totaled during the accident, and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a bi-plane cockpit. Meanwhile, well-known actor Neville Sinclair, who hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket pack is at the airfield.Cliff's aspiring actress girlfriend, Jenny Blake, has a bit part in the latest Neville Sinclair film. On the set, Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local air show, Cliff uses the rocket pack (and Peevy's newly designed face-hiding finned helmet) to rescue his friend Malcolm, who is drunkenly piloting a bi-plane. Having been seen by the newsreel press in the airshow audience (and Valentine's gangsters), \"The Rocketeer\" becomes a media sensation.Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its detailed schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy, trapped by several Valentine mobsters, learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum.[Note 1]At Sinclair's home, Jenny discovers that he is a Nazi secret agent, and Jenny knocks him out. She is later detained and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Howard Hughes, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes reveals his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing. When Secord asks why there is so much interest in the rocket pack, Hughes shows a horrifying propaganda film depicting flying soldiers invading the United States and hoisting a Nazi flag over the White House. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.Cliff flies to the rendezvous, where Sinclair demands that Cliff give him the rocket pack. Cliff divulges to the mobsters that the actor is a Nazi spy; Valentine turns his weapon on Sinclair and Lothar, but Sinclair summons 60 heavily armed Nazi S.A. commandos hidden at the observatory. The Nazi rigid airship Luxembourg appears overhead to evacuate Sinclair. FBI agents suddenly announce their presence, having secretly surrounded the area; they and the mobsters join forces to battle the Nazis. Sinclair and Lothar escape, dragging Jenny with them aboard the airship.Cliff flies to and boards the airship, but during the ensuing showdown, Jenny accidentally sets the bridge on fire using a flare gun. Sinclair takes the rocket pack to save himself, saying \"I'll miss Hollywood\". However, Cliff has removed the makeshift chewing gum patch from the tank, which is now leaking. The fuel catches fire, and the fire follows the vapor trail to the rocket pack's fuel tank, which also catches fire, causing Sinclair to plummet to his death near the \"HOLLYWOODLAND\" sign; the resulting explosion destroys the LAND part of the sign. Lothar is engulfed in flames as the airship explodes, but Cliff and Jenny are rescued at the last moment by Hughes and Peevy flying an autogyro.Hughes later presents Cliff with a brand-new Gee Bee air racer and a fresh pack of chewing gum.

Lorenzo, preferring a law-abiding life as an MTA bus driver, politely declines. Sonny befriends Calogero and introduces him to his crew. Calogero earns tips amounting to $600 working in the Mafia bar and throwing dice, and is admonished harshly by Lorenzo when he discovers it. Lorenzo speaks severely to Sonny, returns the money, and angrily warns him to keep away from Calogero.Eight years later in 1968, Calogero (now played by Lillo Brancato, Jr.) has grown into a young man who has secretly been visiting Sonny regularly without his father's knowledge. Calogero is also part of a gang of local Italian American boys, which concerns Sonny, who warns Calogero to keep away from them and focus more on his schoolwork. Later on, Calogero meets an African American girl named Jane Williams (Taral Hicks), and is smitten with her. Despite the high level of racial tension and dislike between Italian Americans and African Americans, Calogero arranges a date with Jane. He asks for advice from both his father and Sonny, with the latter lending Calogero his car. Later, Calogero's friends beat up the black cyclists who ride through their neighbourhood, despite Calegero's attempts to defend them. One of the cyclists is revealed to be Jane's brother, Willie. Willie mistakes Calogero for one of the assailants. He then accuses \"C\" of beating him up when Calogero and Jane meet for their date. Calogero loses his temper over the accusation and Willie's lack of gratitude, responding by accidentally addressing him with a racial slur. He instantly regrets it, but it's too late. Heartbroken, Jane walks back to the car with Willie and leaves Calogero.At home, Calogero is confronted by his father who just saw him driving Sonny's car. An argument ensues and Calogero storms out. Shortly thereafter, Calogero is confronted by Sonny and his crew, who found a bomb in Sonny's car and suspected Calogero of planning to assassinate him. Calogero tearfully proclaims his love for and dedication to Sonny. Sonny recognizes Calogero's innocence and allows him to leave. Lorenzo emerges to defend his son, but is held back by Sonny's men. The African American boys egg the Italian American boys' usual spot in retaliation for the previous beating, and Calogero's friends make a plan to strike back using Molotov cocktails. They try to force Calogero to participate, but Sonny stops the car and orders Calogero out. Calogero catches up with Jane, who tells him that Willie had since admitted that the boy who beat him up wasn't Calogero. Jane and Calogero make amends, but Calogero suddenly remembers his friends' plans to attack Jane's neighborhood, and the two rush to stop them. Calogero and Jane arrive to find the Italian American boys' car in flames. During the attack, someone threw one of the Molotov cocktails back into the car window, igniting the remaining bottles. The resulting crash and explosion killed everyone in the vehicle.Calogero rushes into the crowded bar to thank Sonny for saving his life, but an unnamed assailant shoots Sonny in the back of the head before Calogero can warn him. Calogero later learns that the assailant was the son of the man who Sonny killed in the beginning in the film. A funeral is then held for Sonny, where countless people come to pay their respects. When the crowd disperses, Carmine (Joe Pesci) visits the funeral, claiming that Sonny once saved his life as well. Calogero does not recognize Carmine until he sees a scar on his forehead and realizes he was the man being assaulted eight years ago. Carmine tells Calogero that he will be taking care of the neighborhood for the time being, and promises Calogero help should he ever need anything. Carmine leaves just as Calogero's father unexpectedly arrives to pay his respects to Sonny, thanking him for saving his son's life. Lorenzo later says that he had never hated Sonny, but merely resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly. Calogero makes peace with his father, and the two walk home as Calogero narrates the life lessons that he learned from the two men.", "output": "Question: Who does the story revolve around?, Answer: the mob, Question: The name of the movie is A ____ Tale?, Answer: Bronx, Question: In a lot of ways, what does the movie resemble?, Answer: living life next to the mob, Question: Who directed \"A Bronx Tale\"?, Answer: Robert Dinero", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Sam works as a guide in the local aquatic theme park, \"Atlantis\", and Jared has worked a number of odd jobs in his field of passion, diving. His real dream, though, is finding one of many merchant and pirate ships lost in the waters around the Bahamas, many of them with large amounts of gold on board.Jared's friend Bryce (Scott Caan) and his girlfriend Amanda (Ashley Scott) come to visit, as Bryce, a lawyer in New York City, has acquired the use of a luxury vacation house from a client he defended. While snorkeling, Jared comes across artifacts that seem to stem from a ship wreck. The four of them investigate and find several other pieces that turn out to be the remains of a legendary French pirate ship, the Zephyr, lost as the pirate made his getaway.This legendary shipwreck is rumored to contain millions of dollars in gold. The foursome, thinking their dreams of discovering buried treasure have finally come true, decide to investigate. While exploring it to try and stake their claim, they come across the remains of a crashed plane carrying a large quantity of cocaine. Bryce and Amanda are advocates of keeping the cocaine to sell it for profit, while Jared and Sam oppose it. To avoid attracting attention to the location of their treasure find, Bryce and Amanda agree not to report the crashed plane and its illegal cargo until they have secured their claim on the sunken ship.Jared and Bryce go to a local boat supplier in order to make a deal for the equipment needed to retrieve the treasure, with Bryce funding the purchase. However, Jared soon finds out that Bryce, during a trip to Las Vegas about a month ago, borrowed money from a loan shark and is in heavy debt and therefore is in no position to pay for anything.Without Jared's knowledge, Bryce and Amanda come up with a plan to retrieve some of the cocaine from the sunken plane and sell it to local night club owner Primo (Tyson Beckford). Unfortunately, Primo turns out to be an associate of the drug lord Reyes (James Frain) to whom the cocaine belonged in the first place. Reyes, wanting his cocaine back, threatens Jared, Amanda and Bryce at gunpoint to bring him his cocaine or die.Faced with this choice, Jared agrees to retrieve the cocaine. However, he tells Reyes that he will need $30,000 worth of non-refundable diving equipment to do so. Instead, he uses the situation to get to the gear he needs to salvage the Zephyr.Back on land, the trio breaks the bad news to Sam. Sam is heartbroken that Jared would violate his principles and work for drug lords. He tries to convince her that it's okay and that it's a one-time thing, but Sam leaves him, saying that 'they' are over.Jared, Bryce, and Amanda head to sea. They start the night's work by uncovering the site of the Zephyr, finding the ship's bell with the name on it. For Jared, the victory feels hollow, though.As they are moving the cocaine packs from the plane to their surface boat, Amanda is attacked by a large tiger shark. She is brought to the hospital where she dies due to a huge bite out of her left leg. Hearing of the tragedy, Sam comes to the hospital and she and Jared are reunited.While driving back from the hospital, the threesome (Jared, Sam, and Bryce) are confronted by Primo at an intersection. A short, but intense car chase ends up with Jared leaving their truck and telling Bryce and Sam to meet him later. He surrenders to Primo and tries to get them to back off by offering them and their boss the loot on the Zephyr. Primo still takes him to Reyes' boat. The boat looks deserted, so Primo tells Jared to lie down on the floor of the state room while he investigates. After some time, when Primo doesn't return, Jared goes to explore. He finds Primo, Reyes and several others shot dead in one the bedrooms. Out from the toilet comes Bates (Josh Brolin), a local salvager and former employer of Jared's. He asks Jared where \"his cocaine\" is and Jared bolts. He escapes from the boat and heads for shore.Meanwhile, Sam insists on going to the police, and goes to the private home of one of their friends, a local cop named Roy (Dwayne Adway). Bryce drops her off, but thinking they'll get busted, heads off to meet Jared. Roy comforts Sam and tells her he knows a guy who can help, but that it has to be kept outside of the official channels, as he's not sure who he can trust. Roy betrays Sam and takes her to Bates, who captures her.Jared and Bryce meet up and Jared calls the captive Sam, who is handcuffed and gagged with duct tape. Bates answers her cell phone and tells Jared to disclose the location of the cocaine. Jared insists that they meet and Jared show him to the location. Bryce and Jared then make a plan to settle the situation once and for all.Jared is taken aboard Bates' boat, the Sea Robin. Here he is shown Sam, who is in the engine room, handcuffed to the body of Roy and gagged with duct tape, who was shot by Bates. The Sea Robin heads for the location where Jared directs them, but as they approach the area, they see a white substance floating on the surface. Jared tells Bates that it's half of the cocaine, ruined, and that Jared will destroy the rest. He jumps into the water, and Bates and his men, after changing into Scuba gear, go after him. Below the surface, in the plane, the divers look for Jared. Bryce has switched places with one of the dead pilots, and they use this to mount a surprise attack. An underwater struggle follows, killing all of Bates' men and wounding Bryce.Meanwhile, Sam finds a forgotten machete in the engine room and uses it to free herself from Roy's body by cutting off his arm. She then severs a pipe, which brings one of Bates' men down into the engine room, where she locks him in. They then goes up to the bridge to call for help. The man escapes from the engine room; a chase around the boat ends in a fight that Sam ultimately wins as they go into the water and the man, wounded by Sam with a boat hook, is attacked by another tiger shark.Below, Jared and Bates are the only ones left. Jared uses an air tank as a missile by hammering off the valve. Bates escapes it, but as it hits the fuel tank at the back of the plane, it causes the entire plane to explode, killing Bates. Sam jumps into the water, fearing for Jared's life, but he survives.Six weeks later. The trio is salvaging the Zephyr. After trying to bring an old cannon atop fails and the cannon sinks back down to the bottom, Sam and Jared call it a night. However, Bryce sees something in the water, uncovered as the cannon hit the wood of the wreck's deck. He jumps in and dives down. As he comes back up he announces that he found the gold of the Zephyr.", "output": "Question: Where does the plane crash?, Answer: The waters around the Bahamas", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}]
