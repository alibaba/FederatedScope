It is rather a metaphor to a student who instead of doing his homework properly at the home, he did it in hurry, supported his notebook on knees and did it in a short break between classes. In other words it means doing something in hurry, usually resulting in poor quality and unsophisticated enough. Some usage: Who designed this building? Looks like some architect 'made it on a knee'... Or nowadays according to software engineering: There are lots of bugs in this application! They came short on deadlines and 'wrote it on their knees' even without unit tests... My question is, is there an English equivalent (in idiom or phrase) which preserves this meaning better? Edit After reading some answers I realized that my examples were a little bit misleading. In reality, the phrase does not carry itself any negative connotations about the 'author'. Rather poor quality of his job results. The only negative connotations about author we can only deduce from the quality of his job: 'He did his job inaccurately so we can assume that he may be inaccurate.' or 'You Will Know Them by Their Fruits' sort of thing. \nAnswer: Haste makes waste.

The weekend would be the 6th & 7th. How do you refer properly to the coming weekend, \"This weekend\" or \"Next weekend\"? I believe that using \"next weekend\" would refer to the 13th & 14th and \"this weekend\" would refer to this week's end. Technically the coming weekend (6th & 7th) would be the next weekend on the calendar. So which is correct? I'm hoping for a definitive answer with backing since this is an argument over opinion. \nAnswer: The issue isn't as definitive as you might think. Ultimately, it comes down to what interpretation of \"next\" you consider to be correct. For example, the American Heritage Dictionary (4th ed) defines 'next' simply as Immediately following, as in time, order, or sequence Following this definition, \"next weekend\" will always mean the weekend with the start date in closes proximity in time. If the phrase is used during a weekend, of course, you'd be referring to the weekend following the one you are currently experiencing. However, the issue gets more complicated if you look to other definitions. The Oxford American Dictionary has a specific definition for 'next' when used in the context of time: (of a day of the week) nearest (or the nearest but one) after the present : not this Wednesday, next Wednesday Here, we're given the choice: it can either mean the weekend with the closest start date, or the following one (as specified by the parenthetical addition or the nearest but one). This definition has come about mostly because of usage development. Many words and phrases in the english dictionary have meanings contrary to their technical definitions, and yet are still used commonly and considered valid. Thus, while technically \"next\" implies immediate sequence, it is used in other ways (which dictionaries like the OAD have accommodated for validity), so it's really a matter of personal preference. For example, it is unlikely that I will even use the phrase \"next weekend\" during the week, because some people might be confused as to what I am referring to. Instead, I will say \"this weekend,\" unless it is currently the weekend, in which case I will say \"next weekend.\".", "output": "yes", "category": "Answerability Classification 854.json"}, {"instruction": "Given the Question and Answer pair, detect whether the answer is acceptable or not.

It is often used to describe someone who has been very seriously injured. For example (15 December 2019): \"[A police officer] said the man who had been shot was in a \"critical but stable \" condition in hospital.\" I understand that \"critically ill\" means that life is in danger.

'critically ill patients who were awaiting surgery' stable (of a patient or their medical condition) not deteriorating in health after an injury or operation. 'he is now in a stable condition in hospital' What does \"critical but stable\" really mean? \nAnswer: Trying to find a meaning in these words by following a definition is the wrong approach, as critical but stable is a kind of euphemism. Much in the same way as the wording \"according to circumstances\" is, depending on how it's being said, either a polite way of saying: \"I have no idea!\", or \"I'm not going to tell you!\". Most certainly, every patient's condition is \"according to circumstances\" (whatever the circumstances may be!), so basically saying that is nothing but saying: \"Bugger off!\", only more polite, and less troubling for people who are emotinally involved. Because after all, if the situation is good according to circumstances, that's quite positive, is it not! Similarly, when you say \"critical\", then that means as much as \"that doesn't look good, I expect the person may die\". You do not say that to either relatives or in public. You do not say that to, or nearby, the patient (awake or unconcious) either. Never, not ever. The consequences of saying such a thing may be terrible. Thus, when you are saying such a thing, you add \"but stable\" which in reality means nothing more but \"we're currently not desperately trying to stop this bleeding, and we're currently not reanimating\".

Am I right to describe the use of the word \"suck\" in such context? \nAnswer: Yes, as used in the OP, \"sucks\" is always slang. SUCKS transitive verb; slang: a. To be highly unpleasant or disagreeable: This job sucks. b. To be of poor or inferior quality: The acting in that movie sucked. c. To be inept: I suck at math. see TFD The fixed-phrase \"this/that SUCKS dick/cock\" gained currency exclusively among male American youth in the early 1970's as a derogatory slang expression of general contempt for some object, activity, or person. The phrase was, as intended, unapologetically misogynistic and homophobic. In the seventies, female youth never employed this idiom. No surprise there, though this is no longer the case. By the late seventies, probably in order to evade adult censure (and since youth knew precisely what was intended), the last word of the phrase was dropped. If the term is currently considered to be non-vulgar it is most likely due to this partial sanitization and because contemporary youth are ignorant of the original misogynistic and homophobic intent. see, ELU; UE;.", "output": "no", "category": "Answerability Classification 854.json"}, {"instruction": "Given the Question and Answer pair, detect whether the answer is acceptable or not.

I was under the impression that farthest is strictly speaking in terms of distance, whereas furthest is more abstract. A poster on this forum gives the following example: The further [quantity] you walk, the farther [distance] you get. What gives? \nAnswer: The NOAD I had on my Mac Mini reported the following note, which is the same note found on the Oxford Living Dictionaries about farther and farthest. Traditionally, farther and farthest were used in referring to physical distance: the falls were still two or three miles farther up the path. Further and furthest were restricted to figurative or abstract senses: we decided to consider the matter further. Although farther and farthest are still restricted to measurable distances, further and furthest are now common in both senses: put those plants the furthest from the window.", "output": "yes", "category": "Answerability Classification 854.json"}, {"instruction": "Given the Question and Answer pair, detect whether the answer is acceptable or not.

After a little bit of searching it seems that they are, with shat being Old English. Is any form more common in British or American English? Erik Kowal claims that shit is mostly American English and shat British English. [M]ost Americans don't change the verb form for the past tense of certain short verbs ending in -it. So fit, spit, shit, slit and pit are thus formed both in the present and the past tense as far as Americans are concerned, whereas people from Britain would almost always use fitted, spat, shat, slitted and pitted for the past tense. What about shitted? \nAnswer: The OED's etymology for this word is: The form shite represents OE. *scitan, pa. t. *scat, pa. pple. -sciten (in be-sciten), corresponding to OFris. *skita (NFris. skitj, pa. t. skad, pa. pple. skedden), MLG. schiten, Dutch schijten, OHG. scian (MHG. schian, mod.G. scheissen), ONor. skita (MSw. skita, Da. skide), f. OTeut. root skit-. The now more common form shit is influenced by the pa. pple. or the related sb. As far as modern/current forms go, it says that: The present tense is either shit or shite. For the past tense, the OED gives all three of shit, shat, shitted as current. So the answer to your question is yes. For the past participle, the OED provides only shit and shat, with shitten last appearing in the 19th century. That means you won't find any one \"correct\" answer. Because those variant forms are all used natively by speakers born to the language, all are therefore \"correct\".

Second, shall I break the sentence into two or keep it compact in one? Third, any better way for saying that my profile meets their requirements? Any help on any of these questions will be appreciated. ////// \nAnswer: You don't need to explicitly express interest in a position. Your sending an application does that. You also don't need to say that your profile matches the requirements -- your CV says that. A cover letter is an opportunity to tell the employer something about yourself that isn't on your resume in a way that may lead to your employment. How a cover letter is received depends on who receives it -- you never know what a reader will find compelling. Still, you should try to be personal because it shows that you have something unique to say and can be a platform for your writing, which can be a draw to some employers regardless of other skills. Talk about why you are interested in a PhD position. Talk about how your interest in the field came about - what made it attractive to you. Talk about your strengths with examples that set you apart from others. If there are specific requirements for the job, try to show how you meet those requirements if it isn't clear from your CV.

They pinpoint a specific region of time. As such, seasons should be capitalized. However, the actual word 'season' (like any generic time period), should not be capitalized, as a particular time period is not being specified.
