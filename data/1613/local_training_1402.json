Lucy Seward [Kate Nelligan] goes to help her father Jack [Donald Pleasance] while the sickly Mina Van Helsing [Jan Francis], who is staying with the Sewards, remains in bed. Mina is awakened by the storm and sees a runaway ship. She races down to the beach and comes upon an injured man (Dracula, of course). The next day, Jonathan Harker [Trevor Eve] salvages Dracula's cargo and has Milo Renfield [Tony Haygarth] deliver it to Carfax Abbey where Dracula is staying.Some nights later, the Sewards hold a dinner party and invite Count Dracula [Frank Langella]. Mina is not feeling well, but Lucy and the Count hit it off. Later that night, Dracula comes to Mina's bedroom. The next morning, Mina dies. Seward sends for her father, Doctor Abraham Van Helsing [Laurence Olivier]. Van Helsing arrives just after Mina's burial and, because Seward must pick Van Helsing up at the station, Lucy alone accepts an invitation to dine with Dracula.That night, Mina kills a baby.The next evening, Dracula pays his respects to Mina's grave and meets Van Helsing. Dracula comes to Lucy that night and 'mates' with her. Knowing that Mina is vampire, Van Helsing and Seward track her down and destroy her. Dracula confronts Van Helsing who determines that Dracula casts no reflection in a mirror and thus is the vampire. The next day, while Lucy is held in a sanitarium cell for her own protection, Harker and Van Helsing search out Dracula's coffin at Carfax. But it is empty! During daylight hours? \"After my rest, my need is only to stay in darkness,\" Dracula admits. Harker visits Lucy in her cell only to discover that she is turning vampire. Dracula enters the sanitarium, kills Renfield, and escapes with Lucy.Dracula and Lucy, pursued by Harker, Seward and Van Helsing, begin a wild dash for the shipyard. Although Harker's car suffers axle damage and they must walk, they arrive at the dock just as Dracula's ship clears the harbor. Harker and Van Helsing snatch a boat and catch up with the vessel. They find Lucy and Dracula asleep in their coffin. Van Helsing attempts to stake Dracula, but Dracula awakens in time to stake Van Helsing instead. Just before he dies, Van Helsing hooks a cargo winch in Dracula's back and hoists him up out of the hold into the sun. Dracula is destroyed by the light, and Lucy is released. But Dracula's cape suddenly takes flight, and Lucy smiles.

The film is a stylised, downbeat comedy, following the pair through a single day, which, like every other, is devoted to scrounging and robbing money to buy heroin.Adam and Paul wake up sick in the middle of a field with Adam glued to a mattress. They make their way into town via a run-in with a terrified and terrifying drug dealer named Martin in Flat 63 of a tower block in Ballymun, a hasty exit from the top deck of a bus, a long trudge down the median of a dual carriageway and an incident with a moped that injures Paul's leg. Wandering through St Stephen's Green they meet their old gang who are drinking cans and having \"a little picnic for the kiddies\".

Marian, backed by her brother Wayne, warns them to stay away from his sister, Janine. To the disgust of Wayne and the girls, Georgie lets slip that there is a \"do\" on for Matthew that night in the Bunker pub.From here we follow the boys aimlessly wandering around the city looking for an unknown person\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps a contact that might be able to sort them out with a fix. They have a misunderstanding with a homeless guy in a sleeping bag who thinks they're looking for a local troublemaker under the alias of \"Clank\" who he mistakenly gathers owes them money. Paul hurts his hand in a botched attempt at a smash and grab; they get kicked out of a caf\u00c3\u00a9 for trying to steal a handbag and Paul gets barred from a shop for \"feelin' bread\". After a random argument with a Bulgarian immigrant (who asks them infuriated \"Why the fuck, are you here?\"), and failing to get anywhere in their search for drugs, they make their way to Janine's. She is not home but the door is left open. The boys are just about to steal her telly, when they hear the sound of a baby crying. Janine returns home to find the two gently holding and whispering to the baby. They leave Janine with the promise that they will see her again that night at the Bunker.The pair mug an adolescent with Down syndrome, but he does not have any cash or valuables. Later, a furious man grabs them, accusing them of spreading rumours that he owes them money. He identifies himself as Clank. Clank and his friend Zippy kidnap the two and force them to keep a lookout for trouble while they \"cause a bit of mayhem\" in a nearby garage with baseball bats. Adam and Paul fail to notice the arrival of police and both Clank and Zippy are arrested.The pair decide to take Clank's car to a fence, but crash in the process. Sitting on an old cooker down a back lane, they come across a flat-screen TV. They and Kittser, a stolen goods merchant, take the telly to Ballymun and attempt to sell it to an older man. But Kittser and the buyer argue and the telly gets damaged, forcing the again hopeless depressed Adam and Paul to leave. On the way out they pass the door of drug dealer Martin who is being raided by a gang of vigilantes.

One of the effects of the economic crisis is a decline in manufacturing, and heavy emphasis on recycling aging 20th-century mechanical equipment. Society has become increasingly bureaucratic and hypersexualized, with the declining number of human sexual encounters requiring contracts drawn up by lawyers prior to sexual activity. At the same time, robotic technology has made tremendous developments, and female androids (or \"gynoids\") are used as substitutes for wives.Business executive Sam Treadwell owns a \"Cherry 2000\" gynoid named Cherry. After Cherry short-circuits during sex, Sam is told by a repairman that she is irreparable. A gynoid dealer tells Sam that \"Cherry 2000\" gynoids were manufactured in a defunct factory in \"Zone 7\", a particularly dangerous, lawless area. With Cherry's memory disk, Treadwell hires Edith \"E\" Johnson, a tough tracker, to guide him to the factory.As they enter Zone 7, they encounter Lester, a wasteland overlord with deranged subordinates. Edith and Sam enter an underground reservoir occupied by Six-Fingered Jake, an elderly tracker who was Edith's mentor. When Lester's men attack, the three attempt to escape, but Sam is knocked unconscious and taken to a 1950s-styled motel/village run by Lester. He is greeted by his ex-girlfriend, Elaine, who now calls herself Ginger and works for Lester. Ginger tells Sam that he was the only one spared by Lester's men. Lester decides to induct Sam into the group, and Sam goes along. When he witnesses the group sadistically murdering a tracker, he decides to escape. As he escapes Lester's group, Sam runs into Edith and Jake. Jake stays behind to create some distractions, and gives Cherry's memory disk to Edith, though he had earlier led Sam to believe the chip had been lost.Edith, realizing Sam is a veteran of earlier wars, begins to see him in a new light and have feelings for him. Sam realizes he is attracted to Edith, but feels guilty when he is reminded of Cherry. After fighting off Lester's goons, they continue on to the factory. Edith goes to a brothel/gas station owned by Snappy, a friend of Jake, to borrow his light plane. Snappy betrays them to Lester. Jake is killed, but Edith and Sam escape in the plane.Sam suggests that they turn around, but Edith is determined to find a Cherry 2000 model so Jake's death will not be meaningless. As they land, Zone 7 is revealed to be actually the ruins of Las Vegas, now a ghost town. The gynoid \"factory\" is actually a casino called \"Pharaoh's Casino\". Sam finds a functional Cherry 2000, and activates her with the memory disk.When Lester's gang finds them, Edith and Sam manage to evade and kill many of his henchmen. Escaping to the plane, the three find that their combined weight prevents takeoff. Edith jumps out, despite Sam rejecting the idea. Sam turns the plane around to help the now-trapped Edith. Sam sends Cherry to get him a Pepsi, then has Edith get aboard. Lester is killed trying to stop them from escaping.

She reveals to Tom that her father is making her house-sit on the same night as a party she wants to attend, but Tom convinces her to stand up to her father and attend the party anyway. Lisa asks him to come to their house that night, leading Tom to think that she has invited him to the party; in reality, she just wants him to fill in for her - he reluctantly agrees. A comedy of errors ensues, including the return of Lisa's older brother, Red, on the run from drug dealers. Red dumps drugs into the toilet, and instead returns a bag of flour to the drug dealer.

The Marquis has been publishing his work through laundress Madeleine \"Maddy\" LeClerc (Kate Winslet), who smuggles manuscripts through an anonymous horseman (Tom Ward) to a publisher. The Marquis' latest work, Justine, is published on the black market to great success. Napoleon (Ron Cook) orders all copies of the book burned and the author shot, but his advisor, Delben\u00e9 (Patrick Malahide), tempers this contentious idea with one of his own: send traditionalist Doctor Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) to look in at Charenton and silence the Marquis.Dr. Royer-Collard arrives, informing the Abb\u00e9 that the Marquis' \"therapeutic writings\" have been distributed for public consumption. Horrified, the Abb\u00e9 rejects Royer-Collard's offers of several archaic \"treatments\" and asks to speak with the Marquis himself, who promptly swears obedience (winking at Madeleine through a peephole). Royer-Collard takes his leave for the time being and travels to the Panthemont Convent in Paris to retrieve his promised bride, the underage Simone (Amelia Warner). They are given a run-down chateau by the Emperor, with a handsome young architect, Prouix (Stephen Moyer) on hand for its renovation.The hasty marriage incites much gossip at the asylum, prompting the Marquis to write a farce to be performed at a public exhibition. The audacious play, titled \"The Crimes of Love\", is interrupted when the inmate Bouchon (British character actor Stephen Marcus) molests Madeleine off-stage, prompting her to hit him in the face with an iron. Royer-Collard shuts down the public theater and demands that the Abb\u00e9 do more to control the Marquis. Infuriated, the Abb\u00e9 confiscates the Marquis' quills and ink, prompting more subversive behavior, including a story written in wine on bedsheets and in blood on clothing. This results in further deprivation, eventually leaving the Marquis naked in an empty cell.While this is occurring at the asylum, Simone has been violently introduced to the adult world by her husband. She unrepentantly purchases a copy of the Marquis de Sade's Justine, seduces Prioux, and the young lovers run off together. She leaves behind a letter explaining her actions and her copy of Justine. Upon finding this, Dr. Royer-Collard seizes on the Marquis as the source of his troubles and embarks upon a quest for revenge.About to be sent away from Charenton for her role in assisting the Marquis, Madeleine begs a last story from him, which is to be relayed to her through the asylum patients. Bouchon, the inmate at the end of the relay, is excited by the story, breaks out of his cell, and kills Madeleine. The asylum is set afire by the pyromaniac Dauphin (George Yiasoumi) and the inmates break out of their cells.Madeleine's body is found by her blind mother in the laundry vat and Bouchon is captured and imprisoned inside an iron dummy. The Abb\u00e9 blames the Marquis for Madeleine's death and prods him into a fury. The Marquis claims he had been with Madeleine in every way imaginable, only to be told she had died a virgin. The Abb\u00e9 cuts out the Marquis' tongue as punishment for his involvement. In a later scene, the Abbe commits necrophilia with the corpse of Madeline in a dream. The Marquis' health declines severely, though perverse as ever, he decorates his oubliette with a story, using feces as ink. As the Abb\u00e9 finishes reading the last rites, he offers the Marquis a crucifix to kiss, which he swallows and chokes on, thus committing suicide.A year later, the new Abb\u00e9 du Maupas (Alex Avery) arrives at Charenton and is given the grand tour. The asylum has been converted into a printing press, with the inmates as its staff. The books being printed are the works of the Marquis de Sade. At the end of the tour, the new Abb\u00e9 meets his predecessor, who resides in the Marquis' old cell. Yearning to write, he begs paper and a quill from the Abb\u00e9, who is herded off by Royer-Collard, now overseer of the asylum. However, the peephole opens, and Madeleine's mother thrusts paper, quill, and ink through.

When WCW Monday Nitro comes to their home state of Wyoming, they attend the show to watch their favorite wrestler, WCW World Heavyweight Champion Jimmy King (Oliver Platt) get cheated out of the title by Diamond Dallas Page (playing himself), and WCW CEO Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano), and DDP's partners. After the match, the two wrestling fans humorously express their rage in their septic truck, resulting in a car crash.After this event, Gordie believes that the car crash was fate and that they should make Jimmy King once again World Champion. Sean agrees to help Gordie, and the dimwitted duo go on a quest to put their King back on his throne. The next day, Gordie asks a friend to find out where the washed-up wrestler lives. Their friend succeeds, and they go to an unexpected-looking neighborhood. They find King's estranged wife (Caroline Rhea) and later his parents (Kathleen Freeman and Lewis Arquette). The parents tell them that King borrowed their mobile home, and never returned it. The duo find King and become over-excited. They have a conversation, and when King says that he gives up on wrestling, Gordie and Sean anger him to the point where he suddenly attacks the two boys. The boys encourage King to beat them up, which influenced him to return to wrestling. Then Gordie and Sean are knocked out when Jimmy King does his finishing move.The two boys wake up the next day when Jimmy King drips beer on their faces. Later that day, the trio go on a road trip. Gordie sends letters to his father, who wanted Gordie to follow in his footsteps to be a policeman, but Gordie says that he will not join him in a policeman test, making him frustrated. Gordie, King, and Sean go to the New York Arena where they hide King in a port-a-potty and they meet one of the Nitro Girls, Sasha (Rose McGowan). When DDP mocks Jimmy King on camera, King comes out of the port-a-potty and beats him up. Sinclair, therefore, declares a Triple Cage match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship plus a $1,000,000 cash prize. However, if King loses, he will never wrestle again.Sasha is impressed by Gordie, and they go to her apartment. Jimmy King is in deep need of a trainer. They go to a local training center, where King meets his former partner, Bill Goldberg. They also find Sal Bandini (Martin Landau), who beats up King. He is then hired as their trainer, but he becomes hospitalized when Sid Vicious and Perry Saturn attack him that night. Gordie finds out that Sasha has been spying on them for Titus and breaks up with her. They take King to his wife's home.When they try to get a new partner for King, Gordie's father comes along, gets Gordie and convinces him that his dream of working with Jimmy King was stupid. When Gordie was at home, Sean and King tried to bust him out, but Gordie refused (an ironic change in Gordie as he once encouraged King to return to wrestling). But the next day, Gordie comes at an entourage audition and is thanked by King for everything Gordie did for him. No one, however, was able to make the cut, and so King has to face DDP alone. Initially King is alone, but after he gets a horrible beatdown by DDP and his goons starting with King's own son, Goldberg, Booker T, Billy Kidman, Disco Inferno come to his aid but aren't able to get into the cage until Gordie shows up and crashes a motorcycle through the cage door. Gordie and the others deal with DDP's posse and defeat them while King and DDP climb the cage to get the belt. Sasha attempts reuniting with Gordie as the fans love him, but is knocked out by a ladder being swung around during the match after not listening to Sean's warning. DDP manages to throw King back to the mat, but is knocked back there himself by Sting. The two climb to the top again and fight it out and King manages to defeat DDP, throwing him through the cages to the mat, knocking him out. King retrieves the belt and is once again champion. After this, Sinclair is booed by the fans then beaten up by Sean and Gordie who toss him to the fans who beat him up some more. Goldberg later asks King to re-team with him, but the new champ announces his new partner will be Gordie and their manager will be Sean. Gordie's father watches the match on TV and after seeing how good Gordie is, accepts Gordie's choice and even cheers for him.The epilogue shows Sean telling kids \"dreams can come true\" back at the convenience store, where Gordie and Goldberg teach the clerk a lesson by hurling him out on the street for being mean to kids.

The two soldiers confront each other in a trench, where they wait for dark. They trade insults and even find some common ground. Confounding the situation is another wounded Bosniak soldier (Cera, portrayed by Filip \u00c5\u00a0ovagovi\u00c4\u0087) who wakes from unconsciousness.

UNPROFOR's mission in Bosnia was to guard the humanitarian aid convoys, to remain neutral and act as a mere bystander. Luckily, an English reporter arrives on scene, bringing media pressure to bear that moves the United Nations high command to swing into action to try to save the soldiers.A row between the stressed out and fatigued \u00c4\u008ciki and Nino gradually escalates even after being rescued.

As he is reading the latest issue of Playduck magazine, his armchair begins to quake violently and propels him out of his apartment building and into outer space; Howard eventually lands on Earth, in Cleveland, Ohio. Upon arriving, Howard encounters a woman being attacked by thugs. He defeats them using a unique style of martial arts. After the thugs flee, the woman introduces herself as Beverly Switzler, and decides to take Howard to her apartment and let him spend the night. The following day, Beverly takes Howard to Phil Blumbertt, a scientist who Beverly hopes can help Howard return to his world. After Phil is revealed to be only a janitor, Howard resigns himself to life on Earth and rejects Beverly's aid. He soon applies for a job as a janitor at a local romance spa. Because of unfair treatment, Howard quits and rejoins Beverly, who plays in a band called Cherry Bomb. At the club where Cherry Bomb is performing, Howard comes across their manager, and confronts him when he insults the band. A fight breaks out, in which Howard is victorious.Howard rejoins Beverly backstage after the band's performance and accompanies her back to her apartment, where Beverly persuades him to be the band's new manager. The two begin to flirt, but soon after that they are interrupted by Blumburtt and two of his colleagues, who reveal that a dimensional-jumping device they were inventing was aimed at Howard's planet and transported him to Earth when it was activated. They theorize that Howard can be sent back to his world through a reversal of this same process. Upon their arrival at the laboratory, the device malfunctions when it is activated, raising the possibility of something else being transported to Earth. At this point, Dr. Walter Jenning is possessed by a life form from another alternate dimension. When they visit a diner, the creature introduces himself as a \"Dark Overlord of the Universe\" and demonstrates his developing mental powers by destroying table utensils and condiments. A fight ensues when a group of truckers in the diner begins to insult Howard. Howard is captured and is almost killed by the diner chef, but the Dark Overlord destroys the diner and escapes with Beverly.Howard locates Phil, who is arrested for his presence at the laboratory with no security clearance. After they escape, they discover an ultralight aircraft, which they use to search for the Dark Overlord and Beverly. At the laboratory, the Dark Overlord ties Beverly down to a metal bed and plans to transfer another one of his kind into her body with the dimension machine. Howard and Phil arrive and apparently destroy the Dark Overlord with an experimental \"neutron disintegrator\" laser, which has only been forced out of Jenning's body. The Dark Overlord reveals his true form at this point. Howard fires the neutron disintegrator at the hideous beast, obliterating the creature, and destroys the dimension machine, preventing more creatures from arriving on Earth, but also ruining Howard's only chance of returning to his planet. Howard then becomes Beverly's manager, hires Phil as an employee on her tour, and plays guitar with Beverly on stage.", "output": "Question: How does the creature demonstrate his developing mental powers?, Answer: Destroying table utensils and condiments., Question: What planet does Howard the Duck live on?, Answer: Duckworld, Question: What does the Dark Overlord tie Beverly to?, Answer: metal bed, Question: Who does the woman introduce herself as?, Answer: Beverly Switzler, Question: How old is Howard the Duck?, Answer: 27 years old, Question: Howard serves what position on Beverly's tour?, Answer: manager, Question: What is the name of the band that Beverly is in?, Answer: Cherry Bomb, Question: What does the Dark Overlord tie Beverly down to?, Answer: the metal bed, Question: Who does the creature introduce himself as?, Answer: A dark overlord of the universe., Question: Who is arrested for being at the laboratory without a security clearance?, Answer: Phil, Question: Where does Beverly persuade Howard to be the band's new manager?, Answer: Her apartment., Question: Who is possessed by a life form from an alternate dimension?, Answer: Dr. Walter Jenning., Question: Who does the Woman Introduce Herself as?, Answer: Beverly Switzler, Question: Who interrupts Howard and Beverly flirting?, Answer: Blumburtt and two of his colleagues., Question: Who captures Howard?, Answer: Chef, Question: What do Howard and Phil discover?, Answer: ultralight aircraft, Question: How do Howard and Phil destroy Dark Overlord?, Answer: an experimental neutron disintegrator laser, Question: How rejoins Beverly backstage?, Answer: Howard., Question: Which character fires the neutron dis-integrator at the beast and destroys the dimension machine?, Answer: Howard, Question: Duckworld is similar to what planet?, Answer: Earth, Question: How many moons orbit Duckworld?, Answer: 2, Question: Phil is arrested at the laboratory for not having what?, Answer: Security Clearance, Question: Where does the group visit and encounter a group of truckers who insult Howard?, Answer: Diner, Question: What instrument does Howard play?, Answer: guitar, Question: What is the Band's Name?, Answer: Cherry Bomb, Question: What city does Howard land in?, Answer: Cleveland, Question: What does Beverly persuade Howard to be?, Answer: Band manager", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Five of their puppies look like their husky mother, while one pup, Aleu, clearly takes her looks from her wolfdog father. When they all reach eight weeks old, all of the other pups are adopted to new homes, but no one wants Aleu. Aleu stays with her father, Balto. A year later, after she is almost killed by a hunter, Balto tells Aleu the truth about her wolf heritage. In anger and sadness, she runs away, hoping to find her place in the world.At the same time, Balto has been struggling with strange dreams of a raven and a pack of wolves. He cannot understand what the dreams mean, but when Aleu doesn't come back the next day, he runs off to find her and bring her back home. He meets with mysterious creatures, like a cunning fox, a trio of wolverines that taunt him, the same guiding raven from his dreams, and a furious grizzly bear, that suddenly disappears as if it was never there.During the journey, his friends, Boris, a Russian snow goose, and Muk and Luk, twin polar bears, hope to find Balto, but they are halted by some unknown force. They soon realize that this journey to find Aleu is meant for the father and daughter themselves. Aleu, after taking refuge in a cave, meets the field mouse called Muru who lets Aleu realize that being part-wolf isn't so bad. He teaches her that everyone has a spirit guide. After singing the song \"Who are you?\", it turns out that Muru is Aleu's spirit guide.When Aleu and Balto reunite after a close escape from the bear, a part that helped them escape is a strange ability that Aleu managed to get somehow, and allowed Aleu see the bear's thoughts. Aleu has started to grow, telling her father that she's not going home until she finds out who she is. The two of them travel onward, both following the raven, to a starving pack of wolves by the ocean. They are led by an old wolf named Nava, who has magic powers and can contact the mysterious white wolf, Aniu, in his \"dream visions\". He tells his pack that one day soon, they will be led by a new leader, \"the one who is wolf but does not know.\" Everyone believes that Balto, who is half wolf himself, is the chosen one that Aniu was speaking of. However, Niju, a young wolf with the help of his three followers (Nuk, Yak, and Sumac), hopes that he will be the next leader since he is stronger and more powerful than the old, wise Nava.The day comes to depart from their home to follow the caribou, the wolves' food source, across the large sea using pieces of ice like a bridge, with Balto in the lead. When Nava is separated from the rest of the pack, Aleu joins him to help him across, but runs into Niju, who is ready to take the elderly leader's life and the young half-wolf's as well. Balto abandons the pack to save his daughter, but before anyone gets hurt, they realize that the pack is floating away, leaderless. Nava cannot make the swim in his old age, and Niju shows his fearfulness when Balto tells him to swim across to the pack and returns to his homeland. Balto is prepared to help the pack, but Aleu realizes that this is where she truly belongs. She makes the swim to the pack to become its leader as Nava returns to his home to find Niju.

Meanwhile, at Cross Lake, two farmers (Gary Busey and Clu Gulager) search the waters to recover the body of a dead cow. Piranha eggs that have been laid inside the cow hatch, and the farmers are killed by the swarm, but before they both die, one farmer pops out of the water, bites the head off one of the piranhas and spits it into the air before sinking back into the water.Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), a marine biology student, returns home for the summer to the waterpark she co-owns. She finds to her horror that the other co-owner, her step-father Chet (David Koechner), plans to add an adult-themed section to the waterpark with \"water-certified strippers\", and re-open it as \"Big Wet\". At a party at the waterpark that night, Maddy encounters several old acquaintances, including her policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle (Chris Zylka) and Barry (Matt Bush), who has secretly had a crush on her since grade school. She also runs into two of her close friends, Ashley (Meagan Tandy) and Shelby (Katrina Bowden). Shelby and her boyfriend Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) go skinny-dipping in the lake, where a piranha makes its way inside her vagina. Meanwhile, Ashley and her boyfriend Travis begin to have sex in their van, but Ashley accidentally trips the handbrake with her foot, causing the van to roll into the lake. Travis, handcuffed to the van during foreplay and unable to escape, is devoured while Ashley, on the roof of the van, calls for help. With no one around to hear her cries, the van sinks into the lake and she is eaten alive by the killer fish.The next day, Maddy is consoling Shelby about their missing friends. While sitting on a jetty, they are both attacked by a swarm of piranhas. They manage to kill one, and Maddy, Kyle and Barry take it to marine expert Carl Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) to examine. He informs them that the piranhas may be moving via sewage pipes and underground rivers between lakes, attracted by chemicals involved in swimming pool cleansers that match their spawning routes. However, the wider world wouldn't listen to his theory that the fish could evolve to become terrain-viable. The trio return to the lake, where they establish that the piranhas cannot make their way into the outflow pipes connecting the lake and the waterpark. While Shelby and Josh are having sex, the piranha in Shelby's vagina bites Josh's penis, forcing him to chop the organ off with a knife. Both are hospitalized, but survive. Kyle is revealed to be corrupt and taking bribes from Chet, who is secretly pumping water from an underground river into the waterpark, lowering his costs and boosting his profits. Chet orders Kyle to keep Maddy from finding out about his nefarious plans.\"Big Wet\" opens the next day. Among the first guests are Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames), who survived his previous ordeal with the piranhas but lost his legs, and former cameraman Andrew Cunningham (Paul Scheer). While the duo attempts to overcome their fear of the water after they were attacked a year ago, David Hasselhoff also makes an appearance as a celebrity lifeguard.Discovering the connection between the park and the underground river, Maddy attempts to shut the waterpark down, but is stopped by Chet and Kyle. The piranhas make their way to the area and attack, killing many of the lifeguards and waterpark-goers. Fallon attaches a shotgun prosthesis to his legs in order to save the visitors, while Hasselhoff, after rescuing a small boy named David (Matthew Lintz), is pleased that he has finally become a real lifeguard. In the chaos, Chet refuses to help any survivors, including Kiki (Irina Voronina), who is eaten by the fish. He reluctantly offers some cash to a young girl whose mother is dead, but then accidentally reverses over her with his golf cart. As he attempts to drive off to safety, Chet is then decapitated by a hanging cable.Maddy instructs Barry to begin draining the pools; however, while rescuing people from the water, she becomes caught in the suction and is dragged down to the bottom of the pool. After Kyle refuses to save her because of his fear of piranhas, Barry, despite being unable to swim, leaps down and brings her to the surface, whereupon Maddy is revived. She and Barry then kiss.Another employee, Big Dave, pours pure chlorine into the pipes, followed by a lit joint. The resulting explosion kills most of the piranhas, while Kyle is killed by a falling trident. The celebrations are cut short, however, when Maddy takes a phone call from a horrified Mr. Goodman, who informs them that the escaped piranha are evolving and are now able to move on land, to which Maddy replies that she knows. The film ends as the Piranha Queen emerges from the pool and decapitates David (the small child who Hasselhoff saved earlier), leading Hasselhoff to quip \"Little ginger moron\", while the surviving visitors pick up their phones and take pictures of the dead child.In a post-credits scene, Hasselhoff is running on a beach holding a trident, which is an advertisement for a film titled Fishhunter.", "output": "Question: Who emerges from the pool and decapitates David?, Answer: Piranha Queen, Question: Who attempts to shut the waterpark down?, Answer: Maddy, Question: Who is the marine expert?, Answer: Carl Goodman, Question: Who is talking bribes from Chet?, Answer: Kyle, Question: Who gets handcuffed inside the van?, Answer: Travis, Question: Who was searching for a dead cow?, Answer: Gary and Clu, Question: Who is running on a beach holding a trident in a post-credits scene?, Answer: Hasselhoff, Question: Who saves Maddy?, Answer: Barry, Question: Who is killed by a falling trident?, Answer: Kyle, Question: Who co-owns the waterpark with Maddy?, Answer: step-father Chet, Question: Who stops Maddy's attempt to shut down the waterpark?, Answer: Chet and Kyle, Question: Who pours pure chlorine into the pipes?, Answer: Big Dave, Question: Who makes an appearance as a celebrity lifeguard?, Answer: David Hasselhoff, Question: What was Kyle afraid of that he would not save Maddy?, Answer: Piranhas, Question: What is the name of the boy Hasselhoff rescues?, Answer: David, Question: Where was Gary and Clu searching for the dead cow?, Answer: Cross Lake, Question: Who is the former cameraman in this movie?, Answer: Andrew Cunningham (Paul Scheer), Question: What were Gary and Clu?, Answer: Farmers, Question: What's the adult themed section of the waterpark going to be called?, Answer: Big Wet, Question: who is secretlyWho is pumping water from an underground river into the waterpark?, Answer: Chet", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

After a while, his car swerves off the icy road in a blizzard. In the car, he has a flashback in which he is talking to his agent (portrayed by Lauren Bacall) about his last Misery book. He is rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who takes him back to her house for two days and reveales that she is his number one fan, hence the infamous quote \"I'm your number one fan\". When Annie asks if she can read his new book (in manuscript form) she proves to be more than a little eccentric when she lashes out in a fit of rage over the swearing in his book. When she leaves the room he seems fraked out and looks like he wants to leave quickly. The next day, Annie brings home a copy of the final Misery book and over the days reveals how many pages she has read. During which, she introuces him to her pet sow, Misery.The following night, she nearly kills him over the fact that he has killed Misery in his final book, tells him that she never called the local hospital (which she said she had) and threatens to kill him if anything happens to her. He immediately tries to escape but fails. The next day, Annie seems happy and tries to persuade him to burn the manuscript to which he seems reluctant. Later, she reveals she wants him to write a new book in which Misery comes back to life. When he sees a hairpin on the floor, he has an idea to buy time, he asks Annie to buy some different paper because his current paper smudges, to which she responds with another fit of rage. Whilst she is out shopping, Paul uses the hairpin to unlock his bedroom door and escape. However, he soon finds out that the front door is locked as well. He makes a visit to her living room and medicine closet. In the living room he accidentally knocks a small ceramic penguin off the table and puts it back the wrong way (this will become important later). He also realises that Annie's phone is a fake one, cancelling his chances of contacting the outside world. In the medicine closet, he takes some of the pills the Annie had been giving him for his fracture. He also tries to escape through her back door in the kitchen but cannot open it (I forgot to mention that he was bedridden for a few days and currently in a wheelchair). Soon, he hears Annie returning and immediately races back to his room. Fortunately, he gets back to his room in time just when she opens the door. She gets him back into bed and gives him a notepad and his pills (which he pretends to swallow).The following night, he saves up a lot of powder from the pills. In the morning, an argument starts between Paul and Annie about the book, which escalates into a humorous fit of rage about her growing up in Bakersfield watching chapter plays. Meanwhile, the local authorities find Sheldon's '65 Mustang buried in the snow. When Annie reads some of Paul's new manuscript she responds happily. Paul requsts that Annie have dinner with him to celebrate Misery's return. At the dinner, Paul makes a toast to Misery's return but asks if she has any candles. Whilst Annie is looking for them, Paul puts the powder in her wine. When she returns she almost makes the toast but drops her drink in the process, ruining Paul's plan.The next scene shows a line of clips of Paul writing the book. In the last clip, Annie gives him his pills and talks about committing suicide. When she leaves the house, he goes out of his room again and reads her scrapbook. It includes many newspaper clippings, revealing that she killed her father, her college roommate and many patients in hospitals. He grabs a knife from the kitchen and wheels himself to his room. Later, he awakens to the sight of Annie as she forcibly sedates him. In the morning, she ties him to the bed and reveals that she knows that he has been out of his room (the scrapbook, the ceramic penguin, the hairpin). Then, she 'hobbles' him (puts a block of wood betwen his feet and hits them with a sledgehammer)In the next scene, 'Buster' the local sheriff sees an emotional outburst in the town and researches her history. Later, he pays a visit to her house to look around. When he leaves, he hears a noise and goes back inside to find Paul in the basement and is shot by Annie. When she says she wants to kill him then herself, he requests finishing the book first. later, he is writing the book and requests 3 things: a cigarette, matches, and Dom Perignon champagne. When Annie returns, he also requests two glasses. whilst she is out of the room, he pours flammable liquid onto the manuscript and burns it, which escalates into a brawl resulting in Annie's death.18 months later, Paul is seen in a restaurant with his agent, refusing to write a book about his experiences.

With him is his teenage daughter from his first marriage, Marti, his second wife Carol, and Marti's half brother Andy. On their way to the base, they stop at a gas station. In the restroom, Marti is threatened by an MP member with a knife. When he notices her fear, he lets go of her, satisfied that she shows an emotional response. Before she leaves the room, he warns her, \"they get you when you sleep\".Steve and his family move into their new home on the base, and Marti makes friends with the base commander's daughter Jenn. On his first day in day care, Andy runs away because he is recognized as an outsider among the other somehow conformist children. He is picked up and brought home by helicopter pilot Tim. Marti and Tim quickly feel attracted to each other. Meanwhile, while examining soil samples, Steve is approached by medical officer Major Collins, who asks him about psychological effects, particularly narcophobia (the fear of sleep), and their possible relation to toxication of the environment. Steve believes that a physiological reaction would be more likely.In the evening, Marti and Jenn go to the bar attended by the station's military personnel, where they meet not only Tim but also the MP who threatened Marti at the gas station. He denies that they ever met before. That night, a group of soldiers can be seen picking giant pods from the river running by the base. When Andy wakes up and enters his mother's room, Carol crumbles to dust, while a soulless double emerges from the closet. Nobody believes Andy's story that his real mother is dead and the person pretending to be Carol is only an impostor.The following night, Marti and her father are nearly \"taken over\" too by duplicates emerging from the giant pods. Carol attempts to convince Steve that the takeover is a good thing, claiming that it ends confusion and anger. She also claims that there's no place to go, as the invasion is not an isolated incident. Steve is almost shocked and saddened into compliance, but Marti and Andy drag him out the door. Carol emits a shrill and mechanical scream that alerts other \"pod people\" to the presence of a human being. Now the majority in numbers, they swarm over the base chasing the remaining humans.After hiding Marti and Andy in a warehouse, Steve enters Major Collins' office. The hysterical Major tries to call for help, but the line is blocked. While swallowing sleep-prevention pills Collins announces that it is too late to run; all they can do is fight. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of a group of pod people, led by base commander General Platt. While Steve hides, the pod people try to convince the Major that the individual is not important, and that only conformity can solve the world's problems. The Major shoots himself rather than live in such a world.Steve returns to his children and tells them to follow him, claiming to have found a way out. They drive aimlessly through the military base, as loudspeakers shout out instructions for spreading the invasion by carrying out pods in trucks. Realizing that her father was replicated while he was away, Marti swerves the car to the side and tries to escape with her brother. Tim, who escaped his former comrades who tried to turn him into one of them, enters the scene. Marti takes his gun and shoots the person pretending to be her father. The father duplicate shrinks into a mass of seething, bloody goo.Tim manages to get hold of a helicopter gunship, but Marti and Andy are taken away by the pod people. They sedate both of them and take them to the base infirmary where the remaining human beings are systematically duplicated by pods. Tim is able to rescue Marti, and although Jenn and Andy (now duplicates themselves) try to stop them, Tim and Marti manage to escape in the helicopter.The ending of the film is an ambiguous one. Tim destroys the trucks filled with pods with the helicopter's rockets, while Marti confesses her profound hatred in a voice-over narration, thereby hinting at a loss of humanitarian quality. While they land on another base, the words of Marti's stepmother earlier in the film can be heard, suggesting that the phenomenon may have already spread beyond the army base: \"Where you gonna go, where you gonna run, where you gonna hide? Nowhere...

The opening scene shows a native girl, Zuranda (Jean Davis) participating in a ritual and placed on a table. A voodoo doll is placed on her chest. A chicken is waved over her and placed on her stomach and killed. Participating in the ritual is Dr. Roland Gerard (Tom Conway). He draws a sample of her blood.In the doctor's hut, Bobo, the houseboy (Otis Greene) enters and opens the blinds. He startles Susan Gerard (Mary Ellen Kay), the doctor's wife. Susan tries to bribe Bobo to help her escape her husband, but he fears the doctor's wrath. The hut is like a prison with bars on all the windows. Outside sits a guard, Gander (Emmett E. Smith). When Susan gets too close to the bars she gets a little too close to Gander's spear and she retreats inside. The ritual continues with Dr. Gerard and Chaka, the Witch Doctor (Martin Wilkins).In a bar, Rick Brady (Lance Fuller) and Marilyn Blanchard (Marla English) wait to approach a potential business partner. The bartender, Marcel Chateau (Paul Dubov) assists them in their scheme. Marilyn cozies up to Harry West (Norman Willis) at his table. They know and dislike each other, but they agree to a business venture. Marilyn tells Harry she intends to marry Rick. Rick and Marilyn leave the table after exchanging a few more barbs with Harry. They walk back to the bar and annoy Marcel and have a drink. She tells Marcel she's going to Harry's room and to distract their \"business partner.\" Marcel tells Yvette, the singer (Giselle DArc) to keep Harry occupied with a song. Marcel helps himself to his own product. Rick and Marilyn rifle Harry's room. They are looking for a map of the location of a tribe that has enormous amounts of gold and jewels. Harry notices his \"business partners\" have left. For $5 Marcel sells Harry a gun. Harry is unaware his weapon doesn't work, but Marilyn does. Harry returns to his room to find Rick and Marilyn examining a gold statue studded with diamonds and rubies. Harry's gun malfunctions, but Marilyn's works fine and she uses it to kill Harry. They continue to search Harry's room. It seems Harry had made arrangements before his untimely death to secure the services of a guide to find the tribe and collect the gold and jewels. That much Rick and Marilyn know.At the ritual, the girl's feet change. She changes into some kind of blond hairy creature, but we don't get a very good look. The witch doctor tells Dr. Gerard the change is only temporary. Zuranda is the daughter of the priest in the next village, so the tribe is responsible for her safety. Gerard wants to take Zuranda with him, but Chaka objects. Gerard finally convinces Chaka to let her leave, but just about that time Zuranda changes back to a native girl. Gerard wants the change to be permanent.Marcel comes to Harry's room to tell Rick and Marilyn that Harry's funeral is over. For a percentage Marcel arranges such things. He informs Rick and Marilyn there is a considerable fee due and payable. They are waiting for the guide, and since it was arranged by mail, Rick will impersonate Harry. The guide, Ted Bronson (Mike Connors, credited at Touch Connors) arrives at the bar and meets Marilyn. He is suspicious of her motives, but he needs the money.The next day they plan their trip. The three start their trek through the jungle complete with bearers. They decide to make camp just outside the voodoo territory. Gerard has returned to his lab with Zuranda. She screams which upsets his wife back in the hut. Susan enters the lab, against standing orders. Before he can send Susan back to her room, he informs his wife, \"I'm using her to create a new being, not man, not beast, but a combination of the best of each. When I'm finished we'll take her back to the States with us. We'll shatter the very foundations of Science.\" Susans reply is terse, \"You're insane.\" Gerard reminds her if she tries to escape he'll kill her. Zuranda again transforms. She has claws like a panther. The creature (Paul Blaisdell) is directed telepathically to go to the village. It destroys a hut and chases the couple with the baby inside off into the jungle. But Zuranda has serious qualms about harming anyone, and transforms back into her human form.Resting in the camp, Marilyn asks Ted about voodoo. Marilyn is drawn to the drums and tells Ted she's going to the north country. Ted informs her it will be without him. The next day Gerard approaches the village and is stopped by the natives until Chaka intervenes. Chaka confronts Gerard with the evidence he made Zuranda attack her own village. Chaka wants her back and Gerard agrees. He is told she will never kill because it is not in her nature to do so. Gerard departs. Ted and Rick get into a fight over Rick's trying to shoot a native scout. Ted is victorious and takes Rick's rifle. But the native village now knows of the white man's presence. Gerard takes his wife down to the lab to see Zuranda. Susan thinks she's dead. But Gerard explains that she is between life and death--a state of pre-transformation. Gerard smears blood on a doll and then tells Zuranda to get up and walk around the room. Zuranda complies. He injects her with a substance that turns her skin into armor plating. Gerard fires a gun at Zuranda and the bullets bounce off. Even acid has no effect when poured on her leg. Susan accuses her husband of being crazy and gets a slap across the face for it.Ted confesses to Marilyn that he thought she was poison the minute they met, but took the job because he needed the money. He asks for a straight answer, what are they looking for? She makes him a bargain--a 50/50 deal. She wants gold and badly. He agrees to take her as far as Bandaleya. She pulls a gun on Ted and takes his gun. She informs Ted he's going with her and Rick.When Bobo tries to take a message from Susan to the party approaching he is killed by Gander. When Ted tries to escape, Marilyn ties him up. Rick leaves looking for the village. Gerard is looking for Ted, Rick, and Marilyn. He has Zuranda with him in her transformed state. Gerard finds the camp and directs Zuranda to kill, but she is unable and retreats and transforms back into human form. Gerard admits that Chaka was right, he can't make her kill. He sends her back to her village. Rick finds the markings on the native totem pole which confirms they have the correct village. Ricks accosts Zuranda. She screams and bites Rick. He hits her and kills her. He walks back to camp and wakes Marilyn. He tells her they've found the village. Gerard and Chaka find Zuranda's body. Chaka informs Gerard, \"White man die for this.\" Gerard agrees, until Chaka informs him that all white men, \"You too.\" They go to the camp and capture Rick, Ted, and Marilyn. They want the one who killed Zuranda. Marilyn rats out Rick. The bite on his hand is the evidence. Chaka insists Rick be executed by a white man, so Marilyn shoots Rick twice killing him. Dr. Gerard cuts Ted loose and they agree to stay with Gerard for a few days until things calm down with the villagers. Of course, Gerard has plans. Marilyn tells Gerard, \"It's lucky meeting up with you. I've got a hunch I can use you in my business.\" Smirking uncontrollably, Gerard slyly replies, \"I'm almost positive that I can use you in mine.\" They go back to Gerard's hut. Gerard takes Marilyn on a tour of the lab. He surmises, correctly, that gold is Marilyn's real interest in the village. He tells her he will arrange to make her a priestess. \"Then you can have anything you'd like.\" Susan is locked in her room, but she has a rifle. She leaves her room and Ted notices her. They talk and she returns to her room. Gander keeps Ted inside the hut.At the village, they prepare for another ritual. Gerard and Marilyn arrive. Gerard convinces Chaka to use Marilyn for the ritual. They return the next day, and Marilyn is dressed in native garb for the ritual. Gander falls asleep and Ted goes to the lab. He checks around then leaves to get Susan in her room. Gander wakes and goes outside. He hears Susan and Ted talking. He captures Ted. Chaka and Gerard work on Marilyn. She transforms into the monster. Chaka pulls a ritual knife on Gerard so he takes Marilyn back to his hut after she transforms back into human form. Gerard takes Gander away from guarding Ted for a little task. Unguarded, Ted goes to see Susan. He grabs a knife and departs. In the lab, Gerard preps Marilyn for her new role as his monster/slave. Ted bolts the hut with Gander in hot pursuit. Just before Susan can escape, Gerard arrives with his monster. Susan shoots it with no effect. The monster picks Susan up and takes her in the direction of the village. Ted manages to kill Gander. Gerard escorts his wife the final distance to Chaka as the white sacrifice Chaka demands.Ted finds traces of Susan at the hut and hears Susan's screams at the village. He is captured by natives and brought to the village to be added to the sacrifice pile. Susan and Ted are tied up by next to a volcanic steam vent. Gerard calls his monster to come get her gold. Gerard is led away to be tied up with Ted and Susan. Ted and Susan manage to slip their ropes and get away as the monster attacks the village. Gerard orders the monster to kill Chaka--He is thrown into the pit. The monster discovers that all the ritual vessels are made of clay, not gold. Gerard informs the monster that the only gold item was the idol that went into the pit with Chaka. The monster feels betrayed and chokes Gerard. The monster returns to human form, now Marilyn. She sees the golden idol near the pit and approaches it. She bends down to retrieve it and falls into the pit, screaming. Ted and Susan return to the lab and mix up a couple of molotov cocktails. They use them to scare the natives and escape.At the bar, Marcel and Yvette are rolling a drunk for his wallet. Yvette gets her cut. Ted and Susan arrive just in time for the bus to town. Marcel asks about Marilyn and Rick and is told they are dead. Marcel comments, \"Her friend perhaps is dead, but not Marilyn. I have a feeling that one still lives.\" We close at the pit/steam vent as the creature crawls out.", "output": "Question: What does Roland attempt to create?, Answer: Combination of man and beast, Question: What does Dr Gerard attempt to create ?, Answer: He attempts to create a slave/monster by transforming Marilyn., Question: What does Dr Gerard turn Marilyn into ?, Answer: A blond hairy creature, Question: Who accompanies Roland to the jungle?, Answer: Marilyn, Question: What does Marilyn Blanchard discover ?, Answer: All ritual vessels are made of clay, not gold., Question: What is Ted Bronson conned into ?, Answer: Ted is conned into killing Gandar for Susan.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

G. Hertzler), about the creation of the 1984 commercial for Apple Computer, which introduced the first Macintosh. Jobs is trying to convey his idea that \"We're creating a completely new consciousness.\" Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the commercial.Next in 1997 with Jobs, returning to Apple, and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the 1997 Macworld Expo. His partner, Steve Wozniak or \"WOZ\" (Joey Slotnick), is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \"got from there to here,\" the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple.The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\" Wozniak then comments that \"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he'd see karma or the meaning of the universe.Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio), and Gates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 high school friend Paul Allen (Josh Hopkins). As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates' story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts's MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard. Gates' and Allen's early work with MITS is juxtaposed against the involvement of Jobs and Wozniak with the \"Homebrew Computer Club\". Jobs and Woz develop Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs' family home, with the help of Daniel (Marcus Giamatti) and Elizabeth (Melissa McBride). Eventually Mike Markkula (Jeffrey Nordling) invests in the company which allows it to expand and move forward. In 1977, Jobs, Woz, and Markkula demo the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire. This event is followed by the development of the IBM-PC with the help of Gates and Microsoft in 1981.The film also follows Jobs' relationship with his high school girlfriend and early Apple employee, Arlene (a pseudonym for Chrisann Brennan, portrayed by Gema Zamprogna, and the difficulties he had acknowledging the birth and existence of their daughter, Lisa. Around the time his daughter was born, Jobs unveiled his next computer, which he named, The Lisa. The Lisa was then followed in 1984 by the (Macintosh), a computer inspired by the Xerox Alto. The main body of the film finally concludes with a 30th birthday toast in 1985 to Steve Jobs shortly before he was fired by CEO John Sculley (Allan Royal), from Apple Inc.The film ends in 1997, with 42 year old Jobs' return to Apple (after its acquisition of NeXT Computer) and with his announcement at the MacWorld Expo of an alliance between Apple and Microsoft. It also indicates that Jobs is now married, has children, and has reconciled with Lisa.", "output": "Question: Who narrates Gate's story?, Answer: Ballmer, Question: Who plays Steve Jobs?, Answer: Noah Wyle, Question: What was the name of their daughter?, Answer: Lisa, Question: Who said, \"Those guys think they're revolutionaries.

Problems start when Ray, while drunk, offers Sean $13,000 to kill Eric. Sean accepts his offer and, although ambivalent, ends up killing Gatley by breaking into his house and stabbing him to death.When Sean goes to collect his pay, however, he is double-crossed and beaten up. When Sean persists that they pay him, he is kidnapped and taken to Ray's secluded farm. It becomes clear at this point that Matthews never had any intent on paying Sean for the killing.

One morning, Ann asks David if he had to do it over again, would he marry her? To her disappointment, although he is very happy with her now and wouldn't marry someone else, he answers that he would not. Later that day, Harry Deever (Charles Halton), an Idaho county official, informs David that due to a jurisdictional mishap, their three-year-old marriage license from Idaho is not valid. Since Deever is a family acquaintance of Ann's from Idaho, he stops by their apartment to tell Ann and her mother (Esther Dale) the same thing. Ann does not mention this to David and thinks he will remarry her that very night, as he just invited her out to a romantic dinner at the fancy restaurant they ate at before they were married. When they arrive at the restaurant, however, they realize that the restaurant has turned into a seedy joint, and they head home. When Ann feels she has given David long enough to propose and leave to get married, she confronts him and accuses him of not wanting to marry her again. While David protests and says he was going to ask her shortly, Ann dismisses that and kicks him out of their apartment.David spends the night at his club, but when he goes home after work the next day, he is not allowed entry by her maid. David waits in the lobby and sees Ann return with an older gentleman suitor. An angry and disheartened David takes to following Ann around, telling her he will not support her, then getting her fired from a new job she has just taken (as it turns out, the older gentleman suitor is her boss). Ann tells David she has no intention of ever marrying him.David's friend and law partner, Jefferson \"Jeff\" Custer (Gene Raymond), tells David he will talk to Ann and persuade her to remarry. However, when David shows up later that evening, he finds that Jeff has instead decided to \"represent\" Ann in the separation. To add insult to injury, Jeff asks Ann to dinner the following night in front of David. David tells Ann if she goes on the date, \"We're through,\" but Ann accepts the invitation.After dinner, Ann and Jeff leave and go to the fair, but they become stuck on the parachute ride and are forced to sit through hours of rain many feet up in the air. When they get back to Jeff's apartment, he dresses to go back out, but Ann gives him a lot of liquor to drink \"medicinally\" even though he is a teetotaler. As Jeff becomes increasingly more drunk, Ann leaves for the night.Ann and Jeff begin to date seriously, and Ann meets Jeff's parents.

Seated while she puts on the skis, David offers to help her, but instead lifts up her legs so that she cannot stand up from being on upright skis.

The death of gang overlord Taha Bemamud has left a power vacuum, and total control of the area is now being fought over by five rival territorial gang lords who want to step into Taha's position. After taking out a major drug dealer, Damien is framed for drug dealing and arrested, but manages to make a call to Le\u00efto.Meanwhile, corrupt government agents from the Department of Internal State Security (DISS), led by Gassman are bent on destroying the five tower blocks at the heart of District 13 with tactical precision bombing, and building luxury flats after the area is cleared. In order to spark conflict with the district's gangs, they shoot several cops, dump their car in District 13, and prompt several gang members into gunning down the vehicle. The footage of the incident convinces the President to carry out the strike. However, a group of teens videotaped the agents as they shot the cops themselves. The DISS agents soon come after the teen to arrest him and seize the recording, but the youth manages to slip his memory card to Le\u00efto.Le\u00efto escapes the cops in District 13 and goes to rescue Damien. After freeing Damien from his cell, they discuss the events and further plans, resolving to gather enough proof to expose the DISS agents. While Damien distracts the guards, Le\u00efto breaks into Gassman's office to steal his hard-drive for the evidence that they need. Once they escape and return to District 13, Damien and Le\u00efto convince the five gang lords to band together to prevent the destruction of the district. While the French president struggles with the decision to destroy District 13 even with the area evacuated, a large number of gang members storm parliament. When they eventually reach the president and show him the information that they acquired, Gassman takes the president hostage and tries to force him to carry out the mass demolition. Le\u00efto, Damien, and the gang lords succeed in freeing the president and incapacitating Gassman, earning the president's thanks and a promise to fund District 13's restoration.With the conflict over and District 13 completely evacuated, the gang lords then decide that it would be better to rebuild District 13 from anew rather than trying to patch up its remnants. The movie ends with the president authorizing the strike and breathing a sigh of relief.At the credits, there is a short clip showing the president, the gang lords, Damien and Le\u00efto all joking around and smoking cigars together.", "output": "Question: Who leads the corrupt government agents from the Department Of Internal State Security?, Answer: Gassman, Question: What does Leto do after escaping cops in District 13?, Answer: Goes to rescue Damien, Question: Who is gang overlord?, Answer: Taha Bemamud, Question: What does the President do at the end of the movie?, Answer: Authorizes a strike and lets out a sigh of relief., Question: Why is Damien arrested?, Answer: He was framed for drug dealing, Question: What does the President do after Leto and Damien free him from Gassman?, Answer: Thank them and promises to fund District 13's restoration., Question: Who is framed for drug dealing and arrested?, Answer: Damien, Question: Who has left a power vacuum?, Answer: Taha Bemamud, Question: Who alongwith Leto convince the five gang lords to band together to prevent the destruction?, Answer: Damien, Question: Who takes the President hostage?, Answer: Gassman", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

We then see that the poppy field is in the middle of the Arctic.Zane Zaminsky (Charlie Sheen), a radio astronomer working for SETI, discovers an extraterrestrial radio signal from Wolf 336, a star 14 light years from Earth. Zane reports this to his supervisor, Phil Gordian (Ron Silver) at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), but Phil dismisses the claims. Zane soon finds that he has been fired because of supposed budget cuts, and blacklisted, preventing him from working at other telescopes. Taking a job as a television satellite installer, he creates his own telescope array using his customers' dishes in the neighborhood, operating it secretly from his attic with help of his young next door neighbor, Kiki (Tony T. Johnson).Zane again locates the radio signal, but it is drowned out by a terrestrial signal from a Mexican radio station. Zane attempts to tell his former coworker, Calvin (Richard Schiff), but finds he has just died suspiciously from carbon monoxide poisoning. Zane travels to the fictional town of San Marsol in Mexico and finds that the local radio station, from which the signal apparently originated, was burnt to the ground. Searching the area around town, he comes across a new power plant. There, he meets Ilana Green, and tries to help protect her atmospheric analysis equipment from the plant's overzealous security forces. While in custody at the plant, Ilana explains that the Earth's temperature has recently risen several degrees, melting the polar ice. She is investigating the power plant, one of several recently built across the developing world, that appears to be the cause of this increase. The two are released, but without Ilana's equipment. Surprisingly, Zane realizes one of the guards could pass as the identical twin of his former boss, Phil. As Zane and Ilana regroup, Phil instructs some agents, posing as gardeners, to release an alien device in Zane's attic that creates a miniature black hole, consuming all of Zane's equipment. Zane leaves Ilana to again investigate the power plant and she is soon killed by scorpions planted in her room.Zane discovers the plant doubles as a front for an underground alien base. The very different looking aliens are able to disguise themselves with an external skin to infiltrate human society. Zane finds that all of the bases expel large amounts of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Zane is discovered but escapes back into the nearby town and attempts to convince the local sheriff of the situation. However, alien agents bring Ilana's body to the police station, making Zane a suspect in her death; Zane escapes and sneaks back into the United States. He accosts Phil on the JPL grounds, forcing him to admit that the aliens are trying to raise the Earth's temperature to not only kill off humans (by greatly exacerbating anthropogenic climate change) but to make the planet hospitable for themselves. Zane secretly records the conversation and once Phil discovers the recording he sends agents to stop Zane.Zane returns home to find his attic devoid of equipment. He figures out the only way to broadcast the tape is to go to a nearby large satellite up-link and beam the signal directly to a hacked news satellite, broadcasting it worldwide. With the help of his girlfriend Char (Teri Polo) and Kiki, he travels to the satellite ground station. Phil and his agents soon disable the satellite controls from the main building. Wondering how they were found so quickly, Zane briefly suspects Char of being an alien, until they are both attacked by one of Phil's agents. Zane leaves the tape with Kiki and instructs him to transmit it when he gives the order and then he and Char sneak over to the satellite's base and barricade themselves in the control room. Zane makes the necessary adjustments and tells Kiki to activate the tape, but Kiki reveals himself to be an alien agent and he opens the door to allow Phil inside, who confiscates the tape.Phil and his agents ram down the door to the satellite control room with a van, but Zane freezes them with liquid nitrogen vapors. As he works to free the tape stuck in Phil's frozen jacket, one of the agents drops a sphere which starts to form another singularity in the room. Phil begins to defrost, and tries to grab Zane's arm, but Zane smashes off Phil's arm with a fire axe. Zane and Char escape through the satellite's optical path, exiting safely onto the collapsed dish before the device implodes most of the satellite dish's base. In the distance they see Kiki, and Zane tells him to tell the aliens that he will soon broadcast this tape; they watch as Kiki runs off.

Bonnie, who is bored by her job as a waitress, is intrigued with Clyde, and decides to take up with him and become his partner in crime. They do some holdups, but their amateur efforts, while exciting, are not very lucrative.The duo's crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W. Moss. The three are joined by Clyde's brother, Buck and his wife, Blanche, a preacher's daughter.

At first Jonathan is hesitant to go despite Martha's offer to handsomely pay him, giving him the opportunity to pay off the debts left to him by his recently deceased father, while his nephew and aspiring journalist Abel is excited for the opportunity to get real life journalistic experience. After reviewing Edward's notes Jonathan is persuaded to go along. The two of them, along with Abel, go to the newly acquired Alaskan territory to gather information about Edward and his expedition and find a Russian guide, Sergei, to aide their search of her husband. They struggle to cover a large amount of ground in only 10 days based upon information recovered from a crudely drawn map. They find and enter a mine shaft in a volcano, venturing deep into the center of the earth. Along the way small signs are found of the previous expedition along with the skeleton of Mikael, a friend like a brother to Sergei, and see it as an ominous sign of what's ahead. Abel constantly lags behind taking notes and pictures of the journey and discovers a passage to a strange new land.They come out into a world that, at first, seems much like the surface except that it never gets dark despite there being no sun with a lush forest land and a large lake-like sea. Soon they encounter many prehistoric creatures and the adventure really begins. While Martha takes a bath and short swim she is attacked by some sort of creature in the sea, at the same time Jonathan and Sergei find some logs that were clearly cut down by a person using an Axe to make a raft to cross the sea. They use the left over logs and their supply of rope to make a raft of their own and notice several dinosaur-like birds flying above their heads in a vulture like fashion. As some of the birds move into attack they notice another large dinosaur in the water heading for their raft. Jonathan suggests shooting the birds to distract and feed the much larger and more lethal dinosaur in the water.They then discuss the nature of the creatures that they encountered noting that they seem to have come from different eras of development and may have escaped to this region to survive Ice Ages and other dinosaur-killing phenomenons. They then find another damaged raft, believed to be Edward's, and decide to make camp. While Abel goes exploring alone, Sergei reveals to Jonathan that he did not go along with Edward when he first came to Alaska because he did not trust him and blames himself for not stopping Mikael from joining the expedition that lead to his death. Abel encounters two native women in the forest and he gathers the rest to follow a trail that may lead them to more answers.While crossing a rather well-made bridge a group of hostile natives surrounds them and brings them to their village to meet their leader which is Edward himself, who acts rather coldly towards them and forces them bow and give up their weapons as a native custom. Edward elaborates the nature of his conditions, that the villagers believe him to be some kind of a god who has brought them prosperity and safety by sharing his wisdom which are actually ideas of indigenous survival he got from studying other civilizations. In a private discussion with him Martha admits that she was expecting him to be more happy to see him, he then admits that he had never expected her to come for him and intends to stay there where he has power and influence compared to the world above where he found her power threatening. Edward makes a pass at Martha and she rebuffs him and he goes to the village priestess whom he regards as a new wife. While they are talking a group of natives encounters another and they join forces and free some prisoners. When Edwards leaves his tent and finds these people he begins to shoot at them and kills one young man in front of all the others claiming that he is a traitor. Martha slaps him causing him to bleed planting seeds of doubt that he is a god, he then explains that their leader (who escaped with help from Jonathan) has doubted Edward from the start and started a resistance to his rule and that the presence of group has undercut Edward's power and that the resistance must be destroyed. Martha explains that Edward has always been this way and that his arrogance is what attracted her to him in the first place.Edward then loses the power and influence of the tribe as he has been revealed to be a false god and all of the villagers leave him. He then leaves all of his village gear behind and states that they must now leave and that their raft has been destroyed so they must take an ancient passage while the resistance is hot on their trail to stop them. The resistance advances upon them Edward holds out a single piece of Dynamite to ward of their attacks and when they reach the cave he lights the dynamite with the hope that it will seal the entrance to the cave that leads to the surface. When it fails to ignite, Edward leaves the cave and shoots the dynamite sealing the rest of the group in, and him out with the violent resistance. The team then struggles through water filled passages that lead them up through to the lake on the surface, where they originally found the entrance to the cave.On the surface they make a small memorial for Edward, who is presumed dead, and decide not to tell the secret of the world below, and to continue their adventures to the East Indies with Martha and Jonathan (most unpredictably) as an item. Abel then writes at the end of his diary that everything he has written and drawn about is only a figment of his imagination as to discredit their discoveries.", "output": "Question: In which country is the volcano with the passage leading to Earth's center?, Answer: United States, Question: Who does Lindenbrook fall in love with?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Where does Alec get shot?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What kills the giant chameleon?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What do the explorers use to construct a raft?, Answer: leftover logs and supplies, Question: What is Sir Oliver Lindenbrook's profession at the University of Edinburgh?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who does Alec marry?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who is Gertrud?, Answer: not mentioned in passage, Question: What does Alec land naked in?, Answer: A tree, Question: How does the professor know they are at the center of the earth?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What is found in Gteborg's goatee?, Answer: no idea, didn't see that in the passage, Question: What does Mr. Paisley find inside the piece of volcanic rock?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: who playes the role as Carla ?, Answer: no clue, Question: What is the name of the sunken city?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who plays Count Saknussemm?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who left marks along the path?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: who initially believed Lindenbrook ?, Answer: not in the passage", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

One day while out in her yard she discovers a key which has the OZ emblem on it. Thinking it was there as a message from Oz she shows it to Aunt Em (Piper Laurie) who tells her it is actually the key to their old house before the tornado blew it away. Aunt Em has had enough and takes her to see a psychiatrist called doctor Worley (Nicol Williamson) who specializes in electro-shock therapy. Toto tries to tag along but is told to go home.While at the clinic waiting for the procedure to be done, a severe storm brews outside. Dorothy then meets a mysterious patient who helps her escape when the storm knocks out the center's electricity. Dorothy manages to escape but the head nurse (Jean Marsh) chases after them. Dorothy loses the nurse, as well as her new friend, and boards a crate floating down a flooding river. From there Dorothy floats away.Dorothy later awakens in the crate to find herself back in Oz and sitting in the Deadly Desert, which has the ability to turn anyone to sand upon touch. Dorothy also discovers that she is being accompanied by her favorite chicken from her farm, Billina (Denise Bryer's voice), who now has the ability to talk.They then set out to the Emerald City to see her old friends, which includes the recently crowned King of Oz, the Scarecrow. They carefully exit the crate and cross the desert while walking on stones, and makes their way inland. The rocks have faces, but they don't say anything to her. After eating a lunch from one the country's famous lunchpale trees, they come upon Munckinland and the remains of her old house that she rode to Oz the first time via the tornado. She looks into her old house to see everything as it was when it landed, and the remains of the Wicked Witch of the East, whom she of course killed by her house landing on her during the first trip, now decomposed. However, she cannot find the munchkins or Glinda, and then she discovers a grisly site: the yellow brick road torn up in pieces.After frantically running the full length of the road, she finds the Emerald City now in ruins and all of the residents there turned to stone, including her old friends the Tin-Woodsman and the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow (Justin Case), who took over as King of Oz from The Wizard at the end of her first trip, is nowhere to be found. She then gets chased by a band of thugs known as the \"wheelers,\" in reference the creatures having wheels for hands and feet. The wheelers chase Dorothy into a dead-end hallway and she appears trapped like rat until she discovers a key hole in the door. Using the key she discovered in her yard earlier, she unlocks the hidden door and shuts it behind her keeping her safe from the wheelers. While in the room she discovers a machine in the form of a soldier. She discovers from reading the instructions on his back that he is a guard and needs to be wound up to work. After doing so the machine, now known as Tik-Tock (Sean Barrett's voice), joins Dorothy as a guardian in the quest to find out what happened to Oz.After leaving the room the two walk out into the ruined city where the wheelers meet up with them. Tik Tock instructs Dorothy to run as he starts knocking out the wheelers as they attack. He grabs one of them and Dorothy questions him about the fate of Oz where he reveals that an evil king known as the Nome King conquered the Emerald City and all of Oz and took all of the city's emeralds back to his castle. When asked about the fate of the Scarecrow he tells her that only Princess Mombi (Jean Marsh) would know. Dorothy and Tick-Tock are then led to Mombi's quarters in a preserved part of the city. While there she discovers that Mombi has a collection of heads she uses that she got from various Emerald City residents when the Nome King conquered the city. She also learns from Mombi that the Nome King took the Scarecrow with him back to his mountain with the emeralds. Mombi then threatens to take Dorothy's head after she is grown up and locks her in the attic.While locked in the attic, Dorothy peers out of the locked window and is able to see the Nome King's mountain in the distance. She also sees a portrait of her old friends, including the King Scarecrow, which saddens her. She is then interrupted by a man with a pumpkin for a head who was locked in the attic earlier by Mombi when he was used by a Princess to scare her. Turns out the man, known as Jack Pumpkinhead (Brian Henson & Stewart Larange) was brought to life by a formula called the \"Powder of Life,\" which Mombi now possesses. Dorothy then comes up with an idea to escape Mombi using the powder to create a flying animal out of chairs, a plant, and the mounted head of a gump (Lyle Conway & Stephen Norrington) found in the attic, but she first has to get the powder of life which is locked in with Mombi's original head.Jack helps her unlock the attic door by using his large height and long arms to reach over the door and unlock it from the outside. Dorothy heads downstairs and first notices a girl's image in the mirror who looks a lot like the girl from the clinic whom she had met before the storm carried her to Oz. The image vanishes and she sneaks down into Mombi's head chamber and manages to grab the powder, but not before she accidentally knocks down another object sitting by Mombi's head which awakens her. Mombi's body, which is sleeping in a nearby bed, awakens and comes for her head while Dorothy runs back up to the room where Jack is building the Gump. Dorothy then pours the powder on the gump, who doesn't awaken right away, and she discovers there are magic words on the bottle which must be said to work. Mombi tears into the room just as the powder works its magic on the gump. The pair, including Billina, hops onto the gump's back and manages to escape.While the clan is escaping, Mombi summons the wheelers to go after them. While the clan flies away into the night, the wheelers chase them on foot, but not before coming upon the Deadly Desert, which several of them fall in and die, leaving the others to retreat back to Mombi. Mombi is furious at their inability to catch the clan and orders them to take her directly to the Nome King. While flying away, Dorothy and Billina fall asleep while the others stand guard.Later Dorothy awakens to find the gump coming apart due to not originally being tied tight enough. They all fall out, landing on a snow covered mountain. The Nome King (Nicol Williamson) is then alerted of their arrival and he goes to the side of the mountain to confront them. The Nome King laughs at Dorothy's demand to free the Scarecrow and restore Oz and opens up the mountain causing her to fall in. While falling to the king's lair she is told that the emeralds from the Emerald City originally belonged to him and the Scarecrow was the thief who took them. She lands on the Scarecrow who is then zapped away. The Nome King tells her that he had turned him into an ornament for his collection.Dorothy then walks up to where the king sits and starts crying and tells him of the fact that the emeralds were there before the Scarecrow and her came to the city. The Nome King comforts her and then brings in her friends from the mountain. He then tells them that they will play a game to find the scarecrow which they will be allowed to leave with him if they guess the right ornament. The Gump is the first one allowed in to guess as the others are offered refreshment.While sitting down to refreshment the remaining pair get knocked down by a sudden flash. They then learn that the gump was just turned into an ornament since he failed to guess correctly on three tries. They also learn that their fate will be the same for not guessing correctly. Jack, with Billina hiding inside his head, is the next to go in. He guesses incorrectly and they join the Scarecrow and gump in the king's ornament collection.After Tick-Tock goes in for his try, the Nome King reveals to Dorothy that he now owns her Ruby Slippers, which he got when they fell out of the sky after she left Oz the first time. He then tells her how he used them to conquer Oz and without them he was powerless. In the meantime Tick-Tock devises a scheme to get Dorothy into the chamber while he guesses, to see what kind of object they are turning into when guessing incorrectly. He stands in the middle of the room and acts like his action ability has gone down to get the king's attention, who then sends Dorothy in to wind him up unaware of the scheme.Dorothy learns upon finding Tick-Tock that it was all a scheme to get her in there and watches as he makes his final guess. The guess turns out to be incorrect and Tick-Tock is transformed with Dorothy being unable to tell what he is turned into. Now it is Dorothy's turn, and she is now the last hope of her friends being freed and restoring the Land of Oz from the Nome King's enchantment.Meanwhile Mombi has made her way into the king's mountain(how she and the wheelers got safely across the Deadly Desert on foot I do not know). She then learns of the scheme the king had devised to finally get rid of Dorothy and her friends. Mombi not satisfied warns the king of what would happen if Dorothy guesses correctly and then learns about Ozma, whom she had imprisoned into a mirror back in the city. The king makes sure that she had not been allowed to escape as well.Back in the ornament room, Dorothy is down to her last two guesses. She guesses incorrectly on the second one but decides to play eeny miney moe on the last guess which would seal her fate. She comes across a green ornament and guesses on it revealing the Scarecrow. She then realizes that the green ornaments were the ones containing her friends. As Dorothy and the Scarecrow sets out to find the remaining three, the king becomes furious with Mombi for allowing Dorothy to escape her and come upon his secrets. He imprisons Mombi and starts to shake the building scaring Dorothy and her friends.After Dorothy finds another green ornament and guesses Jack Pumpkinhead back to life, with Billina still hiding inside his head, the King begins his fury with sending his nomes after them. They chase Dorothy into a seperate room where the Nome King enters in the form of a giant gruesome head with fire all around him. At that moment Dorothy guesses one more green ornament which reveals the gump. The king then demands them to stop and then picks up Pumpkinhead to eat unaware of Billina inside. As the king begins to put Jack into his mouth he then hears Billina laying an egg, which is poisonous to nomes. The egg falls out of Jack's head and into the king's mouth. He then lays Jack and Billina down as he begins to crumble.After the king and his nomes are completely crumbled away, her Ruby Slippers shines through the rubble. Dorothy then runs over to grab them and put them on as the whole mountain begins to crumble away. Dorothy wishes her and her friends back to Oz and the whole land to be restored, and it is granted.Dorothy and her friends then find themselves back in Oz with the Emerald City and it's people being restored in the distance. The caged Mombi also appears with them. Dorothy then discovers they didn't find Tick-Tock but Scarecrow sees a green ornament on gump's antlers. Dorothy guesses correctly and Tick-Tock is restored.The next scene shows the whole gang in a parade celebrating Dorothy's triumph and the restoration of Oz. Along with the new friends she had made, the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman and the Cowardly Lion has now rejoined Dorothy. A few munchkins walk in front of them with Glinda following behind. Also in the parade is the Patchwork Girl and Mombi, who is now a prisoner of Oz.At the end of the parade Dorothy joins the Scarecrow on his throne and the crowd encourages her to be the Queen of Oz, but she reveals that she has to go back home. The crowd is dissappointed at this announcement. Just then Dorothy sees the image of the girl in the mirror again. She walks up to the mirror and pulls her out. The girl is revealed to be Ozma, the real Queen of Oz before the Wizard came. She also reveals that Mombi had imprisoned her in the mirror when she tried to scare her out of the city. Dorothy then puts the ruby slippers on Ozma's feet and asks her to wish her back to Kansas. Ozma agrees on the condition that she will look in on Dorothy from time to time and if she ever wishes to come back to Oz it will be granted. Dorothy agrees and Ozma taps the slippers three times while Dorothy says goodbye to her friends. Billina tells Dorothy that she had decided to stay in Oz instead of going back with her.The next scene shows Dorothy awakening back in Kansas. She hears Toto in the distance and she calls after him.

While in there Dorothy walks up to the mirror and calls for Oz and an image of Ozma, with Billina in her arms, appears. Dorothy calls for Aunt Em but Ozma puts a finger up to her mouth encouraging her not to. They continue smiling at each other and then Aunt Em appears in the doorway prompting them to dissappear and Dorothy to pull the mirror up.

Tom starts to dislike Silas and becomes suspicious of him and his past.Tom travels to the town police station to look for records regarding Silas after he finds a newspaper clipping about him and his father in the attic. The whole town is deserted with only flyers announcing a mandatory evacuation due to the storm. Tom is attacked by two deranged men after finding an article showing Silas as the actual killer of his father. Tom manages to fight the two men off and escape back to the farm.Upon reading the news article, it shows that Silas' father lost the farm because he was drunk and this enraged Silas so much that he hung him from a tree and left him there for days. When a bank foreclosure agent came by to foreclose on the house, Silas slit his throat as well. It is then found out that Silas has been in prison for the last 20 years related to the two deaths. Tom, after finding his wife half naked with Silas in the bathroom, kicks him out at gun point and tells him never to return.That night, Silas does return however, and starts a fire as a distraction outside which makes Tom run out to look for Silas. Silas traps a rope around Tom's neck and drags him up in the tree to hang, just like he did with his father. Silas then goes into the house to talk to Tom's wife and try to persuade her to become his new wife. Tom's son comes to his rescue and cuts Tom down from the tree moments before he loses consciousness. A battle then ensues between Tom and Silas.

A brawl ensues between Toby's gang and another gang, which ends with both sides fleeing just before police arrive. Later that night, Toby's gang goes to a party at Eric's house, and Allison's relationship with Toby as well her other friends Emily and Sam is further revealed. At the end of the party, Allison performs oral sex on her boyfriend.The next day, Allison meets with her father, Stuart, at work to discuss family problems, the awkward conversation revealing the virtually non-existent relationship Allison has with her parents. Afterwards, she and her friends drive downtown into East LA, intent on buying marijuana, eventually encountering Mexican drug dealer Hector and his crew. Toby and Hector make a deal, but Toby believes that Hector did not sell him enough for what he paid, and attempts to confront Hector, who pulls a gun on him, humiliating him in front of his friends. Allison persuades Hector to leave Toby alone.The next night, Allison and her girlfriends return to the location of the drug deal. There, she and her friends once again meet up with Hector and his crew, who invite them to a party at his house. Before they leave, Hector informs Allison of a motel where his crew regularly party, and invites her to stop by if she wishes. The next day, Eric continues his film project at Allison's home, with Allison turning his interview of her into a bizarre mind-game. That evening, Allison meets up with Hector again in a store, and he shows her around his neighborhood, while talking about his family and lifestyle. His guided tour abruptly ends when the police arrive in force, ostensibly on a drug bust. Allison winds up being arrested with the other present gang members, but \u00e2\u0080\u0093 save for an argument with her parents and Toby \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is let off the hook. The experience only serves to increase Allison's fascination with the inner-city lifestyle. The night after her release, Allison and Emily agree to head downtown the next evening to hang out with Hector's crew.The two meet up with Hector and his gang at a motel, and a night of partying and drinking results in Allison and Emily asking Hector if they can join his crew. Hector informs them of their initiation; to join the gang, the two must roll a die; the number they roll corresponds to the number of gang members they must have sex with. Allison rolls a one, Emily rolls a three. Hector and Allison pair off, but Allison has second thoughts and refuses to have sex with him, and is thrown out of the room by the gang when she tries to get Emily to leave with her. Emily eagerly engages in sex with Hector, but as she does so, Hector has one of his fellow gang members copulate with her anally, against her will. When Allison storms the room and screams at the men to stop, they flee the room, leaving the two distraught women.The next day, Allison returns to the motel and confronts Hector over the previous night, but he responds by saying he didn't do anything wrong, that he only did what she and Emily asked him to do. At that moment, a woman shows up at the door, surprising Allison, much to the amusement of Hector, who mocks Allison for thinking he had feelings for her, and calling her a poser who only knows how to play games and nothing about the realities of gang life. The same day, Emily is shown at a police station, accusing Hector and his crew of gang rape. Allison is brought in for questioning, but claims to know nothing about a rape. Hector is subsequently arrested, and members of his crew vow to seek out and silence Allison and Emily, but wind up getting lost in Bel-Air. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang are shown posing with guns in front of Eric and his video camera, making clear their intent on seeking revenge on Hector's crew. Eric later shows Allison the footage, and Allison subsequently calls Toby and makes an ill-fated attempt to convince him that there was no rape and what he is doing is foolish.Allison informs Emily of what Toby plans to do, and reveals to Emily's parents the events at the motel. This initially upsets Emily to the point of nearly attempting suicide, but eventually the two reconcile. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang arrive at Hector's motel and bust in violently, but only succeed in frightening a group of Latino women and a baby. Toby tries to work up the nerve to shoot them, but, consumed by their desperate pleas to not hurt the baby, realizes he can't and storms out. On their drive home, the gang passes the SUV containing the members of Hector's crew that had been looking for Allison and Emily. The two gangs exchange looks, and the screen subsequently fades to black.

Edward hears Giselle singing and sets off to find her. Nathaniel sets free a captured troll to kill Giselle, but Edward rescues her in time. When they meet, they instantly fall in love and plan to get married the following day.Narissa, disguised as an old hag, intercepts Giselle on her way to the wedding and pushes her into a well, and she is magically transformed into a 3D live version of herself and transported to a manhole in New York City's Times Square. Giselle quickly becomes lost. Meanwhile, Robert, a divorce lawyer, prepares to propose to his longtime girlfriend Nancy, much to the dismay of his daughter Morgan. Robert and Morgan encounter Giselle on their way home, and Robert begrudgingly allows Giselle to stay the night at their apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who trusts Giselle.Pip, Giselle's best chipmunk friend from Andalasia, had witnessed Giselle's exile and alerted Edward thereafter, and both embark on a rescue mission to the city, where they too are turned into 3D versions, but Pip is instead in the form of a real chipmunk \u00e2\u0080\u0093 therefore losing the ability to speak. Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow and impede Edward. In a restaurant, Narissa appears to Nathaniel in a soup pot and gives him three poisoned apples to murder Giselle. Pip eavesdrops but is unable to communicate with Edward, as animals cannot speak outside of Andalasia. Nathaniel keeps Pip silenced by imprisoning him in various containers. Meanwhile, after Giselle summons vermin to clean Robert's apartment, Nancy arrives to take Morgan to school. She meets Giselle and then angrily leaves assuming Robert was unfaithful. Robert is initially upset but spends the day with Giselle, knowing she is vulnerable in the city.

Narissa, who has been spying from Andalasia, decides to follow and kill Giselle herself after Nathaniel failed to poison her twice.

In 1999 special areas known as \"free fire zones\" have discouraged police from entering out of fear. Seattle's Kennedy High School is in the middle of a free fire zone, thus the Department of Education Defense (D.E.D.), a pilot special government agency, has been notified. Working with MegaTech head Dr. Bob Forrest, an experiment begins where three former military robots have become android educators. Forrest introduces Mr. Bryles, Mr. Hardin, and Ms. Connors to the Board of Education. Impressed with the new teachers, new principal Miles Langford has announced that former delinquents who are imprisoned will be released as part of the new experiment, which would allow new methods of discipline from the new teachers.One such delinquent is Cody Culp, a member of the Blackhearts gang. Out of prison, Cody has decided to lay low and avoid any gang warfare, especially with the rivals Razorheads, led by Hector. After a car chase, Cody and his brothers Sonny and Angel make it to school. Sonny is taken in by the new school guards after he confronts them as they check the car for weapons or drugs. Blackheart member Curt, who thanks to Angel learns Cody no longer wants to be in a gang, informs Cody that if he is not with them, then he is against them. Still, Cody sticks to laying low and attends class. In chemistry class, Ms. Connors attempts calmly talk down Hector and another Razorhead. When the two Razorheads attempt to confront Ms. Connors, she uses fighting skills to take them down and make them sit in their seats. This pleases Forrest and MegaTech, who are in the basement, disguised as a DED control center. When Mr. Hardin's history class is interrupted by a fight between Curt and Razorhead member Flavio, Hardin resorts to using corporal punishment and puts the class in line. Returning home, Cody is shocked to find his brothers and his mother are addicted to the drug known as \"edge\". Upset and angry, he leaves and goes on his motorcycle, returning home later that night.The next day, Flavio attempts to woo Christie, Mr. Langford's daughter, but when she resists his advances, he tries to force himself on her. Cody, witnessing what is happening, fights off Flavio as well as Hector. Mr. Bryles, who sees the incident, puts Cody in a full nelson hold and takes him to the principal's office. While Langford informs Cody that he technically violated his parole with the fight, he lets him off due to the fact that he did save Christie. Cody and Bryles head to physical education class, where Bryles, who is the coach, humiliates Blackheart member Mohawk while doing push-ups. When class is over, Bryles tells Cody to stay behind and begins to viciously beat him. Mohawk goes to his locker and takes some \"edge\" and grabs a gun. Cody, still being beaten, is seriously hurt when Bryles sees Mohawk with the gun. Bryles grabs the gun and breaks Mohawk's neck, killing him instantly. MegaTech technicians Marv and Spence are in total shock when Forrest informs them that it was self-defense with a gun.When Sonny shows up late to Mr. Hardin's class totally high on \"edge\", Hardin takes him to his locker. Hardin grabs the locker door and pulls it out to find vials of \"edge\" in the locker. He proceeds to take the vials and force them in Sonny's mouth and pummeling his head on the lockers. Hardin kills Sonny and upon his return to class, takes Sonny's now bloodied cross and puts it in his pocket. Cody sees the cross as Hardin gives his lecture. When Langford confronts the three teachers about the death of Sonny, it soon becomes a cover-up to say Sonny died of a drug overdose. When Christie tries to convince Cody based on her father's word about Sonny, Cody is angry and is convinced Hardin killed Sonny. Apologizing to Christie the next day, he tries to convince her that Hardin had something to do with Sonny's death and the duo skip school for evidence. Christie and Cody have the teacher directory and learn that Hardin, Bryles, and Connors live in the same apartment. They break in and Cody finds the bloody cross. However, the trio of teachers arrive and catch the duo escaping. A chase ensues and ends up with the trio in the water. Having survived the car crash in the water, the trio decide to start a war between the Razorheads and the Blackhearts.That evening, Cody and Angel once again bond over a game of basketball. When Angel, who has become a Blackheart, decides to stay behind, he is met by Bryles, Hardin, and Connors on his way home later that night. The trio chase down Angel. Bryles lifts up Angel and throws him against a wall and the trio ultimately kill him. Shortly after, Razorhead Noser is coming out of a local pizza place when he sees Connors. She kidnaps him and when the Razorheads are waiting for Noser, Noser is sent through the window of their hangout while on fire. Hector is convinced the Blackhearts did it and decide to start a war. The next morning, Cody goes to the Blackheart hangout, where he finds a dead Angel surrounded by the likes of Curt, Reedy, and Dawn. Dawn finds Angel's basketball with a message written in blood. Cody, seething with revenge, decides he wants back in the gang.That afternoon, a war ensues between the Razorheads and Blackhearts. However, Bryles, Hardin, and Connors intercept at various times, killing members from both gangs. When Cody and Reedy go inside an abandoned building to trap Hector, Hardin grabs Reedy through a wall and splits him in half with his bare hands. When Cody shoots at Hardin, he discovers he is not human. That night, Cody tries to tell the Blackhearts that Hardin was there and that he killed Reedy. Meanwhile, Langford has gotten wind of the situation and decides to have the program terminated. However, Dr. Forrest not only decides not to terminate the program, but tells Langford that the teachers must \"kill the enemy\". Bryles grabs Langford by the throat and with brute force, sticks his fingers in Langford's throat, killing him.Hector receives a call apparently from Cody saying he wants him one-on-one at the school entrance. Connors, kidnapping Christie, pretends to be Hector and calls Cody with the same proposition. When Dawn wonders why Hector would meet him at the school, the Blackhearts are finally convinced that the teachers are responsible. When Hector and Cody show up with both gangs, Cody attempts to tell Hector that it is not him he wants to kill. He tells Hector of the war the teachers have started. To prove he is right, Cody shows Hector Sonny's bloody cross. The Razorheads and the Blackhearts decide to team up and take on the teachers, who are waiting in the school. While they look for Christie and the teachers, they soon learn of the real deal with the teachers. Ms. Connors' arm becomes a flame thrower. Bryles' arm becomes a missile launcher. While many Razorheads and Blackhearts fall victim to the teachers, Curt and Cody find Christie. There, they find Hardin. They attempt to shoot down Hardin. However, Hardin is too powerful as he grabs Cody with one hand and grabs Curt with his other hand, which has become a grip with a drill attached. Curt is killed by the drill. Hardin attempts to do the same to Cody when Cody reaches for a machine gun and shoots Hardin through the mouth numerous times, destroying him instantly.Cody and Christie see Ms. Connors and are chased to the chemistry lab. Cody, noticing that Connors has an exposed area of flammable gas, distracts her in time to grab an axe. When he throws the axe at the exposed area, he and Christie run out of the lab. Connors, unleashing the flame thrower, fatally explodes due to the flame hitting the gas. Hector, the only other survivor alongside Cody and Christie, meet up with the duo and are seen by Bryles. Hector and Christie provide a distraction while Cody grabs a bus and is able to run down Bryles at the school entrance. The bus explodes but all three are safe. When they hear a noise in the school, they go check it out. However, a now half-human, half-robot Bryles escapes from under the bus.Hector, Cody, and Christie find Dr. Forrest who takes Christie hostage. When Cody tells Forrest it is too late, Forrest is convinced that he can somehow continue the project. When Hector attempts to shoot Forrest, he is shot and killed. Forrest then attempts to kill Cody, but Bryles comes up from behind him and rips his heart out, killing him instantly. Cody and Christie are at first overpowered by Bryles until Cody finds a forklift and impales Bryles. Christie grabs the nearest chain and puts it around Bryles' neck with Cody using the forklift to lift the chain, decapitating the robotic Bryles.

Carter quickly learns that the athletes are rude and disrespectful, and are in need of discipline. He hands the players individual contracts, instructing them to attend all of their classes, wear dress shirts and ties on game days, refer to everyone (players and coach alike) as \"sir\", and maintain a minimum 2.3 (C+) grade point average, among other requirements. He also teaches them to play a disciplined brand of basketball which includes an emphasis on fundamentals, execution, defense, and conditioning.Carter also asks the school staff for progress reports on the players' attendance. However, three players including Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzalez) refuse to follow the contract and quit the team. Carter's son Damien (Robert Andrew Richard) later decides to join the team, after quitting the private school St. Francis to play for his father.Teammate Kenyon Stone (Rob Brown) struggles to come to terms with his girlfriend Kyra (Ashanti) being pregnant; unsure if he can juggle basketball and aspire for college. Later, Cruz makes a valiant effort to rejoin the basketball team after watching them perform at a game in an inspiring victory and also after witnessing his only family member- who happens to be his cousin (a drug dealer)- shot one night in the streets, which Carter accepts. The team goes on to post an undefeated record eventually winning a seasonal basketball tournament. However, Carter later discovers the progress reports filled out by the faculty reveal some of the students have been skipping classes and floundering academically.Carter initiates a lockdown on the gym, banning the team from playing until they improve their grades. The act angers the locals, as Carter is criticized by parents and academic personnel alike. The school board eventually confronts Carter, who justifies his actions, explaining he wants to give his team the opportunity and option for further education so they won't resort to crime, asserting that achieving a sound education is more important for the students than winning basketball games. The board, aside from Principal Garrison (Dowse) and the chairman, vote to end the lockout, much to Carter's dismay.Just when Carter is about to quit in disgust (after promising to do so if they vote to end the lockout), he is shocked to find his players in the gym with desks and teachers studying and working to bring their grades back up. The athletes decide to fulfill Carter's original intention of pursuing academic achievement before continuing to play their next game, with one explaining that the school board can force an end to the lockout, but the players can't be forced to play. They work hard in the classroom, study after school during practice time, and eventually raise their grade point average to a point that fulfills their end of the contracts they signed. The Oilers eventually end up competing in the regional high school playoffs, but ultimately lose to St. Francis. Nonetheless, Carter is proud that the players accomplished their goal of attaining a proper education with athletics.

As they approach the airport the plane short circuits due to an electrical storm but regains power. They find their Swedish business partner, Skyler (Joel Kinnaman), has betrayed them and already made a deal with the Russians, using a knockoff application. They go to a nightclub and meet Natalie (Olivia Thirlby), an American, and her Australian friend Anne (Rachel Taylor). The lights go out in the club and everyone heads outside. There, they witness what appears to be an aurora. Balls of light fall from the sky and then fade away. When a policeman investigates he is disintegrated. The invisible entities begin hunting and disintegrating people, sending them into a panic.Ben, Sean, Natalie, Anne, and now Skyler hide in the club's storeroom for seven days. With most of their food gone, the group plans to go to the American Embassy. They find the city full of scorched cars and cinders, but empty of people, except for a wary old woman who warns them of \"the ghosts\". Ben and Sean search for supplies in a police car near Red Square while the others hide in the nearby GUM department store shopping mall. While they are searching the car, a barking dog discovers and fatally confronts an alien, but the dog is disintegrated. Ben and Sean successfully hide under the car as the alien moves closer, causing the car's lights and siren to turn on. The alien moves on and the men run to the mall. Sean realizes that light bulbs give the aliens away. The group takes shelter in one of the mall stores. Sean and Natalie go to look for clothes and almost run into an alien who can't see them through a glass wall. Sean theorises that the aliens can only see their electrical charge, but not through glass.The group finds the American Embassy gutted and lifeless. All except Skyler go to the roof to get an aerial view. They find a logbook telling them that the invasion is worldwide. They also find a radio broadcasting a message in Russian. They hear gunfire. Ben and Sean go to help Skylar, but he is killed. When the others go outside they see a light in a nearby apartment tower and go to investigate, bringing the radio they found. They find a young woman named Vika and a man named Sergei, an electrical engineer. Sergei has made his apartment into a giant Faraday cage that hides everyone from the aliens. He has also developed a microwave gun that weakens an alien's force field, so that it can actually be seen and killed. Vika and Sergei translate the message, which says that a nuclear submarine K-152 Nerpa is waiting in the Moscow River to take survivors to safety.As Sergei shows the men the microwave device, Vika, Natalie, and Anne go to other apartments to gather supplies for the submarine journey. An alien senses them outside the Faraday cage and gives chase; Anne hesitates following Vika and goes another way, causing Natalie to follow her back inside. When they get to the apartment, Natalie is unable to close the door and the alien gets inside. Sergei shoots the alien with his gun and finds that it is only stunned. The alien disintegrates Sergei while the others get out by the fire escape. Anne hesitates again and is disintegrated while trying to escape. Natalie sets the apartment on fire as they climb down and meet up with Vika.They meet up with a Russian police team with improvised armor led by Boris who manage to wound an alien with conventional weapons. Sean collects a piece of the alien's body. The small police band were also able to build another Faraday cage at the Russian State Library. Boris and his men eventually agree to help the remaining four to get to the submarine. The policemen believe that the aliens are strip mining for conductive metals since giant light columns can be seen drilling all over Moscow.As they move through the subway, an alien discovers them and they escape on the tracks. Vika hides behind a pillar, unable to join the others without being seen. Ben helps her climb down to the tracks, but gets disintegrated.The survivors make it to a powerless patrol boat on the river and drift downstream to the waiting submarine. The boat nears the submarine but runs aground. As they attempt to push free, a new light beam destroys a large apartment building right next to the river, causing the boat to capsize. Sean and the policemen swims towards the submarine but upon reaching it discover Natalie is missing. They see a flare fired from Natalie's flare gun in a railway and bus yard near the river. Sean is determined to get her, possibly missing his chance to escape. The policemen agree to help him rescue her. The Russian submarine crew, after expressing doubt about the rescue, assist by building another microwave gun with stronger batteries.After the team manages to destroy an alien, Sean finds Natalie on a bus while the policemen and Vika destroy three more aliens using the microwave guns and water. As Sean is about to get off the bus with Natalie, an alien climbs on board, locks the door, and sends the bus speeding around the bus yard. It grabs onto Natalie's leg, but Sean blasts the alien's shield with the microwave gun. He then discovers the alien's weakness when he throws a piece of the wounded alien he had collected earlier, and it destroys the unshielded alien. The two stop the bus and narrowly avoid a collision.After returning to the submarine, the police team decides to stay and fight for the city, and Boris tells them that now the war has begun. Sean, Natalie, and Vika plan to spread what they learned about the aliens - the microwave guns and their vulnerability to pieces of other dead aliens - to the rest of the world. Sean and Natalie, the only survivors of the original group along with Vika, nearly share a kiss on the submarine. In a pre-credit scene, as the submarine cruises through the Caspian Sea, they learn that survivors in Paris managed to destroy an alien mining tower.", "output": "Question: Where does the group hide after leaving the club storeroom.?, Answer: GUM department store shopping mall, Question: What does the team destroy?, Answer: An alien, Question: In which city did survivors destroy an alien mining tower?, Answer: Paris, Question: Who developed a microwave gun?, Answer: Sergei, Question: What can be used to weaken the alien's force field?, Answer: Microwave gun, Question: Who hides behind a pillar?, Answer: Vika, Question: How did the alien get destroyed?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who is determined to save Natalie?, Answer: Sean, Question: Who manage to wound an alien with conventional weapons?, Answer: Russian police team with improvised armor led by Boris., Question: In what river is the K-152 submarine waiting?, Answer: Moscow, Question: How does Sergei stun the alien?, Answer: gun, Question: What did the policemen and Vika use to destroy the alien?, Answer: Microwave guns and water., Question: How does the alien get inside the apartment?, Answer: Natalie is unable to close the door., Question: What destroys a large apartment building?, Answer: A light beam, Question: How does Anne die?, Answer: disintegrated while trying to escape, Question: Where did the police band build another Faraday cage?, Answer: The Russian state library, Question: Ben and Sean travel to which city?, Answer: Moscow., Question: Why the plane short circuits?, Answer: Due to an electrical storm., Question: Swedish business partner Skyler made a deal with whom?, Answer: Russians., Question: Who tells the police team that war has begun?, Answer: Boris, Question: What do Ben and Sean search for supplies?, Answer: A police car, Question: Who nearly shared a kiss on the submarine?, Answer: Sean and Natalie, Question: What is that Sean realizes gives the aliens away?, Answer: light bulbs, Question: Who do they discover is missing?, Answer: Natalie", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Hal's work life is steady, but he is dismayed after being passed over for a long-sought promotion.Hal becomes trapped in an elevator with famous American life coach Tony Robbins. While waiting for the elevator to be repaired, Robbins sympathizes with Hal's disappointment but tries to figure out his ideas about women. He hypnotizes Hal into only seeing a person's inner beauty. Hal does not realize he's been hypnotized and later meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), daughter of the president of the company where he is employed. Rosemary is morbidly obese, but Hal sees a slender and beautiful trophy blonde. He is immediately smitten by her. His boss is not certain about Hal dating his daughter, thinking that Hal may be trying to climb to the top of the corporate ladder. Used to being overlooked due to her appearance, Rosemary initially interprets Hal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest as mocking, but begins to realize his feelings for her are sincere. After apologizing to him, they begin to date, which includes a bike ride with Walt (Rene Kirby).Mauricio, worried about Hal's new taste in women, convinces Robbins to give him the trigger phrase to undo the hypnosis. Mauricio phones Hal, who is on a date with Rosemary, and says the trigger phrase, which serves to break Hal's hypnosis. Mauricio confesses to Hal the truth about Robbins' hypnotherapy, but Hal does not believe until he runs into a woman who initially appeared beautiful to him but whom Hal now sees in her true, unattractive state.Hal begins to avoid Rosemary, who becomes melancholic without him around. Distraught that he was not seeing the \"real\" Rosemary, Hal accepts a dinner invitation from his neighbor, Jill. The two dine together and Jill tells Hal that she has observed him overcoming his shallow nature and is interested in dating him now.Hal realizes his true feelings for Rosemary who has, coincidentally, arrived at the same restaurant with her family and sees Hal and Jill seated together. Assuming the worst, Rosemary leaves in tears. Not recognizing Rosemary, Hal walks right by her on his way to the pay phone to, ironically, reassure her of his feelings, after refusing to date Jill because of his feelings for Rosemary.

Hal attempts to find Rosemary, but instead encounters a young patient named Cadence at the hospital where Rosemary volunteers. Previously, due to Robbins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hypnosis, Hal saw Cadence as a perfect little girl; he now sees that there are severe burns all over Cadence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. Inspired by Cadence, Hal changes his views on the outer appearances of people in general.Rosemary decides to leave the country to rejoin the Peace Corps. Hal, during his search for Rosemary, finds that Mauricio had his own reason for stopping Hal's hypnosis: He has a vestigial tail, which has prevented him from ever getting close to a woman. Mauricio confesses he was jealous of Hal's happiness and is afraid to start a relationship with a woman. Hal convinces Mauricio to accept his abnormality, with confidence.Hal makes up with Mauricio and decides to reconcile with Rosemary. He heads to the Peace Corps and confronts Ralph, believing he and Rosemary got back together. Ralph informs Hal that Rosemary's mother forbade him from seeing her again.

But Jacob cannot bear to see Silver's suffering and takes it upon himself to put Silver down. August is furious with Jacob's decision to euthanize Silver against orders. To show Jacob who is boss, he threatens to throw him from the moving train \u00e2\u0080\u0094 telling him that an animal's suffering is nothing compared to a man's, and that Jacob must carry out all of August's future orders if he wishes to keep his job.August eventually procures Rosie the elephant as Silver's replacement. He invites Jacob to his car for dinner and cocktails with him and Marlena. Jacob watches the married couple flirt and dance in front of him, but it becomes clear that their relationship is complicated because August is possessive, jealous and rough with Marlena.In the next few weeks, August becomes frustrated when Rosie the elephant seems impossible to train. August is brutal with Rosie, beating her when she fails to follow orders. After a beating that August gave to Rosie when she ran away after fleeing from the event and dropping Marlena, Jacob realizes that the elephant only understands Polish commands. After that, Rosie performs beautifully and the circus enjoys a short period of success. While working together to train Rosie, Jacob and Marlena fall in love. After August discovers this, he cruelly taunts the two. Marlena discovers that August plans to throw Jacob from the train and they run away together, hiding in a local hotel. Soon after consummating their relationship, they are ambushed by August's henchmen who drag Marlena away and beat up Jacob.Jacob returns to the circus to find Marlena. Marlena tells Jacob that his friends Walter and Camel were thrown from the train and killed. Several circus employees have become fed up with August's murderous cruelty and unleash their revenge by unlocking all the animals' cages while the big top tent is jam-packed with an audience enjoying Marlena and Rosie's performance. Jacob attempts to find Marlena in the chaos and August attacks him. When Marlena tries to stop August from beating Jacob, he turns his fury on her and chokes her, while one of August's henchmen beats Jacob. Two circus workers save Jacob and he sees Rosie hit August on the back of the head with a metal spike, killing him.He returned to Cornell and finished his degree. He and Marlena took several of the horses and Rosie and got jobs with Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus with he as a veterinarian and she continuing to perform with the animals. They married and had five children and kept Rosie until her death many years later. He took a job as a vet at the Albany Zoo and Marlena died peacefully in her bed at an old age.

The siblings' parents are both involved in theater and are happily married until their father, Oscar (Allan Edwall), suddenly dies from a stroke. Shortly thereafter, their mother, Emilie (Ewa Fr\u00c3\u00b6ling), marries Edvard Verg\u00c3\u00a9rus (Jan Malmsj\u00c3\u00b6), the local bishop and a widower, and moves into his ascetic home where he lives with his mother, sister, aunt and maids.Emilie initially expects that she will be able to carry over the lavish, joyful qualities of her previous home into the marriage, but realizes that Edvard's harsh authoritarian policies are unshakable. The relationship between the bishop and Alexander is especially cold, as Alexander invents stories, for which Edvard punishes him severely. Edvard immediately confines the children to their bedroom. As a result, Emilie asks for a divorce, which Edvard will not consent to; though she may leave the marriage, legally it will be considered desertion, placing the children in his custody, including the infant to which she will shortly give birth. Meanwhile, the rest of the Ekdahl family has begun to worry about their condition. When Emilie secretly visits her former mother-in-law, Helena (Gunn W\u00c3\u00a5llgren), to explain what has happened, their friend Isak Jacobi (Erland Josephson), helps smuggle the children from the house. They live temporarily with Isak and his nephews in their store.Emilie, now in the later stages of her pregnancy, refuses to restore the children to the home. Edvard insists she do so. Emilie allows Edvard to drink a large dosage of her bromide sedative. She explains to him, as he shows signs that the medication is working, that she intends to flee the home as he sleeps. He claims that he will follow her family from city to city and ruin their lives, then blacks out. After Emilie gets away, Edvard's dying aunt knocks over a gas lamp, setting her bedclothes, nightgown and hair on fire. She runs through the house in flames to seek Edvard's help, igniting him. Despite the sedative, he is able to get her off him, but dies shortly thereafter.Alexander had fantasized about his stepfather's death while living with Isak. Isak's mysterious nephew, Ismael Retzinsky (Stina Ekblad), explains that fantasy can become true as he dreams it.The story ends on a happy, life-affirming note, with the christening celebration of Emilie's and the late bishop's daughter as well as the extra-marital daughter of Alexander's uncle, Gustav Adolf Ekdahl (Jarl Kulle), and the family maid, Maj (Pernilla August).

Josh's father, Frank (Richard Roxburgh), a master diver, has already established a forward base camp at a lower level inside the cave, where the team has been exploring for weeks. As Josh voices his disdain for his father and his opinions about cave exploration, the team below prepares to dive into an unexplored area of the system.While exploring the entrance to the new system, Judes (Allison Cratchley) experiences a problem with her air tank hose. She loses use of her air mask forcing Frank to buddy breathe. After a few exchanges, Judes panics and tries to keep the mask on, but Frank forces the mask off of her knowing he will not have enough air otherwise to make it back to the team. As Judes drowns, Josh watches on a monitor at \"forward camp\" and presumes the worst of his father. In a struggle to determine who truly was responsible for her death, it is revealed by Frank that Judes had dived in an exhausted state since they previously had to retrieve the extra bailout tanks, a task Josh didn't do. Meanwhile, their above-ground crew realizes that a very big storm is preparing to hit their location sooner than anticipated. They attempt to warn the team below, but are unsuccessful. Josh expresses his desire to return to the surface and with communications down and an uncertain expedition in front of them, team leader Frank agrees to have his son return to the surface with a buddy climber ahead of them.While Josh climbs back towards the surface with Luko, Liz, and J.D, water begins rushing in from their exit. The storm they were trying to avoid had turned into a cyclone causing flash floods that begin to fill the cave. As J.D. and Liz make their way up through \"the elevator\" (an area leading up to the main entrance of the cave), Josh is unable to leave his father and the dive team behind to their doom and turns back, accompanied by Luko. As they are making their way back to \"forward camp\" they discover that Frank and the team have already evacuated their camp and are assisting Victoria as she climbs her way up and out of the cavern. Josh leaps in to help, strapping a rope around a nearby boulder and forming a belay for the team to escape. Unfortunately, the boulder begins to give way leaving Josh to hold Victoria's line and Luko to hold back the boulder. The water rushes through and forces Victoria and Josh to fall back down into the now flooded base camp. Luko is severely injured when the boulder breaks loose, sealing the shaft and throwing him back down into the cavern. He is swept into an underwater tunnel before the team can reach him.The team decides to use the unexplored tunnel as an escape route from the rapidly flooding cavern. Victoria, panicked and anxious, refuses to wear Jude's old wetsuit and is given a quick tutorial on how to dive. Before the team can leave, a severely injured and mutilated Luko surfaces in the cavern. Seeing that his friend is in great pain and near death, Frank mercifully drowns him. The team presses on and makes it through to the other side of the system. Without a wetsuit, Victoria suffers severely from the cold water. Meanwhile, George - an experienced, veteran diver - has become ill due to the dive and is dying unbeknownst to the rest of the team. After a short rest, the team continues through the system following the flow of water out towards the sea. George realizes that he cannot continue and after sharing a few words with Josh relieves himself of his pack and hides himself so as not to burden the rest of the team.As the team marches on they arrive at a seemingly dead end. A great hole in the bottom of the cave separates them from the other side of their path. Josh uses his climbing expertise to fish a line across and begins to transfer their gear and each other. As Victoria begins to make her way across she catches her hair in her rope gear she is hung on and loses her grip, leaving her hair as the only thing holding her weight. Using her knife, she attempts to cut away the hair, but severs her rope and falls to her death. At the sight of Victoria's death, Carl becomes psychotic. In a fit of panic, he steals the last remaining rebreather and disappears into the tunnel. Josh and Frank, however, find another way out through a crevasse in the cavern. The tunnel leads them to a sunlit cavern where an unidentified WWII Japanese tank collapsed through the surface years ago. Unfortunately the hole in the middle of the roof where the tank fell is the only opening and they are unable to climb out. They spend the rest of the day there and proceed back into the cave by night.A little later they discover Carl who has gone completely insane and found Victoria's corpse. Carl attempts to murder Frank but Josh separates the two and temporarily disables Carl. Frank, however, has been gravely injured having fallen on a stalagmite which punctured his back. When Carl wakes, the gravity of his actions is realized and he solemnly disappears into the tunnel. In immense pain, Frank requests that Josh drown him. Josh reluctantly does so, and swims into the tunnel. A short distance in, he encounters Carl, who has already drowned looking for the exit. Just as he begins to lose hope, Josh discovers a way out through the cave to open ocean. He emerges from the water and crawls onto the beach, where he is discovered by fishermen.The end credit paid a tribute to Wesley C.

A wolf, apparently tamed by the feral Woman, circles the infant as well but does it no harm.

The oldest daughter Peggy (Lauren Ashley Carter) sits off to the side, upset. Their only son Brian Cleek (Zach Rand) watches as a couple of boys abuse and push a small girl into a corner, making no effort to save her. While out hunting, Chris happens upon the Woman, who is bathing. He returns with a net in an effort to capture her. He knocks her out and returns home with her, restrains her in a cellar, and directs his family to participate in \"civilizing\" her.Over the following days, it is revealed that the family is dysfunctional. Brian enjoys causing pain to others, Peggy is withdrawn and afraid of her father and Chris gives the appearance of a smart, charming man. Chris' first attempt to approach the woman results in her biting off and eating the end of his ring finger. Chris and his wife Belle (Angela Bettis) protest and the youngest daughter Darlin (Shyla Molhusen) attempts to befriend the imprisoned woman. Chris' will prevails and he orchestrates a violent series of civilizing measures.Chris bathes the Woman with boiling hot water and later decides to bathe her with a high pressure power washer. Belle watches in horror but Peggy rushes to the Woman's aid and turns off the washer. Peggy is forced into the house while Belle and Chris move the woman back into the cellar. Later, Chris rapes the Woman while Brian secretly observes. The next day, Brian also violates the woman and is caught by Peggy. Belle, unable to stand it anymore, announces her intention to leave Chris and take their two daughters but not their \"rapist\" son. Chris knocks Belle unconscious just before Peggy's teacher Ms. Raton (Carlee Baker) rings the doorbell. Ms. Raton tells Chris that she believes Peggy is pregnant. He becomes angry, knowing that she will somehow expose the family's secret and hits her. He and Brian tie her hands and drag her to the barn where he keeps German Shepherds. Peggy protests, but Chris subjects her to a vicious verbal assault.In the barn, Chris and Brian lock Ms. Raton in the dog's cage. It is revealed that the cage also contains an eyeless girl named \"Socket\" (Alexa Marcigliano) who behaves like the two dogs. Socket and the dogs kill and eat Ms. Raton. Peggy releases the imprisoned woman from the cellar. The Woman attacks and kills Belle, gnawing off most of her face. She then kills Brian, severing his torso, and rips Chris's heart out and eats it.

Jim Layton (Marshall Thompson) and his buddy Pvt. William J. Hooper (Scotty Beckett) are fresh replacements assigned to separate companies in the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. As a newcomer Layton receives a chilly welcome from his squad. PFC Holley (Van Johnson) returns to the company after recuperating from a wound sustained from fighting in the Netherlands.Instead of going on leave in Paris, the squad is trucked back to the front to help stop a surprise German breakthrough in the Ardennes. They stop that night in the town of Bastogne. The platoon is put up for the night in the apartment of a local young woman, Denise (Denise Darcel), with whom Holley hopes to fraternize. Jarvess (John Hodiak) is informed by Denise that she is taking care of two orphaned French girls. Jarvess later goes on guard in the village, where he runs into a group of battle weary soldiers. The soldiers inform Jarvess that they are making a \"strategic withdrawal\". The next morning, led by Platoon Sgt. Kinnie (James Whitmore), the men are ordered to dig in on the outskirts of town. Just as they are nearly done, they are ordered to a new location and have to dig in again.Holley, Layton and Kippton (Douglas Fowley) stand guard that night at a roadblock. A patrol of German soldiers, disguised as American soldiers, infiltrates their position and later blows up a nearby bridge. In the morning the squad awakes to a heavy winter storm. Roderigues (Ricardo Montalb\u00c3\u00a1n), a Latino from Los Angeles, is delighted by the novelty of snow, but his foxhole mate Pop Stazak (George Murphy), awaiting a \"dependency discharge\" that will send him home, is unimpressed. Layton goes over to see his friend Hooper, only to find that he had been killed hours before, and that no one in his company knew his name.Kinnie informs the squad about the infiltration and sends out a patrol\u00e2\u0080\u0094Holley, Roderigues and Jarvess to move through the woods. Just before they start out, the platoon is shelled by German artillery, causing Bettis (Richard Jaeckel) to panic and desert. During the barrage Layton reminds his squad leader, Sgt. Wolowicz (Bruce Cowling), of his name and finds for the first time that he has been accepted as a part of the squad. Holley's patrol briefly skirmishes with the infiltrators. Roderigues is wounded by machine-gun fire from an enemy tank. He is unable to walk, so Holley hastily conceals him under a disabled jeep half-buried in snow, promising to return for him. Unfortunately, by the time they can get back to him, Roderigues has died due to the exposure of the elements (freezing to death).Wolowicz, who has been wounded by shellfire, and a sick Cpl. Standiferd (Don Taylor) are sent back to a field hospital. Not too long after, Doc (Thomas E. Breen) informs the 3rd Squad that the field hospital had been captured. Holley is appointed the new squad leader, and partnered with Layton, while Pop Stazak is paired with Hansan (Herbert Anderson). When Pop's discharge comes in they find out from Kippton that the 101st is surrounded forcing Pop to stay with the men.Moved again and again, 3rd Platoon is attacked at dawn. Garby (James Arness) is killed by machine gun fire. Hansan demonstrates bravery by crawling out of his foxhole and being the first to fire on the Germans. Just when it appears that the platoon will be overrun, Hansan is wounded and Holley loses his nerve and runs away. Layton follows Holley. Ashamed of his cowardice, Holley leads a flanking counterattack that defeats the German attack. The platoon leader, Lt. Teiss (Brett King), announces that he will recommend Hansan for a Silver Star. Jarvess's foxhole partner, country boy Abner Spudler (Jerome Courtland), is killed while trying to put on his wet boots.After they get Hanson to the aid station, the squad runs into Bettis, who is doing K.P. duty in the rear and gives them a hot meal. Holley discovers that Layton is a quick learner, finding him being entertained by Denise. Later, while on guard duty, they encounter a party of Germans who have come under a flag of truce to offer Brig. Gen. McAuliffe (Ian MacDonald) surrender terms, resulting in his famous reply of \"Nuts!\" to the puzzled Germans.[4]In the bitter, foggy weather, the squad is short of supplies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 supply transport aircraft are grounded. Several men attend impromptu outdoor Christmas services held by a chaplain (Leon Ames). That night the Luftwaffe bombs Bastogne. Denise is killed. Bettis, slowed by his fear of going back to the lines, is killed by a collapsing house. The \"walking wounded\", including Hansan and mess sergeant he befriended (George Chandler), are recalled up to duty for a last-ditch defense of the town.As the platoon is down to its last few rounds of ammunition, the weather clears, allowing the Allied fighters to attack the Germans and C-47 transports to drop supplies, enabling the 101st to hold. Afterward, the siege lifted, Kinnie leads the survivors of the platoon toward the rear for a well-earned rest. As they move out, they spot a relief column of clean, well-equipped soldiers marching toward Bastogne. Kinnie begins calling \"Jody cadence\" and the veterans pull themselves together, proudly chanting the refrain as they pass the other GIs.", "output": "Question: Who deserts the squad?, Answer: Bettis, Question: What is Pop Stazak waiting for?, Answer: A dependency discharge, Question: Who is Lt.

Intimidated by the calling's demands and ignoring his father's orders, E.B. runs away to Hollywood to pursue his dream of becoming a drummer. E.B.'s father sends his three ninja royal guards, the Pink Berets, to find his son. Meanwhile, Easter Chick Carlos plots a coup d'\u00c3\u00a9tat against him to take over the Easter organization.At Van Nuys, E.B. is hit by Fred O'Hare, an out-of-work, job-hopping slacker (who is being pressured by his family to \"get a job\") who was driving to his sister Sam's boss's house he is house-sitting, while his parents forced him to move out. Feigning injury, E.B. persuades Fred to take him in as he recovers, but when E.B. causes trouble, Fred attempts to abandon him in the wilderness. E.B. persuades the human to help him by claiming to be the Easter Bunny, whom Fred saw in operation in his youth. The rabbit sees the Berets closing in on him and hides inside a business where Fred is having a job interview. E.B. enjoys a successful recording session with the Blind Boys of Alabama as their substitute drummer, but ruins Fred's job interview. In the process, E.B. gets a tip about a possible audition for David Hasselhoff, who invites him to perform on his show.Afterward, Fred attends his adopted younger sister Alex's school Easter pageant with E.B. hiding in a satchel. E.B., alarmed that the Pink Berets have apparently found him due to the three bunny suit shadows on a wall and disgusted by Alex's awful rendition of \"Peter Cottontail\", dashes out and disrupts the show. Fred feigns a ventriloquist's act with E.B.'s cooperation as his dummy and they lead the show in singing, \"I Want Candy\". Both his father, Henry, and Alex, are angry about the upstaging, but Fred is inspired to be the Easter Bunny himself. E.B. is skeptical, but he agrees to train the human and finds that Fred has some genuine talent for it.As the Pink Berets close in on him, E.B. prepares a decoy to fake his death and leaves for Hasselhoff's show. The Berets see the decoy and, horrified that the human has apparently killed E.B., capture Fred and take him to Easter Island. Fred is held captive and confronted by E.B.'s father and Carlos about killing E.B. Carlos pretends to be upset about E.B.'s death, silences Fred (who tries to reveal the truth of the decoy) and seizes control of the Easter factory.Meanwhile, at the Hoff Knows Talent live show, E.B. is in his dressing room preparing for his performance but his reflection begins to berate him for acting selfish and leaving Fred. Just then a production assistant arrives to tell him that he is next to perform. E.B. leaves his dressing room and begins to feel guilty about leaving Fred so he discusses the situation with Hasselhoff, who advises him to go back and help his friend. E.B. finds evidence of Fred's capture and races back to the factory. He confronts Carlos, but is immobilized in gummy candy and tossed into the chocolate bunny carving line. Fred and E.B.'s father are tied up with black licorice and are to be boiled alive; Fred eats through the licorice to allow them to escape, something his fellow captive was unwilling to do because of the poor taste of the candy. E.B. survives by dodging the blades.Carlos, now a chick-bunny combination due to the magic of The Egg of Destiny (a magical staff used by The Easter Bunny), battles with E.B. and beats him with an elbow drop easily due to his size and then tries to lead the Egg Sleigh out with his sidekick Phil directing with light up wands, but E.B. improvises a drum session that makes Phil uncontrollably driven to dance to the beat and provides the wrong signals, causing a crash to subdue Carlos. After being defeated, Carlos is made to pull the Egg sleigh and Phil is made the new head of the Easter Chicks. E.B. then apologizes to his father for his selfishness, and he and Fred are made co-Easter bunnies and take over the job. Fred's family is now proud that he has a job and responsibilities.After the credits, E.B. and Fred are in China delivering an Easter basket to the same woman who had previously attacked E.B.'s father earlier in the film.", "output": "Question: Who did the crash subdue?, Answer: Carlos, Question: What is the name of the talent show?, Answer: Hoff Knows Talent, Question: What instrument does E.B. play?, Answer: Drums, Question: How does E.B. pursuade Fred to help him?, Answer: Claiming to be the Easter Bunny, Question: What happens to E.B. after he confronts Carlos?, Answer: immobilized in gummy candy, Question: who pretent to be upset?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Why was Fred staying at Sam's boss's house?, Answer: House sitting, Question: E.B. persuades the human to help him by claiming to be what?, Answer: Easter Bunny, Question: Who asks E.B to perform on his show?, Answer: David Hasselhoff, Question: what is the city where E.B. & Fred meet?, Answer: Van Nuys, Question: What's Fred's adopted sister's name?, Answer: Alex, Question: Who disrupts the show?, Answer: E.B., Question: Who is captured?, Answer: Fred, Question: How does Carlos beat E.B.?, Answer: With an elbow drop, Question: Who is left by E.B.?, Answer: Fred., Question: Who is made the new head of the Easter Chicks?, Answer: Phil, Question: what is close?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Where does Fred attempt to abandon E.B.?, Answer: The wilderness, Question: What does Fred sing?, Answer: I Want Candy, Question: What is the name of the show?, Answer: Hoff Knows Talent live show., Question: What is Fred's sister's name?, Answer: Alex, Question: Where does E.B. run to?, Answer: Hollywood., Question: What does E.B. improvise?, Answer: A drum session, Question: What was the magical staff used by the Easter Bunny?, Answer: The Egg of Destiny, Question: Who is in dressing room preparing for his performance?, Answer: E.B., Question: How does E.B. survive?, Answer: dodging the blades, Question: Who is made a co-Easter Bunny with Carlos?, Answer: Fred, Question: Who does E.B. record with?, Answer: Blind Boys of Alabama, Question: Where is E.B. hiding?, Answer: In a satchel, Question: Who inspired Fred?, Answer: The Easter Bunny, Question: What did E.B. and Fred deliver to the woman they visited in China?, Answer: An Easter basket, Question: Why wouldn't E.B.'s father eat through the licorice so they could escape?, Answer: poor taste of the candy, Question: What religious holiday is the school pageant in celebration of?, Answer: Easter, Question: Who are the Pink Berets?, Answer: Ninja royal guards., Question: Which pop song do Fred and E.B. sing during the Easter pageant?, Answer: \"I want Candy\", Question: How do Henry and Alex feel about the upstaging?, Answer: Angry, Question: Who is a chick-bunny combination due to the magic of The Egg of Destiny?, Answer: Carlos, Question: Who is E.B. hit by?, Answer: Fred O'Hare, Question: Who is proud that he has a job and responsibilities?, Answer: Fred's family, Question: Who is captured along with Fred?, Answer: E.B.'s father, Question: What is The Egg of Destiny?, Answer: A magical staff used by the Easter Bunny", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

A newly constructed gallows has been set up in the middle of town and is being tested with sandbags. As they walk through town, drifting through the crowded main street, Sam and Sunrise continue, relating that Cat killed a man in Wolf City, Wyoming.CREDITSSam and Sunrise stop outside the town jail as a group of temperance woman exhort Pray Jezebel, pray.Cats barred jail cell window looks out at the gallows. She is putting finishing touches on a white dress hanging on a dress form.Sam and Sunrise finish, promising to answer for us, how come theyre now going to hang you and how did you begin? In her jail cell, there is a framed photo of Cat on her graduation day, 1894.FLASHBACKA train conductor calls out the town of Sumqua as an older woman escorts Cat down the aisle, telling Cat that she is on the threshold of life, having graduated from her academy with a first rate education. As Cat follows the older woman, a man in a sleeping berth peeks out and wolf calls at Cat. Another man walking by with a piglet in his arms leers at Cat. The older woman points out a young man sitting in a bench with an older man as being clean. The older man tells the two ladies that the young man is in his custody, at which the young man, smiling, holds up his arm, showing the ladies that he is handcuffed to the older man. The older woman hurriedly guides Catherine away. The young man leans into the aisle to glare at Cat and gives a wolf whistle.Further up the compartment, the older woman notices a man dressed as a parson and asks if he can look after Cat. She says goodbye to Cat, asking her to be a good schoolteacher. Cat sits, the old woman, Miss Parker, leaves.Cat looks back down the aisle and the man in custody is still staring at her. She introduces herself to the parson as Cat Ballou, and he introduces himself as Drunk as a skunk and apologizes for his condition. He claims it was the first time hes had alcohol and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. She pulls out a book from her satchel a collection by Tennyson. He grabs it and starts to read definitely not Tennyson something about Kid Shelleen. It turns out Cat had a dime novel nested inside, Kid Shelleen and the Massacre of Whiskey Slide. He gives it back to her and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. A conductor comes by and directs her to a sleeping birth.The parson stumbles off as well and enters a restroom where the man in custody has been handcuffed by the sink as he washes his face. When the lawman appears and blocks the door, the parson blurts out a few nonsensical bible verses. The lawman frisks the parson and steps back to let him in. The parson asks the man in custody if hed like to hear any bible verses, to which the man replies with a laugh. The parson opens his bible, which has a carved out middle, pulls out a small hand gun, points it at the sheriff, and soberly tells him to raise his hands. The parson covers the sheriff as the man in custody, thanking the priest and calling him Uncle Jed, goes through the sheriffs pockets, and unlocks his handcuff. The sheriff puts up a fight and they struggle but they knock him cold and cuff him to a pipe under the sink. The man and the parson run through the compartment Cat peeks her head out of her lower bunk and sees them and they stop at the gangway. The man asks if the parson has a gun for him, and the parson asks if he took the sheriffs gun. He didnt. The man tells the parson to jump off the train, but the parson looks down and only sees a steep cliff above a rocky sea shore. The man throws the parsons suitcase off the train and then shoves the parson off, too, with him landing safely on a grassy patch. The man runs back to the restroom passing Cat again but hears a gunshot and runs back toward the exit, then ducking into Cats curtain-shrouded sleeping berth. The conductor asks the sheriff what happened and he tells him the prisoner escaped with the help of the parson. The conductor asks if it was the parson sitting with the young girl and they go to her berth. The man in custody has his hand over Cats mouth, and whispers Please to her. Cat pops her head out when the sheriff comes by and shakes her head when he asks if shes seen either man. The conductor leads the sheriff to the next car.Cat, in a nightgown, tells herself she shouldnt have done that it was morally wrong. The man, lying next to her, assures her it was the right thing to do. She admits she didnt want the man to get hurt. He snuggles close to her and she tells him to back off. Cat tells him he has to leave when the commotion dies down, and peeks out again down the aisle. He takes advantage of the situation and slips his arm between her head and the pillow. She pushes him off and he rolls on top of her, saying he just wants to see if the coast is clear. She sits up and switches to the other end of the berth. He looks out and sees passengers gathered by the end of the car, where the conductor directed the sheriff; but the other end of the car is passenger-free. He pops back in and tells Cat he saw people with shotguns. He says he will face the shotguns, so as to keep from compromising Cat. He gives her his pocket watch. Touched, she hugs him but then realizes what he is doing. She says she will keep an eye out instead and leans out. He sighs at the sight of her behind in his face. She pops back in and says she thought he was lying (about the people with shotguns) and, surprised, he asks if she meant he wasnt, and peeks out himself. The sheriff, carrying a shotgun, is coming down the aisle, checking each berth. The man ducks back in, slides open Cats window and starts climbing out. He asks her name and introduces himself as Clay Boone. He kisses her on the mouth and jumps out with a whoop.Sam and Sunrise tell how Cat has returned home to Wolf City where the citizens live high on the hog and are upright, kind, reliable, friendly and neighborly. However, they sing, if Cat had behaved, she would have gotten along, but Cat was depraved and wicked through and through.Cat rides a buckboard through town to a ranch. As an Indian boy watches them, Cat notices an empty corral and asks her father, who is driving the wagon, where the horses are. He tells her he sold them, as he was tired of them. She is surprised the house is unpainted and decrepit. As they pull up and get off, the Indian boy comes by and her father introduces him as his new bronc-buster, and speaks Yiddish to him. The boy, Jackson Two-Bears, obviously having been through this before, argues that hes a full Sioux Indian, and not one of the Chosen, as the father heard in a dubious lecture given by an ex-Congressman. The father takes Cats satchel into the house and Jackson struggles with Cats trunk. Out of earshot of her father, she asks Jackson whats been going on. He tells her the father has rubbed a lot of local people the wrong way. She is incredulous, saying that he is a sweet old bear, and Jackson agrees -- the father was the only one in the county who would give him a job. She says theirs used to be the best spread in the valley, but he shakes his head saying a new outfit is coming in, building factories, making Wolf City a real city. They want her fathers water rights and he wont sell. The father comes back out to help with the trunk and promises to build lunch as soon as they go back in. Cat turns toward the house, insisting that she will cook from now on, and runs into a man, dressed in black, with a silver prosthetic nose strapped to his face. Cat screams. The man asks if the father is Frankie Ballou, and the father tells him to beat it. The man, carrying a rifle, glares and then strolls off. She asks who he is and Frank ignores her. Jackson tells her its Tim Strawn a hired killer who had his nose bit off in a fight. Frank scoffs and says if he were to be scared, hed be afraid of the man who bit it off. Frank reassures Cat that they are going to eat and sleep and go on living, and go celebrate the Fall Harvest Day tomorrow. Cat watches Strawn ride off.At a dance, as a trio plays, Frank leads Cat in wide circles, taking time out to pat a woman on the behind. Frank bumps into a table where men are playing cards, and a half a dozen men stand around glowering. One of the gamblers is the newly elected Sheriff Cardigan who Frank clearly does not respect. Frank points at Cat reminding the sheriff that Cat is back in town, and demands the sheriff greet her courteously. Frank asks the sheriff if he knows who dumped manure into his well. The sheriff says no. Frank says, some sheriff, and storms off. Left with the men, Cat asks the man if hes really the sheriff and then ask why he doesnt help Frank figure out who poisoned his well, obviously in an effort to drive him off his land. The sheriff patronizingly explains that there are ramifications to peace officering that she wouldnt understand. Cat storms off, enraged, and commiserates with Jackson who is at the punch bowl. She asks what she is going to do, and Jackson muses, They gotta a gunfighter; you get a gunfighter. She cant tell if he is being serious or making fun of her, but he replies that no one would bother her dad if Wild Bill Hickok or Bat Masterson were around. A square dance starts and Cat grabs Jacksons arm to go join in. Some of the cowboys who were standing by the card table glower at them as the couple mixes into the crowd.On the floor, Cat asks Jackson who would she get, and he replies, Kid Shelleen. She thought he was just a character in books, but Jackson says hes real and one of the best. He suggests writing Shelleen a letter. Cat dances to Frank on the floor and he says she shouldnt dance with Jackson because hes an Indian. She spins away and, to her surprise, winds up dancing with Clay Boone. She spins away, back to Frank, and he tells her shes just causing trouble for Jackson. She spins back to Clay and asks why he is there. He says hes looking for her, and she calls him an outlaw. Proudly, he says theres a reward of $25 for the capture of Jed, $35 for himself. Cat falls into a line dance and dances next to Jed, who thanks her for helping him and his nephew (Clay and Jed are about the same age). Cat spins to Clay, who makes a kissy face at her. Cat spins back to Jed and asks where they are staying. He tells her they are hiding out among the crowd and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. Back with Clay, she asks if he has a gun and when he says, sure do, she invites him back home tonight. As Cat dances toward the stage, we see its Sam calling the dance, and Sunrise at the piano. Cat spins to Jackson and compliments him on his dancing. He says he danced on the reservation : buffalo dance, rain dance, and then looking back at the cowboys glowering at them, says, war dance. They dance away and the men step onto the floor, accosting Jackson. The chief glowerer calls Jackson, Low, and pokes Jackson on the chest. Jackson shrugs and says its Custers Last Stand all over again and punches the man, which instigates an all-out brawl. Frank goes to rescue Jackson, as everyone, including Cat, join in the fight. Jackson pulls off a toupee of an opponent and gives a war whoop. Cat throws a chair at the chief glowerer, knocking him out, and gives a war whoop as well. Clay and Jed sneak around the perimeter, trying not to get involved, but are tackled and piled on by a scrum. Frank cheers on the woman he had patted on the bottom, Mabel, as she beats up a mustached man. Two kids, watching from the hayloft, throw hay at each other.Frank drives the wagon back to the ranch with Cat, Jackson, Clay and Jed. They are singing happily and drunkenly. Cat gets off and lands in Clays arms. Frank continues singing and literally falls off the wagon, caught just in time by Clay and Jed. They carry Frank, now passed out, into the house. Jackson whispers to Cat if she thinks the pair of free-loaders will be able to stop Strawn. She assures him that they are gunmen and have a price on their heads. Clay looks around, admiring the house with its living room, kitchen . . . and bedroom. Cat says Clay and Jed will sleep in the barn; Jackson tosses each a blanket.Before going to bed, Cat sits at her dresser and brushes her hair. Unknown to her, Clay is hiding under her covers, and he smiles when she blows a playful kiss to the mirror. She gets in bed and Clay slowly covers her mouth to keep her from screaming. She jumps out and demands that he gets out before her father catches them, but Clay assures her that the father is out cold. He invites her back to bed to spoon and she stands on the mattress and kicks him onto the floor. He heads toward the door, but with a change in tone, Cat asks where hes going and tells him not to go. He turns and smiles, but she tells him she just needs to talk to him. As he sits at the end of the bed, she tells him her father is a wonderful man, but the town hates him, has dropped manure into his well, has made him talk to lawyers, and now has sent a gunman around to drive him off. Clay thinks she is dreaming. She assures him she saw the gunman. He plays along and says, then he will help her pack; her father can defend himself. Frustrated she says Clay is useless, and he agrees. As she buries her face in her pillow, Clay suggests since they hired a gunman, that she do the same. She looks up briefly and buries her face again. He then asks her about the kiss she made before going to bed; Cat moans in frustration. He pauses and gets up to leave. She calls him back, saying that everyone has some good in them and cant be as depraved or cowardly as they may think. He grabs her shoulders and assures her that some people in the world are exactly as depraved and cowardly as they think. He leans in for a kiss but Jed pops up at the window and asks Clay how long they are staying. Cat reminds Jed she had helped him on the train and asks if he can help her now. She asks if he can stay, that theres someone trying to kill her father. Jed says theyll stay and do what they can. Cat nods at Clay and says then they wont need him, but Clay tells Cat that Jed has never shot at a man before its against his principles. Cat is incredulous and then Jed tells her that neither has Clay. They leave.Cat picks up the Kid Shelleen novel from her nightstand, thinks a little, and sits at her desk to write a letter.Sam and Sunrise sing about the arrival of a fast gun into town. A stagecoach pulls up outside the telegraph office. Cat and Jackson are waiting outside. They smile happily as a tall man exits the coach, but then five kids and a woman run up to hug him. The stage drivers open the back boot flap and balled up inside is a dusty old man. They tug him out and he flops onto the ground, semi-conscious. The crew drops off his valise and a paper sack, and Cat and Jackson run up to the body. Jackson rolls him over; hes still passed out. She gets the men to carry him onto their wagon. Cat grabs the sack and gets in the back of the wagon with the man, Jackson retrieves the valise, and as Sam and Sunrise sing about the fastest gun youve ever seen, Cat and Jackson drive off.Frank wedges a plank between the clapboards of his barn and draws a chalk circle on it. He walks back a few paces and we see Cat, Jackson, Clay and Jed as Frank demands Kid Shelleen shows him what Cat got for the $50 she laid out, now that hes had a few hours to sleep it off. Kid gets up, squares off, and reaches for his gun, but he doesnt have one he hocked it for drink money. Frank yells at Cat for wasting the money and for the possibility that the ill-spent $50 worth of drink could have killed the man. Cat says she didnt know he was a drunk, and at that, Kid turns to look at Cat, sadly. Clay steps up and hands Kid a revolver. Kid can barely hold the gun steady. Frank guesses that Kid would rather have a drink than a poke in the eye. Kid gets a shot off but hits the weather vane on top of the roof. Clay points out that Kid actually missed the barn. Kid rushes up to Frank, who recoils at Kids breath, and begs him for a nip to steady his hand. Frank asks Jackson if hes carrying the bottle he uses to get the sheriff mad. Kid takes a swig, and then another, and keeps the bottle when Jackson tries to take it back. In between more swigs, he tells them his recent history, including that he worked the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. He shoots and hits the circle on Franks plank, twice; a tin can on top of a trellis; and another tin can on another trellis, and then again as it flies off the trellis. Cat and the men are impressed. Kid almost finishes Jacksons bottle, and tosses it in the air, but when he tries to pull the gun from the front of his pants, his pants fall halfway down, he stumbles, and asks where the bottle went. Cat looks dejected. Kid rattles off some gunslinger philosophy. Cat tries to defend Kid, but Frank tells her to keep Kid away from him, and stomps away. Cat asks Kid where he will go now, and he replies that shes paid him, so he intends to stay. Cat says Kid will sleep in the barn. Clay takes back his gun. Jackson offers to carry Kids valise, and Kid asks him how many are in the opposition. Jackson says, one, Tim Strawn, and at hearing that name, Kid rears back and stumbles away. He bends down to pick up Jacksons bottle and asks if Jackson is sure. When Jackson says, yes, Kid finishes the bottle.At lunch, Cat laments that Kid is in no condition to defend her father, and asks Jackson, Clay and Jed to stay by Franks side. They agree. Frank walks through the kitchen on his way out and the men get up and walk out with him. Cat yells at them not to let Frank out of their sight. Outside, with the men shadowing him, Frank says Cat is crazy, like her late mother, and tells the men that theres no one around to bother him. As he marches off, a shot rings out and Frank falls. In the distance Strawn, on horseback, points a rifle at them, and tells them to drop their gun belts. Cat rushes up to Frank who is dead. Strawn rides off and Cat gets on her horse and follows. The men retrieve their gun belts and follow as well.Cat makes it to town and finds Strawn sitting on a rocking chair outside the saloon. The Sheriff and a few men are standing nearby. Cat accuses Strawn of being a murderer, but the Sheriff says thats not possible since Strawn had been sitting right there all morning. The men agree. Understanding the situation, Cat pounces on Strawn but is pulled back by Jackson, Clay and Jed. She takes Clays revolver from his belt and tries to shoot Strawn, but in the struggle misses wildly. Strawn pulls his own gun but looks around, knowing he is being baited. Defiantly, Cat tells the Sheriff that he wont make her cry, and turns to Strawn and says the same to him.As the sun sets, and as Cat and the men ride back home, Sam and Sunrise sing that there are teardrops in Cats heart, but they cant make her cry.As they come up to the house, most of her furniture has been moved outside and a man is sitting on the front porch who tells her that this is private property, pointing at a sign proclaiming, Property of Wolf City Development Corp. No Trespassing. Cat pushes her way in and sees two undertakers standing next to Frank lying in a pine box. She demands to know why Frank has a smile on his face as hes never smiled before. The undertaker says its free, courtesy of the Wolf City Development Corp. She shoves them out. A man with a rifle comes up and tells Cat that theyve dug a grave behind the barn and that they will stay to make sure that Cat and her men leave before morning.Cat says she doesnt want the ranch now that Frank is dead, but she wants Wolf City to know that she intends to make Shermans March look like a bird walk.Jed points out to Clay that Cat wont have a place to stay and Clay suggests they take her with them to Hole-in-the-Wall. However, Clays not sure they will let her in, or even let him and Jed in. Cat brightens to the idea, saying that all they need is to be outlaws, and Clay and Jed have a price on their heads, so they are outlaws. Clay agrees, hesitantly.Kid stumbles in, drunk, saying that hes ready, and that anyone who tries to get Frank will have to go through him first. Jed directs his attention to Frank in the box, but Kid notices the candelabras around the coffin and starts singing Happy Birthday. Kid blows out the candles.The next morning, Cat and the men ride off as Sam and Sunrise sing about the beginning of the Legend of Cat Ballou. As Clay and Jed, riding behind Cat, admire her from behind. They are towing a riderless horse, which is pulling a litter with Kid lying down. Jackson, reaching down from his horse, hands Kid a bottle, which Kid bobbles and drops.They ride up on Hole-in-the-Wall and are met with kids scurrying to their mothers, and men patrolling the streets, carrying rifles. Kid sits up from the litter, sniffing, and says he smells a water hole its the town saloon. Kid stumbles in and yells for the bartender. Kid is recognized by the bartender, an aged, worn-out Butch Cassidy, knocked down the ladder of life by the cavalry and the Pinkertons and the changing West. Kid suggests they have a drink for old times sake which Cassidy knows means that Kid has no money. Kid offers him his guns in exchange, but Cassidy says the guns arent worth anything, anymore; no one cares.Cat and the men are at a table. As Kid sits down with them, Clay is talking to Jed about getting back in to business. He thinks they will need more men and asks Jackson if he is interested in helping them rustle 50 head of cattle. Kid interrupts, asking if anyone wants to buy a round and continues to interrupt them, saying hell drink to that, after each point of conversation. Cat, reading a newspaper, says she is against their plan for raising money and suggests they rob a train. Clay and Jed ignore her and get back to talking rustling. Cat interrupts and points at an article about how 200 local men were recently hired to build a slaughterhouse and these men will need to be paid. She thinks there will be at least $1000 to $2000 in each payroll. Clay says that shes out of her mind -- they are rustlers, not train robbers. Jed waxes philosophical and urges her to get off the path of revenge.Cat pulls out her Kid Shelleen novel and flips to Kid Shelleens own plan to rob a train. Kid perks up at hearing of the plan HIS plan. As she reads, the men bow their heads and she becomes upset at their reluctance. She reminds them that they had said they love her and had promised to take care of her, but now she is only asking them to rob one little train and they turn on her. Cat runs outside and they follow. She picks up rocks and throws them at the men, calling them a horse ranch Indian, a drunken gunfighter, a sex maniac, and an uncle. As she continues to throw rocks, she calls them Clay Boone and his band of chicken rustlers. Jed says they never said, no. He asks her to stop crying and that they will do it for her. Kid, standing at the saloon door, wonders about the plan.A train rumbles through the countryside. Jed, sitting in a passenger car, checks his watch and walks out the back to another car. It is a well-appointed private car and there is a man and his valet. The British-accented man is sitting in a bathtub. Jed says hes looking for the baggage car, and the man, miffed, directs him back forward. Jed exits and climbs up to the roof of the passenger car he had exited. Jed walks forward, making a lot of noise. Inside the baggage compartment at the front of the car, Cat, dressed in mourning clothes, leaning over a coffin, starts wailing loudly to keep the baggage employee distracted from Jeds noise. Jed climbs down and unhitches the passenger cars from the locomotive. The locomotive rumbles ahead without the cars, which slow down. Jackson and Kid are sitting on their horses, watching the whole situation from a distance. Kid takes a swig, but Jackson takes the bottle and admonishes him they have a job to do. They ride down to the tracks with two riderless horses in tow.Jed pulls the handbrake, causing packages in the baggage compartment to tumble around, and the water to slosh out of the Englishmans bathtub. As the baggage employee helps Cat up, a knock comes from the coffin. The employee backs away in fright as Cat looks heavenward and happily says, hes alive! Cat opens the coffin and Clay climbs out. With Cat nudging him, Clay pulls out his gun and holds it on the employee. Jed climbs into the baggage compartment as Jackson and Kid watch over the passengers. The Englishman walks in with a towel around his waist, demanding to speak to the person in charge. Kid says, he is, and that the train is being robbed. The Englishman demands they hurry it up because he is taking a bath. Kid pulls off the mans towel and the man scurries off.Ahead, the engineer notices his cars have been detached and reverses the locomotive. Jed finds the trains safe and Cat demands the employee open it. The man says no. Clay reminds him he as a gun, but the employee says that Clay will have to use it. Cat and the men huddle and whisper about what they are going to do. Kid walks up to the baggage compartment and sees the locomotive coming back. Kid asks whats wrong, and Clay tells him the employee wont open the safe and would rather die. Kid asks the man if thats true, and then shoots the mans hat off. The man immediately tells them the combination.Clay notes theres more than the one or two thousand dollars Cat predicted, in fact, theres probably $50,000. The locomotive backs into the cars and causes Cat and the men to fall over, and the Englishmans bathtub to slosh out water again. The engineer drives the re-attached train forward, causing the Englishman to fall out of the tub in a big splash. Jackson rides beside the train, towing the horses. Kid sees him and jumps off the train onto Jacksons horse. Clay urges Cat and Jed to jump, and they do, with the bag of money. They land safely and Cat whoops and hugs the men. Jackson and Kid ride up and Cat praises Kid for his plan. Kid waves his hand at Jackson and Jackson hands him the bottle. Clay asks Kid how the plan in the dime novel wound up, and Kid, taking a swig, says they ride off separately and meet back at Hole-in-the-Wall. Cat heads off, with Clay following her, and Jed following them. Jackson watches Kid finish the bottle.Kid tips off his horse and the horse gallops away as Kid drunkenly hangs off the saddle half-horizontally. Jackson follows and they ride past Sam and Sunrise who sing about Cat masterminding the train robbery.The train pulls into the next town and the conductor tells the sheriff what happened and he in turn rounds up a posse which rides off after Cat and her band of desperados. As they head out into the brush, Jackson and Kid, still uncontrolled on his horse, ride up behind the posse. Jackson grabs Kids reins and turns them back around. The posse follows. They split up and the posse divides in half to follow Jackson and Kid. Jackson catches up to Kid and they resume their escape.Back at Hole-in-the-Wall, Kid storms in to the saloon and boasts about their exploits to Cassidy. He notices, worriedly, that Cat and the men arent there. They come in, elated, but Kid asks Cat why they were delayed and if Clay had bothered her. Clay says they were losing the posse; Jed says he was doing his job. Clay laughs to Jed that Kid is jealous. Kid grabs Clay by the shirt and tells him that Clay has no respect. Cat separates them and Clay tells Cassidy to get Kid a drink. Cassidy asks if they really did it and Cat proudly says that they did, her gang. She says they are going to wipe out Wolf City. She tells Cassidy that theres more where that came from and if they help her, there will be more for them. Cassidy picks up a money sack and reads the inscription : Wolf City Development, Property H. Percival. Cassidy tells Cat that Sir Harry Percival owns Wolf City Development, which owns Wolf City, which lets Hole-in-the-Wall alone. Cat decides that she should go after Percival and asks Cassidy to help. He refuses, as that would be cutting their own throats. Dejected, she tells Cassidy that Hole-in-the-Wall had the reputation for harboring cutthroats and murderers; that they used to whisper their names when they were kids scared to say them out loud. She scoffs they got old and walks out. Clay follows her.As she walks contemplatively in a copse of trees, Clay comes up behind Cat and surprises her. He grabs her and kisses her. He tells her they should go to Saint Louis now that they got the money, but she says now that Wolf City is desperate, she should continue her plan. They kiss and she tells him she thinks she loves him. He laughs it off; that shes being too serious. She says hes not as cowardly as he thinks he is, that he may be selfish and a little stupid, but not cowardly. She says she sees his faults but loves him anyway. He says he sees trouble, pointing toward the direction of the posse, and then, saying in Cats eyes as well. He says hes not going to be tied down by a girl and that hes going to Saint Louis. He warns her that shes going to get herself killed. He walks off, saying he never promised he was going to be a hero. She yells back that hes not a hero and tells him to leave. He says bye and walks off.Jackson has overheard some of their conversation and comes up to Cat. She asks what is happening. He tells her that when the gods decide to make a man crazy, that they just made him fall in love. She discounts that, wondering who is falling in love with whom. She asks Jackson if he will stay, and he says he likes being on the winning side for a change. He walks away.Cat continues her walk and Strawn rides up and tells her Sir Harry wants his money back. He adds that if she wasnt a girl, that hed split her like a chicken. She screams as he rides off. Jackson, Jed and Kid run up. Jackson and Jed console Cat as Kid stares after Strawn. Kid calls Jackson over and tells him to find his valise and to get a case of cartridges from Cassidy. As Jackson runs off, Kid walks over to Cat and assures her everything will be okay.As Kid rubs his trembling hands together, Jackson brings him the valise. Kid does some sit-ups. Jackson massages the Kids back as the Kid tests the steadiness of his hands. Kid practices his quick draw -- at first Jackson is able to clap before Kid can level his gun, but Kid gets faster as they go. Kid shoots at cans and bottles that Jackson tosses in the air. He hits every one. Jackson asks Kid if he wants a drink, but Kid tells him, no booze. Jackson adds water as Kid takes a steaming bath. Kid shaves with a straight razor.Jackson opens the valise and takes out a girdle. Jackson helps Kid, standing in front of a full-length mirror in his long johns, get into the girdle. As Jackson helps him with his shirt, Kid looks at his hand; it is steady. Kid has silvery garters for his shirt sleeves and a matching vest. Jackson helps him with his gun belt with a garish silver buckle. Kid holsters his shiny guns. Jackson helps him put on his hat with a silver hat band. Kid is now dressed in his finest.Sam and Sunrise are singing and play piano at a brothel. Kid comes in, spurs jangling, and goes upstairs. He walks down the hall, opening each door, only to be greeted by a womans scream . . . and then a mans scream, where Kid does a double-take. At the last door, he finds Strawn. Strawn, sitting, says its been a long time. Kid notices Strawns silver nose and strap on the dresser. Strawn asks Kid if hes there for money or for a job. Kid squares up. Strawn stands and notes that theres never been any love lost between them. Strawn goes for his gun, but Kid says he cant, and turns away. Strawn draws anyway, Kid kneels down and draws. In the drawing room, the Englishman is being entertained by three prostitutes. We hear the gun shot.Back at the Hole-in-the-Wall saloon, a black clad man with a silver nose barges in. Cat shrieks, but its Kid. He takes off the nose and twirls it by the strap. He happily kicks back in a chair and says it was just swell. Kid says that even when they were kids, Strawn would always sneak around and shoot kids in the back, and he thinks Strawn thought Kid was still on the booze. Cat is surprised that Kid and Strawn used to play together as kids. Kid says that they are brothers; Cat, Jackson and Jed are shocked. Kid continues to reminisce and says he took Strawn just like the dime novel said.Clay busts in and says that Kid has brought the roof down; that half of Wolf City is on its way to Hole-in-the-Wall. Kid looks at Cat and assures her they can take them like they did last time. Clay continues and says that Percival has added at least fifty of his own goons. Kid grabs Clay by the arm and demands that he try to remember if the men were professionals or just barroom sweeps. Clay describes them as professionals. Kid says that with Strawn dead, they might as well be sweeps. Clay warns that Strawn was just a hired hand, and that these men are an army. He grabs Cat and says hes taking her out of there. Cat asks Clay if hes sure about the men. As he embraces Cat, Kid says if Percival wants a fight, then theyll give him one he and Cat Ballou. Clay accuses Kid of wanting to die. Kid says hes done everything hes wanted to do and been everywhere hes wanted to go. He says he and Cat can make history. Clay accuses Kid of trying to get Cat killed. Kid says its better than dying in a dirty hotel, or off somewhere drunk a fate he was always afraid of for himself until Cat came along. Cat tenderly tells Kid that there are places she wants to see and things she wants to doshe doesnt want to die.Clay says now she is making sense, that they can now go to Saint Louis. She rejects him. He suggests Sioux Falls. She rejects him again. He asks if shes afraid to be seen with him that he will marry her. Cat is indignant that he thinks THAT is what a woman wants a man to say or do in order to save her. She runs out.Kid glares at Clay and says hes been studying her and now realizes that Cat loves Clay, not himself. He also realizes Clay had been laughing at him the whole time and says that he will make Clay do the right thing. Kid circles the table, grabs a chair and smashes it into little pieces. Jed and Jackson grab Clay and hold him away from Kid. Kid proposes guns, bottles, fists, knives, clubs, theyre all the same to him. Clay doesnt know what Kid is talking about. Kid demands he marry Cat. Clay says he would, but Cat wont. Kid philosophizes that at first you cant stand to get hit, but then you realize you CAN take it, because the blood doesnt matter and you know youre going to live. Kid tells Clay that hes giving Clay a gift to know that it doesnt hurt to fight. Kid chases Clay around the saloon and roundhouses him into Jed. Jed punches Clay into a chair, saying that Clay is kin and has been a millstone around his neck all his life. Clay stumbles to Kid, realizes what he is doing, and stumbles toward Jackson, who also punches him, saying everyone else was doing it and he shouldnt be excluded for reasons of race, creed or color according to the Fourteenth Amendment. Cassidy pops his head in and asks if he can have his saloon back now that Cat is leaving. They all rush to the window to see her riding off.Cat, dressed like a prostitute, calls on Percivals private railroad car. The valet introduces her as a consolation from the town. Percival is beside himself. She takes off her stole, revealing a low-cut dress, and hands it to the valet who scurries off. Percival asks if she wants a drink and he calls the valet to bring it. She says her name is Trixie and says shes never seen a train car like this and he shows her the bedroom. The valet brings champagne and Percival dismisses him for the evening.Percival turns to put on a phonograph and to dim the lights and when he turns back around, Cat has a gun on him. She re-introduces herself as Catherine, Frank Ballous daughter. He is not impressed. She produces a rolled up piece of paper from her bodice and demands that he signs it. Its a confession, saying that he hired Strawn to kill Frank. He asks what if he doesnt sign, and she says shell kill him. He is still not impressed. He doubts she has it in her, and goes for the gun. They struggle and the gun goes off; Percival falls.CURRENT TIMEBack outside the town jail, Cat, in her white dress, watches through her window as the temperance women continue to sing. The crowd outside is now much larger. The Sheriff, standing outside her cell, has been eyeing his pocket watch, and happily declares it is time. Cat looks out the window again and says shes sorry the people do not like her. The Sheriff says its understandable, since her killing Percival ended the plans for the slaughterhouse, so now there are no jobs, and no payroll. He continues that she took the bread out of the mouths of half of Wolf City; and that she doesnt have a friend in the world. The Sheriff calls for the reverend. As he blurts out a few nonsensical bible verses, Cat recognizes it is Jed, dressed in his parsons disguise. He leads her out of the cell.Jackson, dressed like an undertaker, runs up and sees Kid on his horse, both slumped against the jail house wall. Jackson is disappointed that Kid chose this time to fall of the wagon and that they are all counting on him. Kid waves him off.Jed walks Cat through the jeering crowd. The temperance women are singing Rock of Ages. On the gallows are the Sheriff and a few men including the hangman and Jed. The Sheriff tells the crowd to quiet, and asks Cat for her last words. She says, Lets get on with it. The Sheriff gives the signal and the hangman puts the noose around Cats neck. She looks back at Jed but he just looks away. Under the gallows, in the coffin intended for Cats body, Clay lifts the lid and peeks out. Jackson, sitting on the horse-drawn hearse next to the gallows, looks back and sees Kid in the same position he was before. The Sheriff gives the signal and a man pulls the lever. Cat falls. Jed has produced a razor from his fake bible and cuts the rope. Clay is under the trapdoor and catches Cat in his arms. Jackson has the side door to the hearse open, and Clay helps Cat inside; he follows her. Jed jumps off the gallows onto the roof of the hearse and sits down next to Jackson. They ride off. Jed asks Jackson where Kid is, but Jackson shakes his head. As they drive down the main street, men with rifles follow, and Kid finally rides into view, half-horizontally again. He shoots randomly causing a banner to fall and tangle up a man on a horse. Another shot frightens some draft horses that run off and spill their load of beer casks, which causes the road to become slippery, and other riders to slip and fall. One of the casks pops its cork near Kids horse, spooks the horse, which carries Kid, half-horizontally, out of town.Sam and Sunrise sing that where Cat rode off to is a mystery, but that shes made history, and that her legend continues to grow.The hearse rides off into the mountains with Kid, half-horizontally on his horse, following. Jackson, sitting next to Jed, takes off his undertakers top hat and happily puts on his own. Cat and Clay, looking out the back of the hearse, kiss.END", "output": "Question: who rob a train ?, Answer: Frankie, Question: What is Uncle Jed disguised as?, Answer: As a preacher, Question: What is the name of the gunfighter hired by Catherine?, Answer: Uncle Jed, Question: What does cat pose as to confront Sir Harry Percival ?, Answer: mourner, Question: Who saves Cat from the gallows ?, Answer: Uncle Jed, Question: who enters the funeral parlor where Frankie's body ?, Answer: the sheriff, Question: What profession does Catherine Ballou want to assume?, Answer: dress maker, Question: who kills Frankie?, Answer: there is no Frankie in the excerpt, Question: What is the name of the corporation trying to take the ranch?, Answer: Pinkertons", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

She has very few social interactions, her only \"true friend\" being a glass-encased doll named Suzie made by her mother and given to May for her birthday with the adage \"If you can't find a friend, make one.\" May works at a veterinary hospital, assisting with surgeries. Her optometrist fixes May's lazy eye, first with glasses, then with a special form of contact lens. As May attempts to be more social, she becomes friends with Adam, a local mechanic. She has a fixation on his hands, which she considers to be the most attractive part of him, and they start dating. Meanwhile, May's lesbian colleague Polly begins to flirt with May. One day while feeling especially low, May remarks that Polly has a beautiful neck. They become friends and Polly gives her pet cat Lupe to May, ostensibly because of her \"bitch\" landlord.One night May invites Adam to her apartment. Adam shows her a film he made for his university titled Jack and Jill. The film reveals a story of two young lovers who go on a picnic and end up eating each other. May becomes aroused by the cannibalism in the film. During an intense make-out session, she bites Adam on the lip and it bleeds profusely. Disturbed by May's strange behavior, Adam abruptly leaves. May shouts at Suzie and shoves her in the cupboard.May begins volunteering at a school for blind children. May gives in to Polly's wishes and starts a short affair. Adam stops calling her and May goes to his house, where she overhears him say that he's glad he could get rid of May. Heartbroken, May visits Polly, and finds her with another girl named Ambrosia. May returns home, miserable. When Lupe refuses to come near her, May becomes enraged. She throws a clay ashtray at Lupe, killing her. May becomes delusional and believes that Suzie is talking to her through the glass case.May takes Suzie to school and tells the blind children that Suzie is her best friend. The children struggle to take the doll out of the glass case, and the case falls and shatters. May and the children are cut by the broken glass. Scooping up the ruined, blood-stained doll, May returns home devastated.The following day, May meets a punk boy named Blank. He asks her if she wants to get some candy with him and she accepts.

He calls May a freak; she stabs him in the head with a pair of scissors.On Halloween night, May dresses in a homemade costume resembling Suzie and goes to Polly's house. She slits Polly's throat with scalpels from the animal hospital. When Ambrosia arrives, May admires her legs and stabs Ambrosia in the sides of the head with the scalpels. May goes to Adam's house and finds him with a new girlfriend, Hoop. May kills them both.At home, May designs her \"new friend\", Amy (an anagram of her own name), a life-sized patchwork doll made from Blank's arms, Polly's neck, Adam's hands, Ambrosia's legs, and Hoop's ears. She uses Lupe's fur for the hair. The head and torso are scraps of fabric stitched together and stuffed. May realizes that Amy has no eyes and can't \"see\" her, so May gouges out her lazy eye with the scissors, fatally injuring herself in the process. Crying in pain and bleeding, she puts her eye on Amy's head and begs the doll to look at her. She collapses dead on the bed beside the doll and caresses it.

(December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)On Planet 51, green humanoids with snail-like feelers and pointed ears live peacefully in a society reminiscent of the 1950s United States, but with alien technology and 1950s-themed alien homes. In the town of Glipforg, Lem is a teenager with a new part-time job at the local planetarium and a long-time crush on his neighbor, Neera. His best friend is Skiff, a big fan of the Humaniacs films. Lem tries to ask Neera on a date, but her hippie friend, Glar, keeps interrupting with his protest songs.A mysterious spacecraft goes into orbit around Planet 51 and sends out a signal. On Planet 51, under a secret Army installation called Base 9 (their version of Area 51), there is a basement filled with Earth artifacts including robotic satellites launched by the United States and the Soviet Union. The spacecraft's signal activates Rover, a wheeled A.I. probe. Rover escapes, following a program to locate the newly arrived astronaut. The Planetary Army becomes suspicious after Rover's escape and begins to investigate.The spacecraft touches down in Lem's backyard; NASA astronaut Charles \"Chuck\" T. Baker emerges. As Chuck plants the United States flag, he steps on a \"rubber ducky\" someone left on the ground. Everyone stares, and Chuck tries to get back into his module. Shocked when he realizes he is on an inhabited planet, Chuck runs about wildly and hides at the planetarium as the Army arrives on the scene. Planetary Army General Grawl consults Professor Kipple about the \"alien invader\". The Army quarantines the area and asks citizens to start a local civil defense force to prevent the citizens from becoming \"zombies\".At the planetarium, Lem discovers Chuck's hiding place. They are surprised to discover they speak the same language. Realizing this alien is no threat, Lem decides to help Chuck, hiding him in his bedroom for the night. Rover finds Chuck, who is very happy to see it. As the General and his men search Lem's room, the group sneaks back into the planetarium with Chuck, who tells Lem he has \"the right stuff\". Chuck also shows Lem the star that Earth orbits and how the universe is much bigger than Lem had thought. The next morning, the Army takes Chuck's module to a secret location.The next night is the premi\u00c3\u00a8re of a new Humaniacs movie, and Lem, Skiff and Chuck attend in costume as fans. Chuck introduces some new music as part of the contest and teaches Lem to dance. Things go well until Rover arrives: chaos ensues. General Grawl arrives and points out that Chuck's U.S. flag insignia identifies him as the alien. Chuck is captured and unmasked. When Lem tries to keep him from being taken away, General Grawl labels Lem a zombie, and Professor Kipple announces he will dissect both their brains. To protect Lem, Chuck pretends to \"release\" him from his control. Lem is proclaimed a hero, and Chuck and Rover are taken away.At Base 9, General Grawl interrogates Chuck, and an accidental gunshot starts a complicated chain reaction with soldiers shooting at each other. General Grawl thinks Chuck is resisting his demands and allows Professor Kipple to have a go at dissecting Chuck's brain. Lem gets his job back at the planetarium and is permitted to speak about the incident on TV, but cannot fully accept the honor. He feels terrible about Chuck and decides to do the right thing. Neera, Skiff and Eckle join him to go off to rescue Chuck. The teens know luck is on their side when Rover shows up on the edge of town\u00e2\u0080\u0094he unscrewed the bolts holding together the armored vehicle in which he was imprisoned.Rover sniffs out Chuck's trail and leads them to an abandoned gas station in the desert. They look around, and Skiff sees a soda bottle in an old refrigerator. When he tries to take it, it opens up the entrance to Base 9. Lem has Glar distract the soldiers guarding the base with his protest group while the rest of them sneak into the base. They find Chuck strapped to a laboratory table, and Professor Kipple getting ready to remove his brain. Lem and his friends break in through the ceiling while Rover scares away the scientists, technicians, and guards. They release Chuck but set off alarms.Rover helps the group find Chuck's spacecraft, which was in a hangar. General Grawl warns that, if the \"alien\" tries to leave, he will blow up the hangar. To give Chuck his chance to escape, Lem initiates the 2-minute destruct countdown by pressing the self-destruct control button, which panics the guards into fleeing the underground base. In the resulting firestorm, the General is knocked unconscious. The teenagers and Rover get into the module, but Chuck rescues the General from the fire. Chuck pilots the ship into orbit around the planet, allowing the teens to experience outer space. Skiff and Eckle enjoy the weightlessness, General Grawl realizes Chuck has not turned him into a zombie, and Lem asks Neera out on a date. Chuck returns to the planet's surface. Although the soldiers are ready to shoot anyone who appears, the General stops them. Finally, the inhabitants of Planet 51 see that Chuck came to their planet for peaceful purposes. Chuck lets Rover stay with Skiff and says his farewells to Planet 51. Chuck then leaves Planet 51 peacefully, accompanied by the alien pet dog seen throughout the film (who had sneaked aboard Chuck's ship without anyone noticing, except its owner).In an end scene Professor Kipple is seen emerging from Base 9 from a hatch, only to be seized and dragged away by two military test subjects of Kipple's brain removal procedure who insist that the professor share the delightful experience of having his brain removed.", "output": "Question: Who interrogates Chuck?, Answer: General Grawl, Question: Who asks Neera out on a date?, Answer: Lem, Question: Who taught Lem to dance?, Answer: Chuck, Question: What is the home town of Lem?, Answer: Glipforg, Question: What did the spacecraft's signal activate?, Answer: Rover, Question: Where does Chuck hide as the Army comes on the scene?, Answer: Planetarium, Question: Who does Planetary Army General Grawl consult about the alien invader?, Answer: Professor Kipple, Question: Who do the test subjects want to share the experience of having his brain removed with?, Answer: Professor Kipple, Question: To whom Lem asks for a date?, Answer: Neera, Question: Who helps the group find Chuck's spacecraft?, Answer: Rover, Question: What is the secret Army installation called?, Answer: Base 9, Question: Who distracts the soldiers at the base?, Answer: Glar, Question: Where does Lem work?, Answer: planetarium, Question: What starts a chain reaction with soldiers shooting at each other?, Answer: accidental gunshot, Question: What does Skiff see in an old refrigerator?, Answer: Soda Bottle, Question: Who rescues the general from the fire?, Answer: Chuck, Question: Where does Len discover Chuck's hiding place?, Answer: Planetarium, Question: Who sniffs out Chuck's trail?, Answer: Rover, Question: Whose spacecraft lands in Lem's backyard?, Answer: Chuck, Question: What did General Grawl label Lem as?, Answer: Zombie, Question: Who takes Chuck's module to a secret location?, Answer: The Army, Question: Who finds Chuck?, Answer: Rover, Question: What did Professor Kipple announce?, Answer: Dissect both their brains", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

When the professor and his friend, American reporter John Lawrence (Robert Clarke), discover the creature, they help it when it is in distress and try to communicate with it, but fail. They leave, and the alien follows them home. A colleague of the professor, the unscrupulous and ambitious scientist Dr. Mears (William Schallert), discovers how to communicate with the creature and tries to get from it by force the formula for the metal the spaceship is made of. He shuts off the alien's breathing apparatus and leaves it for dead, telling the professor that communication was hopeless.Soon, Lawrence discovers that the alien is gone, as is the professor's daughter, Enid (Margaret Field).

Lawrence objects that doing so will also kill the people who are under the alien's control. With the mysterious planet due to reach its closest distance to the earth at midnight, Lawrence is given until 11:00 to rescue them. He sneaks up to the ship, and learns from Mears that the alien intends the ship to become a wireless relay station in advance of an invasion from its home planet, which is dying. Lawrence orders the enthralled villagers to leave and attacks the alien, shutting off its breathing apparatus, then escapes with Enid and the professor.

After the birth of their twin daughters, Annie and Hallie (Lindsay Lohan), Nick and Elizabeth divorce and lose contact, each parent raising one of the twins without telling her about her sister. Nick raises Hallie in Napa Valley and becomes a wealthy wine grower, while Elizabeth raises Annie in London and becomes a famous wedding gown designer.Over 11 years later, Nick and Elizabeth coincidentally enroll their daughters at the same all-girls summer camp in Maine called Camp Walden. Hallie and Annie first meet at the end of a fencing match, when they remove their masks and see that they look exactly alike. A comical hostility between the two girls leads to a prank war that ends when the camp counselors fall into one of Hallie's traps and isolate the twins from the other girls.Living together in an isolation cabin, Hallie and Annie discover they were born on the same day, and each has half of a torn wedding photograph of their parents. Realizing with delight they are twins, the girls act a plan to meet their previously unknown parents. Each girl trains the other to impersonate her, with the intent to switch places at the end of summer camp.When camp is over, the twins put their plan into action. Hallie, pretending to be Annie, goes to London to meet her mother, her maternal grandfather, Charles, and the James family's butler, Martin (Simon Kunz). Annie, pretending to be Hallie, goes to California to meet her father, the Parker family's housekeeper, Chessy (Lisa Ann Walter), their dog Sammy, and Nick's young, opportunistic fianc\u00e9e, Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix), who is only interested in Nick's money. Distressed by Meredith's deviousness, Annie telephones Hallie and persuades her to bring Elizabeth to California to break up the engagement. However, Charles catches Hallie on the phone, and in California, Chessy figures out that it's Annie and not Hallie there. Soon, everyone except for Nick and Meredith, who remain unaware of the switch until their newfound family members surprise them, discovers the girls' identities.To bring Nick and Elizabeth together, Hallie, Annie, Chessy, Martin, and Charles conspire to have them meet at a hotel in San Francisco by arranging for Nick to meet Meredith's parents and by not telling Elizabeth about Meredith. Nervous about meeting Nick, Elizabeth asks Martin to accompany Hallie and her. After a few comical mix-ups in the hotel, Nick and Elizabeth eventually see each other. Nick finally learns about the switch and the girls host a candlelit dinner for their parents, served by Chessy and Martin, on a yacht decorated to recreate their first meeting. At dinner, Elizabeth mentions that Nick did not follow her after she left him, and Nick responds that he was not sure if Elizabeth wanted him to. They make plans for the girls to spend holidays together, but decide against resuming their relationship.Dismayed, Hallie and Annie force their parents to take them on a camping tripthe annual outing Nick and Hallie take before school startswhile keeping quiet about which twin is which. Elizabeth coaxes Meredith into camping with Nick and the girls in her place, while she stays behind at the Parker residence. During the trip, the girls play various tricks on Meredith. It all boils over after the two execute their final prank, of sending Meredith out on the lake by their camp while she is sleeping. Meredith becomes enraged and gives Nick an ultimatum: her or his daughters. Nick chooses the girls over Meredith and breaks off the engagement. Although Annie and Hallie are both punished for their shenanigans, they accept it, as they are rid of Meredith for good. Later, out of earshot of the girls, Nick asks Elizabeth to \"Remind me to thank them one day.\"When Nick returns home, he shows Elizabeth his wine collection, which includes the wine they drank at their wedding. Elizabeth is touched at first, but has a change of heart and returns to London with Annie. However, when Annie and Elizabeth get home, they find Hallie and Nick waiting for them, having flown there on the Concorde. They explain that they had realized they didn't want to lose Annie and Elizabeth again and Nick finally chased after Elizabeth like he should've done the first time she left. Elizabeth is fearful of remarrying, but she yields to Nick's unwavering confidence, and Hallie and Annie look on happily as their parents embrace.

The Ruling House, the House of Capulet from where Juliet hails and that of Montague, the male protagonist's family.

When the Prince of Verona announces that any further feud would result in punishment, Count Paris of the ruling house expresses his desire to marry Juliet, from the House of Capulet, who is only thirteen.Meanwhile, after the brawl, Benvolio learns about Romeo's lost-love Rosaline, one of Lord Capulet's nieces. The estranged meeting between Romeo and Juliet takes place at the ball arranged for Count Paris to meet Juliet. Romeo meets and falls head-over-heels in love with Juliet. Romeo discloses his identity to her on being 'encouraged in love'. They seek the support of Friar Laurence, who longs for a reconciliation between the two families and are secretly married. Tybalt, Juliet's cousin challenges Romeo to a duel on discovering that he had sneaked into the ball. However, because of Juliet, Romeo refuses to fight him and calls on the ire of Mercutio, who accepts the duel instead of Romeo.When Mercutio is wounded in the duel, Romeo slays Tybalt and is exiled for the latter's death. Juliet's grief is worsened when Lord Capulet makes plans for her wedding with Count Paris. She seeks help from Friar Laurence. The plan they come up with is that Juliet would consume a drug that would take her into a coma for nearly two days. Romeo was to be informed of the plan via a messenger, who doesn't reach him in time. On the eve of her marriage to Count Paris, Juliet takes the drug and is declared dead.Romeo hears about her 'death' and buys poison before visiting the family crypt. Fate has other plans as Paris encounters Romeo and is killed by the latter. Believing that his lady love is dead, Romeo drinks the poison. When Juliet awakes to discover Romeo's corpse, she stabs herself. The families meet at the tomb and hear the story of the lovers from the friar. They reconcile and the violent feud is declared over.The exact date when William Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet remains unknown. Though there is mention about an 'earthquake 11 years ago', the dialogue highlights the earthquake in England in 1580. Hence, the popular belief is that the play was written in 1591.

Christine slaps him several times across the face, but he hardly reacts, choosing instead to depart without a word.The next morning, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney) happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore. He runs to get help and call the police, but two young swimmers arrive just in time to see him racing away from the corpse. A belt from his raincoat, which had just recently gone missing, is found next to the body, further implicating him in her strangling. He is subsequently arrested and becomes the main suspect, partly because of a large sum of money Christine left to him in her will, a gift he was unaware of.Tisdall is grilled all night by Scotland Yard detectives until he faints. He is brought round by the aid of Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam), daughter of the local police Chief Constable and who was one of the women who witnessed him running away from Christine's dead body. Tisdall from there is taken directly into court for his formal arraignment. Saddled with a completely incompetent barrister, Tisdall doubts if his innocence will ever be established. He elects to take advantage of a crowded courthouse and make his escape, wearing the barrister's eyeglasses as a disguise.After his escape, Tisdall finds Erica Burgoyne on the road pushing her car, which has run out of gas, and convinces her to give him a ride in her Morris car. Though she is initially fearful and unsure about her passenger, Burgoyne eventually becomes convinced of his innocence and elects to help him in any way that she can. They are eventually spotted together, forcing both to stay on the run from the police. Tisdall tries to prove his innocence by tracking down the stolen coat to show that it still has its belt.The duo succeed in tracking down Old Will (Edward Rigby), a sociable china-mender and homeless bum that was known to have received Tisdall's coat. He agrees to help them find the man who gave him the coat; unfortunately, all that Old Will can remember about the man is his distinctive eye twitch.Upon searching the pockets of the coat, Erica finds a clue, a box of matches from the Grand Hotel, a place Tisdall has never been to. She is separated from the group, however, and taken in by the police. Upon realising that his daughter has fully allied herself with the murder suspect, her father chooses to resign his position as Chief Constable rather than arrest her for assisting Tisdall. Nonetheless, Erica and Old Will go to the Grand Hotel together, hoping to find the true murderer. In a memorably long, continuous sequence, the camera pans right from Erica and Old Will's entrance to the hotel and then moves forward from the very back of the hotel ballroom, finally focusing in extreme close up on the drummer in a dance band performing in blackface. Recognizing Old Will in the audience, and seeing policemen nearby (unaware that they have followed Old Will in the hopes of finding Tisdall), the man performs poorly due to fear and a drug he has been taking to try to control the twitching, and is berated by the musical conductor. Eventually the drummer faints in the middle of a performance, drawing the attention of Erica and the policemen. Immediately after being revived and confronted, he confesses his crime and begins laughing hysterically.", "output": "Question: Who plays Rovert Tisdall in \"Young and Innocent\"?, Answer: Derrick De Marney, Question: Who is grilled all night by Scotland Yard?, Answer: Tisdall, Question: Who plays Christine Clay?, Answer: Pamela Carme, Question: Who is after them after spotted together?, Answer: Police, Question: Who is a successful actress?, Answer: Christine Clay, Question: Who's body was found washed ashore?, Answer: Christine, Question: Which hotel Erica and Old Will go, hoping to find the true murderer?, Answer: Grand Hotel, Question: What does Tisdall finds Erica on the road pushing?, Answer: Car, Question: What does the Old Will has received?, Answer: Tisdall's coat, Question: Where is the box of matches from?, Answer: Grand Hotel, Question: Who does the duo succeed in tracking down?, Answer: Old Will, Question: Who is daughter of the local police Chief Constable?, Answer: Erica Burgoyne, Question: What is the clue Erica finds while searching the pockets of the coat?, Answer: Box of matches", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (October 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)The film follows three seasoned birders who each set out to achieve a Big Year. They are Brad Harris (Jack Black), a 36-year-old computer programmer based in Baltimore; Stu Preissler (Steve Martin), founder and CEO of a New York company bearing his name; and a roofing contractor named Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson), who holds the current Big Year record of 732 birds.Bostick is obsessively possessive of his record, but his third wife Jessica (Rosamund Pike) is concerned; this was supposed to be the year they focused on conceiving a child. She also believes that Bostick's birding obsession is what destroyed his previous marriage.[5]Brad is a skilled birder who can identify nearly any species solely by sound. He hates his job maintaining the operational software of a nuclear power plant in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania. Living with his parents after a failed marriage, an aborted career at Dell, and dropping out of grad school, he is a \"typical Jack Black underachiever\".[5] He hopes that doing a Big Year will give him a sense of purpose and possibly even make his father proud of him.[6]Stu is the founder and CEO of an enormous Manhattan-based chemical conglomerate which he built from the ground up, starting in his garage. After decades of corporate success, he is ready to retire to Colorado with his architect wife. Fear of an empty schedule led him to come back from a previous retirement, but now he wants to leave his company in the hands of his two lieutenants (Kevin Pollak and Joel McHale). The company is in the middle of complicated negotiations to merge with a competitor, so his two anointed successors keep calling him back to New York for important meetings; to some extent he is a \"prisoner of his own success\".[5] A Big Year has been his lifelong dream and he's pursuing it with the full support of his wife.At his parents' house over dinner, Brad reveals to his father (Brian Dennehy) that he has begun his Big Year and the travel costs necessary to undertake his dream have already been budgeted. His father objects, but Brad is resolute, encouraged by his mother (Dianne Wiest).Stu flies off to British Columbia after receiving notification of a Xantus's hummingbird sighting in a backyard there. His former company colleagues try unsuccessfully to convince him to return to New York City. Unbeknownst to Stu, Bostick arrives at the same house in British Columbia and sees the hummingbird. Bostick again comes into contact with Stu when all three men are aboard a birding boat in Coos Bay, Oregon. Aware he may have a fellow birder on his tail, Bostick tries to worsen Stu's seasickness. Brad befriends a nauseated Stu and also meets for the first time fellow birder Ellie (Rashida Jones).Bostick's wife attempts to gain her husband's attention back on the home front, informing him she has decided to hire a rival contractor to begin work on remodeling their home. Brad is feeling the financial pressure of balancing the need for constant exotic travel with his work schedule and limited budget. Meanwhile, the merger of Stu's company continues to hit snags, causing his former lieutenants to pressure Stu to take an active role in the increasingly acrimonious negotiations.A freak storm in the Gulf Coast creates a rare \"fallout\" event, driving exotic birds away from their established migratory routes and forcing them to take refuge on the one patch of land available. It's such an invaluable opportunity to spot dozens of rare, non-native species that Stu, Brad and Bostick all immediately drop what they're doing to bird the island, despite the effects this will have on the merger deal, his job, and his marriage, respectively. Hundreds of birders flock to the area, including Ellie, much to Brad's delight. After spending the day birding together, Brad and Stu dine together and bond further, forming the seeds of a close friendship. Brad discloses he is currently doing a Big Year; Stu does not. He's still smarting from Bostick's interference earlier in the year, and fears what would happen if too many people learned of his own pursuit and word got back to Bostick.The negotiations for the merger of Stu's company have collapsed completely and the only hope is a do-or-die session scheduled to take place just before Stu's birding expedition to Attu Island. Stu's former lieutenants persuade him to come to the meeting,A friend of Brad's (Jim Parsons) who writes a prominent birding blog happens to discover Stu's growing list. He posts a picture of Stu, along with his Big Year total of 497 species to date. Feeling hurt that Stu did not tell him, Brad divulges Stu's goal to Bostick while the two are aboard a plane on their way to Attu Island. Stu was booked on the same chartered flight but narrowly missed it, held up by his successful closing of the merger deal. Stu's disappointment only worsens as he watches local news anchormen stating that a storm created prime birding conditions on Attu. Stu arrives days later and makes amends with Brad, wanting to remain friends. He encourages Brad in his pursuit of Ellie, who also made the trip.When they all are back home, Ellie calls Brad to inform him a pink-footed goose has been spotted in Boston. Any thoughts he had of pursuing her are dashed, however, when she and her boyfriend pick him up from the train station.Stu and Brad meet up again while awaiting a ferry to an island where a blue-footed booby has been spotted. They compare notes and each is pleased with the other's progress: each has spotted more than 700 species. When they encounter Bostick, Brad injudiciously reveals his number. Bostick then tricks Stu and Brad into concluding that the booby had just been spotted on the mainland. When the two realize how cleverly Bostick had manipulated them into missing the booby, they decide to form an alliance against him and begin birding as a team. Well-heeled Stu pays for a helicopter ride to see Himalayan snowcocks.Upon landing, Brad is notified that his father has suffered a heart attack; he returns home to be with him. His father comes to affectionately view his son with a newfound respect after hearing Brad explain his love for his favorite bird, the American golden plover, and comes to understand the significance of his Big Year attempt. He accompanies Brad into the snowy woods and helps him locate a great grey owl.All three birders are coming to understand the cost of their birding obsessions. Brad leaves his sick father behind on the trail when he became short of breath during their pursuit of the great grey owl; cursing himself, he rushes back to find that all is well. Stu finds that he's regretting the time he's spending away from his wife and his new grandson, born during the Big Year and named \"Stu\" in his honor.Bostick races home from yet another birding trip to keep an important appointment with his wife at a fertility clinic. He is literally at the front door of the clinic when he receives a report of a sighting of a snowy owl, his most coveted and elusive bird. Despite the fact that his wife is waiting inside to have her eggs harvested, fertilized and implanted after undergoing months of hormone injections, he speeds back to the airport and phones in an obviously made-up excuse for his absence. His wife returns alone to their big house, and screams in frustration inside the empty nursery. When Bostick finally returns home after the (fruitless) search for the snowy owl, she tells him she still loves him but can't be his wife anymore.As the year draws to a close, Stu enjoys his newborn grandson; Brad gets a phone call from Ellie saying she and her boyfriend have broken up; and Bostick dines alone in a Chinese restaurant on Christmas Eve, still seeking a snowy owl.When Stu is offered the chairmanship of 3M, the parent company that bought Preissler Chemical, he realizes that his fears of retirement are gone and he easily turns down the opportunity to become one of the world's most powerful CEOs. Brad and Stu close out their Big Year together near Stu's home in Colorado by finally sighting a Norwegian species that they'd just missed spotting during the fallout. Now close friends, they congratulate each other on \"a very Big Year indeed.\"The Big Year results are published and Stu phones Brad with the news. Bostick is first with 755, a new record; Brad came in second; Stu was fourth. Brad opines that \"he got more birds, but we got more everything,\" as he looks at Ellie, who has come for a weekend visit. Stu smiles, looking at his wife.The film ends with Brad and Ellie cozily birding together on a rocky coastline, while Brad confesses that birding is no longer the biggest part of his life. Stu, contented in retirement, is hiking with his toddler grandson (already enamored by birds) in the Rockies. And Bostick is on a birding adventure in China, alone and gazing wistfully at a happy couple walking with their newborn child.", "output": "Question: What birding contest is Brad Harris trying to win?, Answer: The Big Year is the name of the birding contest Brad is trying to win., Question: Which two characters form an alliance?, Answer: Stu and Brad form a alliance and work together., Question: Who devotes all his time to birding?, Answer: Kenny Bostick", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Suspecting that the charismatic, spoon-bending mind reader was involved in the mysterious death of his most vociferous critic three decades earlier, she considers him far too dangerous to confront.Buckley remains determined to discredit the hugely popular and seemingly genuine Silver, however, believing that doing so would cement his reputation and guarantee funding for Matheson and his research for years to come.

Hiking the wild, secluded trails, they believe they've found paradise. But when the pair comes across a group of frightened hikers discussing the horrifying murder of another newlywed couple on the islands, they begin to question whether they should turn back. Unsure whether to stay or flee, Cliff and Cydney join up with two other couples, and things begin to go terrifyingly wrong. Far from civilization or rescue, everyone begins to look like a threat and nobody knows whom to trust. Paradise becomes hell on earth as a brutal battle for survival begins... [D-Man2010]AGAIN D-Man2010, STOP with the brief summaries!!!This is for a FULL synopsis of a movie. Look up the definition.The film begins with video footage of a wedding. In the wedding footage, we see the brother putting the groom in a headlock and various friends/family talking to the camera about the newlyweds. After the wedding, newlyweds Cliff (Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich) are driving in Hawaii on their honeymoon. Cydney videotapes them and notices for the first time a scar under Cliffs chin. He says that his brother hit him when they were younger. They drive to a goods store and buy hiking equipment. While Cliff makes sure they have everything, Cydney says that its been since nine minutes since theyve been apart. If he tells her that he missed her, shell give him a BJ in the car. Cliff is too focused and doesn't say it. He gets their permits to go on the hiking trail and pays for their equipment with a big wad of cash. Employee, Chronic (Anthony Ruivivar) walks into the store and eyes the money. He helps the couple put their things into the jeep and they drive away. As they pull out of the parking lot we see a newspaper on the ground. On the cover is a story about two bodies being found in Honolulu dead.Cliff and Cydney are shown around an island on a helicopter ride. Cliff has Cydney film him while he fools around in the helicopter. The remote island they are on only has two ways out by hiking or by kayaking. After the helicopter ride, Cliff and Cydney drive around in their rental jeep when they come across Cleo (Marley Shelton) and Kale (Chris Hemsworth) trying to hitch a ride by the side of the road. Cliff decides to stop for them, which Cydney doesn't agree with. Cleo says that they are heading towards a beach about 10 miles down the road. Cliff gets intimidated by Kale, who has the words do not revive tattooed over his heart. Kale starts to put their bags into the jeep when Cliff says that they're heading towards the big trail, not the beach. He says that they should just wait for another car to pass by. Cleo says that they've been trying to hitchhike for an hour. Kale gets angry and starts to unload their bags. Cleo shows Cydney some photos. Cleo and Kale just got married in a grocery store and are on their honeymoon as well. Cliff and Cydney have a change of heart and decide to drive them to the beach. However, Kale rejects them and curses at Cleo to get out of the F***ing jeep. Cliff and Cydney drive off.They get to the start of the hiking trail and excitedly begin the hike. They get to a narrow ridge in the trail and both are unsure of whether they can make it across. Another hiker, Nick (Timothy Olyphant), shows up and shows them how to get across. Cliff, following Nicks guidance, makes it across fine. Cydney though almost falls to her death when a helicopter suddenly flies by, but Nick grabs her and pulls her to safety. The trio walks together and Nick recognizes Cliff from somewhere but cant place him. Cliff says that hes an aspiring screenwriter. While Nick pees, Cliff mentions that his first work is being made into a movie, but the studio hired another writer to do rewrites. Nick says that he took a writing class once and knows a little about screenplays. He says that \"every story needs a red herring\". While hiking, they come across a group of girls trying to get their cell phones to work. One of the girls says that when they still had service, her father told her about some murderers being in Oahu and having killed two people already. The victims had their teeth pulled out and their fingerprints removed. The police are looking for a man and a woman as suspects. As it turns out, Cliff and Cydney just came from there before they decided to do the trail. Nick mentions that he was also just there.The trio continues to hike when Nick decides to break off from them. He says that he just hiked back to get some things that he forgot. Cliff and Cydney discuss whether they should stick with Nick (who is walking back to his camp) or if they should continue. Nick doesn't mind either way. The couple was about to head off on their own when Cliff suddenly has a change of heart after spotting Cleo and Kale on the trail just below them. They come to a waterfall, where Nicks girlfriend Gina (Kiele Sanchez) is lying down on a raft naked. Nick takes off his clothes and joins her in the water. Cliff and Cydney didnt know that Nick had company, and that they apparently dont care about being naked. Nonetheless, Cydney strips down and gets in the water while Cliff goes off on his own to try to find a signal for his cell phone. Cliff finds a signal and uses Google to look up the story about the murderers. It turns out that the killers were unknowingly photographed. Cliff tries to upload the image onto his phone. As the photo just starts to focus, Kale startles him from behind saying, \"people die out here every year\". Kale is still angry about Cliff turning them down earlier for the ride accusing Cliff of being a liar and says that he hates liars. Cliff says that he offered them a ride afterward so he doesn't know why Kale is so hostile towards him. Cliff thought that they were going to a beach, but Kale says that they decided to take the trail. Cliff thinks that they're following them and gets uncomfortable. Cliff tries to leave, but Kale blocks his way. Nick shows up behind Kale and asks if there is a problem. Cliff brushes past Kale leaving Nick and Kale to glare at one another. Nick grins before he turns to walk away.They go back down to the waterfall where Cydney and Gina are. Gina asks if she and Nick can tag along with them on the trail, since they're all going to the same place. Cliff and Cydney say yes. As Cliff looks through his bag, he cant find the permits. Cydney says that maybe he left them at the store, but Cliff is sure that he packed them in his bag. He goes off and looks through Cleo & Kales bags for the permits, but doesn't find it. What he does find is a business card for Kales parole officer. Cliff, Cydney, Nick, and Gina continue on the trail and get to know each other better. It turns out that Nick is some type of ex-special forces guy. He says that officially, he cant tell them exactly what he was. Unofficially, he says that hes an American Jedi. While on a mission, he got shot in the head. Doctors were able to save him and put a metal plate in his head. He doesn't mind much, since whenever he goes through a metal detector he can sneak through with a hidden knife, which he keeps strapped to his leg. Gina tells them that Nick is hard to kill. Nick tells Cliff that he should write a screenplay about him. Further on the trail, Cliff gets nervous since there are fewer people the farther they go. He goes off with Cydney to pee and shows her the photo of the killers on his phone. He asks her if the killers look familiar. They turn their attention towards Nick and Gina. Cydney says that the killers could be anybody and tells Cliff that they're fine.It starts to rain so they decide to set up camp. While the women stay dry under a cover, the men set up tents. Nick easily does this while Cliff struggles. Nick tosses Cliff his hatchet and he catches it. Nick remarks that he has good reflexes. Meanwhile, we see someone walking by their camp unseen by the group. Later on, Cliff comes out of the tent to see Cydney and Gina looking off in the distance. He asks them what theyre looking at, and they tell him whatever Nick is looking at. Nick stares into the forest then turns to come back to the camp. He says that a couple of goats passed by the camp. He makes a bow and arrow and tells Cliff to come help him hunt dinner. Cliff doesn't want to go so Nick teases him so Cliff relents and goes on the hunt armed with the hatchet. Both men venture out in the forest. Cliff asks Nick why they're hunting since he hasn't seen any goats around. Nick comes clean and says that they're not hunting goats. He says that they have a shadow, having seen someone lurking around the camp. He wants to find out who they are. Cliff asks if its Cleo and Kale, but Nick doesn't know. He also mentions that he knows Cliff has thought of him and Gina as the killers. They were there when the murders took place, as were Cliff and Cydney. Cliff says that its a coincidence that they were all there at the same time. Nick doesn't mind that Cliff suspected him and Gina, since its only his screenwriter mind at work. Nick leads Cliff through the forest and has fun with him making him constantly stop and come forward, stop and come forward pretending that danger is nearby. Cliff realizes this and ends the joke. As Nick walks off, Cliff sees a camp nearby. He tries to signal to Nick, but Nick is already long gone.Back at camp, Cydney talks about what she wants in life and about growing up. There was a guy named Rocky that everyone thought was perfect, and she dated him. However, she saw that there was something else going on with Rocky, something darker that he kept hidden. One day, they went out to a make-out point and things got hot and heavy when suddenly he stopped and turned on the headlights. He made her get out of the truck and led her nearby and showed her that he strangled a Labrador dog and the pantyhose was still around it's neck. Rocky said that if she ever told anyone, he would kill her. Gina is the only person shes ever told. Cydney remarks how its strange how much people talk about themselves to people they just met.Back to the forest, Cliff moves in closer to the camp he saw. He gets startled by someone. Cliff grabs the person and throws them to the ground, threatening them with the hatchet. It turns out to be Chronic. Cliff really did leave his permits at the store, and Chronic came out there to give it back. The rain clears up, and Cliff goes back to camp. Gina asks him where Nick is, but he doesn't know. Nick arrives, carrying a bloody goat on his shoulders that he killed with his bow and arrow. Gina gets the hatchet from Cliff and takes out a hidden knife from it. She then cuts off its head, guts the goat, and prepares it for dinner. While Gina works, Cliff and Cydney talk in their tent. Cliff says that Nick and Gina have officially graduated to the crazy category. Cydney agrees, and they both want to ditch them. However, they cant just leave due to how remote it is. Since they are two miles away from a beach, Cliff says that they're just going to have to ride it out with Nick and Gina. They're going to keep Nick and Gina happy so that they can all arrive at the beach alive.The next morning, Cliff wakes up hearing a helicopter flying around. The two couples watch as the helicopter lands nearby. Cliff wants to see whats going on, but Nick holds him back telling him that they should stay out of it. Cliff, Cydney, and Gina go down to the helicopter. A cop keeps them back at a distance. They see that Cleo and Kale are being thrown to the ground and arrested. The authorities believe that they are the killers. As they're being loaded into the helicopter, Kale says that they're innocent. The cops search through their bags and find several teeth inside. It looks like the search for the killers is over. The authorities take off with Cleo and Kale in tow. Cliff, Cydney, and Gina all breathe a sigh of relief since each couple suspected the other as the killers. They go back to camp and pack up everything.They continue on the trail and finally get to the beach. Cliff has Gina record him and Cydney with their video camera overlooking the beach as a rainbow shines in the background. They go to the beach and Gina ventures out to a waterfall while Nick plays football with the other hikers. Cliff lights up what looks like a butane lamp and sits with Cydney while looking at the ocean. Cliff approaches Nick and tells him that he paid the other hikers forty bucks to rent two kayaks for an hour. He wants Nick to go with him to explore some cave nearby. Nick tells him that he was planning on doing something with Gina, but Cliff goads him into coming along. They take off in the kayaks.Gina comes back and sees Cydney sitting in the distance on the beach. She yells out and asks where Nick and Cliff are going. Cydney yells back that they'll be back in a little while. Gina finds Cliffs camera and starts to go through his wedding photos. One particular photograph catches her attention and she drops the camera in shock. She runs along the beach screaming for Nick to come back, but he's too far to hear her. She tries to call him, but she doesn't have a signal on her cell. She grabs the hatchet and runs to find higher ground. Cydney finds the camera on the beach and realizes that Gina saw that the bride and groom in the wedding photos were not Cliff and Cydneys. She chases after her. Gina climbs up some vines and continues to run. Cliff and Nick get to the cave and relax. After a little while, Nick realizes that something is wrong. Cliff takes off his glasses and breaks them in his hand. Cliff then pulls a pistol on Nick as he reaches down for his knife.A series of flashbacks reveal that Cliff and Cydney are the killers. They killed the newlyweds from the wedding video and changed their appearances to look like them. They also removed the teeth and fingers from the bodies so that they couldn't be identified. They learned about their victims from all their friends and family talking about them in the wedding video. Another series of flashbacks focuses on Nick and Gina in Oahu. Gina goes inside a ring store and looks at a group of rings. She tells the cashier that when she leaves, her boyfriend is going to say that he forgot something and go back to the store without her. She wants the cashier to show him what rings she was looking at. Sure enough, as Gina and Nick walk away, Nick says that he forgot his drink and goes back to the ring store. The cashier shows him the rings Gina was looking at. Nick shows the cashier that he already has an engagement ring and was planning on proposing to her while looking at a sunset. He asks the cashier for her advice. If Gina would be happy with his ring, hell give it to her. If she'll be happier with one of the rings she was looking at, hell buy one for her. The cashier says that Gina will be happy with any ring he presents her. Flashback to earlier, Cliff planted the teeth in Kale and Cleos bags to frame them. When he encountered Chronic in the forest, he told them that he suspected Kale and Cleo were the killers, which led the authorities to arrest them. Cliff is really Rocky from Cydneys story. When they were on the beach, Cliff (Rocky) told her not to mess up their arrangement. Cydney loves him, but he doesn't feel the same way. They then smoked meth before Cliff (Rocky) approached Nick about kayaking. Cliff (Rocky) and Cydney planned on killing Nick and Gina, then stealing their identities.Gina winds up on the top of the cave and sees Nick & Rocky below. Rocky shoots Nick in the head, causing him to fall out of the kayak. Gina screams, which gives her away. Rocky shoots at her but misses. Cydney shows up with a knife and fights Gina, who fends her off with the hatchet. The weapons are knocked away and Cydney smashes Ginas head against a rock. She then kicks her in the stomach and grabs the knife. Gina stands up, weakened, and grabs the hatchet. Cydney charges at her, but Gina flips Cydney over, causing her to fall down into the cave (where she lands in the water). As Cydney fell she stabbed Gina in the leg. Gina threw the hatchet into the cave, almost hitting Rocky in the kayak below. Gina pulls the knife out of her leg and goes to get help. She tries to make a phone call but there is no signal. Moments later as she is peering over the cliff her phone rings and it's from a telemarketer in India trying to sell her a new wireless plan. Desperate, Gina tries to tell him (Woody) that shes in danger, but he wont listen. She then hears a walkie-talkie nearby. Cydney, in a kayak in the water, is telling Rocky where Gina is. Rocky suddenly climbs up and grabs Gina. She kicks him away and he fires the gun at her, shooting her in the hand. While he tries to reach the top of the cliff, Gina stabs him through the hand. Rocky rips the knife out and tells Cydney to get to the beach. He then chases after Gina through the forest.Meanwhile, Nick wakes up in the cave. The back of his head is open, and we see that the metal plate saved his life. He ties his head wound shut with a bandanna, retrieves the hatchet nearby, and goes to save his girl. Gina gets to the vines and climbs down. She runs into a group of guys who are looking for their stolen kayaks. She says that Rocky attacked her, and one of the guys happens to be an EMT. He wants her to calm down so that he can look at her wounds, but she tries to run away. The men hold her down and keep her from running. Rocky climbs down and acts innocent. He says that Gina is a meth addict and is delusional. The EMT says that its strange that Gina is supposedly high, since her pupils are fine, whereas Rocky's are as big as olives. His cover blown, Rocky shoots and kills all the guys. Suddenly Nick comes to the vines and jumps down, attacking Rocky. Nick is shot in the side while Nick has sliced halfway through Rocky's hand.Meanwhile, Cydney gets to the beach. She hesitates at first, but flags down a helicopter.Rocky, both hands wounded, sees that the gun is nearby. He manages to grab it while Nick grabs a knife. Rocky tries to shoot him but misses due to not being able to properly hold the gun. Nick grabs the gun and holds it to Rocky's throat. Rocky laughs when the helicopter arrives and the authorities order Nick to drop his weapon. Rocky says that if Nick kills him, the cops will kill Nick. If Rocky gets arrested, he'll act like the victim and beat the system. He promises that a year from now, Nick will run into him again only he won't look like how he does now. He'll look a lot like Nick. Just as the sniper is about to shoot, Gina appears in his line of vision and drags Nick away from Rocky. Nick drops the weapon and stands down. Gina kicks Rocky in the face and up in the helicopter Cydney informs the cops that the killer is Rocky. She points out that he's going for the gun while Nick and Gina have their backs to him and this time the sniper has a clear shot and shoots Rocky in the forehead, blowing his brains out.Nick and Gina are loaded in a helicopter to get medical attention. He's strapped to a stretcher while she sits nearby. The sunset in the background, he pulls out the engagement ring and proposes to Gina. She asks him how long he's had the ring. He says that its been a year and a half. She scolds him, asking him what took him so long. He says that he was just waiting for the right time. She gladly accepts and they kiss.

He is carefree until his parents split up after 36 years of marriage. Out of the blue, he must care for his aging, bitter father Max (Jackie Gleason), as well as support his emotionally fragile mother Lorraine (Eva Marie Saint). Max has also just been fired from his 35-year career in the garment industry. At work, David is developing a commercial for Colonial Airlines, owned by the rich and bullish Andrew Woolridge (Barry Corbin). A successful ad campaign would likely gain David a promotion to partner in his company. David develops a relationship with Woolridge's daughter, no-nonsense Cheryl Ann Wayne (Sela Ward). His father is well aware of David's playboy nature. Asking at one point if his son is in bed with a woman, Max adds: \"Anybody you know?\"The parents separately each begin to rely more on David, frequently calling him on the phone. His mother needs help moving to a new apartment. His father needs to be driven to an eye doctor. Late one night, David's mother calls to be rescued from a bar after going out on a date, having become frightened when the man tried to kiss her goodnight. At the bar, David's mother confides that his father Max had cheated on her and humiliated her in their marriage. An enraged David goes to confront Max. Their argument ends with David saying: \"Tomorrow I'm shooting a commercial about a family who loves each other, who cares about each other. I'm fakin' it.\" The next day, David is distracted by his problems with his father, affecting his work. As a peace offering, David offers to take Max to a nightclub to hear some of his favored jazz music. While there, David accidentally discovers that his father has been dealing with diabetes and his foot has gangrene.Max must have surgery. Beforehand, he and Lorraine share thoughts about their life together, and she condemns him for his treatment of her. Alone, Max sobs in regret. At the agency, Andrew Woolridge insists that David accompany him to New York to promote the new ad campaign for his airline. David refuses, saying he wants to be with his father, who is scheduled for surgery. After Woolridge complains, David loses his temper with this important client, and is fired. The next day, David accompanies his dad to the operating room. His boss Charlie is sympathetic and assures David that he will personally smooth things over with Woolridge, so David can take time to be with his father. Max has two toes amputated.

Jones) boards a small plane. Onboard, he meets travel journalist Dale Arden (Melody Anderson). Mid-flight, the cockpit is hit by a meteorite sent by Ming and the pilots are sucked out. Flash takes control, and manages to crash land the craft in a greenhouse owned by Dr. Hans Zarkov (Topol). Zarkov, who believes the disasters are being caused by an unknown source in space which is sending the moon toward the Earth, has secretly constructed a rocket ship with which he intends to investigate. Zarkov's assistant refuses to help him, so he lures Flash and Dale inside the rocket. After a struggle, the rocket launches into orbit, taking the trio through a vordex to the planet Mongo. There, they are taken prisoner.Flash, Dale and Zarkov are brought to the palace before Ming. Ming orders Dale to be prepared for his pleasure. Flash attempts to resist but is overpowered by Ming's bodyguards. Ming orders Zarkov to be reconditioned and Flash executed by leathal gas. Ming's daughter, Princess Aura (Ornella Muti), manipulates Ming's Chief Surgeon into helping her save Flash, to whom she is attracted, by having him injected with an imunity seurum helps him escape from the palace.Zarkov is seemingly brainwashed by Klytus (Peter Wyngarde), the golden-masked de facto regent of Mongo and Ming's right hand man. Meanwhile, Aura and Flash flee in a shuttle to Arboria, the kingdom of Prince Barin (Timothy Dalton), Aura's lover. En route to Arboria, Aura reluctantly teaches Flash to use a telepathic communicator to contact Dale. He uses it let her know he is still alive. Dale informs Flash that she is locked in Ming's bedchamber. Encouraged by Flash, Dale escapes. Klytus dispatches Zarkov to intercept Dale, who informs Zarkov and a listening Klytus that Flash is alive. The two then escape, as Zarkov reveals he was able to resist the brainwashing process. But after fleeing the city, Dale and Zarkov are captured by Prince Vultan's (Brian Blessed) Hawkmen and taken to his kingdom, Sky City.Aura and Flash arrive at the forest moon Arboria. Aura asks Prince Barin to keep Flash safe. A distrustful Barin, who is in love with Aura, agrees not to kill Flash, but then contrives to force him to take part in a deadly ritual. Barin and Flash take turns sticking their hands into a hollow stump with a poisonous creature inside. When Barin compels Flash to take an extra turn, he pretends to be stung by the creature and begs for a quick death, using this as an opportunity to escape. Barin follows, but they are both captured by Prince Vultan's Hawkmen.Back in Mingo City, Klytus informs Ming that Flash is alive and gains Ming's authority to discover the person responsible. Aura returns alone to Mingo City only to be taken prisoner and tortured by Klytus and General Kala (Mariangela Melato), the head of Ming's secret police. They force Aura to confess to helping Flash escape, and Ming orders her to be banished to the ice moon Frigia after his wedding.Meanwhile, Flash and Barin are captured by the Hawkmen and taken to Sky City, where Flash and Dale are briefly reunited. Flash is forced to fight Barin to the death, but Barin joins forces with Flash when he saves his life. Klytus arrives and threatens Vultan as well as everyone else for their insolence. Flash and Barin double-team up to overpower Klytus and kill him. Knowing that this will bring retribution on the Hawkmen, Vultan orders them to evacuate Sky City, leaving Barin, Flash, Dale and Zarkov behind. Ming's ship arrives shortly afterwards and he orders Barin, Zarkov and Dale to be taken aboard. Ming finds himself impressed with Flash, and offers him lordship over a subjugated Earth in exchange for fealty, as an alternative to death, which Flash refuses. Ming returns to his ship and gives the order to destroy Vultan's kingdom with Flash still on it. Flash cheats death by finding a rocket cycle in the city and escaping before Sky City is destroyed.Flash contacts Vultan, whose people have found refuge on Arboria, and they plot an attack on Mingo City. Flash pretends to attack Mingo City alone on his rocket cycle. General Kala dispatches the war rocket Ajax to bring back Flash's body, but the Hawkmen army intercepts and Flash and the Hawkmen seize control of the rocket after a fierce battle.In Mingo City, Princess Aura overpowers her guard and frees Barin and Zarkov from the execution chamber. Flash and the Hawkmen attack Mingo City in Ajax and Kala activates the city's defenses, as Ming and Dale's wedding starts. Mingo City's lightning field sheild protecting the city can only be penetrated in time to save Earth by flying Ajax in to it in a suicide run. Flash volunteers to stay at the helm to ensure it is successful and allow the Hawkmen to invade the city.Just before the rocket hits, Barin manages to kill Kala then then sabotage the lightning field generators and Ajax plummets into the city's great hall where the wedding is taking place; the ship's bow impales Ming. Ming falls off the rocket nose, seriously wounded, and Flash offers to spare his life if he will stop the attack on Earth, but Ming refuses to submit. Ming attempts to use his power ring on Flash but his power falters and nothing happens. He then aims the ring at himself and is seemingly vaporized by its remaining power seconds before the counter to the destruction of the Earth reaches zero.A huge victory celebration ensues with planet Earth apparently saved and Barin is proclaimed the new ruler of Mongo. Vultan is named general of all of Mongo's armies including the Hawkmen. Thus Mongo's population can live in peace. Aura chooses to marry Barin and stand alongside him. Flash, Dale and Zarkov are asked to stay on Mongo for the time being since the vortex to Earth has been severed with Ming's demise. They all agree to stay, while Zarkov will plan on a way to get the three of them back to Earth somehow.The final shot focuses on Ming's empty power ring, as an unidentified individual picks it up.

Ray (Clive Owen) walks up to Claire (Julia Roberts) and says he noticed they had been checking each other out. Claire insists she had not been, but she ends up going back to his hotel room with him. We then cut to several shots of a drugged Ray lying on his bed while Claire searches his room and checks his pulse. It seems she had been on a mission and is stealing some important documents from him.There is a scene in slow motion with Garsick (Paul Giamatti) and Tully (Tom Wilkinson) each standing in front of their respective company planes surrounded by a set of each of their employees. They are shouting angrily at each other (it is silent though, we just see their mouths moving) and suddenly start fighting each other. They are clearly rival CEOs.We are then taken five years later. Ray is holding a mini Rubik's cube key chain and walks into a department store, where he spots Claire. He walks up to say hi and Claire pretends to know him, until she finally admits that she doesn't remember him. He asks if she is going to play it that way, meaning pretending not to know him. He tells her he is bad with names, a B or a B+ with faces, but he has traditionally been good with remembering people he's slept with. He knocks her bag over by accident, and the same Rubik's cube key chain falls out. They get real and realize they were each others' contacts. Claire reluctantly gives Ray a piece of paper to give to Duke (who we do not know yet). They talk in a bar where Ray tries to get Claire to apologize for Dubai. Claire tells him that she has been working for 14 months undercover at a company and has a high position so he'd better not mess it up. Ray threatens to expose her unless she fully cooperates with him for the rest of the mission.Ray brings the paper to some sort of lab or hideout that is run by Garsick's people, including Duke and Pam. It seems like the paper is a rough draft of a speech that Tully will be delivering. As Tully formally delivers his speech to all of his employees back at his company, we cut back and forth between him speaking and Garsick reading the rough draft aloud. Garsick realizes that this speech is about Tully's company discovering some new product and Garsick wants to find out what it is so he can steal the idea.Two years ago, in Rome, Ray is sitting at an outdoor caf\u00e9 with a woman. She goes inside, and as he waits, he spots Claire. He follows her to her moped and says hi. Claire pretends to know him, until she finally admits that she doesn't. He asks if she is going to play that way, and tells her he is bad with names, a B or B+ with faces, but he has traditionally been good with remembering people hes slept with. She admits she knows him and apologizes for what happened in Dubai. She says she was on assignment. They end up back at his lavish hotel room and stay there for three days getting reacquainted.On the third day, Claire realizes her wake up call never came and she has missed her flight. Ray asks when she made the wake up call, and Claire admits she sneaked out of the tub with him the night before to make it. After some back and forth, Ray admits he cancelled the wake up call and now they are even for Dubai. It seems they are on good terms and really care for each other and are going to start a relationship. They agree that it would be great if they could work together to steal millions of dollars and then they could live in Rome together in happiness.Back to the present day, Garsick's people are analyzing Tully's acquisitions over the last 18 months to figure out what this product is. They realize he made 7 purchases in one day and then investigate travel records relating to these purchases. They come to the conclusion that Tully is working with a young genius named Ronny Partiz. Ronny graduated college at a young age and got caught plagiarizing a paper. He made some formula for lotion, and then it is clarified that it is actually a cream. Ronny now lives in the Bahamas, where they believe he has developed a cure for baldness.Fourteen months ago, Claire visits Ray and he is very excited to see her. She asks about a thong she found in his closet, but he insists that it's impossible. She admits that it was hers and she needed to hear him say that he didn't cheat on her. Ray tells her about a job with a frozen pizza company. He thinks this should be their big plan to make their millions. There are two competing companies trying to work on different types of frozen pizza, and when there is competition, there are checks being written. Claire tells him that she was offered a job at Tully's company yesterday and took it. He is a little angry, until she gets him to admit that he took the job at the pizza company already, too. They agree to work separately for a while, but will maintain their relationship.In the present, Ray and Boris, another man from Garsick's team, are in the Bahamas to track down Ronny. They are at a casino watching him. Claire and Dale, another of Tully's employees, are seen planting things in a hotel room that would imply that the guest was planning to cheat. Cut back to the casino, and we see Claire and Dale escorting Ronny out, as security arrests Ray and Boris. One of the security guards is actually somehow from Ray's team, so it is implied that he got released.Tully is in a private meeting with Claire and tells her that he wants to tell her what their special and secret product is. He says she can protect it better if she is in on what it is. He tells her about the baldness cure.Duke and another man on his team reveal to Ray that they had tape recorded his initial meeting with Claire and are angry he didn't tell them he knew her. They play back the conversation and we hear Ray's line about being a B or B+ with names and great with people he's slept with. Suddenly, the men start laughing. It seems they believed that Ray and Claire hadn't spoken since Dubai (although we know otherwise), and think it's hilarious how Ray really stuck it to her and called her out. They tell Ray that Claire had requested a personal meeting with Garsick to reveal something big and he has to go with.Cut to a few months ago (possibly two months ago). Claire is telling Ray about the big new product at Tully's company and says she thinks she can get him a job as an agent in Garsick's team. He is reluctant because the pizza business is really heating up because they are developing a new Hawaiian flavor. She gets him to agree to quit his job and take the agent position.Back in the present, Garsick and Ray are at a bowling alley when Claire shows up. Garsick asks if she wants any food or drinks, when Ray says she's fine. Claire says she's starving and wants Ray to get her some frozen pizza. Ray goes to order the pizza and sees that is the pizza of the company he had been competing against. Claire leaves so Ray rushes over. He is too late to find out what she said.Ray rushes back to his apartment to check his passports and money and sees that half of everything is gone. He sees Claire outside and she admits she was hurt by finding out Ray had slept with someone as part of his job to gain access to Tully's company. She says it's strictly business between them now. She gets a phone call and has to leave immediately to go to Tully's business.At Tully's we see Dale handcuffed to a chair because he had tried to steal Ronny's hair growth formula. Claire tapes Dale's eyes and mouth closed and takes the formula. She calls Ray, who is at the hideout. Garsick's team had rigged several photocopiers in Tully's building to send a copy of whatever is photocopied to Garsick's hideout. Ray asks Pam and an IT guy to figure out where the nearest photocopier is so Claire can copy the formula. Claire copies it once, and Ray holds the copy on his end up to Pam with a blank sheet in front of it to show it didn't work and stuffs it in his pocket. Claire does it again and Ray says it worked.Later, Garsick's team is having a celebration over the fact that they got the formula. Claire bursts in and is angry that she had to risk her job and wants a new identity. She calls Ray out for stealing the formula and leaves. They search Ray and see the formula in his bag.At the airport, Claire waits for Ray and he eventually shows up. They both admit they love each other and that they both have the formula. Ray has another copy and Claire has it in a picture on her cell phone. They leave for Switzerland to sell the formula.We cut back and forth between Claire and Ray trying to sell the formula and Garsick making a gigantic speech to his shareholders about his new product (the stolen baldness cure). As scientists hired by the Swiss check out the validity of the formula, Garsick continues to talk. The scientists talk to the Swiss businessman, who turns to Claire and Ray and says that the formula is for a simple lotion. He corrects himself and says it is for a cream. Claire and Ray know they have been played.Cut to 10 days ago. Claire and Ray are in their hotel room. Claire is on the bed and reading from a script. Claire says she doesn't remember Ray. Ray says that he is bad with faces, a B or B+ with names, and great with people he's slept with. Claire corrects his mistakes from the script and tells him she prefers when he says he's traditionally great with people he's slept with. They talk about how they have to get this perfect because they will have to do it for real in 12 hours. We see that their room is bugged. On the other end of the bug, Tully, Dale, Ronny, and Pam (from Garsick's team), are listening to Claire and Ray. Tully says this is perfect. Dale reports that they let Claire find the rough draft last week. They talk about how they are going to use Ronny's real life story and add in the parts about the cure for baldness. Ronny says he is going back to the Bahamas after this meeting. This had all been a plan to bring down Garsick by letting him think they had this new product that doesn't exist.We see Claire and Ray sitting in the Swiss hotel, when a man brings them over Champagne with a note saying that it was from Tully.

One day while preparing her will with lawyer Georges Hautecourt, Madame declares her fortune to be left to her cats until their deaths, and thereafter to Edgar. Edgar hears this through a speaking tube, and plots to eliminate the cats. Therefore, he sedates the cats by sleeping pills in their food, and enters the countryside to abandon them. There, he is ambushed by two hounds, named Napoleon and Lafayette, and the cats are stranded in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the mouse, and Frou-Frou the horse discover their absence. In the morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris. The group briefly hitchhike in a milk cart before being chased off by the driver. Later, while crossing a railroad trestle, the cats narrowly avoid an oncoming train, but Marie falls into a river and is saved by O'Malley; himself rescued by two English geese, Amelia and Abigail Gabble, who accompany the cats to Paris. Edgar returns to the country to retrieve his possessions from Napoleon and Lafayette, as the only evidence that could incriminate him.Travelling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet O'Malley's friend Scat Cat and his musicians, who perform the scat song Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat. After the band has departed, O'Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill. Here, Duchess' loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O'Malley's proposal of marriage. Duchess and the kittens return to Madame's mansion, but Edgar places them in a sack and prepares to ship them to Timbuktu; whereupon they direct Roquefort to retrieve O'Malley. He does so, and O'Malley returns to the mansion, ordering Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang. This done, the alley cats and Frou-Frou fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. In the end of the fight, Edgar is locked in his own packing-case and sent to Timbuktu himself.

The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists.However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered.An old friend of Kristan's named Dr. Bizet arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.)After Kristan's fiance (Maxine Doyle) is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave.

Meanwhile, Princess Lily (Mia Sara), a mischievous and vibrant girl goes alone to the forest to meet her love interest Jack (Tom Cruise), an adventurous forest dweller who teaches her the languages of animals before showing her the unicorns as he promised he would someday do. Against Jack's pleas, Lily approaches the stallion to stroke him, making him distracted and the perfect target for a poisoned dart from Blix's blowpipe. Once hit, the unicorns bolt, and Lily makes light of Jack's fears and sets him a challenge by throwing her ring into a pond, declaring that she will marry whoever finds it.Jack, proving his love to Lily, dives into the pond to retrieve it. As the stallion dies from the poison and the goblins seize his horn, the forest and the pond freeze, setting the mortal realm into an apocalyptic winter. Lily runs off in terror before Jack can break the surface of the frozen pond. Taking refuge in a frozen cottage, Lily overhears the goblins talking about their slaying of the unicorn and testing the alicorn's magical powers. She follows them to a rendevouz with Darkness, who orders them to hunt down the mare. In a fit of overconfidence, Blunder challenges Darkness with the stallion's horn in hand, but is instead restrained and taken away.In the forest, Jack encounters the elf Honeythorn Gump (David Bennent, voiced by Alice Playten). Joined by Gump, the fairy Oona (Annabelle Lanyon), and the dwarves Brown Tom and Screwball (Cork Hubbert and Billy Barty), Jack searches for Lily before coming across the lifeless stallion and his mate. Knowing that the horn must be recovered and returned to the stallion, Jack is led by Gump and the others to a cache of ancient weapons while Brown Tom guards the mare. Lily, attempting to make amends for her role in the stallion's death, is captured alongside the mare after Brown Tom is knocked out. Learning what has transpired, Jack and his group enter the ancient temple in the marshes where Darkness resides. Though Jack deals with the swamp hag Meg Mucklebones (Robert Picardo), he and his group fall into a pit trap that takes them to dungeon. There they encounter Blunder, revealed to be a disguised elf, before he is dragged off by the ogre chefs to be cooked into a pie. Oona saves Jack and the others, and they resume searching for Lily and the mare.Having fallen in love with Lily, Darkness tempts her; and Lily agrees to wed him on the condition that she kills the mare in the upcoming ritual. Overhearing their conversation, Jack and Gump learn that Darkness can be destroyed by daylight. While saving Blunder, the group take giant metal platters to reflect the sunlight to the chamber where the mare is to be sacrificed. As the ritual begins, Lily frees the unicorn, but is knocked out by Darkness. Jack fights Darkness while the others relay the light of the setting sun. Once hit by the light, Darkness is expelled to the edge of a cliff, but, using the unicorn's horn to hold on, he defiantly states to Jack that evil lurks in everyone and that they will never truly defeat him. Jack strikes Darkness' hand, releasing the unicorn's horn, and Darkness is expelled into the stars. As Gump returns the stallion's horn, returning him to life, Jack retrieves the ring from the pond and returns it to Lily, reviving her.Alternative endings[edit]The film concludes (depending on its targeted market) with one of two endings:In the original version (included in the Director's Cut), Lily wakes as if from a dream and, realizing that they live in two different worlds, continues her platonic relationship with Jack. In the final segment, Jack runs off into the sunset, hailed by the forest fairies and the revived unicorns.In the American theatrical version, Jack and Lily assure each other of their love, and watch the unicorns reunite.

The ABA Commissioner announces a plan to merge the league with the National Basketball Association, but only four teams will move to the more established league. The Tropics, the worst team in the league, are in danger of dissolving. Jackie argues that the teams with the four best records should be merged and the Commissioner accepts.Jackie trades the team's washing machine to the Kentucky Colonels for Ed Monix, former backup point guard for the Boston Celtics. The Commissioner reveals that the Tropics will also need at least 2,000 fans at every remaining home game.Jackie begins to stage extremely desperate stunts, like wrestling a bear named Dewie. The Tropics begin playing better with Monix, as well as the increased intensity of Clarence Withers. Monix takes over as offensive and defensive coordinator and starting point guard, leaving Jackie as the head coach. Monix trains the team rigorously with a play he calls the \"Puke\" as the players are to run it, until they throw up.From Monix's training, the Tropics go on a winning run, moving from last to fifth. Jackie gets a visit from the Commissioner. The NBA does not think that Flint has a large enough media market and will not allow the Tropics into the league even if they beat the first place San Antonio Spurs. Jackie admits that he stole \"Love Me Sexy\" from a napkin his mother wrote on three weeks before she died. Realizing that all his assets are basically stolen, Jackie trades Withers to the Spurs so that he may realize his dream in the NBA. Monix inspires the team to leave everything on the court, while they may not be able to continue the franchise after this season, they have come very far and still have a lot to prove.Going into the Spurs game, which Moon declares the \"MegaBowl\", the Tropics are in fifth place and with a win they would make it into fourth, although they have no chance in making it into the NBA. The game begins and the Tropics fall behind quickly. In the closing seconds of the first half, Jackie gets fouled hard by Petrelli while going up for a shot and is injured. Withers decides he has seen enough and rushes in to the Tropics locker rooms with the rest of the team, which angers the Spurs.During halftime, an unconscious Jackie imagines that he is in heaven with his mother. He apologizes for stealing her song and she gives him a weapon in order to win. On the court, the Tropics reveal their new weapon: the alley-oop. With the return of Withers, it is very effective and he leads the charge. The referee calls the play a foul, but after some persuasion by Jackie and Monix, is soon convinced that it is a legitimate score. The Tropics take advantage of this new strategy and begin coming back. After the Spurs start defending against the Alley-Oop, Monix calls a time-out and calls for them to run the \"Puke\" with 12 seconds left and down by two points, 115\u00e2\u0080\u0093117. The play gives Jackie the ball, but he gets fouled hard again with two seconds left. Shooting granny style, Moon sinks the first basket. The second rebounds off and Monix tips it in right at the buzzer for two points to win.The Spurs' coach offers Withers his position back. The now-former ABA Commissioner offers Jackie a position on the staff of the NBA Assistant Commissioner, as a marketing director.

The remnants of humanity are either enslaved by the Psychlos and used for manual labor or survive in primitive tribes living in remote areas outside Psychlo control. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), a member of one such tribe, leaves his home in the Rocky Mountains on a journey of exploration. He joins forces with Carlo (Kim Coates), a hunter, but both men are captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp at the Psychlos' main base on Earth, a giant dome built over the ruins of Denver, Colorado.Terl (John Travolta), the Psychlo security chief on Earth, has been condemned by his superiors to remain indefinitely at his post on Earth as punishment for an unclear incident involving \"the Senator's daughter\". Aided by his deputy, Ker (Forest Whitaker), Terl devises a plan to buy his way off the planet by making a fortune using human slaves to mine gold in radioactive areas. Psychlos are unable to visit such areas due to the explosive interaction of the gas they breathe with radionuclide particles. Terl selects Jonnie as his \"foreman\" for the project and gives him a Psychlo education using a rapid-learning machine. Terl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and orders him to go out and find gold.After learning the Psychlos' language, history, and myriad other things from the rapid learning machine, Jonnie plots a human uprising against the Psychlos. He obtains gold from Fort Knox to satisfy Terl's demands, and uses the free time to plot a revolution. Jonnie and his followers find an abandoned underground U.S. military base with working aircraft, weapons, fuel, and nuclear weapons. They use the base's flight simulators to train themselves in aerial combat. When Terl returns, he orders more gold to be extracted, and tells how in the 21st century the Psychlos conquered Earth in only nine minutes. Jonnie warns Terl that he will be overthrown and the humans will retake Earth, citing the United States Declaration of Independence as inspiration, to which Terl scoffs.After a week of training, the rebels launch a mass uprising against the Psychlos using Harrier jump-jets and other weapons. Carlo sacrifices himself to destroy the dome over Denver, and the Psychlos inside suffocate in Earth's atmosphere, which they are unable to breathe. Jonnie captures a Psychlo teleportation device and uses it to teleport an atomic bomb to the Psychlo home world. The ensuing detonation causes the entire Psychlo atmosphere to explode, wiping out the Psychlo world. The film ends with the humans in control of Earth but facing an uncertain future, along with Terl and Ker who survived the base destruction.

Harpo kindly helps ladies with their shopping bags, all the while pilfering their groceries and stuffing them in the pockets of his long trench coat. When the elegant Madame Egelichi (Ilona Massey) arrives, store manager Lefty Throckmorton (Melville Cooper) tells her that \"the sardines\" have come in. Harpo sneaks into the basement and watches as Lefty lovingly unpacks a sardine can marked with a Maltese cross, and swipes the can from Lefty's pocket, replacing it with an unmarked one. Madame Egelichi, who has gone through eight husbands in three months in her quest for the Romanoff diamonds, is furious when Lefty produces the wrong can. When Lefty remembers seeing Harpo in the basement, she orders him to call the police and offer a $1,000 reward for his capture.At the theater, meanwhile, unemployed entertainer Faustino the Great (Chico Marx) asks Mike for a job as a mind-reader, and when Faustino's clever improvisation stops the show's backer, Mr. Lyons (Leon Belasco), from repossessing the scenery, Mike gratefully hires him. Harpo, who is secretly in love with dancer Maggie Phillips (Vera-Ellen), Mike's girl friend, gives her the sardine can, and she says she will eat them tomorrow. A policeman sees Harpo inside the theater and brings him to Madame Egelichi, who turns Harpo over to her henchmen, Alphonse (Raymond Burr) and Hannibal (Bruce Gordon) Zoto. After three days of interrogation, Harpo still refuses to talk, and when he is left alone, he calls Faustino at the theater, using the bike horn he carries in his pocket to communicate. Madame Egelichi listens on the extension as Faustino declares that there are plenty of sardines at the theater, and she goes there at once.Meanwhile, Mike has just finished telling the troupe that they do not have enough money to open when Madame Egelichi arrives and offers to finance the show. Mike cancels his plans to take Maggie out for her birthday so that he and his new backer can discuss the arrangements. In the alley outside the theater, Harpo, having escaped from Madame Egelichi's suite, finds the diamonds in the sardine can which had been set out for a cat, and puts them in his pocket. When he finds Maggie crying in her dressing room, Harpo takes her to Central Park, where he plays the harp for her and gives her the diamonds as a birthday gift.On the opening night of the show, Grunion is visited by an agent of the Romanoff family, who threatens to kill him if he does not produce the diamonds in an hour. At the theater, Lefty and the Zoto brothers spy through a window as Maggie puts on the diamond necklace, but Mike asks her not to wear it, promising to buy her an engagement ring instead. As they kiss, Maggie removes the necklace and drops it on the piano strings. The curtain goes up, and when Harpo sees Lefty and the Zoto brothers menacing Maggie, he distracts them with a piece of costume jewelry and leads them up to the roof. Meanwhile, on stage, Faustino plays the piano, and when he strikes the keys forcefully, the diamond necklace flies into the air, drawing the attention of Madame Egelichi, who is watching from the audience. Faustino pockets the diamonds, then rushes to the roof to help Harpo. Madame Egelichi shows up with a gun and demands the necklace, but Faustino gives her the fake diamonds. After tying up Lefty and the Zotos and recovering the real diamonds, Harpo encounters Grunion, who has been hiding on the roof. Harpo drops the diamonds in Grunion's pocket, but then steals them back as Madame Egelichi begins to lead the detective away.Later, in his office, Grunion comments that Harpo disappeared with the diamonds, never realizing their true value.

Eight candidates dress for what appears to be an employment assessment exam; they enter a room and sit down at individual desks. Each desk contains a question paper with the word \"candidate\", followed by a number, from one to eight. The Invigilator, a representative of the company named DATAPREV, explains that the exam is 80 minutes and consists of only one question, but there are three rules: they must not talk to the Invigilator or the armed guard at the door, spoil their paper, or leave the room. If they do, they will be disqualified.As the exam timer starts, it turns out that the papers are blank; one Chinese candidate is immediately disqualified for spoiling her paper when she begins to write on it. The seven remaining candidates realize they can talk to each other and work together. \"White\", who is arrogant and rude, suggests nicknames based on physical appearance: Black, White, Brown, Blonde, Brunette, and Dark, refer to their skin and hair colours, and Deaf for one candidate who does not pay attention to the others. The candidates use the lights, bodily fluids, and fire sprinklers to reveal any questions on the paper, with no luck. It is revealed that the company in question is responsible for a miracle drug which a large part of the population are dependent upon after a viral pandemic, including Brunette's partner. White takes control of the group and causes Brunette to be disqualified by tricking her into burning her paper so the group can test the water sprinklers. He also tricks Deaf into ripping up his own paper.White taunts the others, saying he knows the question but will not tell them. Black subdues White and ties him to a chair; White says he needs his medication, implying he has the virus, but the others do not believe him. Brown then accuses Dark of being a plant from the company, as she demonstrates much knowledge about the internal workings of the company. After Brown tortures Dark into revealing that she works for the company, White goes into convulsions, showing he has the disease. Dark asks the unseen Invigilator for help and is disqualified.Blonde retrieves the medication for White, reviving him, and the others release him, demanding to know the question; White suggests that there is no question and that the company is going to hire the last remaining candidate. Black steals the guard's gun, but it requires the guard's fingerprint ID, giving White time to steal it. White forces Brown to leave the room at gunpoint, disqualifying him, but when he forces Blonde to leave, she turns off the voice-activated lights, allowing Black to attack White.When the lights are turned on, Black dies from a gunshot, and Blonde is hiding in the hallway, with one foot still inside the room. Before White can kill her, the exam timer runs to zero. When White addresses the Invigilator, he is disqualified, as Deaf had earlier set the countdown forward by a few minutes. Blonde then remembers that Deaf had been using glasses and a piece of broken glass with an exam paper earlier but was ignored. Taking the abandoned glasses, she finds the phrase \"Question 1.\" on the exam paper in minuscule writing.Blonde realises that Question 1 refers to the only question asked of them by the Invigilator: \"Any questions?\" She answers, \"No.\" The Invigilator and Deaf enter; the Invigilator reveals Deaf is actually the CEO of the company and inventor of the cure for the virus, which can also heal any wound. The bullet that hit Black contained this cure, and he awakens, healed. With the drug about to be released to the public, the company needed to hire someone who was not only able to make tough choices but is also compassionate, which Blonde had demonstrated throughout the exam. Blonde passes the exam and accepts her new job.", "output": "Question: Who is the CEO of the company ?, Answer: Deaf is the CEO of the company., Question: What is written in minuscule writing?, Answer: Question 1, Question: Where is the film set?, Answer: In present - time United Kingdom in an alternate history, Question: Who is hiding in the hallway with one foot inside the room?, Answer: Blonde, Question: What does Blonde turn off in the movie?, Answer: The voice-activated lights, Question: Who eventually takes control of the group?, Answer: White, Question: Who passes the exam and accepts the Job ?, Answer: Blonde passes the exam and accepts the job., Question: What powers does the virus have ?, Answer: The virus has the power to heal any wound., Question: Who is tricked into ripping up his own paper?, Answer: Deaf, Question: What does each desk contain?, Answer: A question paper with the word \"candidate\", followed by a number, from one to eight, Question: How many candidates dress for what appears to be an employment assessment exam?, Answer: Eight candidates, Question: Who suggests that there is no question in the movie?, Answer: White, Question: Brunette burns her paper so that the group can test what?, Answer: Sprinklers", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

She has the boys address written down on a note and a mobile number. But she forgets to recharge her mobile battery the previous night which compels her to find his address on her own without any assistance from the boy had she had called on his mobile number asking for directions. She gets off the rickshaw and walks towards a group of young children playing cricket. She asks for directions for the address she is looking for to Swapnil Joshi (even his character does not have a name in the movie) which causes his concentration to lapse and he gets clean bowled by the bowler. He tells her the directions in the typical Puneite manner which she doesnt happen to like it much for she has a bit trouble understanding the same language spoken differently in two major cities of Maharashtra. She says she would manage on her own and walks off. Eventually she reaches on the address to find the house was locked. She returns and walks into a shop to make a call to her friend. At the same time Swapnil and another boy walks into the shop to buy a ball. She asks Swapnil what was he doing there and he answers her back that he'd come there to have his beard shaved. She gets displeased a bit over this funny answer and walks out of the shop. He follows her and asks her whether she found the address. She tells she did but that the house was locked and the neighbor slammed the door on her face saying that she didnt know where the people in the house have gone. She makes a remark over the woman's behavior as \"We should learn how to insult someone from the people in Pune.\" Swapnil goes defensive with his city saying that \"This is the busy time for women who work in the house. So it is but natural to insult someone who appears on your door at a time like this.\" (Note - People who belong to Pune city do not like their city to be berated as they are proud of their city) Then she asks him whether there was any coffee shop around, on which he goes back to his Puneite manner to answer when she abruptly gesticulates him with her hand to stop and says that she would manager on her own. As she was looking for a rickshaw to hail, Swapnil comes on his bike and offers her help to drop her off as far as the coffee shop. She thinks he is trying to flirt with her and asks him the same but he completely denies it and says it is just a gesture of help to a girl who is going around in the heated sun looking for an address. She theorizes that she'd better accept his help lest she should have trouble finding the coffee shop and rides on his bike on the back seat to the coffee shop. At the coffee shop she gets off his bike and says thanks and starts to walk away into the coffee shop when he makes a remark that that's what he calls \"being ungrateful.\" She asks him to explain himself. He explains that after having helped her so much, she doesnt even bother to offer him a glass of water. Over which she says \"Are you sure that you are not flirting with me?\" He again denies and goes back to appreciate the Puneite culture which obliges him to offer help to a girl like her in so-called trouble. She reluctantly invites him over a cup of coffee.Inside the coffee shop they start to make conversation. Swapnil learns that she's come here to meet the guy whom her mother wants her to meet for marriage proposal. He also learns that she is not interested in this 'marriage institution.' And that she has only come here to respect her mothers wish and she is going to visit his house again and turn him down. Now she has no other alternative than to wait out until the evening as the house was locked. Over the course of conversation they find out that they have difference of opinion on the subject of marriage. When their conversation ends he starts to walk out when she bluntly says that she would not pay the bill of his coffee. She says that they should pay for their coffees respectively. He startles over this and says that he does not have any money on him. She makes an indifferent gesture and says that she would only pay for her coffee and he is on his own. He sits down at the table urging her to pay his coffee bill for the moment and he would pay it back after a while. She asks him how is he going to do that and he replies that he's got an ATM card. She asks him whether he's got any money in it and he answers madly that he does. He offers her to keep his expensive watch as insurance until he repays her her money back. He withdraws money and gives her back. He sarcastically tells her that she is very good at keeping accounts and she must be a chartered accountant the way she handled the situation. She replies that she is a fashion designer and not a chartered accountant. That gives him an excuse to continue the conversation and asks her what's her opinion about the fashion of Pune is, stretching his both hands horizontally anticipating she would make an excellent remark over it. Instead she says that Pune is not that much mature about fashion. He argues over this and shows her few of his ornaments says that those particular things have originated in Pune. So, their conversation continues until they reach the basement where he'd parked his bike. As he was about to leave she asks where Sarasbaug or something is, over which he gets displeased again as he didn't happen to like the way she mentioned \"Sarasbaug or something.\" It gets underlined that he is proud of everything about his city that he didn't like the way she formed her question. The incident gives them another excuse to be with each other and they go to visit Sarasbaug together.Further in the movie they go on to explore few well known places of Pune. In one of the scenes, they lose the sight of each other in the immense crowd and Swapnil thinks that Mukta's lost. He gets uneasy and desperately begins to look for her in the crowd and eventually manages to find her out. During this time Mukta spots Swapnil to have gotten to be restless when he fails to locate her in the crowd. Then she realizes that Swapnil has developed a thing for her and she gets pleased with that. They again begin their conversation. Afterwards, she gets completely angry over his senseless questions when she had got off the phone talking with someone and she tells him she needs to go to a place to cool her head. Then they go to Sinhgad (a fort) on his bike. While strolling on the fort they inadvertently begin to open up with each other about their love life and they get to know each others opinions about the subject. She finds out that Swapnil is very emotional though he doesnt look like. They unknowingly develop a friendship being with each other almost all day. As the evening draws nearer, they begin to return to the Pune station where Mukta is supposed to board the train back to Mumbai.The climax of the movie reveals that Swapnil is the boy who she was supposed to meet in the morning. However, he tactfully disguises this thing from her in order to know her better informally. When he reveals the same thing to her, she gets a pleasant shock of surprise. In the happy end, they like each other and she boards the train back to Mumbai and says that she will let him know her decision once she talks this over with her mother. (which will definitely be positive is understandable)Most of the Indian wedding used to fall into arranged marriage category in the days gone by. However, as the new generation is seen to be inclined towards western culture over the past two decades, this ritual has seemed to be fading away. This story can be summarized as \"Its the marriage which ultimately ended up being a love marriage which was supposed to have been an arranged marriage.\"", "output": "Question: Where does the girl ask for directions to the first time?, Answer: Pune, Question: Who did Hridaymardyam meet?, Answer: Barve, Question: Who receives a call from hridaymardyam?, Answer: In the story Mukta Barve calls her friend., Question: Where does the boy give the girl a ride to?, Answer: coffee shop, Question: When is the train due to leave?, Answer: 15 minutes, Question: What is Joshi's pseudonym?, Answer: Swapnil, Question: How does she leave Joshi?, Answer: By Rickshaw, Question: What does she ask Joshi to do?, Answer: Tell her the location of the address, Question: Whose pseudonym is \"Mumbai\"?, Answer: Barve, Question: What makes her wait for her boyfriend?, Answer: No charge in her cell phone, Question: Who doesn't want to marry Hridaymardyam?, Answer: Barve, Question: What do they share?, Answer: Coffee, Question: Who left the note?, Answer: Barve, Question: What did Hridaymardyam ask Pune?, Answer: her to return his mobile handset, Question: Who cannot start his bike?, Answer: Pune, Question: Where is the girl from?, Answer: Pune, Question: What is the girl's answer to the guy's marriage proposal?, Answer: No", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

When their car breaks down, they discover there is no cell phone reception and start walking back to a motel across the street from an auto repair garage where they had stopped because the car was making noises. Oddly, when they arrive, there are no cars in the parking lot. At the Office, they hear piercing screams coming from the back room. The motel manager, Mason (Frank Whaley), appears and explains that the noises are coming from the television. They book a room for the night.In their room, the couple hear loud and insistent banging on their door and on the door to the adjacent room. They also receive anonymous phone calls, despite being told by Mason they are the only people staying there. David notifies Mason of the situation, and he says he'll take care of it. Back in the room, a bored David takes a peek at the video tapes left on top of the television. At first, they appear to be horror movies; but, after careful observation, he realizes they are snuff films that were made in that very room. David searches the room, finding hidden cameras, and concludes they are being watched by Mason from the office.In the bathroom, the couple is amazed to find the apple Amy left in the car. They flee the room and head for the woods, but two men dressed in blue and wearing masks stop them, so they return to the room and lock the door. David runs to the motel's payphone and dials 9-1-1, but Mason answers. David escapes the phone booth just before the men crash their car into it and chase him back to his room.Back in the room, David and Amy hear a truck pull into the parking lot. From the window, they attract the driver's (Mark Casella) attention, but Mason and the men in masks appear behind him; and the couple realize he is a part of it and is there to buy the snuff films. David and Amy discover a tunnel from a trapdoor in the bathroom, which the men must have used to leave the apple. They follow it to the manager's office, where they find video monitors taping the entire motel. Amy calls the police, but she's interrupted by Mason before she can give the Dispatcher any useful information, leaving the phone off the hook.Followed by two of the masked men, the couple sneak back into the tunnel and take a different route underground, ending up in the auto garage across the lot from the motel. They hold the trapdoor down with heavy items. Meanwhile, a Sheriff's Deputy (David Doty) responding to Amy's call arrives. Mason offers to show the officer around, but he leaves to fetch a different set of keys while the officer continues to search. He finds tapes in one of the rooms and, realizing the nature of the hotel, flees. David and Amy run to him, and they all get inside the police car. They find the engine wire has been cut; and, when the officer gets out to check under the hood, he is killed by the masked men and the couple flee into one of the other motel rooms.David hides Amy inside the ceiling, and attempts to venture out alone to get a revolver gun that was in Mason's office, but the killers surprise and stab David before he can leave, and he ends up collapsing in the doorway, seen by Amy who breaks down in tears. In the morning, Amy comes down and finds the killers' car. As she drives away, a killer breaks into the car from the sun roof and, in her effort to fend him off while driving, crashes the car into the motel, killing her attacker as well as another one of the masked men, revealed to be the gas station attendant (Ethan Embry) who \"helped\" the couple earlier with their car troubles, as he is crushed against the front of the car. Amy runs into the reception area where she finds the revolver. In an effort to reach the revolver, an apoplectic Mason strangles her with a telephone cord that he took out of the phone in his office. As they fight, Mason beats her severely. But in his effort to get a good final shot with his hand-held digital video camera, Amy fights back, and Mason ends up throwing her within reach of the revolver she had dropped, and she shoots him three times, fatally wounding. Amy immediately runs to David to find that he is still alive, but seriously in need of help. She searches Mason's body carefully for the telephone cord he had used to strangle her, calls 911 again and returns to comfort David while they wait for the police.", "output": "Question: Where does David hide Amy?, Answer: In the ceiling, Question: How did Ami kill the motel manager?, Answer: revolver gun, Question: Who stops Ami and David from escaping?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What kind of animal gets hit by a car?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who is Amy on her way home with?, Answer: David, Question: Who makes a call to 911?, Answer: david, Question: How many times does Amy shoot Mason?, Answer: 3 times, Question: What did Ami and David find in the motel?, Answer: Finds hidden cameras, Question: Who gets stabbed near the end and looses consciousness?, Answer: David, Question: Who beats Amy severely?, Answer: Mason", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

After calling Nick to yell at him for bringing drugs into his home, he disposes of all of it in the kitchen sink.Ice (Glenn Plummer), a Jamaican Rasta hitman, enters Casey's house and is about to kill him, but Casey manages to persuade him to have a last smoke of marijuana. After having smoked, Ice is about to kill Casey when Ice's cell phone rings. Ice begins to rap over the phone in an effort to clinch a record deal, and Casey seizes the moment and knocks him out. Casey then ties him up and leaves him in his garage.A representative from the adoption agency comes to interview Casey about his fitness to be a father. The representative is particularly curious to know what Casey did for several years when he lived in L.A. as there is no account of his time there. Casey tries his best to cover up his past as well as his recent encounter with the hitman.During the interview, Dallas, who wants the money that she believes Nick left with Casey along with the heroin, shows up. She scares away the representative from the adoption agency by telling a story about Casey's drug-dealing and murdering past.When left alone with Casey, Dallas questions him about the money's whereabouts. Angry that he cannot help her, she decides to kill him. But not before she ties him up to a chair, fellates him to force an erection, gets naked and proceeds to mount and rape him. She tells him she will not kill him until he orgasms and she plans to go on until she makes him get an orgasm. Delivering on her word, she reaches multiple orgasms, but gets no results from him.While Dallas reaches a third orgasm, Hill breaks in and shoots her, splattering her blood all over Casey, his walls and his floor.Billy believes Casey when told that he does not have the heroin, but plans on torturing him with a saw and a blow torch anyhow, while he brags about his prowess and technique of cauterization as he sets to work. Hill is interrupted by cops ironically raiding the house next door. As Billy checks on it Casey is able to loosen the tape around his wrists and grabs a frying pan and sits back down. Billy returns and tells Casey the cops got the wrong house. As he is about to proceed, he notices something is wrong. But catching Billy off guard, Casey overpowers him, and leaves him in the garage.Nick calls Casey from a pay phone, apologizes for everything and admits he had stolen the heroin and money from the police. After he hangs up, it is revealed to us that Nick has been shot, and is bleeding severely, seemingly about to die.Finally, a corrupt cop (Mickey Rourke) arrives with a bag which contains Nick's head. He gives Casey until 7 p.m. to find the money but tells him that he does not care about the heroin. The cop then sees the garage with Ice and Billy tied up and Dallas dead and unloads a magazine into Ice and Billy. He then tells Casey to throw them out as it is garbage day.In the end, Casey calls Ice's boss and tells him that the heroin is being auctioned off at 7 p.m. at his house. He recalls Nick's earlier words which promptly lead him to find the money and a wedding present in the spare tire of his car. He takes them, puts them in Dallas' Lamborghini Diablo car and goes to pick his wife up at the airport to presumably escape the country. The movie ends as we see the cops and the Jamaicans, both armed, about to meet each other at the house.", "output": "Question: Who does Casey knock out while he is rapping on the phone?, Answer: Ice, Question: What does Dallas want?, Answer: money and heroin, Question: When does Dallas say she is going to kill Casey?, Answer: After she makes him orgasm., Question: What does Casey tie Dallas to?, Answer: chair, Question: What does Nick leave in the guest bedroom?, Answer: Suitcases filled with heroin, Question: What business is Casey Wells in?, Answer: Architecture, Question: How does Dallas scare away the representative?, Answer: by telling a story about Casey's drug-dealing and murdering past, Question: What does Nick apologize to Casey for?, Answer: stealing the money and heroin from the police, Question: What is in the corrupt cop's bag?, Answer: Nick's head., Question: By what time must Casey find the money?, Answer: 7 p.m., Question: Why is Nick bleeding?, Answer: he's been shot, Question: What does Casey plan on torturing Billy with?, Answer: saw, Question: What type of coffee does Nick want to buy?, Answer: Chocolate Macadamia, Question: What does Billy use to torture Casey?, Answer: Ba saw and a blowtorch., Question: What is Casey's profession after cleaning up his life?, Answer: Architect, Question: Where does the movie begin?, Answer: Convenience store, Question: What is the name of the Jamaican Rasta hitman?, Answer: Ice, Question: What type of coffee does Nick finally choose?, Answer: Chocolate macadamia, Question: What type of drug did Nick bring to Casey's?, Answer: Heroin, Question: Who does Nick go to visit?, Answer: Casey Wells", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Cryptograf, an advisor to Viking chief Timandahaf, says that the enemies are always gone because, \"Fear gives them wings\". Timandahaf excitedly concludes that they must find a \"Champion of Fear\", who can teach them to be great cowards so they can fly, making them invincible. The chief says he'll give anything to whoever can bring him this Champion of Fear. Cryptograf hatches a secret plan to seize power and tells the chief they'll find the Champion of Fear in Gaul.During a typical day in the Gaulish village, chief Vitalstatistix announces the imminent arrival of his nephew Justforkix, who is to be trained to be a man. When Justforkix arrives from Parisium, he doesn't look like warrior material. He uses his bird SMS (Shortmessageservix) to send messages to his \"babes\". Besides chasing girls, he's into hi-tech, nightlife, and dancing and he's a vegetarian, much to the dismay of Obelix, who can't get him to try wild boar.In Norway, as the Vikings prepare to start their quest, the chief's wife, Vikea, orders her husband to get her some flat-packed easy-to-assemble furniture from his raids, while his daughter, Abba, insists on going along, but is flatly refused. Abba disguises herself as a man and goes anyway.Back in Gaul, the training of Justforkix under the direction of Asterix and Obelix is proceeding, but with little, if any, success. He runs screaming from any danger and refuses to drink potion. Upon their arrival in Gaul, Cryptograf explains to his incredibly stupid son, Olaf, that he must capture the Champion of Fear, and claim the prize of anything he wants, which Cryptograf says is the chief's daughter, Abba. Since the chief has no son, this would put Olaf in line to be the next chief (with Cryptograf calling the shots, of course).Justforkix is captured by Olaf, and Asterix and Obelix must go to retrieve him before the next full moon when his father, Doublehelix, is expected at their village. Asterix and Obelix arrive on Iceland shortly after the Vikings, but they can't rescue Justforkix. He doesn't want to leave because he considers the Vikings (especially Abba) to be his friends. After our heroes' retreat, the Vikings decide to test Justforkix's flying skills by throwing him off a cliff. Cryptograf secretly rigs up a rope to Justforkix allowing him to be suspended in the foggy air, convincing the Vikings that he really can fly.The Vikings rush off to the wedding ceremony leaving the Champion of Fear dangling, and Asterix and Obelix return just in time to rescue him before the rope breaks. On the way to Gaul, Justforkix sneaks some magic potion from Asterix and swims back to stop the wedding and rescue Abba. Later, he discovers that he really can fly as he rescues Abba from another precarious spot using a hang glider improvised from a ship's mast and sail.Back in the Gaulish village, everyone gathers to celebrate the wedding of Justforkix and Abba, and the Vikings finally experience real fear when they hear a ballad sung by Cacofonix.", "output": "Question: What causes the Vikings to experience fear?, Answer: Ballad, Question: Why does Cryptograf say the enemies are always gone?, Answer: Because \"fear gives them wings\"., Question: What are the Vikings looking for?, Answer: Champion of Fear, Question: What is Cryptigraf's position?, Answer: Advisor to Viking chief, Question: When do the Vikings finally experience real fear?, Answer: When they hear a ballad sung by Cacofonix., Question: Who is Cryptograf?, Answer: An advisor to Viking chief Timandahaf., Question: What does SMS mean?, Answer: Shortmessageservix, Question: What does the chief say he'll give to whoever can bring him this Champion of Fear?, Answer: Anything!, Question: How do the Vikings test Justforkix's flying skills?, Answer: Throw him off a cliff, Question: Who is the chief of the Gaul village?, Answer: Vitalstatistix", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

THIS APPEARS IN ONE OF THE MOVIE SPOILER WEBSITES AND IS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE CALLED 'John C'. ITS SO DESCRIPTIVE AND FANTASTIC THAT I DECIDED TO SHARE IT WITH OTHER IMDB USERS. THE TEXT HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED IN ANY WAY AND APPEARS EXACTLY AS WRITTEN BY THE ORIGINAL WRITER.********************************************************************************************************************************************************The movie begins with David Drayton (Thomas Jane), the main character, hand painting a movie poster for an upcoming film. A collection of his other original works, including a poster of The Thing can be seen in his studio. That night, a massive storm strikes Bridgton, Maine, the setting of the story, and his house loses power and a tree smashes through his studio window, ruining his latest painting. The next morning David, his eight-year-old son Billy (Nathan Gamble), and wife Steff (Kelly Collins Lintz) are cleaning up debris and assessing damage from the storm. Outside, the family notices a thick mist approaching from off the nearby lake. In the storm, the Drayton family boathouse has been crush by a fallen tree from their neighbors house. They go to the neighbor, Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), who is a lawyer, to exchange insurance information about the boathouse. David notices that Brent's Mercedes convertible has been smashed by a falling tree. Brent asks David if he will be driving into town to pick up food and supplies and if he could get a ride seeing as the storm claimed his car. David says yes and David, Billy, and Brent drive to town in David's SUV for the grocery store. David's wife, Steff, remains behind at the house. While driving to the supermarket they view several electric company trucks heading in the other direction, and oddly, several dozen military vehicles heading to the military base. David says to Brent if he's ever heard of all the crazy conspiracy stories about the military base and project arrowhead. Brent just laughs.Upon arriving at the supermarket they find the store to be packed with people also stocking up on supplies. Three military men in the store are on leave. The soldiers are approached by a Military Policeman (Eric Kelly McFarland) to return to base and they their leave has been suspended and they have thirty minutes to finish shopping. After a minute elapses from the time David, Billy and Brent enter the store, a man, Jeff Miller, a local townsperson, flies into the market, bloodied and frantic. The man immediately begins screaming about something hidden in the mist that is attacking and killing people. Everyone looks outside, and the mist has now completely surrounded the grocery store and nothing can be seen outside of the store but white smoke. Several people flee the store immediately and screams are heard shortly after coming from outside. Jeff tells everyone to seal the doorway to the store and to remain inside. However, there is a lady (Melissa Suzanne McBride) who worries that she's left her two young children on their own at home. She wants to leave the supermarket to go home to check on them, and asks everybody to volunteer to accompany her. Nobody volunteers, so she leaves the supermarket on her own.David meanwhile realizes already that they will be spending the next several hours, if not days in the store, and goes to the back of the store to check the generator. In the backroom of the store where the generator is, the loading dock, he hears something outside of the large loading dock door. Eventually the thing, the creature, starts pressing heavily into the door and he runs back into the main store. He tells three men a young male worker what he heard through the door and they dont believe him. David also tells him that the generator is smoking and might not work for that much long if it is not fixed. The five of them go back to the loading dock in the back of the store to fix the generator.They conclude that the generators exhaust system is clogged outside and that someone must physically remove wha'ts unclogging the generator. A young bagboy of the grocery store, Norm (Chris Owen), volunteers to go outside. David warns and pleads for no one to go outside. Norm and the other men ignore the warnings and open the large loading dock garage door. Upon opening the door the mist has become incredibly thick and begins slowly entering the loading dock. Before anyone can react, a large tentacle snags Norms leg and pulls him under the door. He grabs the door and David pulls him back into the loading dock. Unfortunately several more tentacles follow Norm back into the loading dock and begin ripping flesh from his body. Bloodied and terrified Norm is dragged outside into the mist. David quickly grabs an axe and manages to chop off the end of one of the tentacles. They close the loading dock doorway. The mist concealed what the tentacles were connected to. The generator is still clogged.The men are in shock and go back into the grocery to tell Brent what they've discovered, and to ask him if he has any idea what to do. Brent however lashes out at them, believing they are playing a joke on him by saying that monsters are dwelling in the mist. Brent believes that some of the townspeople are setting him up for a prank, a joke, and that no monsters exist. Brent says that he knows it's just a storm and that trying to joke about monsters is not going to work on him. He says that the men are trying to prank him because he was the lawyer who represented people who sued this grocery store and lost. David and the men though show Brent and several others the piece of tentacle that David had severed from the monster. Brent has already made up his mind though, and he says that it proves nothing and that the mist is nothing more than part of a storm.Brent organizes a group of people to leave the store to drive and find help, reassuring them that nothing is going to happen if they leave the store into the mist. One man says that when Brent and his group leave, he will go to the parking lot and retrieve a shotgun from another mans car who is to afraid to retrieve the gun himself, and he will bring the gun back into the store. David asks the man to tie a 300 foot rope around his waist, so that the people in the store will know that he made it at least as far as the rope goes. Brent and his group leave first. The man with the rope leaves right behind them. After a minute of silence, waiting for the man to come back with the shotgun, his rope begins pulling rapidly out of the store. David and several others try to hang on but suffer rope burn. Finally the rope stops pulling and David and the other pull on the rope. Eventually the rope starts coming back into the store red, covered in fresh dripping blood, and everyone in the store begins crying and screaming. The lower, severed half, of the mans body is still attached to the end of the rope. They decide not to pull the torso in and let it rest in front of the store. The remaining people assume that Brent and his group have also died and they realize the only way to survive is barricade everything in front of the storefront. One of the store supervisors observes the entire front of the store is large glass windows. The supervisor, Ollie Weeks (Toby Jones), organizes all of the dog food and fertilizer to be stacked up. The wall is only five feet tall and the remaining three feet of glass is exposed.Since the moment that they've been trapped in the store, the people have been split into two groups. One groups follows David and Ollie, and believe that the group must barricade the doorway and survive until help comes. The second group however listens to a deeply religious woman, Ms. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), who believes that God has sent down his plagues and wraths upon their town and the world for their sins. Ms. Carmody slowly convinces many people that God is angry at the sins of the world and has seen down monsters and demons in the mist to claim all those are not worthy of salvation. She cries out that she's a righteous follower of God and that anyone who wanted to be saved should listen to her words and scripture. David and several others are convinced that this is not a biblical problem and that it can be rationally solved.Both groups don't have a chance to argue that night though, as giant, two feet long insects begin landing on the windows of the stores front. The insects though are not the problem; its the giant six feet pterodactyl like predator birds that are now crashing into the windows that are alarming. The birds are killing the insects, but whenever a bird crashes into an insect resting on a window the windows crack further. Eventually a bird shatters a window cleanly, allowing several insects to fly through the window. The insects attack and kill only a young girl, who is a worker of the grocery store and also a love interest of one of the military personnel, Private Jessup (Sam Witwer). The people use shovels, rakes, and sticks to beat and kill the insects, but two large bird creatures also enter the store. The first bird kills a man immediately upon entering the store and is in turn killed by being set on fire. The other bird is shot by Ollie who wields a six shooter pistol. The fire used to kill the bird though also severely burns a man. He is burned so badly that he says that the pain is unbearable, and begs to be killed so end his suffering. David and those watching the burn victim tell him to hang on a little longer.David and his group set out to outside go to a nearby pharmacy in the shopping plaza to retrieve burn medicine, antibiotics, and painkillers for the burn victim. Jessup sees the group leaving the store and volunteers also. On the mission they encounter the Military Policeman who ordered the three military soldiers on leave to return to duty. The MP has been strung up in a spiders web and has large pulsing sores covering his body. Coughing and stuttering, he says that everything is our fault and that the military is responsible. The sores on his body then open up to reveal live spiders growing inside of them. David and his group see the source of the smaller spiders, several large three feet long spiders and begin to retreat back to the grocery store. In the retreat they lose two people to the spiders. The large spiders have claws and fangs, but also shoot acidic webbing. One man dies from the webbing burning through his jeans and flesh, eventually bleeding to death. The other victim is surrounded and attacked by spiders and killed.David and his group make it back to the store ask the soldier who came with them on the mission what the MP meant by it being the military's fault. The soldier says his two other soldiers who are in the store can explain it better, but the group discovers that the two other soldiers have committed suicide by hanging themselves in the loading docks. The remaining soldier says that all he knows was that scientists had found a way to open up doorways to other worlds and dimensions and they called it Project Arrowhead. This is all revealed to the remaining survivors in the store. Ms. Carmody says that the doorway was hell and that now we are paying for the soldiers' mistakes. She demands that the remaining soldier be sacrificed for his sins, for bringing these monster here. She says that God demands his blood. The soldier pleads that he was just a lowly solider and the scientists were the ones who did all of the experimenting. Ms. Carmody exclaims that we have tampered with God's power, we have split God's atoms, used God's stem cells and allowed abortions and now those responsible must suffer. One of the men who has sided with her, lunges and stabs the soldier three times in the stomach. To David and his groups horror, the soldier is tossed through the front door to the outside. Bleeding and alive, he begs to be let back inside. A gigantic monster approaches the store and grabs the soldier and kills him. The monster leaves and Ms. Carmody says that the monster has been appeased tonight, but more people must be offered up eventually.Ms. Carmody's biblical ramblings become more fervent and frequent. She starts talking commandingly about a human sacrifice. David assembles several people, to accompany him, because he intends to break out of the store and see if he can drive through the mist and find a place where the mist is not there. David, his son, Ollie, and six others agree that in a couple nights they will leave after stockpiling food and supplies under the radar of Ms. Carmody and her group. The night of the departure Ms. Carmody catches them before they can leave and assembles everyone else in the store to prevent them from leaving. David tells her to move but she counters by saying that not only can David not leave the store, but that David's son Billy, must be the next sacrifice. David and Ollie are approached by several men armed with knives. Ollie doesn't hesitate though and opens fire on Ms. Carmody with his pistol. He shoots her in the stomach, stunning her followers, and then he executes her with a bullet to the forehead, completely horrifying them and causing them and back off. Ollie points the gun at the knife-wielding men, causing them to retreat, and motions for David and the group to make a break for it. On their way out, a furious woman, who was a very ardent follower and appeared to have had a very close friendship with Mrs. Carmody, screams at Ollie, calling him a murderer, and approaches the group, intent on killing Billy herself in order to avenge Mrs. Carmody, but runs off in terror when Ollie points the gun at her.David and the group get outside and run for David's SUV. One of the men falls and is helped by two other men. Two of them are attacked and killed by spiders and the other runs back to the market and is welcomed inside. Ollie reaches the SUV first but is killed by the giant creature that killed the soldier from before. David, his son Billy, a woman, the original man who warned of the creatures in the mist, and an older woman, eventually make it into the SUV. David, before driving away sees the gun that Ollie dropped, and grabs it off the hood of his car while a giant spider climbs on the car. David starts the car and drives by the front of the store while the survivors that followed Ms. Carmody, who have now snapped back to reality and realize what they had done, watch him drive by.David, his son, and the three others drive through the mist for hours looking for help or a sign of clear until the SUV runs out of gas. On the ride they first stop at David's house where he sees his wife's dead body in a spiders web. On the main roads they see tons of cars that have been overturned, a school bus full of webbed children, and tons of debris and roadside damage. While driving, they also encounter the largest creature in the film, a massive six legged monster covered in thousands of smaller creatures and tentacles that is the size of several large buildings, and is so high that only its legs can be seen as its head is well above the trees. With the SUV out of gas they pull over. They have not been able to drive out of the mist. With Billy asleep, David pulls out the gun and nods with silent agreement with the other members of the group. David says that there are only four bullets, not enough to kill all of them, and David will stay alive and let the creatures kill him saying that he will figure something out.Four gunshots are heard and four flashes of light are emitted from the car. David exits the car screaming for the monsters to come get him. He has shot and killed his eight-year-old son, and the three other survivors, and is now waiting for his own death. A large rumbling noise emerges in the distance, something is approaching David. Screaming and begging to die, a monster does not reveal itself in the mist. Instead it is a U.S. military tank. In fact, it is a full military battalion. Tanks, soldiers with flame throwers and rifles, and truckloads of survivors are now traveling on the road. Some of the survivors are from the grocery store and one of them is the one woman who left by herself, who is completely unscathed and has her two children with her. Realizing that he just murdered his son and three innocent people only moments before they would have been rescued and that they should have never left the market in the first place, David collapses and two soldiers approach him unaware of what David has just done.Credits then roll.", "output": "Question: When the mist receded, what did David see?, Answer: U.S. Army has arrived, Question: What does Mrs. Carmody attempts to do with David and his group?, Answer: Mrs. Carmody stops them, Question: Who now contains most of the survivors?, Answer: Mrs. Carmody's faction, Question: what are breaking the glass and and fighting inside the store?, Answer: Birds, Question: Where are two people are killed by giant spiders?, Answer: Myron and Ambrose, Question: Who did David find dead in his destroyed house?, Answer: his wife Stephanie dead., Question: who runs in warning of danger, a thick mist envelopes the store, accompanied by earthquake-like tremors and the town's tornado siren?, Answer: Jeff Miller, Question: How many legs did the giant tentacled beast have?, Answer: six-legged, Question: who stats preaching?, Answer: Ms. Carmody., Question: Who discovers David and a handful of other survivors?, Answer: Mrs. Carmody, Question: Who is named by Norm?, Answer: Chris Owen, Question: who leaves his wife Stephanie ?, Answer: David Drayton, Question: What is the name of Women?, Answer: Ms. Carmody, Question: Who attempt to look into other dimensions?, Answer: Arrowhead Project", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Here we get the first display of Pai Mei's mastery of internal kung-fu techniques that allow him to retract his privates into his groin. After using his body protection techniques to ward off a clawing attack to the face, he traps a kick to the groin from Master Zhishan and delivers his own coup de gr\u00c3\u00a2ce.Master Zhishan's vision blurs as the scene changes to a more realistic scene of the aftermath of the temple's destruction. Pai Mei's prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9, area governor Kao Tsin-chung (Kong Do) and his army, chase the fleeing ex-students of Shao Lin. Tung Chin-chin, (Gordon Liu) after watching waves of other students fall to the pursuing army's arrows, makes a heroic last stand to divert their attention. He falls to a hail of arrows, crushing the throats of the soldiers he is closest to. It is left to Hung Hsi-Kuan to lead the remaining students to safety.They join an itinerant opera group which travels from town to town on iconic red junks as a front for anti-Qing forces. Along the way he encounters the comely Ying Chun, herself a master of the Crane style. Together, they have a son, whom both of them train. When area governor and student of Pai Mei, orders the destruction of the red junks, the couple retreat to a modest home where they raise their son (Wen-Ding) and Hong begins mastering the Tiger style of kung fu in preparation for challenging Pai Mei. In the meantime, Wen-Ding seems to develop a taste for piggybacking on his father after training sessions...After a decade of training, Hsi-Kuan goes to face Pai Mei, defeating several of his henchmen before retreating from his temple stronghold. Along the way, he discovers Pai Mei's weakness: he's vulnerable between one and three o' clock. Hung trains with renewed zeal on a sophisticated life-size bronze dummy fitted with grooves representing acupuncture meridians along its surface. By releasing a vessel in the head, metal balls cascade along these grooves so that he can snatch them to train his speed and accuracy. Still, he refuses to integrate his wife's Crane style, to his ultimate detriment.In the final act, Hung goes to confront Pai Mei at his temple once again. He uses his training in vital point striking to catch Pai Mei off-guard. But again, he gets his foot trapped in Pai Mei's groin. Pai Mei tells Hung that he moves his vulnerable point up and down at will. After incapacitating Hung, Pai Mei tells the governor to keep him alive, only for Hung to kill the governor as he comes near. Pai Mei kills him with a swift but powerful blow.Wen-Ding returns to avenge his father's death having been forced to synthesize his father's Tiger style with the crane style his mother taught him. Once again, he too lands in battle with Pai Mei, getting his foot trapped in Pai Mei's groin. But when Pai Mei goes to break Wen-Ding's leg, he jumps on Pai Mei's shoulders piggyback-style. Wen-Ding rips off Pai Mei's topknot, smashes him on the now unprotected crown of his head and, as his eyes are startled open, blinds him with a brutal dual jab in the eyes. They both tumble down the temple steps as the ending explains, \"A combination of Tiger and Crane styles is what finally defeated Pai Mei.\"", "output": "Question: Which style did Hsi-Kuan refuse to integrate with his ultimate detriment?, Answer: His wife's Crane style., Question: What style of fighting did Wen-Ding's father teach him?, Answer: Tiger., Question: Who is killed by a hail of arrows?, Answer: Tung Chin-chin, Question: Who does Pai Mei fight?, Answer: A master of the Shaolin temple., Question: who tells Hung that he moves his vulnerable point up and down at will?, Answer: Pai Mei, Question: What style of kung fu is Ying Chun a master of?, Answer: the crane style, Question: Who tells the governor to keep him alive?, Answer: Pai Mei, Question: Who is left to lead the students to safety?, Answer: Hung Hsi-Kuan, Question: What is the name of the couples son?, Answer: Wen-Ding, Question: Which weakness of Mei did Hsi-Kuan discover?, Answer: He's vulnerable between one and three o' clock., Question: Who does Wen-Ding defeat?, Answer: Pai Mei., Question: Where do Pai Mei and master of the Shaolin temple fight?, Answer: In an empty red backdrop, Question: Who taught Wen-Ding the crane style?, Answer: His mother., Question: Who is Hong preparing to challenge?, Answer: Pai Mei", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Mac also makes sure to keep Gin's romantic advances at bay, unsure if she is a true partner in crime or an ambitious career woman on a mission.After they have stolen the mask, Mac accuses Gin of planning to sell the mask to a buyer in Kuala Lumpur and then turn him in. Gin convinces him that her insurance agency job is the real cover and that she has planned an even bigger heist in Kuala Lumpur: $8 billion from the \"International Clearance Bank\" in the North Tower of the Petronas Towers. During their set-up, Cruz and his team (with the guidance of the stealthy Thibadeaux) track down Gin and confirm that she is still on mission to bring Mac in. Despite the presence of Cruz and other security watching the building, the theft takes place in the final seconds of the new 2000 millennium countdown. Gin pulls the plug on her laptop prematurely and sets off alarms. They narrowly escape the computer vault and are forced to cross the lights hung from the bottom of the bridge linking the two towers. Following a death-defying escape when the cable breaks, Gin and Mac make their way to a ventilation shaft, where Mac explains \"Plan B.\" Using mini-parachutes, they were going to escape down the shaft. Gin has lost her parachute earlier in the escape, so Mac gives her his. He tells her to meet him the next morning at the Pudu train station.Gin arrives at the station waiting for Mac. He shows up late with Aaron Thibadeaux, who reveals himself with fellow FBI agents. He explains that Cruz is here and that the FBI has been looking for her for some time. Two years ago when Agent Thibadeaux caught and arrested him, Mac made a deal to help the FBI arrest Gin, as she was the primary target all along. However, the aging thief has another plan: to help her escape. Mac slips Gin a gun and quietly explains that he returned only seven of the eight billion dollars they had stolen electronically in the heist. Gin then pretends to hold Mac hostage at gunpoint, threatening to shoot him if the agents follow her. She boards a train and the FBI heads to the next station. Gin jumps trains mid-station and arrives back at Pudu. She tells Mac that she needs him for another job and they both board a train.The Petronas Twin Towers, where the final heist takes place", "output": "Question: What does Gin plan to steal in Kuala Lumpur?, Answer: $8 billion, Question: What is the name of Gin's boss?, Answer: Hector Cruz, Question: What does Virginia tell MacDougal she will help him steal?, Answer: priceless Chinese mask, Question: Where is Mac's hideout?, Answer: isolated castle, Question: What time the next morning do Gin and Mac agree to meet at the train station?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who is Gin sent to investigate?, Answer: Robert \"Mac\" MacDougal, Question: What does Gin promise to help Mac steal?, Answer: a priceless Chinese mask from the well-guarded Bedford Palace., Question: Where do Gin and Mac travel to?, Answer: The Petronas Twin Towers, Question: What did Gin lose in the escape?, Answer: her parachute, Question: What is Virginia Baker's occupation?, Answer: investigator", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the opening credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice.A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers in a bay area of San Diego, in a parody of 'Jaws').While the President's press secretary, Jim Richardson, tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a Euro-American man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, an African-American disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Euro-American Navy diver Greg Colburn; Central-Russo Russian Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and Euro-American parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter.Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \"pass the ketchup\". Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason.Meanwhile, the president sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency \"Mind Makers,\" where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys including a bumper sticker with \"STP\" for \"Stop Tomato Program\" on it, a satirical reference to the real \"whip inflation now\" campaign and its widely ridiculed \"WIN\" slogan. It is revealed that a human is also plotting to stop Dixon when a masked assassin attempts to shoot him, but misses.A senate subcommittee meeting is held where one secret pamphlet is leaked to a newspaper editor who sends reporter Lois Fairchild on the story. While she tails Finletter, he mistakes her for a spy and trashes a hotel room attempting to kill her. He then chases the assassin as the masked man fails again to kill Dixon, but loses him.Gretta is killed and further regression has led leaders to bring in tanks and soldiers to the west coast in a battle that leaves the American forces in shambles. Dixon, walking among the rubble, sees a trail of tomato juice and decides to investigate. He ends up being chased by a killer tomato to an apartment where an oblivious child is listening to the radio. The tomato is about to kill Dixon but suddenly flies out the window. Dixon peers out to see if it has died when he spots the assassin hijacking his car. He chases the assassin on foot until he is knocked out when it is revealed that Richardson is behind the tomatoes. He is about to reveal his secret of control when Finletter charges in and runs him through. Dixon, picking up some strewn records, realizes that both times the tomatoes left him the new hit song \"Puberty Love\" had been on the radio. He orders Finletter to gather all remaining people and bring them to the stadium, which is soon attacked by the tomatoes.The tomatoes are cornered in a stadium. \"Puberty Love\" is played over the loudspeaker, causing the tomatoes to shrink and allowing the various people at the stadium to squash them by stomping on them repeatedly. Fairchild, meanwhile, is cornered by a giant tomato wearing earmuffs. Dixon saves her by showing the tomato the sheet music to \"Puberty Love.\" He professes his love to her, in song.

It begins with Carl Willat[5] (Michael Kramer) and his friends, Richie White (Matt Dillon), Claude Zachary (Tom Fergus), and Johnny (Tiger Thompson) hanging out at \"the Rec\" (Recreation Center), which is the only place in the community where young people can spend time and be supervised by Rec counselor Julia (Julia Pomeroy).From an overpass, Mark Perry (Vincent Spano) and his friend shoot a BB hole in the windshield of a passing patrol car and flee on their bikes. They pass Carl and Richie and tell them to hide. Sgt. Ed Doberman (Harry Northup) arrives shortly, pulls them from their hiding place and finds a pocket knife on Richie. He takes them in and calls Carl's father Fred (Andy Romano) to pick up his son.Carl's father is a local businessman. Before getting Doberman's call, he is talking to Homeowners Association president Jerry Cole (Richard Jamison) about getting wealthy landowner Mr. Sloan (Lane Smith) to buy land across the street from the Rec and build an industrial park instead of the planned twin cinema and roller rink, to the loss of the local kids. Doberman questions the defiant Richie and Carl about the BB gun. Richie is then taken out of the room while Doberman lectures Carl and warns him that he could end up at \"the Hill\", a juvenile detention facility.The next day at school, Claude announces that he took drugs to prepare for an upcoming test and has a bad reaction. Afterward, the students are assembled in the school's cafeteria for a presentation about the recent shooting of the police car, where Carl exchanges smiles with Cory (Pamela Ludwig). That evening, Carl asks his father about the land across from the Rec, and his father tells him about the proposed industrial park. An apoplectic Carl storms out to join friends at the Rec.The kids have brought drugs to the Rec's playground, where Claude buys a gram of hash from Tip (Eric Lalich). An announcement about a party at a nearby house causes the group to migrate there. Carl sees Mark making out with Cory on a couch. Mark threatens Carl not to mention his name to the cops. Carl then tells Cory that she could do a lot better than Mark and leaves, unknowingly followed by Mark and his friend who, after Doberman arrives in his patrol car to bust the party, beat up Carl as he is walking home alone. Carl stumbles home but is unable to sneak past his parents, who interrupt their meeting with Jerry Cole to grill the boy. After Carl goes upstairs, Jerry suggests to Fred that the Rec should be closed the next day so that the kids won't be making trouble when Mr. Sloan and his people come to visit.The next day at the Rec, Doberman arrives and Julia talks to him about keeping the Rec open, but over Julia's objections, he comes inside, finds drugs on Claude and takes him into custody. They emerge from the Rec among rowdy teens to find Richie standing defiantly on the roof of the patrol car. After a brief foot chase, Richie gets away.Richie and Carl come upon Cory and her friend, who have just emerged from a house with a stolen pistol. They all go to a half-finished town home that Carl and Richie call their condo. They plan a 'picnic with a gun' for the next day. On the way home, Carl sees Mr. Sloan's car at his house and plants firecrackers under the hood. The firecrackers go off as the men are leaving, and Mr. Sloan is scared away from buying land in New Granada.At the picnic the next day, the kids take turns shooting the pistol until the ammo is gone. Later, Claude tells Carl that it was Tip who sold him the hash, and Cory announces that Tip had recently gotten busted. They decide to pay Tip a visit and interrogate him. Tip admits he told the police whom he sold the hash to. The group throws Tip into the adjacent pond while Tip's mother watches. Cory gives Carl a kiss, showing him that she likes him. When Carl gets home, his mother Sandra (Ellen Geer) tells him that he is forbidden to see his friends and that the Rec will be closed. Carl gets in a fight with his father.In school the next day, Carl overhears Tip's mother revealing the names of the boys who assaulted her son. Carl grabs Richie and they run to Richie's house, where Richie grabs the pistol and the keys to his mom's Bronco. As they leave town, Doberman chases them. They flip the Bronco and flee the scene in opposite directions. Doberman chases Richie and fires a warning shot. Richie points his unloaded pistol at him and Doberman fires and kills Richie. Carl runs away to 'his' condo. Cory meets him there and they spend the night together. After Cory leaves in the morning, Carl goes home to grab money, and along the way he sees Mark riding his dirt bike. He takes Mark's BB gun and shoots him in the shoulder, which causes him to crash his bike. Mark sits down with Carl and they decide their fight was stupid and they should team up instead.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (April 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)An early morning test explosion of the first atomic plutonium bomb is planned at a military site in Desert Rock, Nevada. When the chain reaction for the charge fails its cycle and does not detonate as expected, Lt. Col. Glenn Manning (Glenn Langan) receives orders to keep his men in the protective trench, as an explosion is still imminent, but its timing is now unknown. Moments later, an unidentified small civilian aircraft crash-lands near the bomb site, and Glenn leaps from the trench and runs into the detonation area to rescue the pilot. Once in the detonation area, the bomb goes off, and Glenn is caught in an atomic blast that burns him and immediately disintegrates his clothes and hair.Surviving the blast\u00e2\u0080\u0094but suffering from third-degree burns over almost his entire body\u00e2\u0080\u0094Manning is treated by specialist Dr. Paul Linstrom (William Hudson) and military scientist Dr. Eric Coulter (Larry Thor) at the base hospital. Glenn's fianc\u00c3\u00a9e Carol Forrest (Cathy Downs), who was supposed to have been married to him that very night in Las Vegas), anxiously awaits a prognosis...but Linstrom refrains from telling her that the consensus is that Glenn will not survive.The next morning, however, Linstrom and Coulter are stunned to discover that Glenn's burns have completely healed, without so much as scarring. They are concerned over the incredible recuperation and begin analyzing the details of Glenn's unusual case. That same evening, Forrest is upset when Glenn's security officer informs her that she is prohibited from seeing Glenn again, and she later learns that he has been moved out of the hospital to another facility, an army rehabilitation and research center in Summit, Nevada. Forrest drives out and is admitted entry, and after overhearing Linstrom and Coulter discussing Glenn's case, Carol lets herself into Glenn's room. She faints in horror when she sees him lying on a large pad on the floor\u00e2\u0080\u0094mutated into a giant about 16 feet tall.Later, Linstrom tells Carol that it is believed that Glenn's exposure to the plutonium blast has caused his old cells to stop dying and his new cells to multiply at an accelerated rate, resulting in his growing proportionately 8 feet in height a day. Linstrom admits that he and Coulter do not know if they can stop Glenn's growth, and that if they don't, he will continue to grow until he dies, but assures her that they will not stop their research.The following day, Glenn awakens after unsettling dreams of his past with Carol, his time in the Korean War, and the night he was injured in the plutonium blast. Upon realizing his massive size, Glenn is at first frightened, then deeply disturbed. Carol sees him the next morning to comfort him, but he, now over 22 feet tall, is distant and morose. While the public knows that Glenn survived the explosion, the military has kept the truth of his condition from the media.As Glenn's body continues to increase in size, Linstrom orders him moved to a tent large enough to provide shelter and recommends that Carol spend time with him; however, despite Carol's encouragement, Glenn is angry and bitter. Linstrom eventually reveals that Glenn's heart is growing at only half the rate of his body and soon will be unable to support his enormous size...and he will die in a matter of days. That night, Carol and Glenn argue over his continuing despair and pessimism.The following morning as Coulter reports to Linstrom that he may have found a solution to the phenomenal growth, Glenn has disappeared. Although two motorists come across him on Highway 93, the military, headed by Col. Hallock (James Seay), conducts a 10-mile-wide search for the now over 50-foot-tall Glenn, but with no results. When Carol asks Linstrom if she can help in their search for Glenn, he cautions her that Glenn's condition may be affecting his mind. Later, Coulter declares that he has created a special syringe filled with a serum for Glenn's bone marrow that will stop his growth. Hallock then briefs the military squads on their expanding search, which will also be conducted by air.Meanwhile, the local news relays that a \"giant man\" has been spotted approaching Las Vegas. As the military heads toward Las Vegas, Glenn\u00e2\u0080\u0094now over 60 feet tall and psychologically confused\u00e2\u0080\u0094is drawn to the Las Vegas strip. His appearance panics the local populace, as he breaks out a window in the Riviera Hotel while seeing a woman bathing inside and wreaks havoc on the Royal Nevada, the Silver Slipper, and the Tropicana. At the Sands hotel, he picks up a convertible and hurls it at the crowd, just before smashing the Sands' 56-foot neon sign. When the police become alarmed by Glenn's behavior, they disobey military orders and begin firing at him, thus enraging Glenn, who then moves toward Fremont Street and completely destroys the Pioneer Club's Vegas Vic sign and heads toward Boulder Dam as military helicopters track his movements.Linstrom, Carol and Coulter, who are also traveling by helicopter, attempt to intercept Hallock's troops. After landing at the dam, Coulter and Linstrom immediately take the enormous syringe and plunge it into Glenn's ankle. Glenn is startled, then outraged, and, removing the syringe, mercilessly spears Coulter with it. Glenn then picks up Carol and starts across the dam. Using a bullhorn to amplify his message, Linstrom pleads with Glenn to spare Carol, and although he is utterly disoriented, Glenn complies. When Glenn reaches the middle of the dam, Hallock orders his men to fire on him\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Glenn tumbles into the Colorado River to his apparent death.", "output": "Question: Who plays Dr. Eric Coulter ?, Answer: Larry Thor., Question: When Glenn headed for Boulder dam what tracked him?, Answer: Military Helicopters, Question: How tall is the giant?, Answer: 16 feet, Question: Where is Lt Col Glenn Manning asked to keep his men ?, Answer: Glen Manning is asked to keep his men in a protective trench, Question: Who sees dreams of his past with Carol?, Answer: Glenn, Question: What element was Glenn exposed to that might have caused his growth to eight feet?, Answer: Plutonium, Question: Who does Linstrom talk to about Glenn's growth and their research?, Answer: Carol, Question: What hotel did Glenn break a window out of?, Answer: Riviera, Question: Who create a special syringe with a serum?, Answer: Coulter, Question: Who sneaks into Glenn's room?, Answer: Alice, Question: Who plays Dr. Paul Linstrom ?, Answer: William Hudson., Question: How tall is Glenn?, Answer: 50 tall, Question: Where do coulter and Linstrom plunge the syringe into ?, Answer: They plunge the syringe into Glenn's ankle., Question: How does Glenn die ?, Answer: Glenn falls into the Colorado river and dies., Question: Who orders him moved to a tent large enough to provide shelter?, Answer: Linstrom, Question: What city did the news relay the \"giant man\" was approaching?, Answer: Las Vegas, Question: What does Linstrom use to amplify his message to Glenn?, Answer: He uses a bull horn to amplify his message to Glenn., Question: Who was injured in the plutonium blast?, Answer: Glenn, Question: Whose body continues to increase in size?, Answer: Glenn, Question: What happens to Glen Manning ?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who analyzes the details of Glenn's unsual case?, Answer: Linstrom and Coulter, Question: What is the location of the planned test explosion of the first atomic plutonium bomb ?, Answer: The location for the planned test is Desert Rock, Nevada., Question: Who disappear in the morning?, Answer: Glenn", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

That evening he falls asleep in his chair and his teaching career is related in flashback.When 25-year-old Charles Edward Chipping first arrives as a Latin teacher in 1870, he becomes a target of many practical jokes on his first day. He reacts by imposing strict discipline in his classroom, making him disliked but respected. 20 years pass, his relationship with his pupils improves and he becomes the senior master. He is disappointed in not receiving an appointment as a house master within the school for the following year. However, the new German teacher, Max Staefel (Paul Henreid), saves him from despair by inviting him to share a walking holiday to his native Austria.While mountain climbing, Chipping encounters Kathy Ellis (Greer Garson), a feisty English suffragette on a cycling holiday. They meet again in Vienna and dance to the Blue Danube Waltz. This piece of music is used as a leitmotif, symbolizing Chipping's love for her. Chipping remarks that the Danube appears blue, but only to those who are in love. On another part of the same boat, as Kathy looks at the river, she notices that it is blue. Even though Kathy is considerably younger and livelier than Chipping, she loves and marries him. They return to England, where Kathy takes up residence at the school, charming everyone with her warmth.During their tragically short marriage (she dies in childbirth, along with their baby), she brings \"Chips\" out of his shell and shows him how to be a better teacher. He acquires a flair for Latin puns. As the years pass, Chips becomes a much-loved school institution, developing a rapport with generations of pupils; he teaches the sons and grandsons of many of his earlier pupils.In 1909, when pressured to retire by a more \"modern\" headmaster, the boys and the board of governors of the school take his side of the argument and tell him he can stay until he is 100, and is free to pronounce Cicero as SIS-er-ro, and not as KEE-kir-ro.Chips finally retires in 1914 at age 69, but is summoned back to serve as interim headmaster because of the shortage of teachers resulting from the First World War. He remembers Kathy had predicted he would become headmaster one day. During a bombing attack by a German zeppelin, Chips insists that the boys keep on translating their Latin - choosing the story of Julius Caesar's battles against Germanic tribes, which describes the latter's belligerent nature, much to the amusement of his pupils. As the Great War drags on, Chips reads aloud into the school's Roll of Honour every Sunday the names of the many former boys and teachers who have died in battle. Upon finding out that Max Staefel has died fighting on the German side, Chips also reads out his name in chapel.He retires permanently in 1918. He is on his deathbed in 1933 when he overhears his friends talking about him. He responds, \"I thought you said it was a pity, a pity I never had children. But you're wrong. I have!

Initially, he sets strict rules for himself regarding whom he should follow and for how long, but he soon discards them as he focuses on a well-groomed, handsome man in a dark suit. The man in the suit, having noticed he is being followed, quickly confronts the Young Man and introduces himself as \"Cobb\". Cobb reveals that he is a serial burglar and invites the Young Man (who tells Cobb his name is \"Bill\") to accompany him on various burglaries. The material gains from these crimes seem to be of secondary importance to Cobb. He takes pleasure in rifling through the personal items in his targets' flats and drinking their wine. He explains that his true passion is using the shock of robbery and violation of property to make his victims re-examine their lives. He sums up his attitude thus: \"You take it away, and show them what they had.\"The Young Man is thrilled by Cobb's lifestyle. He attempts break-ins of his own, as Cobb encourages and guides him. At Cobb's suggestion, he alters his appearance, cutting his hair short and wearing a dark suit. He assumes the name \"Daniel Lloyd\" based on the credit card Cobb gives to him and begins to pursue a relationship with a blonde woman whose flat he and Cobb burgled. The Blonde turns out to be the girlfriend of a small-time gangster (known only as the \"Bald Guy\") whom she broke up with after he murdered a man in her flat. Soon, the Blonde confides that the Bald Guy is blackmailing her with incriminating photographs. The Young Man breaks into the Bald Guy's safe, but is caught in the act by an unidentified man. He then bludgeons the man with a claw hammer and flees with the Bald Guy's money and photos. Upon returning to his flat, he finds that the photos are innocuous modeling shots.Confronting the Blonde, the Young Man learns that she and Cobb have been working together to manipulate him into mimicking Cobb's burglary methods. She tells him that Cobb had recently discovered a murdered woman's body during one of his burglaries and is attempting to deflect suspicion from himself by making it appear as though multiple burglars share his MO.The Young Man leaves to turn himself in to the police. The Blonde reports her success to Cobb, who then reveals that he actually works for the Bald Guy. The story about the murdered woman was part of a plot to deceive both the Blonde and the Young Man: The Blonde has been blackmailing the Bald Guy with evidence from the murder he committed in her flat, and he wants her murdered in such a way that it cannot be connected to him. Cobb bludgeons the Blonde to death with the same claw hammer that the Young Man used during the burglary of the Bald Guy's safe and leaves it at the scene. The police, checking out the Young Man's story, find the Blonde murdered and the claw hammer with his fingerprints on it. The Young Man is thus implicated for the murder of the blonde woman.

It begins with his career as a General in Takshashila (modern-day Punjab) and ends with the bloody conquest of the Kalinga country (modern day Odisha State)Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, grandfather of Asoka, of the Maurya empire, has decided to embrace Jainism and abdicate the throne of the empire in favour of his son Bindusara. But his grandson, Prince Asoka, claims his sword. The old emperor explains that this sword is evil and the sword demands blood and destruction.A few years later, Prince Asoka Maurya (Shah Rukh Khan), now a brave youth, is battling the rebellious chief of Taxila for his Emperor and father. He figures that his elder half-brother Susima Maurya (Ajith Kumar), who also has an eye on the throne of the empire, has deliberately withheld reinforcements from arriving, but defeats the enemy nevertheless. Asoka returns to the capital victorious and confronts Susima. Later, Susima tries to assassinate Asoka while he is bathing. The fight among the princes makes the Emperor unhappy and he orders Empress Dharma (Subhashini Ali) to control her son Asoka. She compels Asoka to temporarily leave the capital to lead the life of a common man. The Prince is disappointed but leaves nonetheless.Asoka, alone and disguised as an ordinary traveller, rides to the south. In his travels, he meets a lovely maiden, Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor) and falls in love with her. He also develops a good relationship with her little brother Arya. They are on the run from the Kingdom of Kalinga along with their faithful protector Bheema (Rahul Dev) and are being chased by soldiers of the Kingdom. After saving their lives, Asoka introduces himself as Pawan, hiding his true identity. Kaurwaki and Arya are the Princess and Prince of Kalinga, who fled from their kingdom when the Prime Minister assassinated their parents and took over power. Later, Asoka and Kaurwaki get secretly married.Soon, Asoka is summoned by Emperor Bindusara to the capital. The Emperor dispatches Asoka to quell a rebellion in Ujjaini. Before marching to the west, Asoka travels to Kalinga to meet Kaurwaki and Arya. Unable to find them, and not knowing they have gone into hiding, he is informed by General Bheema that they were slaughtered. A heartbroken Asoka attempts suicide, but is saved by Virat (Danny Denzongpa), who later swears to protect him. Mad with grief and anger, Asoka leads a brutal crackdown in Ujjaini. The assassins sent by Susima injure Asoka in a battle and Virat saves him. He is taken to a Buddhist monastery at Vidisa to recover.There, he meets a Buddhist maiden, Devi (Hrishita Bhatt), who cares for him. Asoka also survives another assassination attempt at Vidisa, this time with the help of Devi. Asoka marries Devi and returns in splendour to Pataliputra. Susima and his brothers are wild with anger from their futile attempts to eliminate Asoka. Emperor Bindusara, who favoured Susima over Asoka, becomes ill and dies. In another vigilante attack, Queen Dharma is stabbed to death by assassins sent by Susima. Angered, Asoka kills Susima and is appointed emperor.A few months later, princess Kaurwaki and prince Arya return to Kalinga with Bheema and have the Prime Minister executed for treason. Asoka declares war on Kalinga, not knowing that Kaurwaki is alive. Kaurwaki still does not know that Asoka is Pawan, and both sides prepare for war.A terrible war is fought in Kalinga. The Maurya army inflicts a crushing defeat on Kalinga. Not content with mere victory, Maurya soldiers butcher everyone in sight. General Bheema is slain and Kaurwaki is wounded. Asoka later visits the battlefield, where he discovers his horse, who was supposed to be in Kaurwaki's possession. With a surge of hope, he frantically searches for Kaurwaki and finds her. They have a heart-to-heart talk and he apologises deeply for his actions. He is interrupted by Arya, who is dying after being pierced with arrows. With Arya dying in his arms, Asoka suddenly realises that his enemies, his family, and even Arya, are all dead because of him. His grandfather's warning about the sword had been correct.The film ends with Asoka throwing the sword into the water at the same spot as his grandfather, and embracing Buddhism.

Seen from the points of view of leaders such as Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Winfield Scott Hancock and Robert E. Lee, the film begins just after the attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861, and culminates with the battle of Chancellorsville in May of 1863. Directed by Ronald F. Maxwell, the film is an epic, dramatic prequel to \"Gettysburg,\" the classic 1993 film also directed by Maxwell.Gods and Generals is the second installment of the Michael/Jeff Shaara Civil War trilogy and the second to be filmed. The third and final installment, The Last Full Measure, was in pre-production but lost financing and has been suspended indefinitely. Congruent to the 1992 production of Gettysburg, Gods and Generals is of epic length with a final release running time of nearly four hours, having been trimmed from roughly six. The story opens just before the secession of Virgina and just after Lincoln had called for 75,000 troops to repel the rebellion. Robert E. Lee is offered and declines the command of Union forces. Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, an instructor at VMI during the secessionist takeover of the institute, commits himself to the defense of Virginia and is rapidly swept up in a leadership role of the fledgling Army of Northern Virginia. The story follows primarily from the perspective of Jackson, as well as other key figures on both sides, but is decidely emphatic of the Confederate POV. We follow Jackson through three early and decisive CSA victories; Manassas (1st Bull Run), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, the scene of his untimely death. The film diverges dramatically from the book version in that the battle of Antietam, a tactical CSA victory, is omitted entirely (it was however filmed but ultimately removed from the final print). Throughout these campaigns Jackson is portrayed as a deeply pious, stern, yet confident and capable commander. The story follows the decision makers, military and political, on both sides and how their actions influence the course of the war through May 1863. Gettysburg, based on Shaaras Killer Angels, picks up the saga from there.", "output": "Question: Is this historical novel based in a time period that is before or after the cliactic battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War?, Answer: Before, Question: Gods and Generals is what installment of the Michael/Jeff Shaara Civil War trilogy?, Answer: The second, Question: About how long is the movie \"Gods and Generals\"?, Answer: Nearly 4 hours, Question: The story Gods and generals is decidely emphatic of who?, Answer: The Confederate POV, Question: Is the movie \"Gods and Generals a sequel orprequel to \"Gettysburg,\" the classic 1993 film?, Answer: prequel, Question: Who is the director of the movie \"Gods and Generals\"?, Answer: Ronald F.

Shift Supervisor Jack Godell (Lemmon) notices an unusual vibration while grabbing his cup of coffee which he had set down. He then finds that a gauge is misreading and that the coolant is dangerously low (he thought it was overflowing). The crew manages to bring the reactor under control and can be seen celebrating and expressing relief.Richard surreptitiously films the incident, despite being requested to not film the control room for security purposes. Kimberly's superior at work (Donat) refuses to permit her to report what happened or show the film, disgusting Richard, who steals the footage. He shows it to experts, who conclude that the plant came perilously close to the China Syndrome in which the core would have melted down into the earth, hitting groundwater and contaminating the surrounding area with radioactive steam.During an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. Godell pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent denies his request and appears willing to let nothing stand in the way of the scheduled restart of the plant.Godell investigates further and finds that a series of radiographs supposedly taken to verify the integrity of welds on the leaking pump are identical - the contractor simply kept submitting the same picture. He believes that the plant is unsafe and could be severely damaged if another full-power SCRAM occurs. He tries to bring the evidence to plant manager Herman DeYoung (Brady), who brushes off Godell as paranoid and states that new radiographs would cost at least $20 million. Godell confronts D.B. Royce, an employee of Foster-Sullivan, the construction company who built the plant, as it was Royce who signed off on the welding radiographs. Godell threatens to go to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but Royce threatens him; and later a pair of goons from Foster-Sullivan parks outside his house.Kimberly also defies her bosses, determined to pursue the truth. She and Richard confront Godell at his home with what they know, and he voices his concern about the vibration he felt during the SCRAM and his anger about the false radiographs. Kimberly and Richard ask if he will testify at the NRC hearings, being held at Point Conception, where Foster-Sullivan is looking to build another nuclear plant. Godell agrees to obtain for them, through Hector, a set of the false radiographs to take to the hearings.Hector's car is run off the road and the radiographs are taken from him. Godell leaves for the hearings but is chased by the goons waiting outside his home. He escapes by taking refuge inside the plant.To his dismay, Godell finds that the reactor is being brought up to full power. He grabs a gun from a security guard and forces everyone out, including his friend and co-worker Ted Spindler (Brimley). Godell demands to be interviewed on live television by Kimberly. Plant management agrees to the interview, but only to buy time as they try to regain control of the plant.Minutes into the broadcast, plant technicians deliberately cause a SCRAM so they can retake the control room, despite Spindler's warnings of Godell's concerns about safety. Godell is distracted by the alarms as a SWAT team forces its way into the control room. The television cable is cut and a panicky Godell is shot by the police. Before dying, he feels the unusual vibration again. The resulting SCRAM is only brought under control by the plant's automatic systems. True to Godell's predictions, the plant suffers significant damage as the pump malfunctions.Plant officials try to paint Godell as emotionally disturbed. However, a distraught Spindler contradicts them when a question is posed to him on live television by Kimberly, saying that Godell was not crazy and would never have taken such drastic steps had there not been something wrong.

When he is supposed to give one of the snakes to his father, he hesitates, giving the snake enough time to bite his father's artery. His father dies in a matter of minutes.Twenty years later, in the movie's \"present day\", Les is still scared of snakes, and his older brother Duff teases him about it. To help him get over his phobia, Duff goes to a Native American snake proprietor, Screaming Hawk. While there, Hawk tells him about a small snake living inside a jar on his desk. The snake, called Unteka, is actually an ancient snake that grows at a massive rate and whose species had killed many of Hawk's tribe in the past. The tribe was finally able to kill all but one of them, and so Unteka is the last of his kind. Duff is given three rules regarding the snake: \"Don't let it out of the jar, don't let it eat anything living, and never fear the heart of the snake.\" Despite being told he cannot have Unteka, Duff steals the snake for his own. Once at home, Duff accidentally breaks the jar. Les sees the snake double in size almost instantly, but Duff doesn't believe his brother when he tells him the horrific tale. That night, while Duff is sleeping, the snake eats the pet cat. The snake is now grown to almost 20 times its original size. It sneaks out into the chicken coop, killing all but one chicken, which the snake soon finishes off. When Les' mother hears the commotion, she goes outside to see what's going on, only to meet the same fate. Duff becomes scared that the legend is true and decides to ask some snake killers on how to deal with his situation. They say that if the snake hasn't yet reached full size, he could kill it by stabbing it in the head. He does so and seems to have killed the snake. The following night, however, the snake awakens and kills and eats both him and the family dog.Les returns home after a long night of drinking, only to find the place ransacked. He calls his girlfriend, Erin, who is a police officer, as well as her ex-boyfriend, Bo, the chief of police. When Les says that he just knows that his family is dead, Bo becomes suspicious that he might be the killer and arrests him. Unteka then attacks a vacationing family in the woods, killing and eating them. Erin starts to believe Les' story, but Bo still doesn't. Erin heads deeper into the woods and finds a giant snake-skin, signifying that the creature is still growing. She helps Les escape and they head over to Screaming Hawk to try to find out more about Unteka. Bo and his team finally head out to kill the snake. The enormous creature jumps at them; only Bo is able to escape. Before he dies, he comes to the homes of the snake catchers that Duff talked to earlier. They try to kill the beast, but they both end up getting killed.Meanwhile, Les, Erin, and Screaming Hawk all try to find the snake and kill it. Unteka, who is now 70 feet (21\u00c2\u00a0m) long, heads to the county fair, where Feedback is making a guest appearance. The snake kills a young couple and three stoned men before making its way inside. Unteka then kills multiple people including Fay (Les' paramedic partner). Feedback is able to hold the snake off long enough to save some people before fleeing himself. On the way into the park, the trio sees a little girl trapped in a ride. Erin is able to save her but ends up being eaten herself. Just then, Erin calls Les over walkie-talkie. They head into a haunted roller coaster ride to save Erin before she is digested. Looking around for the snake, Les looks behind Hawk. Hawk, seeing the shock on Les' face, quickly turns around and tries to stab the snake, but Unteka tosses him aside, injuring him. Les is left to kill Unteka. He allows himself to get eaten whole. The snake looks at Hawk while moving slowly towards him. Just as he is about to be eaten, the snake lets out a screaming roar of pain, moves around banging its head against the wall, and then falls to the floor dead. Les cuts a hole out of the snake's chest and, holding its heart, tells Hawk to help pull out Erin. She embraces and kisses Les and walks out of the haunted roller coaster with Hawk holding the heart of the snake.Within a few months, Les and Erin get married and have their first child, and Les has gotten over his fear of snakes.", "output": "Question: What are the rules Les has to follow?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What was Lea's brother's name?, Answer: Duff, Question: When does Les understands the never fear the heart part,?, Answer: When he is eaten by the snake.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

At the beginning of summer vacation, he is asked by Natsuki, one of the most popular girls in his school, to help in celebrating her great-grandmother's 90th birthday. Although Kenji does not know the details of the plan, he agrees and goes with Natsuki to her grandmother's estate in Ueda, Nagano Prefecture. Much to Kenji's surprise, he is introduced at the Shinohara family house as Natsuki's fianc\u00e9.As Kenji tries to act the part, meets over a dozen of Natsuki's relatives, and deals with Natsuki's \"first love\" crush on her uncle Wabisuke Jinnouchi, he receives a mysterious e-mail with a mathematics code. He cracks the code and returns it to the sender but finds himself at the center of a developing news story the following day. Overnight, OZ has been hacked and he is the prime suspect. Using Kenji's account and avatar, the real \"hacker\", which is actually the advanced artificial intelligence system Love Machine, wreaks havoc on the virtual world of Oz which is affecting the real world that is deeply ingrained into Oz' system. With car navigation systems disabled and computer systems malfunctioning, Japan grinds to a halt. With his math skills Kenji is able to crack the passcode and returns control of Oz back to the moderators and Oz' engineers. Meanwhile Natsuki's great-grandmother, Sakae Jinnouchi, uses the level of influence she's created in her 90 years of life and calls various people in important positions in Japan's society and her family who work in various emergency services. She encourages them all to work their hardest, to see through this troubling time of turmoil, reducing the potential chaos and damage that could have occurred. But her actions do not go unnoticed by Love Machine, which leads to an unfortunate tragedy for the Shinohara clan. Although no longer controlling Oz itself, Love Machine continued to steal user accounts, numbering over 10 million at the time, with one being linked to a heart monitoring system for Natsuki's great grandmother. This causes delayed care and ultimately her death when her heart fails her in her sleep. In order to prevent similar incidents and get revenge, Kenji enlists the help of fellow mod and best friend Takashi Sakuma, Natsuki's cousin Kazuma Ikezawa (who is the legendary Oz fighter King Kazma), and the rest of the Shinohara family to defeat Love Machine.After escaping from a trap and winning a combat online, Love Machine takes control of a satellite and sets it on a crash course with a nuclear power plant somewhere on Earth where the fallout could destroy life on the planet. Kazuma tries to fight Love Machine again, now embodied in over 400 million stolen accounts as an almost living botnet, but he is no match and is absorbed by Love Machine. Needing a way to take back the 400 million stolen accounts and find the one linked to the satellite and its GPS, Kenji uses the fact that Love Machine sees everything as a game and has Natsuki's family provoke Love Machine into a game of Koi-Koi in Oz' casino world. There they wager the accounts of the Shinohara family and eventually that of the people throughout the world. Natsuki defeats Love Machine and manages to regain almost all the accounts stolen and in the process stopping the satellite from crashing into the nuclear power plant. However, Love Machine is able to set the satellite navigation and in revenge directs it toward the Shinohara household instead. Using his moderator level of access to Oz and math skills, Kenji manages to hack into the GPS of the satellite and redirects it away from the house, while Love Machine is deleted by the newly rescued King Kazuma. In the aftermath, Natsuki's family celebrate the victory in the memory of their late grandmother. Under the pressure of Natsuki's family, who suggest that the two should marry for real after lying to the family about their engagement, Kenji and Natsuki kiss.

The remaining fragments of the U.S. government and military hide out in fortified military bases and colonies, attempting to find a solution to the zombie pandemic. Sarah, Private Miguel Salazar, radio operator William \"Bill\" McDermott, and helicopter pilot John fly from their base to Fort Myers, Florida, in an attempt to locate additional survivors. They encounter a large horde of the undead, and return to their army base in the Everglades, where a small group of scientists, supported by a skeleton crew of soldiers, is searching for a way to stop or reverse the re-animation process.Dr. Logan, the lead scientist\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 also known as \"Frankenstein\" due to his grisly surgical dissections of zombies \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 believes that the zombies can be trained to become docile, and accordingly has amassed a collection of test subjects, which are kept in a large underground corral in the compound, in spite of the objections of base-commander Captain Henry Rhodes. The tension between soldiers and scientists worsens in the face of dwindling supplies, loss of communication with other survivors, and slow progress in research. During a meeting between the scientists and the soldiers, Rhodes announces that he is taking command of the base, that the scientists henceforth will work under his orders, and that anyone who objects will be instantly killed. Dr. Logan hopes to secure Rhodes' cooperation by showing him the results of his research. He is especially proud of \"Bub\", a docile zombie who remembers some parts of his past life and engages in rudimentary human behavior: listening to music, aiming a pistol, and saluting Captain Rhodes. \"Civil behavior must be rewarded,\" Logan says. \"If it's not rewarded, there's no use for it. There's just no use for it at all!\" Rhodes is not impressed.During a zombie roundup mission, two of the soldiers, Miller and Johnson, are killed after a zombie escapes its harness; whereupon Miguel attempts to kill the creature, but is bitten on the arm. Sarah amputates the arm and cauterizes it to stop the spreading infection. Rhodes then calls off the experiments and demands that all captive zombies be destroyed. Sarah and Bill later discover a crude form of Dr. Logan's experimentation involving the bodies of Miller and Johnson and an audio tape in which a crazed Logan talks to his \"Father\" and \"Mother\"; horrified, both Sarah and Bill plan to leave in the helicopter immediately before someone else does.Conditions worsen when Rhodes finds out that Logan has been feeding the flesh of his dead soldiers to Bub as a reward for his docility and positive behavior. Enraged, Rhodes kills Logan and his assistant Dr. Fisher. He then locks Sarah and Bill inside the zombie corral and then attempts to force John to fly him and his men away from the base, which John refuses to do.Bub manages to escape from his chain and finds Dr. Logan's corpse. In a display of human emotion, he expresses sadness and then becomes enraged. He finds a pistol discarded on the floor and goes in search of revenge. Meanwhile, Miguel, who has become suicidal, opens the gates to the compound, allowing the horde of zombies lurking outside to enter onto the elevator, devouring him. While Miguel is doing this, John overcomes his captors, knocking both Rhodes and Torrez out before stealing their weapons and going into the zombie corral to rescue Sarah and Bill. The zombies rapidly enter the complex; Pvt Rickles and Pvt Torrez are torn apart by the horde. Pvt Steele attempts to shoot Bub through a covered window, but gets bitten by another zombie and chooses to kill himself. Rhodes attempts to escape, but is shot and wounded by Bub and violently torn to pieces by a crowd of zombies.John reunites with Sarah and McDermott inside the zombie corral. They escape together to the surface, board the helicopter, and fly to a deserted island with no dead people or zombies on it.

On the road, they meet up with Adjie's sister Ladya and convince her to go with them. However, Ladya, who still blames Adjie for their parents death, declines. After some accidents at Ladyas workplace, she changes her mind and decides to go with them after all. After they leave Ladyas workplace, they meet a beautiful woman named Maya. She tells them she has been robbed and is unable to get home. Feeling pity for her, they give Maya a ride home.The group travels by car to what seems to be the middle of nowhere where Mayas house is located. There, they meet Maya's family. Mayas mother, Dara, has a very young and beautiful face with an eerie expression and mysterious body language. Adam, Mayas second brother greets them and is very gentlemanly. There is also Arman, Dara's eldest son, who is frumpy and never speak any word. After introductions, Dara secretly drugs Astrid. After much insistence, they agree to stay for dinner. However, Adjie and Astrid, who is pregnant go to the guestroom upstairs so Astrid could rest. Unfortunately, the remainder of our friends, who are having dinner, get drugged (In their food) and they are all knocked out. Arman takes them to a cellar, with Alam still at the dinner table. Alam is seduced by Maya, and is slashed by her and he finds Adam who has a broken arm and has collapsed.Adjie and Astrid saw this and manage to get upstairs, but Adam catches Adjie. Astrid locks herself in the guest room. Dara tells her about the strength of women and that the drug she was given will strength from outside. Dara tells her that the drug she was given, will cause her to go into labor. Then Astrid finds a small window, climbs up and sees a car arriving at the house. Astrid calls for help, but it turns out that woman from the car is Daras friend. She is given several coolers of \"meat\", revealing the motive for the slaughter to come. They are a family of cannibals, who belong to a secret society attempting to gain immortality. The family searches for victims, providing human flesh for the society.

Dara tells the couple that they could escape by themselves. However, if they try to take the infant back, they will all die that night. Astrid follows Dara to the next room, while Adjie goes to another room to try to find help.Down in the cellar, Arman has slaughtered Adam and now chooses Ladya to be his next victim. However, knocks him out and escapes. She breaks out of the cellar and sets Eko and Jimmy free. After their escape, the trio re-enter the house in attempt to save the married couple. However, Maya, who is armed with a crossbow, sees them and shoots at Eko, hitting his left ear. They run to the forest, with Adam now chasing them. Ladya gets away and goes into the house. Jimmy's neck has broken by Adam, and he dies. Eko manages to walk through forest and find a road, where he is spotted by the light of a car.Back in the house, Adjie enters a room filled by babies cadavers and a one baby that has been preserved. He finds his wife, who has been stabbed in neck by a huge hair pin. After finding Astrid dead,Adjie strangles Dara out of revenge. Dara stabs him and strangles him into unconsciousness. Ladya enters, but Arman grabs her and brings her upstairs to rape her.Dara and Maya go back to front door where Adam is already. A police patrol has found Eko and take him into their car. The four police officers separate; two going upstairs, with the others remaining on the first floor. One of the officers finds a video containing the movie that was seen at the start of this film. Shocked, he drops a small collection of photographs, strangely dated in 1912, but depicting Adam, Arman, and Maya. Dara's photo is dated 1889. Upstairs, Arman is stabbed in the eye while raping Ladya. She escapes while Arman screams loudly, tipping off the police. The police take a defensive posture, but Adam turn off the lights and the family of cannibals kill the police in the dark. However, the leader of the police gets away and runs to front door. He retrieves his shotgun, and fires is at Maya, killing her. Dara, who has just killed the other officers, runs to front door and takes the shotgun away from the police leader and kills him. Dara finds an injured Maya and breaks her neck to ends her daughter's suffering.Arman comes out of the room with a the wooden stick jammed in his eye. He slashes the throat of one of the police officers who had gone upstairs to investigate earlier. They die together. Ladya runs to the room where Adjie lies unconscious. She finds Astrid's body, after which they are attacked by Adam. While Adam fights with Adjie, Eko comes enters and jabs Adam with a sword. Adam, who is quite durable, removes the sword while Adjie pours a liquid over his head. Seeing this, Ladya takes her lighter and tosses it to Adam. Adam goes up in flames and runs to another room. Eko goes downstairs alone and slashed by Dara with a chainsaw. Back upstairs, Ladya and Adjie attack Adam once more. Ladya, who has taken the sword, slices Adams throat. Together with Adjie, they decapitate Adam.Ladya and Adjie take the baby to a part of the house, which is stained in blood. Ladya takes revenge on Dara, the last remaining villain. Ladya goes to dining room, where she finds Eko's body and is attacked by Dara and her chainsaw. Ladya with the sword and Dara with the chainsaw, fight each other. Ladya escapes to the other side of dining table and runs out of the room. But Dara slashes Ladyas foot, causing blood to squirt out. Dara readies to attacks Ladya again, but is knocked in the head by Adjie and Ladya makes it away. Dara is still able to grab the chainsaw, slashing Adjie's shoulder. Adjie finds a gun nest to him and throws it to Ladya. Ladya takes the gun and shoots Dara, then strangles her with her necklace. Dara lays on the floor and is kicked by Ladya. Ladya reunites with Adjie and apologizes to him. Adjie forgives her and dies after he asks Ladya to cares her nephew (his newborn son).Morning has come as Ladya gets away from the house with her nephew in her arms.

After her mother dies, her sister Jane (Virginia Madsen) and Jane's boyfriend Lou (Tom Irwin) eject her. Nell receives a phone call about an insomnia study, directed by Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) at Hill House, a secluded manor in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts, and applies for it. At the house, she meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley (Bruce Dern, Marian Seldes), a strange pair of caretakers. Two other participants arrive, Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson) and Theodora (Catherine Zeta-Jones), along with Dr. Marrow and his two research assistants. Unknown to the participants, Dr. Marrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear, intending to expose his subjects to increasing amounts of terror. Each night, the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House, preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning. During their first night, Dr. Marrow relates the story of Hill House. The house was built by Hugh Crain (Charles Gunning)\u00e2\u0080\u0094a 19th-century textile tycoon.Crain built the house for his wife, hoping to populate it with a large family of children; however, all of Crain's children died during their birth. Crain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife Renee killed herself before the house was finished and Crain became a recluse. After the story, Marrow's assistant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face is slashed by a snapped clavichord wire. The freak accident causes Marrow's research assistants to leave. Nell begins to suspect that it was no accident, as she notices that the wire was unwound by someone or something. Theo and Nell begin to experience unusual happenings within the house, such as a mysterious force trying to open the door, Nell starts seeing ghosts of children in curtains and sheets, Hugh Crain's wood portrait morphs into a skeletal face and is vandalized with the words \"Welcome Home Eleanor\" written in blood. Theo and Luke try to establish their innocence, but Nell tells them that they don't know her.Nell becomes determined to prove that the house is haunted by ghostly children who are only terrorized and killed by Crain's cruelty. She learns that Crain kidnapped the children from his cotton mills and slaughtered them, then burned their bodies in the fireplace, trapping their ghosts and forcing them to remain with him, providing him with an 'eternal family'. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, from whom she is descended. Dr. Marrow is skeptical of Eleanor's claims, until he realizes he made a mistake by bringing them to Hill House when a statue tries to drown him in a pool of water in a greenhouse. After several more terrifying events, Nell insists that she cannot leave the ghosts of the kids to suffer for eternity at Crain's hands. Trying to convince Eleanor to leave the house with them, Theo offers to let Nell move in with her, but Nell reveals her relation to Carolyn and claims she must help the children to \"move on\" to the afterlife.Hugh Crain's ghost seals up the house, trapping them all inside. A frustrated Luke defaces a portrait of Hugh Crain. Crain's enraged spirit drags Luke to the fireplace where he is decapitated. Nell is able to lead Crain's spirit towards an iron door. The spirits pull Crain into the door, dragging him down to Hell. Nell is pulled with him, inflicting fatal trauma on her body, but the ghosts gently release her on the ground. Her ghost rises up to Heaven, accompanied by the children's ghosts. After Nell's death and when she moved on to Heaven along with the ghosts, Theo and Dr. Marrow wait by the gate outside until the Dudleys come in the morning.The Dudleys approach as the sun rises. Mr. Dudley asks Dr. Marrow if he found what he wanted to know, but the traumatized psychiatrist does not give an answer, and neither does Theo.

Young William Wallace (James Robinson) witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father (Sean Lawlor) and brother (Sandy Nelson), and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.Longshanks orders his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at Stirling and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew (Richard Leaf) and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), the son of nobleman Robert the Elder (Ian Bannen) and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife Isabella of France (Sophie Marceau) to try to negotiate with Wallace. After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace.Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk where noblemen Lochlan (John Murtagh) and Mornay (Alun Armstrong) betray Wallace, causing the Scots to lose the battle. As Wallace charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, he is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert. Remorseful, he gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him she is pregnant with Wallace's child.In London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate (David Gant), tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being hanged, drawn and quartered, Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, \"Mercy,\" and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, \"Freedom!\", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him. At the same time, Longshanks dies.In 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of Bannockburn, where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace.

John investigates the identity of the dead child and finds that the mystery is linked to a powerful local family, the heir of which is a wealthy United States senator, Joseph Carmichael.John subsequently discovers that the real Joseph Carmichael (who was born in 1900) was murdered in 1906 by his father, Richard. Joseph was a crippled, sickly child, and in the event of his death before his 21st birthday, the family fortune (which in 1905, he inherited from his late maternal grandfather) would pass to charity. Desperate to keep control of the fortune, Joseph's father drowned young Joseph in the bathtub, secretly replaced him with a healthy orphan, and took the orphan to Europe in the guise of seeking a treatment or cure. He returned several years later with the impostor, now grown and \"cured\" of his illness, and continued as if nothing had happened.Now, the ghost of the real Joseph haunts the house, making great efforts to persuade John to investigate his murder, and give him some form of justice. John's investigation leads him to a property that was once owned by the Carmichael family, and after convincing Mrs. Gray (the owner of the property and whose daughter has seen Joseph's ghost), John discovers the skeletal remains of Joseph in a well underneath the house, as well as his birth medal.After taking the medal without handing it over to the police, John attempts to speak to Senator Carmichael as he is about to depart by plane but is restrained by police. It is then revealed that the Senator has an identical medal to the one John found. The Senator then sends a detective, Captain DeWitt, to John's home in an attempt to retrieve the medal, John refuses, and when DeWitt leaves to obtain a search warrant, his vehicle \"mysteriously\" crashes, killing him.After hearing of DeWitt's death, the Senator finally agrees to listen to John's story and meets with him. John reveals the entire story to the Senator, that his father murdered his natural son and replaced him with a changeling, which is the Senator. The Senator refuses to believe the story and angrily berates John for accusing his father, whom he claims was a \"loving man\", of murder. John then leaves the real Joseph's medal, files and the only copy of the seance recording and apologizes. The Senator threatens John that there will be consequences if he has told anyone else of his story.Meanwhile, John's realtor and friend, Claire, goes to the house alone in an attempt to find John and is chased by Joseph's wheelchair until she falls down the stairs. Meanwhile, the house begins to shake and rumble. John arrives, and escorts Claire outside, and then goes back inside to try and stop the ghost of Joseph. A strong wind causes John to fall from the second story, but he survives. Joseph then lights the house on fire.Meanwhile, back at the Senator's home, he is observing the two birth medallions, and throws Joseph's away while placing his own on a portrait of his father. Suddenly, the picture and the desk start shaking violently and an illusion of the Senator is transported to the house and begins to climb the stairs which then crumble. John sees the Senator's illusion walking up the main staircase, and narrowly escapes being crushed by a chandelier. Meanwhile, the Senator's illusion then climbs the stairs to Joseph's attic room where he witnesses how his father murdered the real Joseph by drowning him. Meanwhile, back at the mansion, the Senator himself suffers a heart attack and dies as Joseph's attic room explodes. John and Claire arrive and see the Senator's body being hoisted away. The ambulance then passes the Carmichael mansion, which is now completely engulfed in flames.The next morning, Joseph's burnt wheelchair sits upright amid the ruins of the mansion.

Al and Sue are fascinated when their friends, whose adult son recently moved away from home, reveal that they hired an expert to arrange the matter.The expert is Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker), who believes that men continue to live at home because they have low self-esteem. Her approach is to establish a relationship with the man to build his confidence and transfer his attachment from his parents to her. However, upon meeting Tripp, she finds that he does not fit any of her previous profiles, having normal social skills and no problems with self-esteem.

While waiting for their yacht to be repaired in the rural hamlet of Elk Cove, Oregon, she passes the time by hiring local carpenter Dean Proffitt (Kurt Russell) to remodel her closet. He puts up with her rude and condescending attitude and produces some quality work which is dismissed by her because he used oak instead of cedar, despite her not having specifically asked for this at the start. When he agrees to redo the closet after he gets the money for the work done she refuses to pay and they have an argument, during which he astutely notes that she is inventing things to complain about because her life is so pampered and boring (this gets overheard by the yacht's crew on the intercom who applaud him for telling her off), which concludes with her pushing him off the ship and dumping his tools in after him.Later that night, as the yacht sails away from the harbor, Joanna goes out on deck to retrieve a lost piece of jewelry and falls overboard. The next day the local TV news shows a story about her having been picked out of the water around midnight by a garbage scow. She is suffering from amnesia and is taken to the local hospital where no one can figure out who she is. Once Grant realizes she has fallen overboard, he sails back to port to get her. After seeing her mental state and her lashing out at hospital employees, he denies knowing her and returns to the yacht to embark on a spree of parties with younger women.After seeing her story on the local news, Dean, a widower living in squalor with four sons, decides to seek revenge, or more specifically, get Joanna to work off her unpaid bill and losing his tools. He goes to the hospital and tells her that she is Annie, his wife of thirteen years and the mother of his sons. The hospital staff is eager for her to be gone, but they need binding proof he is responsible for her, and he bears no legal documentation to do so. He is granted her release by telling them about a small birthmark on her behind, which he saw on the yacht when she was wearing a revealing swimsuit. She reluctantly goes home with him. Once there, she is appalled by his residence, but feels some obligation to pitch in, having come to think of herself as \"Annie\".At first, Joanna has difficulty dealing with Dean's sons and the heavy load of chores. She soon adapts, however, and learns to cook, clean, do laundry, and care for the family dogs. As she masters her responsibilities, she learns about the boys' school and family issues and that Dean is secretly working two jobs to make ends meet. She begins to fall in love with him and his sons, and starts streamlining the money problems with more efficient budgeting. She also tells off a persnickety teacher who gives the boys a hard time, accusing the school of being more concerned with ranking than the well-being of their students.Seeing Dean struggle, Joanna makes his dream come true by helping him design a miniature golf course based on her untapped knowledge of the Seven Wonders of the World. Although he has also fallen in love with her, he does not tell her the truth about her real identity for fear that she will leave. Even when he attempts to confess when she discovers a pair of expensive monogrammed underwear (which are actually hers) leading to think he is cheating, his friend, Billy (Michael G. Hagerty), takes the blame. He, who also doctored photos of them to cement the alibi of their prior relationship, tells Dean in private he covered for him because his family needs Joanna.Meanwhile, after Joanna's mother, Edith (Katherine Helmond), threatens Grant (who has been lying that Joanna is \"too indisposed\" to talk to her), he reluctantly ends the partying and returns to Elk Cove to retrieve her, tracing her to the Profitt residence. She greets him and her memory is instantaneously restored. She is shocked and hurt when she realizes that Dean lied and has been using her for months. She returns with Grant to the yacht where Edith and Dr. Korman (Henry Alan Miller), their bumbling psychiatrist, are waiting.Joanna now finds her old lifestyle stuffy and pretentious. That evening, after doing shots of tequila with the crew, she turns to Andrew (Roddy McDowall), her loyal butler, and apologizes for her poor treatment of him. Surprised and pleased, he observes that unlike most people, she has been given an opportunity to see life from a different station than that to which she was born. He also tells her that she is the one who can decide how to use the new perspective. Realizing how happy she was with Dean and his sons, she commandeers the yacht and turns back toward Elk Cove. When Grant finds out, he admits he never loved her, and commandeers it.Meanwhile, Dean and his sons attempt to get Joanna back with the help of Billy's friend who is in the Coast Guard. When they catch up to the yacht, she and Dean both jump overboard. An incensed Grant attempts to shoot her with a bow and arrow only to be unceremoniously booted overboard by Andrew, who promptly gives his notice of resignation. Safely aboard the smaller vessel, Dean is impressed that she left Grant for him, but she says the money and yacht are actually hers. He then asks her, \"What could I possibly give you that you don't already have?\" She looks at the boys, smiles, and replies, \"A little girl.\"", "output": "Question: Who has been lying and using Edith for months?, Answer: Dean, Question: What did Dean say that made Joanna angry?, Answer: she is inventing things to complain about because her life is so pampered and boring, Question: What does Joanna try to retrieve from the deck?, Answer: lost piece of jewelry, Question: What does Dean's wife want?, Answer: A daughter., Question: Dean has a son and a daughter?, Answer: No, he only has a son., Question: who is secretly working two jobs to make ends meet?, Answer: Dean., Question: What did Joanna Stayton ask Dean Proffitt for?, Answer: cedar, Question: Who learns to cook, clean, do laundry, and care for the family dogs?, Answer: Joanna., Question: What picked Joanna out of the water around midnight?, Answer: garbage scow, Question: Who plays Billy?, Answer: Michael G.

Charming her with \"Buongiorno Principessa\", getting the timing perfect every time and whisking her away on a green horse (don't ask!) ensures they soon live together happily in Guido's uncle, Eliseo Orefice's (Giustino Durano) house. Bringing up their 5 year old boy, Giosu\u00e9 (Giorgio Cantarini), the war continues without them noticing until one fateful day when the Germans arrest Guido and his son at the uncle's house during preparation for Giosu\u00e9's birthday party, and transfer them to a concentraction camp. Dora demands to be taken too, thus Guido is devastated to see his non-Jewish wife board the train.Protecting his son from the vile truth, Guido tells Giosu\u00e9 that they are just on a big hoilday, and he turns the camp into a big game for Giosu\u00e9, claiming that they must win 1000 points to win a real tank and leave. His elderly uncle, however, is on a different \"team\" and is lead towards the showers first. Guido must complete \"tasks\" for the camp \"moderators\" (ie. the Nazi SS), while avoiding the impending fate with everything he can offer. His quick thinking saves Giosu\u00e9 from the truth when a German officer requires a translator. Despite not speaking a word of German, Guido steps forward and makes up the \"Regole del Campo\" from the German's body language, claiming that tanks, scoreboards and games of Hide and Seek litter the camp, while cleverly stating that Giosu\u00e9 cannot cry, ask for his mother or declared he's hungry, resulting in the loss of the \"game\", in other words, death.Giosu\u00e9 later refuses to take a shower, and unknowingly escapes being gased, so Guido hides him with the help of other Italian prisoners, since there are no other children. Playing messages over the tannoy for Dora, kept prisoner on the other side of the camp, the family build up hope, only to be diminuished by the SS. With the help of Guido's former German friend, Herr Lessing, Guido can hide Giosu\u00e9 amongst the German children, while waiting the German Officer's meals. With the days becoming steadily worse, Guido realises that time is short and that he must make certain sacrifices if his son is ever to see the tanks roll over the hills, and be reunited with his mother. Giosu\u00e9 is pessimistic, and doesn't believe that there are any real tanks or games.Hiding Giosu\u00e9 in a junction box for the last time, telling him that everyone is looking for him, Guido jeapordises his own survival to prevent the Germans discovering Giosu\u00e9, while he attempts to free Dora, giving his own life away at the same time.

Blackmail, smear tactics, political trade-offs and more highlight this movie. Senate majority leader Robert Munson of Michigan (Walter Pidgeon) tries to steer Leffingwell toward confirmation, with his initial roadblock being Senate Pro Tem Seabright \"Seab\" Cooley-SC (Charles Laughton), a minority party member.

Cooley drags out an old comrade from the nominee's college days (Herbert Gelman, played by Burgess Meredith) in an attempt to scuttle the appointment. Meanwhile, Van Ackerman sics a team of blackmailers on the bisexual Anderson in an attempt to ensure the nomination, even though Anderson, Munson, and the president know Leffingwell has provided perjured testimony about his past. Anderson travels to New York and assaults his old army lover outside a gay bar, returning to the Capitol to slit his own throat in his Senate office. Chastened by Anderson's suicide, Munson and Cooley agree to disagree in a \"nice\" way, and the full Senate vote on Leffingwell's nomination ends on a 47-47 tie since Munson has shamed Van Ackerman into walking out of the chamber before his name is called. Just as the voting ends, the Vice-president Harley Hudson (Lew Ayres), the Senate's presiding officer, is informed that the excitement of the radio broadcast of the close roll-call vote has resulted in the President's death.

The couple engage in various infidelities but, between them, have unenthusiastic sex. Their arousal is heightened by discussing the intimate details of their extramarital sex.While driving home from work late one night, Ballard's car collides head-on with another, killing its male passenger. While trapped in the fused wreckage, the driver, Dr. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter), wife of the dead passenger, exposes a breast to Ballard when she pulls off the shoulder harness of her seat belt.While recovering, Ballard meets Remington again, as well as a man named Vaughan (Elias Koteas), who takes a keen interest in the brace holding Ballard's shattered leg together and photographs it. While leaving the hospital, Remington and Ballard begin an affair, one primarily fueled by their shared experience of the car crash (not only do all of their sexual assignations take place in cars, all of Remington's off-screen sexual encounters take place in cars as well). In an attempt to make some sense of why they are so aroused by their car wreck, they go to see one of Vaughan's cult meetings/performance pieces, a re-creation of the car crash that killed James Dean with authentic cars and stunt drivers. When Transport Ministry officials break up the event, Ballard flees with Remington and Vaughan.Ballard becomes one of Vaughan's followers who fetishize car crashes, obsessively watching car safety test videos and photographing traffic collisions. Ballard drives Vaughan's Lincoln convertible around the city while Vaughan picks up and uses street prostitutes and, later, Ballard's wife. In turn, Ballard has a dalliance with one of the other group members, Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette), a beautiful woman whose legs are clad in restrictive steel braces and who has a vulva-like scar on the back of one of her thighs, which is used as a substitute for a vagina by Ballard. The film's sexual couplings in (or involving) cars are not restricted to heterosexual experiences. While watching videos of car crashes, Remington becomes extremely aroused and gropes the crotches of both Ballard and Gabrielle, suggesting an imminent m\u00c3\u00a9nage \u00c3\u00a0 trois. Instead, Vaughan and Ballard eventually turn towards each other and have sex while, later, Gabrielle and Remington have sex with each other.Though Vaughan claims at first that he is interested in the \"reshaping of the human body by modern technology,\" in fact his project is to live out the philosophy that the car crash is a \"fertilizing rather than a destructive event, mediating the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity that's impossible in any other form.\"The film's climax begins with Vaughan's death and ends with Ballard being involved in another semi-deliberate car crash, this one involving his wife. Their fetish for car crashes has, ironically enough, had an unusual bonding effect on the Ballards' marriage.

Both demons speak of the coming of the destructive Gozer and the release of the imprisoned ghosts, and the Ghostbusters take steps to keep the two apart.Walter Peck (William Atherton), a lawyer representing the Environmental Protection Agency, has the Ghostbusters arrested for operating unlicensed waste handlers and orders their ghost containment system deactivated, causing an explosion that releases hundreds of ghosts. The ghosts wreak havoc throughout the city while Louis/Vinz advances toward Dana/Zuul's apartment. Their romantic encounter opens the gate and transforms them into supernatural hounds. Consulting blueprints of Dana's apartment building, the Ghostbusters learn that mad doctor and cult leader Ivo Shandor, claiming humanity was too sick to survive after World War I, designed the building as a gateway to summon Gozer and bring about the end of the world.The Ghostbusters are released from custody to combat the supernatural crisis, but after reaching the roof of Dana's building, they are unable to prevent the arrival of Gozer, who appears in the form of a woman. Briefly subdued by the team, Gozer disappears, but her voice echoes that the \"destructor\" will follow, taking a form chosen by the team. Ray inadvertently recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"something that could never, ever possibly destroy us\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the destructor arrives in the form of a giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and attacks the city.

Miguel Santos is a talented pitcher who might just have what it takes to earn a prized spot on a Major League Baseball team, but before that happens he'll have to prove his worth in the minor leagues. Advancing into the United States' minor league system at the tender age of 19, Miguel is warmly welcomed into the small-town Iowa home of his host family, but can't help but struggle with language and cultural barriers despite the kindness of strangers. Subsequently forced to reevaluate his life's ambition after his once-trusty arm becomes unreliable, the previously single-minded pitcher gradually begins to question both the world he lives in and the role he has chosen to play in it. - Jason Buchanan, All Movie GuideMiguel \"Sugar\" Santos (Perez Soto) spends his weekends at home, passing from the landscaped gardens and manicured fields on one side of the guarded academy gate to the underdeveloped, more chaotic world beyond. In his small village outside San Pedro de Macoris, Miguel enjoys a kind of celebrity status. His neighbors gather to welcome him back for the weekend; the children ask him for extra baseballs or an old glove. To his family, who lost their father years before, Miguel is their hope and shining star. With the small bonus he earned when he signed with the academy some time ago, he has started to build his family a new house - one that has a bigger kitchen for his mom and a separate room for his grandmother.After learning a devastating knuckle curve, Sugar is invited to spring training by the fictional Kansas City Knights. He is assigned to their Single A affiliate in Iowa, the Swing. He is housed by the Higgins family, who take in Swing players every year. Jorge (Rufino), a veteran player and the only other Dominican on the team, also tries to help Miguel learn the ropes. However, despite the Higgins' welcoming efforts and Jorge's guidance, the challenge of Miguel's acceptance into the community is exposed in small ways every day, from his struggle to communicate in English to an accident of casual bigotry at a local bar.Miguel's domination on the mound masks his underlying sense of isolation, until he injures himself during a routine play at first. While Miguel is on the injured list, Jorge, his one familiar connection to home in this strange new place, is cut from the team, never fully regaining his ability following off-season knee surgery. The new vulnerability of Miguel's injury, coupled with the loneliness of losing his closest friend, force Miguel to begin examining the world around him and his place within it. Pressure mounts when Salvador, a young pitching phenom who used to play with Miguel, is brought up from the Dominican Republic to join the team. Miguel's play falters, and the increased isolation begins to take its toll on him. As his dream begins to fall apart, Miguel decides to leave baseball to follow another kind of American dream. His odyssey finally brings him to New York City, where he struggles to find community and make a new home for himself, like so many before him.

In the process of dynamiting the lode, he falls from a broken rung of the tunnel ladder and breaks his leg. He saves a silver sample, climbs out of the mine, and drags himself to the nearest assay office to evaluate his find and receives a silver and gold certificate claim. In 1902, he discovers oil near Los Angeles, California and establishes a small drilling company. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man's orphaned son. The boy, named H. W., becomes his nominal \"business partner\", allowing Daniel to paint himself to potential investors as \"a family man\".In 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, who tells him of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel attempts to buy the farm at a bargain price. However, Eli, Paul's twin brother and pastor of a local church, is aware of his plan. Eli demands $10,000 and states that it is for the church. An agreement is made and Daniel goes on to acquire all the available land in the area, except for one holdout: William Bandy. Oil production begins, but an on-site accident kills a worker and a gas blowout robs H. W. of his hearing. Eli blames the disasters on the well not being properly blessed. When Eli demands the $5,000 Daniel still owes his family, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table, Eli berates his father for trusting Daniel.A man arrives at Daniel's doorstep, claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Daniel hires Henry to work for him, and the two grow closer. H. W. sets fire to their house, intending for it to kill Henry. Angered by his son's behavior, Daniel sends him away to a school for the deaf in San Francisco, and leaves him on the train by himself. A representative from Standard Oil offers to buy out Daniel's local interests, but Daniel elects to strike a deal with Union Oil and construct a pipeline to the California coast, though the Bandy ranch remains an impediment.While reminiscing about his childhood, Daniel becomes suspicious of Henry and one night holds him at gunpoint. \"Henry\" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry, who died from tuberculosis. In a fit of rage, Daniel murders the impostor and buries his body. The next morning, Daniel is awakened by Mr. Bandy, who knows of the previous night's events and wants Daniel to repent. At the church, as part of Daniel's baptism, Eli humiliates him and coerces him into acknowledging that he is a bad father. Some time later, as the pipeline is well under way, H. W. returns and reunites with Daniel, while Eli leaves town to perform missionary work.In 1927, H. W. marries Eli and Paul's sister Mary. Daniel, now extremely wealthy but a raging alcoholic, lives as a recluse in a large mansion. Through a sign language interpreter, H. W. asks Daniel to dissolve their partnership so that he can establish his own oil company in Mexico. Daniel reacts brutally, mocks H. W.'s deafness and reveals his true origins as an orphan. H. W. leaves, but not before telling Daniel he is now grateful that they are not related.Soon after, Eli visits Daniel, who is drunk and passed out in his private bowling alley. Eli, now a radio preacher, offers to sell Daniel the land of William Bandy, who recently died. Daniel agrees on the condition that Eli loudly denounces his faith and his own credibility. Swallowing his pride, Eli reluctantly does so. Daniel reveals that the property is now worthless because he has already drained its oil through surrounding wells. Shaken and desperate, Eli confesses to being in dire financial straits. Daniel taunts Eli and claims that Paul now has his own oil company. Daniel then snaps and begins attacking Eli, and chases him around in the bowling room. Eventually, Daniel kills Eli by smashing his head in with a bowling pin.

He goes to Hollywood where he encounters a number of eccentric characters. He is at first robbed and later befriended by con artist Dr. Sebastian Melmoth (Boyle), and meets a prostitute named Mary (Lasser) who lets him stay at her apartment. Mary grows to care for Ambrose and seduces him while he is taking a cold shower to try to alleviate his lustful thoughts about her. While he is in Hollywood, he visits several churches including a service at the Church of Divine Profit, performed by the televangelist Armageddon T. Thunderbird (Kaufman) in which he sees the focus of the sermon being a request for money in exchange for salvation. Ambrose is angered by this message and tries to meet a number of times with Thunderbird, being ejected each time.Dr. Melmoth and Ambrose travel the city in a modified school bus, in which they hold church services for donations. During one service, the brakes of the bus release and the bus rolls downhill into a river. The passengers escape safely in the river and are shown on the local news being baptized by the pair, which catches Thunderbird's attention. He prays to G. O. D. for guidance and it tells him to work with Ambrose to make more money because Ambrose is an innocent and has a clean image.Thunderbird has his minions kidnap Ambrose and bring him to his office where he outlines a plan for his own brand of church on wheels. He says he will pay Ambrose the $5000 the monastery needs if he assists him. While they are talking, Thunderbird mentions that G. O. D. (Richard Pryor) audibly talks to him when he prays to him and Ambrose is surprised because he himself has never heard from God in this way. Ambrose agrees to work with Thunderbird and they go across the country from town to town holding services in their own bus.One day at Thunderbird's headquarters, Ambrose overhears Thunderbird praying to G. O. D. in his private chamber and when he hears G. O. D. speak back to him, he is intrigued. When Thunderbird leaves, he sneaks into the chamber and discovers that G. O. D. (General Organizational Directivatator) is a sophisticated master computer, linked to all of Thunderbird's finances and operations. He talks with G. O. D. and reads the Bible to it, giving it morality and a conscience. G. O. D. decides to give all of Thunderbird's money away and tells Ambrose what to do to accomplish this, which results in bags of money being poured out of the office's window. Thunderbird discovers someone has been interfering with the computer and rushes back to headquarters where he tries to capture Ambrose and destroys the computer. Ambrose grabs the paid monastery mortgage certificate from Thunderbird's office and escapes in a chase through the city.While Mary and Dr. Melmoth look for Ambrose during his escape, she learns that Melmoth is her father that left her family when she was a child, due to a distinctive tattoo she sees on his leg. They eventually find Ambrose and rescue him from the people chasing him.Ambrose goes back to the monastery and gives the abbot the mortgage certificate, then leaves and marries Mary, who is pregnant from their single night together.

As the movie begins, Randall is visiting Los Angeles to collect $115,000 owed by a rich gambler to his employer, David Pascal (Frank Michael Liu). After a few threats and some fighting he collects the debt. He dozes during a jet flight back to Hong Kong and the viewer sees in flashback how he got in a fight in the Casino when he was on leave from the US Army and ended up befriending David's father, Sam (David Opatoshu).Josh goes to the casino upon his arrival in Hong Kong and checks in the money. While he's there, David asks him to help terminate one of the Dragon's dealers who is skimming money. David fires the dealer, telling him he's lucky he doesn't have his hands broken for what he's done. The dealer is humiliated by being forced to walk out of the casino without his pants, a punishment Josh considers excessively harsh.After work, Josh visits Sam, and the two share some reminiscences about the old days. Sam asks Josh what is going on with David and the casino, saying his gut tells him that something is wrong. However, Josh has not been taken into David's confidence and doesn't know what to say. Sam invites Josh back later to visit and watch some soccer with himself and David.After picking up some food, Josh heads home to his houseboat out in Aberdeen Harbour, where he spends a pleasant interlude with his beautiful blonde girlfriend Claire (Mary Louise Weller). A couple hours later he returns to the Dragon, just in time to foil an attempted robbery.That evening, Josh, Sam, and David are relaxing at the Pascal home with some beers and watching a soccer game. David tells Sam that a competitor, Stan Ramondi (Michael Cavanaugh), has an interesting business proposition for a merger the elder Pascal should hear. He suggests that the men go to Ramondi's restaurant and casino after the game. Ramondi is widely known as a mobster and runs a Triad-backed syndicate called Osiris which extorts protection money from Hong Kong businesses, but with some misgivings Sam agrees to go.Upon arrival the Pascals and Randall are escorted into Ramondi's office. Ramondi has much praise for Randall, saying he has heard many good things, and even offers Josh a job. When Randall turns him down Ramondi asks him to wait outside in the casino. Ramondi then gets right down to business, telling Sam Pascal that times are changing and he should bring his business in under the umbrella of Osiris. Sam gets angry at this, saying he doesn't need to procure protection from Osiris and that Ramondi's offer is a joke and bullshit. Sam storms out. Meanwhile, Randall has run afoul of Ramondi's hulking bodyguard, Kam (Seiji Sakaguchi). They nearly come to blows until Ramondi calls off his goons.On the way home, David tells Sam that they are almost broke due to David's gambling losses, and that they have no choice but to take Ramondi's offer. Sam is furious to hear this, telling David that he needs to straighten up or he will be out of the business. As they return to the Pascal household, David asks Josh to return later, fearing that there may be trouble. Soon after Randall leaves, Osiris assassins show up at Sam's home and wipe out everyone in the family except for Joy (Camila Griggs), Sam's wild child daughter.When Randall returns to the Pascal home, he finds David and Sam murdered. Knowing that both he and Joy are in deadly danger, he shows up at the swing condo where she lives, and almost coerces her into accompanying him, much to her annoyance.Randall decides to go to the police and drops Joy off with Claire at his houseboat. Two police inspectors, Keck (Jimmy Shaw) and Chen (Lloyd Kino), intercept Randall on his way to the station and arrest him. Randall is brutalized by Keck as he is taken into custody. The police attempt to pin the murder of the David and Sam Pascal on Josh and Keck has him strip searched. Finally due to lack of evidence the cops are forced to let him go.Randall visits the place of business and warehouse of his old Vietnam buddy Leroy Nicely (Bob Minor), and obtains a .45 automatic and a Gerber combat knife. Leroy tells him that he has a $150,000 price on his head, to which Josh jokingly replies \"Hong Kong or American?\" Leroy volunteers to go with Randall like in the old days when they were part of the A-Teams in Vietnam, but Josh tells him to stay and protect the girls.On the way back to his houseboat Josh sees Keck staking him out and sneaks up on him, returning the beating he had taken earlier. Rounding up Joy and Claire, Josh attempts to run and hide out from the mobsters men throughout Hong Kong, but this turns out to be difficult for a big blonde American with two beautiful women in tow. After a number of Karate battles and shots fired, he drops the girls back off at Leroy's.Realizing that Ramondi must be a figurehead as there is no way he has the authority and influence to be at the top of Osiris, Josh resolves to track down who the real leader is, as that person is the one who ordered the killings. After following some leads Randall finds out that aging and supposedly retired crime lord Simon Koo (Peter Gee) is the actual head of the Osiris syndicate and also that Koo is secretly Ramondi's father.Randall returns to the warehouse to find Ramondi's thugs broke into the warehouse and mortally injured Leroy, kidnapped Joy, and raped and killed Claire. Seriously going on the warpath, Josh dresses up in military uniform to get into Ramondi's restaurant without being recognized. Once inside he waylays one of Ramondi's goons and wrings Ramondi's location out of him, discovering that Joy is being held captive on Ramondi's private yacht.At the shipyard Randall takes on more of Ramondi's men and has his life saved by the timely intervention of Inspector Chen who it turns out is part of an international task force against organized crime in Hong Kong. Chen informs Randall that Inspector Keck was arrested and he confessed that he worked for Ramondi. Randall decides to go onto Ramondi's yacht and rescue Joy and Chen says he can't let Randall go alone. While overcoming Ramondi's bodyguards aboard the yacht Chen is wounded, then Randall gets into a savage and difficult battle with Ramondi himself, who like Randall is very skilled in the martial arts. Finally he wins the fight after Ramondi's neck is accidentally caught in a rope and snapped when he falls.Randall leaves Joy in the care of the Inspector and goes after Koo. Arriving at Koo's compound, Randall fights his way in. Once inside, he confronts Koo, telling him he killed a lot of good people. Koo replies that he has a place for Randall in his organization, asking Josh if Ramondi told him this. Randall tells Koo that he did, right before before he died. Enraged, Koo orders Kam to kill Randall. As the fight begins, Kam goads Randall by telling him that he was the one who raped and killed Claire. Randall is nearly beaten in the terrific battle which follows. Finally, after much furniture is broken and many walls smashed, a wooden window frame with a large dagger of broken glass falls on Kam's neck, cutting his throat. Randall then takes Koo into custody.In the aftermath, Inspector Chen drops off Randall and Joy near the harbor. Chen thanks the two of them for all they did and informs Randall that the key remaining people in the syndicate will be deported, which will finish it. He adds that Simon Koo will be committed to an institution for the insane, the shock of his son's death apparently being too much for him. He also remarks that he wishes Randall would consider taking a job on the police force. As the Inspector leaves, Joy tells Randall that she would like to get the Lucky Dragon up and running again, and asks him if he thinks she can. Smiling, Randall rhetorically says, \"You're a Pascal, aren't you?\"In a voice over as the movie ends, Randall states that the city of Hong Kong lives on borrowed time, the lease is running out and the city will be reverting back to the Chinese landlords in 17 years, but as he further muses, Hong Kong's residents are survivors and whatever happens Hong Kong will always be \"the place.\"", "output": "Question: Who shows up at Sam's house uninvited?, Answer: Osiris assassins, Question: How does David humuliate a fired employee?, Answer: Walk out of the casino without pants, Question: Where is the Luck Dragon Casino?, Answer: Hong Kong, Question: How has David lost his fortune?, Answer: Gambling, Question: At the beginning of the movie, how much of amount was collected by Randall from a rich gambler?, Answer: $115,000., Question: What is the profession of Josh Randall?, Answer: Head of security., Question: What is Randall's occupation?, Answer: Head of security, Question: Who is the actual head of the Osiris syndicate??, Answer: Simon Koo, Question: Who was took into custody by Randall?, Answer: Simon Koo., Question: Who is the actual head of Osiris syndicate?, Answer: Simon Koo.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Notable marathoners such as Frank Shorter, Dick Beardsley, Alberto Salazar, Grete Waitz, Paula Radcliffe, Joan Benoit-Samuelson, and Kathrine Switzer provide commentary about the sport.The focus is then on the six featured runners and their training for the 2005 Chicago Marathon. American Deena Kastor and Kenyan Daniel Njenga are both elite runners, and are determined to win the race. Kastor was the bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympic Marathon, but has yet to win a marathon. Njenga had finished second multiple times in previous Chicago Marathons. Kastor is shown training and recovering from an injury in Mammoth Lakes, California, while Njenga's life as a sponsored runner in Tokyo is profiled.The rest of the runners featured live in Chicago. Ryan Bradley and Lori O'Connor are both married young professionals; Bradley is a veteran marathoner who hopes to earn a qualifying time for the Boston Marathon, and O'Connor is running her first marathon. She finds it humorous when colleagues ask if she expects to win. Jerry Meyers is a jovial 70-year-old who claims to run marathons for the t-shirt. Leah Caille is a new runner that took up the sport to help recover from an emotional divorce.While preparing for the race, Bradley suffers a knee injury and is unable to compete. He is clearly upset by this, and takes out his frustration by going for a long bike ride. O'Connor and Caille go through the new experience of the long training sessions necessary for a marathoner. Meyers lends his veteran knowledge while leading slower training runs with his daughter, who is running her first marathon.All of the long and dedicated training culminates on the day of the marathon. There are panoramic shots of the city that display the mass numbers of race participants and spectators. Njenga runs with the lead pack, but once again falls short in third place. Kastor has a lead for most of the race, but is challenged by Romanian Constantina Di\u00c5\u00a3\u00c4\u0083-Tomescu at the very end of the race. In a dramatic finish, Kastor is able to fend off Di\u00c5\u00a3\u00c4\u0083-Tomescu for the victory.Bradley cheers his wife, Colleen, as she races to a 3:51:54 finish, while O'Connor seems to have a smooth race, and enjoys seeing friends in the crowd. Caille struggles with IT Band Syndrome, but eventually has a successful finish, crossing the line in 5:01:15. Meyers wears his favorite \"Kansas\" shirt and enjoys his race, finishing in 5:59:39.", "output": "Question: How many miles are in this famed running event?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: How many different continents was this movie filmed in?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: How many different countries did they film in?, Answer: <No Answer>", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

At South Station, Boston, Thomas Craven (Mel Gibson) picks up his daughter, Emma (Bojana Novakovic), who has returned home to visit. She throws up, while getting into Thomas' car. At home, as he prepares a meal, Emma starts a nosebleed and vomits violently and as they hurriedly leave to find a hospital, a masked gunman yells, Craven, and fires two shotgun blasts at Emma simultaneously. Blasted through the door, she dies in Thomas' arms.At first, everyone believes that Thomas, a police detective, was the gunman's target, but when Thomas finds Emma had a pistol in her night stand, he starts to suspect that Emma was an intended target. He checks the ownership of the pistol and finds that it belongs to her boyfriend David (Shawn Roberts). David is frightened of the company Northmoor where Emma worked and Thomas discovers that Emma became aware that Northmoor was manufacturing nuclear weapons, intended to be traced to foreign nations if they are used as dirty bombs. Following the failed break-in of the activists, Emma was poisoned with thallium through a carton of organic milk. Burning her effects in his lawn, Thomas encounters Jedburgh (Ray Winstone), a \"consultant\" tasked to prevent Craven from discovering Emma's information, or kill him. Liking each other, instead, Jedburgh leaves Thomas to investigate. Throughout the film, Thomas repeatedly imagines he hears and sees his daughter, even having short conversations and interactions with her.Thomas also has several encounters with Northmoor mercenaries, and he eventually discovers through Emma's activist contact that Jack Bennett (Danny Huston), head of Northmoor, ordered the murder of his daughter, as well as the activists Emma was working with to steal evidence of the illegal nuclear weapons (the bodies in the opening). Northmoor personnel kill a hitman marked as a fall guy after he is set up for killing Emma's boyfriend, and attempt to murder another activist who gave Emma's information to Thomas. After confronting a lawyer and Senator that Emma contacted, revealing that they know almost everything that happened, Bennett has Northmoor operatives allow Thomas to be poisoned with thallium, as his daughter had been.Thomas, now very sick, arrives at Bennett's house and kills the mercenaries, one of whom Thomas realizes is the man who shot his daughter. Bennett shoots Thomas, but Thomas tackles Bennett and pulls out the radioactive milk. He forces it down Bennett's throat and collapses. Bennett runs to his cabinet to get pills to counteract the radioactivity but Tom drags himself over and shoots Bennett through the throat, killing him.Thomas is hospitalized for the gunshot wounds and radioactive poisoning. Jedburgh, who is revealed to be suffering from a terminal illness, meets with Moore, the Senator (for whom he had been working) and the political advisor who assigned Jedburgh to eliminate Craven. He listens to their suggestions as to how to play the Northmoor incident in a positive light. He tells them that he is done and then suggests an assassination attempt on the Senator should be the feature story, to drive Bennetts death out of the tabloids. They are happy to go along with the story until Jedburgh tells the senator that he is on the wrong side of the equation. Jedburgh then pulls out his gun and shoots all three men dead before a young Massachusetts State Trooper comes in, gun drawn. Jedburgh gets the drop on the trooper and asks if the young man has a family and kids. The young man says yes and Jedburgh lowers his gun, and is instantly shot and killed by the trooper.As Thomas lies dying in the hospital, we see Emma walk into his room, then lean down at his bedside and whisper in his ear. Across town, a young reporter opens a letter from Thomas with DVDs revealing the conspiracy, with Thomas's good luck wishes, ensuring the company's end. As he dies, Emma comforts him.

At the start of the film, Beth dumps Lane for the captain of the ski team, Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier). Roy is handsome, popular, and has skied the dangerous K-12 slope, but is also an arrogant bully who publicly mocks Lane and unfairly rejects him at ski team tryouts. Beth also criticizes Lane's car, an old station wagon. Although Lane also owns a disabled 1967 Camaro, he has not been able to get it running.Lane lives in a suburban development with his mother, Jenny (Kim Darby), a ditzy housewife who improvises gut-wrenching recipes for family meals; his genius little brother, Badger (Scooter Stevens), who never speaks but at the age of \"almost 8\" can build powerful lasers and attract trashy women; and his lawyer father, Al (David Ogden Stiers), who daily tries to stop the menacing paperboy, Johnny, from damaging his garage with thrown newspapers. Furthermore, Johnny claims that the Myers owe him two dollars for newspapers, and persistently hounds Lane uttering the catchphrase, \"I want my two dollars!\" Lane also regularly encounters two Japanese drag racers, one of whom (Yuji Okumoto) learned to speak English by listening to Howard Cosell.Lane cannot get past Beth's rejection and decides that death is the only way out of his misery. He makes several half-hearted attempts at suicide, which all comically fail. With the help of his best friend, Charles de Mar (Curtis Armstrong), who in lieu of \"real drugs\" constantly inhales everyday substances like Jell-O, snow, and nitrous oxide in a whipped cream can (known as a whippit), Lane tries to ski the K-12 himself in hopes of getting Beth back, but wipes out. Lane is further embarrassed when he gets fired from his humiliating fast food job at Pig Burgers in front of Roy and Beth, who are there on a date.As Lane attempts to either end his life or win back his ex-girlfriend, he gradually gets to know a new girl: a French foreign-exchange student named Monique (Diane Franklin), who has a crush on him. She is staying with Lane's overbearing neighbor Mrs. Smith (Laura Waterbury) and her fat, socially backward son Ricky (Daniel Schneider), who are so annoying that Monique pretends she cannot speak English. Monique turns out to be an excellent auto mechanic and skier who helps Lane fix up his Camaro and tries to build his confidence. When Roy insults Monique, Lane challenges him to a ski race down the K-12, with the winner to be captain of the ski team. Monique helps Lane prepare for the race, which he ultimately wins despite losing one ski and being pursued by Johnny. Beth rushes to embrace Lane at the finish line, but he rejects her and, after besting Ricky in a ski-pole swordfight, drives off with Monique in his Camaro.

Due to his resemblance to the portrait of the devil in a fresco she has just seen, Lisa flees, only to be confronted by a mustachioed gentlemen...who falls from a flight of stairs to his apparent death.When she fails to find back to the tour group, she takes refuge with a couple and their driver, who agrees to help Lisa get to her hotel. But their car breaks down in front of a crumbling mansion where Lisa discovers that Leandro works as the butler. The couple (a young woman and older man) persuade Leandro to let them stay while the driver (the young wife's lover) fixes the car. Lisa attempts to flee, but the countess' son Maximilian (Alessio Orano) stops Lisa and agrees to let the three stay over the objections of his mother, a blind Countess (Alida Valli).The obscure, mustachioed man continues to stalk Lisa as further mysteries unfold: the Countess and her son have a fourth guest in the mansion, a mysterious figure who is held prisoner inside a secret room. The Countess, Maximilian, Leandro, and the mustachioed man (revealed to be Carlos, the Countess' second husband) claim that Lisa is actually,\"Elena,\" Maximilian's long-lost girlfriend who was once frightened away by his jealous mother.Through a series of waking dreams, it is revealed that Elena was secretly sleeping with Carlos and that he was plotting to leave the jealous and reclusive Countess. After seeing Leandro preparing Carlos' body for burial juxtaposed with Carlos being alive, Lisa freaks out. Carlos attempts one last time to whisk Lisa away but Maximilian kills him. Lisa faints as Carlos' body morphs into the dummy Leandro purchased in the store. Leandro repairs the dummy (whose face has caved in, in the aftermath of the murder attempt).The driver is promptly killed by a mysterious figure after fixing the car. Leandro offers to cover up the crime to his employers so long as they let him dispose of the body. When the husband demands his wife leave with him -- she runs over him, only to be brutally murdered by Maximilian.While Lisa is unconscious, Leandro dresses her like Elena. He gives a speech about how he is a demon that is indebted to the Countess and her son. The mansion is cursed and the Countess, her son, the couple, their driver, and Elena are forced to relive their deaths again and again, with dummies being procured by the demon to represent the players as they repeat the cycle of death. Lisa's arrival ultimately negated his inability to find a Lisa dummy to represent her in this latest incarnation.Lisa wakes up and finds the Countess, who has discovered the young wife's corpse. Lisa intends to escape, but a defeated and browbeaten Maximilian has started to believe that Lisa is just like Elena. He takes her to his secret room, where Elena's corpse and ghost are revealed to be the mystery prisoner. Maximilian drugs Lisa, strips her naked and rapes her, only to have the ghost of Elena laugh at him mid-rape and cause him to stop. Furious, he goes downstairs and confesses his crimes to his mother, who wants him to kill Lisa to keep anyone from finding out what he has done.Maximilian reveals to his mother his crimes: having murdered his stepfather to avenge his betrayal of the Countess and his stepson, Maximilian then imprisoned Elena rather than risk allowing her to leave and inform the police. Maximilian kills his mother when he realizes that she will never let him leave her or allow him to have a relationship with Lisa.After doing so, Maximilian is shocked to find all of his victims (the married couple, their driver, Elena, and his mother) waiting for him at a table. As his mother attempts to kill him, Maximilian jumps from a window but is impaled on the metal fence below. Leandro reveals himself behind the corpses making their appearance and says that Maximilian \"accidentally slipped.\"Lisa wakes up the next morning, naked, with the mansion in ruins. She finds the dummy representing Maximilian, beseeching her to stay. Later in town, she runs into Leandro, who is presented with a \"Elena\" doll by the shop keeper. Leandro refuses the doll as Lisa boards her plane, intending to leave Italy. The entire plane turns out to be empty. She discovers the corpse of the men and women she met the previous night.

An enforcer, who we learn later is Lado (Benicio Del Toro) wears a skull Lucha libre mask and runs a chainsaw.Next, there is a shot of an attractive young blonde woman named 'O' (short for Ophelia, played by Blake Lively) as she narrates in a voice-over. The love of her life is two men: Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch). To her, Ben is like warm wood, the idealistic Buddhist; Chon is steel, the baddhist. O is in a polyamorous relationship with both men, and the three live together in Laguna Beach, California in a luxurious cliff-side house for which Ben paid with cash. Ben and Chon are high school buddies. Ben went to Berkeley and majored in business and botany. Chon was a Navy Seal with tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. One day, lounging on the beach, Ben asks Chon where you can get the best weed. Chon replies Afghanistan, and during a tour there, smuggles out hashish/marijuana seeds from which Ben grows in a greenhouse, using his scientific knowledge, cannabis with a THC yield of 33%, \"the best in the world.\" They met O when they hired her to help with managing the greenhouse. Ben is the businessman who runs the production and distribution and handles 99% of the business, while Chon handles the 1% (enforcement). Ben's philosophy is to provide what people want, but Chon is the realist in seeing the money made from marijuana. Ben does a lot of humanitarian work, and sells to marijuana clubs and dispensaries, for medical usage, but most of the money is made from selling on the street, where it goes for about $6,000 a pound.After making love to O, Chon sees on his computer an e-mail. The e-mail has a video of Lado kicking around the decapitated heads and reads: \"These guys were stupid. Be smarter We need to talk.\" O and Chon greet Ben returning from a volunteerism trip to Africa. Chon and Ben discuss the business. Ben wants to give up the business to the Mexican cartel as he wants to go into philanthropic ventures such as making $10 solar panels, and he admits he's afraid of the cartel. But Chon argues that selling would show weakness, and once they do this, the cartel would usurp their whole lives.We see Lado and his 'gardening crew' carry out a hit. Lado accosts a middleman (Shea Whigham) in his home. The middleman pleads forgiveness and promises an even better deal than paying up. He calls El Azul (Joaquin Cosio) (Spanish for The Blue), a cartel head honcho, to connect him with Lado, but Lado shoots the middleman and has a teenage cartel-member-in-training, Esteban, shoot the middleman's wife, while El Azul is on the phone, enraging him. The gardening crew smuggles the bodies out of the house in trash bins. We learn that El Azul is a former inside man with the Baja cartel, the cartel Lado works for. The head of the Baja cartel, Elena Sanchez (Salma Hayek), had a falling-out with El Azul, and now El Azul is encroaching on the Baja cartel's territory, threatening to take over her position.Meanwhile, Ben and Chon meet with Dennis (John Travolta), a corrupt DEA agent on Ben and Chon's payroll. Dennis tells them about the Baja cartel: they want Ben and Chon's market to fill a market they don't have. Dennis urges them to take the deal instead of decapitation; he reminds them that times are changing and they need to adapt. Dennis is sympathetic to them because his wife has cancer and Ben provides him with cannabis to ease the effects of her chemotherapy.Ben and Chon go to a hotel room and meet with Alex (Demian Bichir), the representative for Elena. The meeting is secretly video-recorded by Lado, with the video feed shown to Elena in her Tijuana compound.Alex lays out the deal: a contract of three years of working together, during which the cartel will learn Ben's horticulture methods while providing vast distribution networks and the operation in a safe haven on an Indian reservation that the cartel owns. (The Indian reservations are considered out of U.S. jurisdiction.) During the meeting, Chon badmouths the cartel's products by saying \"I think, basically, you want us to eat your shit and call it caviar.\" Ben and Chon step out into balcony to discuss. We see that a formidable security apparatus, a team of Chon's ex-Navy Seal friends, who have sniper wares trained on the hotel room, backing them. Chon had planned to take out Alex and his men, but Ben talks him out of it. Ben and Chon reach a decision. They will turn over their business to the Cartel, but not join them. The cartel is not happy. (Apparently, no one says 'no' to the Baja cartel.)Fearing the consequences of their decision, Ben meets with his money guy, Spin (Emile Hirsch), an ex-Goldman Sachs banker who launders and invests the marijuana company's money. Ben wants to set up funds to disappear for three years in Indonesia. Ben, Chon, and O have dinner and discuss the plan for their new lives. Unbeknownst to them, they are being watched in the restaurant by Lado's crew. The three celebrate by getting high in their beach house and having a threesome. Lado sits in the car, spying on them. He calls Elena to update her on the situation. Elena says she needs Ben and Chon to join her for their expertise. Hearing about their living situation, she found their weakness: O.The next day, the three prepare to leave for Indonesia. O wants to do a last minute shopping trip and Chon assigns someone from the security team for her. O is driving to South Coast Plaza (an upscale mall in Orange County), but one of Lado's men intercepts the bodyguard and kills him. They tail O. In one scene, O is shopping next to a girl who is talking on a cellphone, answering her mom's questions about college life. Her mom turns out to be Elena.Returning home but not finding O, Ben and Chon hear a chime indicating a Skype call, and to their horror, see a live web feed of the kidnapped O. Elena, her voice masked, reprimands the boys for not complying with the deal. To redress the insult of the cartel's product during the meeting, Elena has Chon put a gun into his mouth, indicating she will tell Lado to cut off two of O's fingers otherwise. She almost gets Chon to pull the trigger but stops him at the last minute, telling him this will clean up his mouth.Elena tells Ben and Chon to deliver 300 pounds of their marijuana in five hours to show compliance. They get the product and race to Chula Vista. They arrive just in time despite being almost pulled over (and Chon almost having to kill the highway patrolman). Lado and his men take their car. Ben and Chon drive back in Lado's truck, which contains the suitcase of money (they paid in full, Ben and Chon note) and a cell phone. Elena calls, her voice unmasked, and tells them that she will hold O hostage for one year to make sure they comply with all of her demands. Chon argues with Ben that they have to fight to get O back -- the cartel members are savages who will kill them anyway. But Ben just wants peace and O back.Ben and Chon meet again with Dennis, who tells them about the conflict between Elena and El Azul. Chon strong-arms Dennis into getting data on Elena and the Baja cartel from the DEA. He is able to get 60 days of financial transactions, encoded onto two credit cards. Dennis also tells them that two of Elena's sons and her daughter (Magdalena), are dead. Back in their company HQ, Ben and Chon have Spin and his experts look into the financial data on the computer. From it, they trace Elena's financial routes. They figure out that one of her real-estate holdings, a trailer house, is a drop off point for the cartel's business. Ben decides on a plan to pay to get O back. He and Elena negotiate to a $13 million ransom. They decide to hijack the drop to get the cash for O's ransom, and make it look like El Azul hit the cartel.The hijacking gets underway. Wearing masks, Chon and his team of ex-Navy Seals blow up the front car in a convoy with IEDs. When the men from the trailer retaliate, an ex-Navy Seal member takes them out with RPG rockets. Chon forces the men out of the car carrying the cash by putting a grenade in the gas tank. He takes the briefcase from a man scrambling out of the car. Ben is horrified by the killings. One of the cartel members is about to shoot Ben, but Chon shoots the member in the back, spraying blood on Ben's mask. They take the money and get away. Alex and Lado arrive to assess the damage, which is 3 million dollars gone and seven men dead. Lado urges Alex not to inform Elena of the loss because he wants to recover the money and rectify the situation himself and because he fears Elena.Ben and Chon get a message to have Ben meet with Alex and Lado. Alex and Lado interrogate Ben to find out their whereabouts during the hijacking but Ben plays it cool. He insinuates that it could be Lado's men. After Ben leaves, Alex decides Ben and Chon don't have the balls for the attack. He suspects El Azul but Lado isn't so sure.We see O at the shack where they are holding her. She is being watched over by Esteban. Her living conditions are bad: one of her legs is chained to a chair, she has a bucket for bathroom and sleeps on a spring bed in a cage. She pleads into the surveillance camera and gets to talk to Elena, and begs her for some concessions. Elena asks O how long she has been using. Since 8th grade, O says, not that her mother cared. Later we see Lado feeding O a steak, and later, giving O a drug fix, and her getting high. O is also given access to a laptop to send a fabricated email to her mother so she won't file a missing persons report on O. Afterwards, Lado tells Esteban, don't look at me like that (because we see later in the movie Lado shows O a cellphone video of him raping her while she was high).Elena's daughter, Magdalena (Sandra Echevarria) is seen having sex when she is interrupted by a phone call. Her mother is on the line, informing her that she is coming to California to visit. Elena gets on a private plane to the Indian reservation in order to avoid U.S. customs. Lado will follow her later, bringing O with him. Before boarding the plane, Lado tells Esteban that he's proven too sensitive to handle the work and proceeds to shoot and kill him.Upon arrival inCalifornia, Lado brings O to Elena. Elena immediately informs Lado that she knows about the hijacking, and chastises him for not telling her. She threatens Lado, telling him to recover the money and he informs her that he didn't tell her because he was trying to get proof that Ben and Chon were behind the hijacking.Ben has Spin fabricate documents and hack into Alex's bank accounts to frame Alex as the mole to El Azul. Ben confronts Lado with Alex's dossier in an effort to take the heat off of him and Chon. To save himself, Lado visits El Azul and makes a deal to work with him.At a posh spa, Elena and O have dinner during which we learn that Elena inherited the business after her husband was killed. Her twin sons and brothers are also killed, leaving two children who resent her and do not want her in their lives (her daughter and a third son). Elena tells O she likes her, but won't hesitate to kill Ben and Chon. When O remarks that only she can 'get Ben and Chon together,' Elena scoffs, telling O that her love story has a serious problem: Ben and Chon must love each other more than O because otherwise, they wouldn't share her.Later, Lado brings Ben and Chon to see Alex being whipped. The torture is video-fed to Elena who forces O to watch once he 'confesses.' Under the threat of his family being harmed, Alex confesses to working with El Azul. He begs Elena for forgiveness, citing the names of her husband and children. Lado douses Alex with gasoline and anoints Ben to be the executioner. To go through with the falsehood, Ben ignites Alex on fire. O watches in horror.The next morning, Ben and Chon walk along the beach where they discuss the night's events. Chon tries to justify what Ben did by referring to the Dalai Lama, but Ben brushes it off. Instead, he tells Chon that during Alex's plea to Elena, Alex swore on Magda's life; meaning that Elena's daughter is alive, and that Dennis knew this and hid it from him and Chon. They make a plan that will work even faster than accumulating the money for ransom: kidnap Elena's daughter and trade her for O.Lado pays Dennis a visit at his home. It turns out Lado also has Dennis on the payroll. Lado questions Dennis on the culprits behind the hijacking and Dennis assures him it was Azul. Lado informs Dennis that it can't be Azul because he's working with him now instead of Elena. Under threat, Dennis reveals that the hijackers are Ben and Chon, but that they are going to give the $3 million to Elena and not Lado. To head off Elena, Dennis tells Lado to kidnap Magda and sell her to Ben and Chon. Dennis is incredulous to learn that Elena is on U.S. soil.Dennis meets with Ben and Chon, who chew him out for giving them away to Lado. The boys offer Dennis the $3 million they stole in exchange for Magdalena's address. They kill her bodyguard, who is sitting outside her dorm in his car, then move inside, tying up her boyfriend and kidnapping her. Wearing masks as a show, they Skype with Elena and show a shivering Magda, tied up and stuffed in an ice box. Elena meekly agrees to their demands. At the end of the talk, O informs Elena that she knew her boys would come for her. Elena slaps O, then screams at everyone to get out. She drops to the ground, rips off her wig, and breaks down.Lado and his boys take O into another room, where she is chained to a chair. Lado makes everyone else leave the room, then he shows her the video he took when he raped her while she was drugged. She spits in his face, but he enjoys it, wiping himself off on her hair.Elena's SUV and Ben and Chon's SUV meet in an open field with their hostages. On the mountain ridges, each group has their sniper team in position. Elena steps into the open with O and releases her. O runs to Ben. Ben and Chon release Magda to Elena, who is told by her daughter that she will never speak to her again. Before Elena returns to her car, she asks Chon who the rat is. Chon smiles and nods toward Lado, who blows back a kiss. Elena turns around to shoot Lado, but Lado draws his gun and shoots her first. O, who was handed a gun by Ben, makes her way to Elena and wants to kill her, but relents when she sees Elena is already dying. Elena begs O to help Magda escape. O glares at Magda briefly before hustling her to safety.A massive shootout is underway. Each group's sniper team shoots at each other, taking out some members of each team. Chon kills Elena's bodyguards and Ben and Chon converge on Lado, hiding behind the SUV. Ben shoots Lado three times in the back, but Lado turns around to shoot Ben in the throat. Lado sprawls on the ground, severely wounded. O shoots Lado dead for revenge, and erases his phone. O rushes to Ben, seeing his wound is lethal. As O cradles Ben, Chon pulls out a syringe and injects Ben, O, and then himself with drug overdoses. They die in a triple suicide. \"That's the perfect ending,\" O narrates while looking into the sky as she dies.But wait... Rewind, as O mentions that this was just how she imagined it.What really happened, as O narrates, \"was more of a fuck-up than a shootout.\" After Elena steps out into the open and releases O, Lado retreats to the car and drives away. A helicopter and DEA agents led by Dennis swoop in to arrest Elena. The DEA agents disarm the sniper teams and arrest everyone (including Ben, Chon, and O).O narrates as we see a montage: Dennis is grandstanding on TV about Elena's arrest and the progress on the war on drugs (Indian grounds are still U.S. grounds he says); Elena goes to prison for 30 years, while Ben and Chon, who have enough information to put Dennis away, are released after a few weeks in a holding cell after Dennis said that they were confidential informants. Lado and El Azul form a new cartel to take over the vacuum left by Elena.After their release, O says that she, Ben, and Chon all vanished. Montages are shown of them living new lives in Indonesia, Africa, and other parts of the world. A few scenes show that they continue to remain in touch and get together, but most of the scenes strongly imply that for the most part, they've all gone their separate ways-- as O narrates, perhaps it's true that three people can't all be equally in love. She says that one day, perhaps they'll return to their pot business in Laguna, but for now, they live simple, even primitive lives, like 'beautiful savages.'", "output": "Question: Who decides to go to Indonesia for a year?, Answer: Chon and Ben, Question: Who plays Chon?, Answer: Taylor Kitsch, Question: Who has incriminating information about Dennis?, Answer: Ben, Question: What does Arroyo show on his video?, Answer: of severed heads and a chainsaw, Question: who shot lado in the back?, Answer: Ben, Question: WHO is facing the loss of her political connections in Mexico?, Answer: Elena., Question: whats the name of Elenas daugther?, Answer: Ophelia, Question: who traveling to the US to visit her daughter?, Answer: Elena., Question: Who is Ben's friend?, Answer: Winnie Haas, Question: Who steals Elena's car?, Answer: Chon and his team of ex Navy Seals, Question: who tortures Alex and forces Ben to immolate him?, Answer: Lado, Question: who revealed Elenas daugheters location?, Answer: Lado, Question: WHO attack a cartel money convoy and kill seven of Elena's men?, Answer: Lado, Question: Who is Miguel \"Lado\" Arroyo?, Answer: A member of the cartel", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Crichton knows his place in the highly class-conscious English society. The Earl insists that all men are equal, and to prove it, he orders his daughters to treat the staff as guests during an uncomfortable afternoon tea. Lady Brocklehurst (Martita Hunt) arrives and strongly disapproves of the arrangement, as does Crichton.When Lady Catherine (Mercy Haystead), one of the Earl's daughters, is arrested at a suffragette protest, Crichton recommends the family take a trip on the Earl's steam yacht to the South Seas until the scandal dies down. When the yacht's motors explode during a storm, all are forced to abandon ship. By the time Crichton rescues the still sleeping \"tweeny\" maid Eliza (Diane Cilento), the lifeboats have already departed. They jump into the water and are picked up by the wrong boat, the one reserved for the upper class.Crichton, Eliza, the Earl, his daughters Mary (Sally Ann Howes), Catherine and Agatha (Miranda Connell), clergyman John Treherne (Jack Watling), and Lord Ernest Woolley (Gerald Harper) land on a deserted island. The aristocrats prove to be helpless in their strange new surroundings. It is up to Crichton to start a fire, provide shelter, and find food.When the abandoned yacht appears and drifts into an offshore rock formation, Crichton swims out to salvage what he can. Upon his return, however, the others order him to pick up unnecessary luxuries rather than vital supplies on his next trip. He reluctantly complies, but at dinner, he insists he must take charge. The Earl instead discharges him. Eliza throws in her lot with Crichton, and the two depart.The Earl and his party soon realise that they cannot do without Crichton and capitulate, Mary being the sole holdout. She is eventually forced to give in as well.After two years, the social order has been completely upended: Crichton, now affectionately known as \"the Guv\", is in charge, while his former betters are his servants. In fact, the aristocrats have toughened up admirably and are quite content with their lot. Romantically, however, the situation is in disarray, as everyone waits to see whether Crichton will choose Mary or \"Tweeny\" (as Eliza is now called), both of whom are deeply in love with him. All three of the other men are smitten with Tweeny.Finally, Crichton chooses Mary. However, just as they are exchanging wedding vows, a ship is sighted. Mary begs the others not to light a signal fire, reminding them how happy they have been on the island, but in the end, Crichton does so. When a rescue party lands, he has put on his butler's uniform and resumed his servile duties, much to the discomfort of the others.The castaways return to London. Woolley writes a book of their experiences, one that portrays him as the saviour of the group. Lady Brocklehurst, suspecting that the work is full of lies, insists on questioning all of the party privately. Crichton tells the truth, but in such a way as to conceal everything. After the Duchess leaves, he tenders his resignation. When the Earl offers financial assistance for his plan to start a business, Crichton shows him a bag of valuable pearls acquired while on the island. Mary begs him to return there with her, but Crichton tells her they cannot fight civilisation.

His punishment is mandatory participation in various after-school activities, such as tutoring disadvantaged children and performing in the drama club's spring musical. At these functions he is forced to interact with quiet, bookish Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore), a girl he has known for many years but to whom he has rarely ever spoken. Their differing social statures leave them worlds apart, despite their close physical proximity.When Landon has trouble learning his lines, he asks Jamie for help. She agrees to help him if he promises not to fall in love with her. Landon laughs off the strange remark, believing Jamie to be the last person with whom he would ever fall in love. After all, Landon has access to the prettiest and most popular girls in town; and between her shy demeanor and old-fashioned wardrobe, Jamie doesn't exactly fall into that category.Landon and Jamie begin practicing together at her house after school. The two form a tentative friendship, and Landon learns that Jamie has a wish list of all the things she hopes to do in her life, such as getting a tattoo and being in two places at once. One day, Jamie approaches Landon at his locker, where he is hanging out with some of his friends. When Jamie asks Landon if they are still on for practice that afternoon he smirks \"In your dreams\". His friends laugh and Landon's smirk falters as Jamie's face fills with betrayal and embarrassment. That afternoon Landon arrives at Jamie's house, hoping that Jamie will still agree to help him. But she refuses to open the door. When she eventually does, she sarcastically remarks that they can be \"secret friends\". She slams the door in his face when he agrees. Landon eventually learns the script by himself.During the play, Jamie astounds Landon and the entire audience with her beauty and voice. Landon kisses Jamie during the play, which was not in the script, and Landon tries to get close to Jamie, but she repeatedly rejects him. It is only after a mean joke played on Jamie by Landon's friends that Jamie agrees to get to know Landon after he punches out Dean and shuns Belinda (his friends who played the joke) and takes Jamie home. The two pursue a relationship. He takes her out to dinner and dances with her, something he never did for anyone else. When he discovers that Jamie has a wish list, he sets out to help her accomplish them. One memorable date had Landon taking Jamie to the state line. He excitedly positions her on the line in just the right way, and when Jamie asks him what he's doing he tells her \"You're in two places at once\". Her face lights up with joy, as she realizes that Landon set out to make her impossible dreams come true.Jamie finally tells Landon that she has terminal leukemia and has stopped responding to treatments. Landon gets upset at first. Jamie tells him the reason why she didn't tell him because she was moving on with her life and using the time she had left but then Landon happened and she fell in love with him. Jamie starts to break down as she says to Landon \"I do not need a reason to be angry with God.\" and she flees.Landon goes to his doctor father's house and asks him to help Jamie. His father freaks out a bit and says that he needs to examine Jamie and know her medical history before he could do anything. Landon leaves in a huff.Landon and Jamie make up the next day. They hug and he tells her that he will be there for her. Soon, word gets out about Jamie's illness. Eric, Landon's best friend comes and tells him how sorry he is and that he didn't understand. Dean and Belinda both come and apologize.Jamie's cancer gets worse and she collapses in her father's arms. He rushes her to the hospital where he meets Landon. Landon doesn't leave Jamie's side until her father practically has to pry him away. Jamie's father sits with Jamie and tells her that \"If I've kept you too close, it's because I wanted to keep you longer.\" Jamie tells him that she loves him and her father breaks down.The next day, Landon comes to the hospital and sees Jamie being wheeled out of there. He asks what's going on. Jamie asks him to thank his father for her. Landon asks Jamie's father what she means. He tells him that his father is going to pay for private homecare for Jamie.

Ray owns an occult bookstore and works as an unpopular children's entertainer with Winston, Egon works in a laboratory at Columbia University conducting experiments into human emotion, and Peter hosts a pseudo-psychic television show. Peter's former girlfriend Dana Barrett has had a son, Oscar, with an ex-husband, and works as a restorer at the Manhattan Museum of Art. After an incident in which Oscar's baby carriage is controlled by an unseen force and drawn to a busy junction, Dana turns to the Ghostbusters for help. Meanwhile, Dana's colleague Dr. Janosz Poha is indoctrinated by the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian, a powerful seventeenth-century tyrant and magician trapped in a painting in the gallery. Vigo orders Janosz to locate a child that Vigo can possess, allowing him to return to life on the New Year.The Ghostbusters' investigation leads them to illegally excavate First Avenue at the point where the baby carriage stopped. Lowered underneath, Ray discovers a river of pink slime filling an abandoned pneumatic transit line. Attacked by the slime after obtaining a sample, Ray accidentally causes a city-wide blackout, and the Ghostbusters are arrested. They are found guilty of investigating the supernatural, but before they can be taken away, the slime taken as evidence reacts to the judge's angry outburst and explodes, releasing two ghosts that proceed to devastate the courtroom. The Ghostbusters imprison the ghosts in exchange for the dismissal of all charges and that they be allowed to resume their Ghostbusting business.Later, the slime invades Dana's apartment and attacks her and Oscar. She seeks refuge with Peter, and the two begin to renew their relationship. Investigating the slime and Vigo's history, the Ghostbusters discover that the slime reacts to emotions, and suspect that it has been generated by the negative attitudes of New Yorkers. While Peter and Dana have dinner together, Egon, Ray, and Winston explore the underground river of slime. While measuring the depth, Winston gets pulled into the flowing river, and Ray and Egon jump in after him. After they escape back to the surface Ray and Winston begin arguing, but Egon realizes that they are being influenced by the slime, so they strip off their clothes. They also learn the river is flowing directly to the museum.The Ghostbusters go to the mayor with their suspicions, but are dismissed; the mayor's assistant, Jack Hardemeyer, has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor's interests as he runs for governor. Meanwhile, a spirit resembling Janosz in the form of a nanny kidnaps Oscar from Peter's apartment, and Dana pursues them to the museum alone. After she enters, the museum is covered with a barrier of impenetrable slime.New Year's Eve sees a sudden increase of supernatural activity as the slime rises from the subway line and onto the city streets, causing widespread paranormal activity with ghosts attacking citizens. In response, the mayor fires Hardemeyer and has the Ghostbusters released. After heading to the museum, they are unable to breach the power of the slime barrier with their proton packs. Determining that they need a symbol of powerful positivity to rally the citizens and weaken the slime, the Ghostbusters use positively-charged mood slime, and a remix of \"Higher and Higher\" to animate the Statue of Liberty and pilot it through the streets before the cheering populace. As they arrive at the museum, the slime begins to recede and they use the Statue's torch to break through the museum's ceiling to attack Vigo and Janosz.Janosz is neutralized with positively-charged slime, but Vigo immobilizes the Ghostbusters and attempts a transfer into Oscar's body. A chorus of \"Auld Lang Syne\" by the citizens outside weakens Vigo, returning him to the painting and freeing the Ghostbusters. Vigo, now a grotesque beast, momentarily possesses Ray, and the other Ghostbusters attack him with a combination of proton streams and positively-charged mood slime. Dressed in full Ghostbusters attire, Louis attacks the weakened slime barrier around the building with a proton stream of his own. This combination destroys Vigo and changes the painting to a likeness of the four Ghostbusters standing protectively around Oscar. Outside, the Ghostbusters receive a standing ovation from the crowd and, at a later ceremony to restore the Statue, the Key to the City from the mayor.", "output": "Question: Why are the Ghostbusters being sued?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Which spirit controlls Dana's colleague Dr. Janosz Poha ?, Answer: The spirit of Vigo the Carpathian, a powerful seventeenth-century tyrant and magician, Question: Whose baby-carriage was controlled by an unseen force?, Answer: Oscar, Question: Why are the Ghostbusters arrested?, Answer: Ray accidentally causes a city-wide blackout., Question: What do they use to weaken the slime?, Answer: The Statue of Liberty., Question: What song do they play from the top of the statue?, Answer: Higher and Higher., Question: What did the Ghostbusters save the New York city from?, Answer: The demi-god Gozer, Question: What university does Egon work for?, Answer: Egon works at Columbia University., Question: What forced the Ghostbusters out of business?, Answer: They were sued for the property damage they caused, and barred from investigating the supernatural, Question: Why are the Ghostbusters committed to a psychiatric hospital?, Answer: To protect the mayor's interests as he runs for governor.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

When their car breaks down, they realize they are in a cell phone dead zone, with no reception. They then decide to check into a completely isolated motel in a rural area with a strangely off-putting manager called Mason (Frank Whaley).While in their room, a bored David takes a peek at the video tapes left on top of the television. As he watches the tapes, he realizes they are snuff films, taken in the very room in which they are staying. The couple are alarmed by this as well as loud, insistent banging coming from the door to the adjacent room, and try to run away. Men dressed in black and wearing masks stop them, and they return to their room. David makes a run to the motel's payphone booth to no avail, escaping it just before a car crashes into it. The couple decides to lock themselves in the room when they notice a truck pull in. They try to warn the truck driver only to find out that he's actually there to buy a box of tapes of the snuff films.David and Amy escape into a tunnel that they discover in the bathroom of their room. Two of the masked people chase them inside the tunnel, but the couple evade them. David and Amy end up inside the manager's lair, where they find video monitors taping the entire hotel. Amy tries to make a call to 911 but is interrupted before she can give the operator any useful information. The couple sneak back into the tunnel, making their way into the auto garage across the lot from the motel. Meanwhile, the police unit responding to Amy's call arrives and David and Amy run to him as he checks the rooms. They all get inside the police car but it has been sabotaged and the killers murder the policeman while he looks under the hood.The couple run into one of the other motel rooms. David hides Amy in a space inside the ceiling, whilst he ventures out. The killers catch and stab David and he ends up lying unconscious in the doorway. When morning comes, Amy comes down from the ceiling and finds where the killers hid their car. As Amy drives away, a killer breaks into the car from the sun roof, and in her effort to fend him off while driving, Amy crashes the car into the motel, killing her attacker as well as another one of the masked men, revealed to be the gas station attendant that earlier \"helped\" the couple with their car troubles, who is crushed against the front of the car. She runs into the reception area where she is attacked by an apoplectic Mason. As they fight, Mason beats Amy severely. But in his effort to get a good final shot with his handheld digital video camera, Mason throws Amy within reach of a revolver she had dropped, and she shoots Mason three times. Amy immediately runs to David to find that he is still barely alive. She searches Mason's body for the telephone cord he had pulled out of the wall and tried to use to strangle her, calls 911 again and returns to caress David, who is barely conscious but alive.", "output": "Question: Where does David hide Amy?, Answer: a space inside the ceiling, Question: How many times does Amy shoot Mason?, Answer: 3, Question: What did Ami and David find in the motel?, Answer: They find some snuff films shot in the same room of the motel., Question: Who stops Ami and David from escaping?, Answer: Manager of the Motel and his two killer side-kicks., Question: What kind of animal gets hit by a car?, Answer: a racoon, Question: Who is Amy on her way home with?, Answer: David, Question: How did Ami kill the motel manager?, Answer: She shoots him, Question: Who makes a call to 911?, Answer: Ami, Question: Who gets stabbed near the end and looses consciousness?, Answer: David, Question: Who beats Amy severely?, Answer: Mason", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Bobby has evidently not told Elton that he is a former classical pianist who comes from an eccentric family of musicians.When Rayette is said to have become pregnant and shortly before Elton is arrested for having robbed a gas station a year earlier, Bobby quits his job and leaves for Los Angeles where his sister, Partita (Lois Smith), also a pianist, is making a recording. Partita informs him that their father, from whom Bobby is estranged, has suffered two strokes. She urges Bobby to return to the family home in Washington state, to visit their father.As Rayette has threatened to kill herself if Bobby leaves her, he reluctantly asks her along. Driving north, they pick up two women headed for Alaska, one of whom is obsessed about \"filth\". The four of them are thrown out of a restaurant when Bobby gets into an argument with a waitress who refuses to accommodate his special order. Reaching his destination, Bobby, embarrassed by Rayette's lack of polish, registers her in a motel before proceeding to his family home on an island in Puget Sound.He finds Partita giving their father a haircut, but the old man seems completely oblivious to him.

He kills a drug dealer in a nightclub,and after a chaotic chase, manages to elude Moss and his colleagues once again.In Beverley Hills, California, Hollywood movie star Nick Lang [Michael J.Fox] is becoming increasingly tired of playing the same teen idol roles, and his latest movie Smoking Gunn 2, an Indiana Jones style adventure, is the final straw. He decides he wants to get the role in a gritty new film and ditch his squeaky clean image. Having seen John Moss all over the news, he wants to go to go undercover in his police department to do his research for the lead detective role.Moss is furious when his Captain, Brix, [Delroy Lindo] tells him about this, but he's no choice. Lang has pulled some strings with the mayor and Brix himself is a Nick Lang fanatic. He tells him that Lang is going to be teaming up with him under the alias of Ray Casanov, and that for the next two weeks he's going to \"babysit\" him and show him around and tell him how to be a cop. But Moss has other plans - he wants the Party Crasher and has no intention of letting a pampered actor get in the way.Moss talks to a gang known as the \"Dead Romeos\" and extracts information about the gun dealer who does business with the Party Crasher, while Nick gets very excited about finding himself caught up in a gang war shootout, and then called to another murder the serial killer has committed. Already frustrated with Nick, things get worse for Moss when he finds out that he has to take him in as well, and then during a date with his girlfriend Susan [Annabella Sciorra], Nick shows up to join them.One night, Moss and Nick go to an old warehouse with a lead on the Party Crasher, and now armed with a gun, Nick shoots a man trying to escape. But Moss tells him it was an innocent civilian, and in order to cover up the incident, it's best that Nick goes back to Hollywood and lets him deal with it. But Nick feels guilty and instead of getting on a plane, he decides to go back to the police station and plead guilty. However, he sees the man there who he supposedly shot and killed, and realises that he is in fact a cop - Moss set the whole thing up to get Nick out of town.Nick takes off in a police patrol car to find Moss, but Moss is in pursuit of the Party Crasher. He sees him pursuing the killer into a cinema (that coincidentally is screening Smoking Gunn 2). A shootout takes place and Moss wounds the killer, but he manages to escape from the ambulance and into the back of Nick's car.Nick becomes brave and scares the Party Crasher with his reckless driving, but after the car flips over, he escapes once again.Susan arrives at Moss's apartment to tell him that she can no longer date him because his job is too dangerous, but upon leaving she is kidnapped by the Party Crasher (which Nick predicted). Moss and Nick go to rescue Susan at the top of a Nick Lang billboard. Nick bravely proves his worth by saving Susan from a fall, and saving Moss's life and taking a bullet. Moss kills the Party Crasher by throwing him off the top of the billboard.Some time later, Moss and Susan are at the cinema with his fellow officers watching Nick's latest movie, which is revealed to be called The Good, The Badge and The Ugly, and Moss is not happy when he realises that a lot of the dialogue in the film consists of things that he has said to Nick during their partnership. \"That little son of a bitch has stolen my life\".", "output": "Question: Does Susan think Moss' job is a safe one?, Answer: no, Question: Why is Moss not happy with Nick's movie?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What is the movie within the movie which the main character is Nick Lang?, Answer: Smoking Gunn 2, Question: what movie was playing in the theater?, Answer: smoking gun 2, Question: Where do Moss and Nick go to rescue Susan?, Answer: At the top of a Nick Lang billboard, Question: Who set up nick with fake shooting?, Answer: moss, Question: What gang doe detectiv moss contact?, Answer: dead romeos, Question: What is the nickname of the killer?, Answer: Party Crasher, Question: What does Nick save Susan from?, Answer: a fall, Question: How does Moss kill the Party Crasher?, Answer: by throwing him off the top of the billboard, Question: Who does nick long pull strings with?, Answer: mayor, Question: Name of the serial killer they are chasing?, Answer: Party crasher, Question: Who did Nick really shoot with a gun?, Answer: cop, Question: Who does Nick scare with his reckless driving?, Answer: the Party Crasher, Question: Who was the, \"Dead Romeos?\", Answer: gang, Question: How does Nick scare the Party Crasher?, Answer: With his reckless driving, Question: What is nick long's job?, Answer: actor, Question: What character trait did Nick have to take on?, Answer: bravery, Question: Who arrives at Moss's apartment?, Answer: Susan", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention.After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Megans inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before its found.Getting the internet to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by a General, Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. As the students argue on-and-off, they find a vent to navigate to different rooms that have its doors locked on both sides. Thereby, they learn Matt has an undisclosed criminal background and become suspicious of him. After Tarek goes missing and they return to the library through the vent, they discover Tricias powerful mother is the Governor, Craigs father is the city councilman, and Megan's father co-owns the property of which Tareks father is responsible for building the library, all of who made an agreement with the school to ensure their spoiled kids would be guaranteed to graduate in exchange for the construction of the library.A dark storm rages on outside the school, tampering with the lights and electronics inside, increasing the students fear of the paranormal. In an accident, Craig falls down the steps in the library and is mysteriously staked by one of his crutches, dying instantly. Not long after, Tricia admits her mother was the reason why Jacob lost his house, and Veronica secures evidence on Craigs camera showing that Tricia, Craig, Megan and Tarek had killed Jacob at his home to vacate the ownership of the property, leaving no next of kin to take over. Deeply believing in ghosts, they attempt to contact Jacobs spirit so that Tricia can call a truce, but the spirit rebels and seemingly harms Veronica. The spirit then appears, and she uses a nail gun to commit suicide due to fright.Shortly after, Dr. Day emerges to reveal his alliance with Veronica. The whole time, they masterminded everyone's paranormal delusions and emotional outbursts, triggered by psychological tests (inkblots), all to sell the story and make money. Killed by Dr. Day for trying to escape through the vent, Tarek's dead body is what was used as the ghost. Before Veronica can shoot Matt using the nail gun, Dr. Day abruptly kills her with an axe for poisoning him and causing his diarrhea earlier. Matt is framed for all the murders, as an unexpected booby trap involving the statue severs Dr. Day's head, killing him. A SWAT team barges in to find Matt armed with an axe in the middle of the carnage. Matt is subdued and placed in a straitjacket. Max arrives, revealing his Apache ancestor, Jacob Rainwater, owned the house where the school now stands, which at one time was also taken by General Clark and his army over a century ago.

Today, many of those untreated will suffer chronic debilitating illness. Some unknowingly will pass the disease on to their unborn children. Many will lose their livelihoods, and still others, their lives.Difficult to test accurately, tens of thousands of people go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The Centers for Disease Control admits that more than 400,000 people may acquire Lyme disease each year, a number ten times greater than AIDS and West Nile Virus combined. And yet, the medical establishment--with profound influence from the insurance industry--has stated that the disease is easily detectable and treatable, and that \"chronic Lyme\" is some other unrecognized syndrome or a completely psychosomatic disorder.Exposing the broken healthcare system, UNDER OUR SKIN is a gripping and often terrifying look not only at the science and politics of the disease, but also the personal stories of those whose lives have been affected and nearly destroyed. From a few brave doctors who risk their medical licenses, to patients who once led active lives but now can barely walk, the film uncovers a hidden world that will alarm viewers.

David then spots Dani's remains floating in the water, but he doesn't know what they are. David and Pete try and climb down the hill to get a closer look, but David trips and falls off. He lands in Dinoshark's mouth and is eaten whole. A horrified Pete scrambles up the mountain, but is knocked unconscious.Mag walks off to sunbathe. She takes off her bikini top, exposing her breasts, and is noticed by Dinoshark. Ron suddenly attacks Mag and rips off the bottom of her bikini. He then ties a rope to her ankle and attaches the other end to a rock before throwing her into the ocean, using her as bait. Meanwhile, Pete awakens and returns to the party, finding that the only members of the group still at the beach are Kirby and Ali. Ron arrives back at about the same time, and the two announce the deaths of David and Mag.The remaining four teens prepare to leave the island in their boat; however, Dinoshark smashes most of the dock and they flee in different directions. Pete discovers a still-living but badly mutilated Mag. She begs him for help, but Dinoshark appears and eats Mag, leaving just her leg. Pete notices how she was tied to the rock and remembers how Ron claimed she was dead, and begins to suspect Ron. Pete heads into the forest when he hears Kirby screaming, and at the same time, Ron meets up with Ali and the two head back to the boat, where he pulls a gun on her and forces her to strip naked.Pete finds Kirby and discovers that she screamed because she had found the desiccated remains of a girl killed by Dinoshark in the beginning of the film. Pete tells Kirby that he suspects Ron while they return, but she does not believe him. However, when they arrive back at the beach, they see Ron shooting Ali in one of her breasts, knocking her into the water, where she is eaten. Ron tells Pete and Kirby that after his family discovered the hidden island, all of them were killed by Dinoshark. Witnessing their deaths fostered his lifelong obsession in violence, gore and death.Kirby tells him that his relationship with Dinoshark will result in his death. Ron is disbelieving, and moves close to Dinoshark to prove her wrong. However, Dinoshark leaps out of the water and grabs Ron. He tries to pull Ron into the ocean, but his leg is caught on a rope attached to the dock; Ron is ripped in half and Dinoshark devours one half of his body. Pete and Kirby attempt to make it to the boat while he is distracted, but Dinoshark still attacks them. Kirby then grabs Ron's gun and shoots Dinoshark repeatedly. They start the boat, but Dinoshark reappears, so Pete hits Dinoshark with the boat, seemingly killing it. Kirby and Pete drive away in the boat, the only survivors of the eight.

Hopkins and his assistant, John Stearne (Robert Russell), visit village after village, brutally torturing confessions out of suspected witches. They charge the local magistrates for the work they carry out.Richard Marshall (Ian Ogilvy) is a young Roundhead. After surviving a brief skirmish and killing his first enemy soldier (and thus saving the life of his Captain), he rides home to Brandeston, Suffolk, to visit his lover Sara (Hilary Dwyer). Sara is the niece of the village priest, John Lowes (Rupert Davies). Lowes gives his permission to Marshall to marry Sara, telling him there is trouble coming to the village and he wants Sara far away before it arrives. Marshall asks Sara why the old man is frightened. She tells him they have been threatened and become outcasts in their own village. Marshall vows to Sara, \"rest easy and no-one shall harm you. I put my oath to that.\" At the end of his army leave, Marshall rides back to join his regiment, and chances upon Hopkins and Stearne on the path. Marshall gives the two men directions to Brandeston then rides on.In Brandeston, Hopkins and Stearne immediately begin rounding up suspects. Lowes is accused at his home and tortured. He has needles stuck into his back (in an attempt to locate the so-called \"Devil's Mark\"), and is about to be killed, when Sara stops Hopkins by offering him sexual favours in exchange for her uncle's safety. However, soon Hopkins is called away to another village. Stearne takes advantage of Hopkins' absence by raping Sara. When Hopkins returns and finds out what Stearne has done, Hopkins will have nothing further to do with the young woman. He instructs Stearne to begin torturing Lowes again. Shortly before departing the village, Hopkins and Stearne execute Lowes and two women.Marshall returns to Brandeston and is horrified by what has happened to Sara. He vows to kill both Hopkins and Stearne. After \"marrying\" Sara in a ceremony of his own devising and instructing her to flee to Lavenham, he rides off by himself. In the meantime, Hopkins and Stearne have become separated after a Roundhead patrol attempts to commandeer their horses. Marshall locates Stearne, but after a brutal fight, Stearne is able to escape. He reunites with Hopkins and informs him of Marshall's desire for revenge.Hopkins and Stearne enter the village of Lavenham. Marshall, on a patrol to locate the King, learns they are there and quickly rides to the village with a group of his soldier friends. Hopkins, however, having earlier learned that Sara was in Lavenham, has set a trap to capture Marshall. Hopkins and Stearne frame Marshall and Sara as witches and take them to the castle to be interrogated. Marshall watches as needles are repeatedly jabbed into Sara's back, but he refuses to confess to witchcraft, instead vowing again to kill Hopkins. He breaks free from his bonds and stamps on Stearne's face, at the same time that his army comrades approach the castle dungeon. Marshall grabs an axe and repeatedly strikes Hopkins. The soldiers enter the room and are horrified to see what their friend has done. One of them puts the mutilated but still living Hopkins out of his misery by shooting him dead.

The film then flashes back to Arseniev's surveying expedition to the area of Shkotovo in Ussuri region in 1902. A topographic expedition troop, led by Captain Arseniev (Yury Solomin), encounters a nomadic, aboriginal Goldi tribesman named Dersu Uzala (Maxim Munzuk) who agrees to guide them through the harsh frontier. Initially viewed as an uneducated, eccentric old man, Dersu earns the respect of the soldiers through his great intelligence, accurate instincts, keen powers of observation, and deep compassion. He repairs an abandoned hut and leaves provisions in a birch container so that a future traveler would survive in the wilderness. He deduces the identities and situations of people by analyzing tracks and articles left behind.Dersu Uzala saves the life of Captain Arseniev for the first time when the two are lost on a frozen lake and a sudden blizzard overtakes them. Dersu shows Arseniev how to quickly build a straw hut for shelter using grass and then, when Arseniev collapses due to exhaustion, Dersu pulls him into the shelter. The two men avoid freezing to death and are discovered by the rest of their comrades when the blizzard clears. The expedition then, struggling to survive the frozen tundra, encounter a Nani family who invite them into their home, providing the men much needed food, and warmth. At this point Dersu asks where Arseniev will go next to which Arseniev tells him \"back to the city\" and invites Dersu to come with him. Dersu tells him that his place is in the forest and that tomorrow he will go on his way. The next day he leaves the soldiers by the railroad tracks and returns to wilderness.Five years later in 1907, Arseniev is on another expedition in Ussuri. He has been mapping mountain ranges for months, all the time holding onto hope that he will run into his old friend Dersu. One night, when at camp, one of his men says they ran into an old Hunter in the forest who was asking about their unit. Instantly hopeful, Arseniev demands to know where he saw the man and rushes into the forest filled with hope of seeing is old friend. Searching the forest for a few minutes he sees Dersu walking away further into the forest. Calling for him he is overcome with joy as Dersu yells back and then men run to each other. The men embrace and Arseniev brings Dersu back to camp with him where the two sit by a fire and talk about their time apart. Dersu takes up the job of expedition guide again. The expedition breaks up as Arseniev, Dersu, and a few men cross a large river by raft, and the rest continue on to try to find a ford to cross with the horses. Arseniev and Dersu get caught on the raft as the others embark and are quickly rushed downstream. Dersu saves Arsenievs' life again by pushing him off the raft and telling him to swim toward shore. Dersu is trapped on the raft as conditions on the river are quickly deteriorating. Moments before Dersu and the raft crash into the rapids, Dersu jumps onto a branch in the middle of the river. He then directs the party to cut a tree which can reach him before he drowns. Some time passes and the men seem to be in good spirits. They take several pictures with Dersu and all seems to be going well. Arseniev writes in his journal that some of his foundest memories of Dersu occurred during the beginning of that autumn.A short time later, the expedition party is trekking through the forest when Dersu realizes they are being stalked by a Tiger. Dersu tries in vain to scare the Tiger away telling him that the soldiers will shoot him with their guns. The Tiger continues getting closer to Dersu and Arseniev until Dersu is forced to shoot the Tiger. Dersu is instantly distraught over shooting a Tiger stating that Kanga, who is a forest spirit that his people worship, will be unhappy and will send another Tiger for him. Dersu becomes more and more irritable, yelling at members of the party and distancing himself from Arseniev. Dersu's eyesight and other senses begin to fade with age until he is no longer able to hunt thus not being able to live alone in the forest.Captain Arseniev decides to take Dersu with him to the city of Khabarovsk. Dersu quickly discovers that he is not permitted to chop wood or to build a hut and fireplace in the city park, nor is he allowed to shoot within the city limits. Despite his love for Arseniev and Arsenievs' family, Dersu realizes that his place is not in the city and asks Arseniev if he can return to living in the hills. As a parting gift, Arseniev gives him a new rifle.Some while later, Arseniev receives a telegram informing him that the body of a Goldi has been found, with no identification on him save Arseniev's calling card, and is requested to come identify the body. Arseniev finds that it is indeed Dersu.

Although Lo Pan can be temporarily granted a decrepit body by supplication to the gods, in order for him to permanently break the curse and regain his human form, he must marry a woman with green eyes. This simple act will appease Ching Dai, the God of the East. But to satisfy the Emperor, he must sacrifice her. When Jack and Wang's friends attempt to save them, they are also captured, and Lo Pan notes that Gracie has green eyes, too. Lo Pan decides to sacrifice Gracie, while making Miao Yin his unwilling wife.After getting the drop on Thunder, Jack and Wang escape, also freeing many women kept in holding cells. Wang and Jack go to see Egg Shen, and with the help of the Chang Sing, they enter an underground cavern to return to Lo Pan's headquarters. Egg pours each of the group a potent potion that Jack says makes him feel \"kind of invincible.\" During the wedding ceremony, a huge fight ensues, which Jack misses due to accidentally knocking himself out. Wang kills Rain in a sword duel, while Jack and Gracie try to catch Lo Pan. Wang joins them, and just when all seems lost, Jack kills Lo Pan with a skillful knife throw. Thunder, who was in the midst of a battle with Wang, becomes enraged and feels dishonored at his failure to protect his master. He inflates to an enormous size, exploding and killing himself. Jack, Wang, Gracie, and Miao Yin are cornered by Lightning in a corridor, which he makes collapse. Egg rescues them with a rope and kills Lightning by dropping a stone Buddha statue on him when he tries to follow. After finding Jack's truck, they escape back to Wang's restaurant.Lo Pan having been defeated, the group celebrates in a warm and family-like way: Wang and Miao are obviously about to marry; Margo, Gracie's journalist friend, seems to be about to pair-up with Eddie; and Egg decides to go on a prolonged vacation, saying China is in the heart. Jack, instead of starting up a new life with Gracie (as everyone was expecting up to that point), bids farewell to the group and hits the open road, with an unknown-to-him stowaway \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of the remaining monsters from Lo Pan's labyrinth.", "output": "Question: Where did the group escape to in the end?, Answer: Wang's restaurant., Question: What is the name of the Chinese street gang who made a kidnapping attempt at the airport?, Answer: The Lords of Death, Question: What is the name of the god of the east?, Answer: Ching Dai., Question: What did the Chinese bring with them to America?, Answer: ancient knowledge and sorcery, Question: How did Egg kill Lightning?, Answer: He dropped a stone Buddha on him., Question: was jack involved in the fight at the wedding?, Answer: no, Question: Why did Jack miss the fight?, Answer: He accidentally knocked himself out., Question: Who does Jack run over while trying to escape?, Answer: Lo Pan, Question: How did Jack say the potion would make them feel?, Answer: Kind of invincible., Question: Who Killed Lo Pan?, Answer: Jack, Question: What is Jack Burton's job?, Answer: Truck driver, Question: What curse did the Emperor place on Lo Pan?, Answer: The curse of No Flesh., Question: What is Margo's profession?, Answer: Journalist, Question: Who does Wang take back to his restaurant?, Answer: Jack, Question: Where is Wang's fiancee, Miao Yin, arriving from?, Answer: China, Question: Was Lo Pan a bad warrior?, Answer: no, Question: What is Wang Chi's job?, Answer: Restaurant owner, Question: Who is Wang Chi's fiance?, Answer: Miao Yin, Question: who does Jack kill?, Answer: Lo pan, Question: Where is it thought Miao Yin is being held?, Answer: a brothel, Question: Where do Jack and Wang follow the truck to?, Answer: Chinatown, Question: Was Lo Pan a powerful wizard?, Answer: yes, Question: who does wang kill?, Answer: Rain, Question: What does Egg say is in his heart?, Answer: China, Question: Who does Wang take to his restaurant?, Answer: Jack., Question: Who is Lo Pan?, Answer: A powerful and legendary sorcerer., Question: Lo Pan is the leader of what?, Answer: The Wing Kong, Question: Whose headquarters are underground?, Answer: Lo Pan, Question: What is the magician's name?, Answer: Egg Shen, Question: Who does the group think is being held in a brothel which they plan to infiltrate?, Answer: Miao Yin.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

He has a reputation of womanizing female tourists and shows no interest in committing to a serious relationship. Henry's closest friends are Ula, a marijuana-smoking Islander; his assistant Alexa, whose gender is unclear; Willy, his pet African penguin; and Jocko, a walrus.One day Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat breaks down while he is sailing around Oahu. He goes to the Hukilau Caf\u00c3\u00a9 to wait for the Coast Guard. There he sees a young woman named Lucy Whitmore, who makes architectural art with her waffles. Henry assumes she is a local, which prevents him from introducing himself, but the next day he comes back. Lucy and he hit it off instantly and she asks him to meet her again tomorrow morning.When Henry goes back to the caf\u00c3\u00a9, Lucy shows no recollection of ever meeting him. The restaurant owner Sue (Amy Hill) explains to Henry that one year ago, Lucy and her father Marlin went up to the North Shore to pick a pineapple for his birthday. On the way back, they had a serious car accident that left Lucy with anterograde amnesia and she wakes up every morning thinking it is October 13 of last year. To save her the heartbreak of reliving the accident every day, Marlin and Doug, Lucy's lisping steroid-addicted brother, re-enact Marlin's birthday by following a script, including putting out October 13's Sunday newspaper, re-watching the same Vikings game, and refilling Lucy's shampoo bottles.Despite Sue's warning, Henry invites Lucy to have breakfast with him. Eventually she does, but it ends poorly when Henry unintentionally hurts Lucy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings. He follows her home to apologize where Marlin and Doug instruct Henry to leave Lucy alone. Henry begins concocting ways to run into Lucy on the following days, such as pretending to have car trouble, creating a fake road block, or by having Ula beat him up. Eventually, Marlin and Doug figure this out due to Lucy singing The Beach Boys' \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" on the days when she meets Henry.One day, as Henry is about to sit with Lucy at breakfast, she notices a police officer writing her a ticket for her expired plates. Lucy attempts to argue that they are not yet expired, and takes a newspaper to prove herself, but sees that the date on all the newspapers is not October as she thought, and Marlin and Doug are forced to admit their ruse when she confronts them.Henry comes up with an idea to make a video explaining to Lucy her accident and their relationship. Although Lucy is upset over understanding about her accident and memory loss, Henry believes that she is more upset realizing her life is a lie every day. Because of this, Henry, Marlin and Doug show Lucy the tape every morning and help her spend her days by picking up where the tape says she left off. She spends more time with Henry and goes to see some of her old friends. Lucy decides to erase Henry completely from her life after learning of his decision not to take a sailing trip to Bristol Bay to study walruses, something he has been planning for the past 10 years. Although Henry would rather spend that year making Lucy fall in love with him everyday rather than go on the sailing trip, Lucy is convinced she is a burden on him and is preventing Henry from really living his life. Henry reluctantly helps Lucy destroy her journal entries of their relationship.A few weeks later, Henry is preparing to leave for his sailing trip. Before he departs, Marlin tells him that Lucy is now living at the brain institute and teaching an art class. He also tells him that she sings. Then he gives Henry a Beach Boys CD. Listening to the CD, Henry becomes emotional and curses Marlin for giving him the CD and causing him to miss Lucy. He then remembers that Marlin once told him that Lucy only sings after she meets him. Concluding that Lucy remembers him, he returns home. Henry rushes to the brain institute where Lucy now resides and asks if she knows who he is. Lucy says she does not know him but shows him the pictures she has painted of him, saying she dreams about him every night.Some time later, Lucy wakes up and plays a video tape marked \"Good Morning Lucy.\" It again informs her of her accident, but ends with her and Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wedding. On the tape, Henry says to put a jacket on and come have breakfast when she is ready. Lucy then sees that she is on Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat, which finally made it to Alaska.

To Julie Sentash [Patience Collier], the castle nurse, he leaves 1,000 koronas and food and lodging for the rest of her days. To Master Fabio [Maurice Denham], the castle historian, he leaves his library. To Lt Imre Toth [Sander Eles], son of his old army companion, he leaves his stable, horses, and cottage. To his aging wife Elisabeth [Ingrid Pitt], he leaves his estate to be shared equally with their only child Ilona. And to Captain Dobi [Nigel Green], the castle steward, he leaves his arms and uniforms. Dobi isn't pleased with his bequeathal after 20 years of service, but there is one thing he's happy about. After 20 years as the Countess's secret lover, Dobi finally has her to himself. Not that the Countess is equally as happy to have Dobi, for she is too distracted by young Imre's good looks and youthful manhood.However, there is much to do. Ilona, who has lived in Vienna since she was six years old and is now a grown woman of 19 years, is returning to the castle on the morrow. The Countess, who is not known for her kindness, is preparing to bathe, when she notices that chambermaid Teri [Susan Brodrick] has made the bathwater too hot. After chastizing Teri, Elisabeth requests a peach. The frightened maid, in slicing the peach, also slices herself. Some of her blood spills on the Countess' face, and Elisabeth later notices that she looks much younger. Dobi is astonished at the change in Elisabeth, but he won't go so far as to bring Teri to her, so Elisabeth goes to Teri. The next morning, Teri is missing, and Elisabeth looks half her age. Knowing that her daughter is due to arrive and not wanting any competition, Elisabeth arranges to have Ilona [Lesley-Anne Down] kidnapped en route and held captive in a cabin in the woods with only the mute old gamekeeper Janco [Peter May] for companionship. That evening at dinner, Elisabeth presents herself as her daughter, saying that her mother is not feeling well. Imre is smitten with her beauty and so starts the love affair between Ilona/Elisabeth and young Imre...much to Dobi's dismay.Two nights the lovers spend in each other's arms, and Elisabeth has never been happier. Then, sometime during the second night, she suddenly reverts to her old self (literally). Knowing that Elisabeth must have the blood of another girl, Julie invites a gypsy girl [Nike Arrighi] into the castle to read Elisabeth's fortune and become her next victim. And so it goes. Imre courts Ilona/Elisabeth, Julie finds fresh blood every few nights, and Dobi seethes in jealousy. Imre, utterly obsessed with Elisabeth, asks her to marry him. Elisabeth says yes.Dobi has had enough. He wants his Elisabeth back and decides to set Imre up. Dobi and Imre go drinking together one night, and Dobi arranges for Ziza [Andrea Lawrence], the pub whore, to accompany Imre home and sleep with him. Dobi makes Elisabeth watch. Elisabeth decides to use Ziza's blood when she suddenly turns old again, but it doesn't work. Master Fabio, who is beginning to catch on, informs them that it must be the blood of a virgin, so Dobi buys the plainest girl he can find, thinking she could only be a virgin. Elisabeth's beauty restored, she begins to make plans for the wedding.Meanwhile, Ilona has a plan to escape her captivity. She pretends to offer herself to the mute. While he is slobbering over her, Ilona steals the key from his pocket and gets away...only to fall into a stream where he catches her and carries her back. Fabio is getting wise, so Dobi has him hanged. Then Dobi takes Imre to Elisabeth who confesses her real identity. Imre is appalled, but Elisabeth assures him that he will be charged with the whore's murder if he should leave her, so there is no escape for him. Plus, the chief bailiff sends away all the serving girls and sequesters the castle until Fabio's killer can be found. With all the girls gone, Elisabeth has no virgins at hand, so she pleads with Dobi to sneak a girl into the castle for when needed. Dobi promises to do so, but the girl he brings is Elisabeth's own daughter, the real Ilona. When Julie finds out that Ilona, the child she nannied since birth, is to be the next sacrifice, she can tolerate Elisabeth's depravities no longer. She introduces Imre to Ilona and tells him that he must get Julie away. They make plans for Julie to free Ilona tomorrow during the wedding ceremony.It is the day of the wedding. Elisabeth is radiant. Imre is resolved to his fate. As the ceremony begins, Julie fetches Ilona and leads her to escape. But Ilona hears the music and the priest's voice and refuses to go until she's had a peek. As Ilona watches, Elisabeth suddenly turns old, shocking the priest. Elisabeth runs out, looking for she who is to be the next victim. Imre tries to stop her, but he is stabbed and killed by the knife being carried by Elisabeth herself.

Hopkins had been a famous distance rider, a cowboy, and a dispatch rider for the United States government; in the latter capacity he carried a message to the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment authorizing the Wounded Knee Massacre of Lakota Sioux.Wealthy Sheikh Riyadh (Omar Sharif) has sent his attach\u00c3\u00a9 Aziz (Adam Alexi-Malle) to ask the show to either stop using the phrase \"the world's greatest distance horse and rider\" or allow Hopkins and Hidalgo to prove themselves by entering the Middle Eastern \"Ocean of Fire\" race: an annual 3,000-mile survival race across the Najd desert region. The Sheikh is custodian of the al-Khamsa line, considered to be the greatest distance horses in the world, and traditionally the race has been restricted to pure-bred Arabian horses and Bedouin or Arab riders.In addition to the grueling conditions, prevailing animosity and contempt for a Christian \"infidel\" and \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpure\u00e2\u0080\u009d horse, horse and rider face stiff competition, including the wealthy and unscrupulous British horse breeder Lady Anne Davenport (Louise Lombard).To complicate matters, Sheikh Riyadh has promised his daughter Jazira Jazeera (Zuleikha Robinson), his only surviving child, in marriage to the rider of his horse, should he win. She hopes to prevent this by giving Hopkins advice and information to help him win, thereby resulting in greater danger for them both. Sheikh Riyadh's outcast brigand nephew, who will stop at nothing to gain control of the al-Khamsa line, raids the race camp, kidnaps Jazira, and threatens to kill her unless he gets his uncle's prize stallion racer as her ransom. Hopkins manages to rescue Jazira. However, Davenport and the Sheikh's nephew try to sabotage the race by eliminating the rival riders, but are thwarted when Hopkins kills the nephew.For Hopkins the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride, honor and survival, but of identity as well: it emerges that his father was European American while his mother was Lakota Sioux. The Lakota call him \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlue Child\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cFar Rider.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As a half-breed he feels sympathy and pity for his mother's people, but does not generally reveal his heritage, especially after the Wounded Knee massacre, for which he feels partly responsible. Jazira compares his relation to his heritage to her desire to avoid wearing the veil, saying that he mustn't \"go through life hiding what God made you....like me.\"Nearing the end of the race, Hidalgo is severely injured and Hopkins is dying of thirst. He considers shooting Hidalgo to end his suffering, but is unable to bring himself to do it. Kneeling, he chants a prayer to Wakan Tanka as a possible death song, and images of Lakota elders and his mother appear before him before Hidalgo suddenly struggles up, and Hopkins rides bareback to come from behind win the race. Hopkins wins the respect and admiration of the Arabs, and becomes friends with the Sheikh, giving him his revolver as a gift. As he bids farewell to an unveiled Jazira, she asks him if he is fulfilling the traditional Western tales' ending where the cowboy rides away into the setting sun and calls him Blue Child as she smiles kindly at him and turns to go.Returning to the United States, Hopkins uses his winnings to buy a herd of mustangs about to be killed by government order, in what was an attempt by the US government to eliminate mustangs and force Native Americans to convert to farming. Hopkins has the horses released and frees Hidalgo to join them in the wild. The epilogue states that Hopkins went on to reportedly win 400 long-distance races and was an outspoken supporter for wild mustangs until his death in 1951, while Hidalgo's descendants live free in the wild in and around Oklahoma.", "output": "Question: What massacre was mentioned?, Answer: wounded knee, Question: Who plays the role of wealthy Sheikh Riyadh?, Answer: Omar Sharif, Question: What is Hopkins father?, Answer: european american, Question: The Sheikh's nephew wants what as his ransom?, Answer: prize stallion, Question: Who is Frank Hopkins' mustang?, Answer: Hidalgo, Question: What show are Frank and Hidalgo part of?, Answer: Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, Question: Who is dying of thirst?, Answer: Hopkins, Question: Who does Hidalgo bid farewell to?, Answer: Jazira, Question: Under whose custody is the al-Khamsa line?, Answer: Sheikh, Question: Who is the Sheikh's nephew's partner in crime?, Answer: Davenport, Question: Who uses his winnings to buy a herd of mustangs?, Answer: Hopkins, Question: What is the name of the wealthy and unscrupulous British horse breeder?, Answer: Lady Anne Davenport, Question: Who is severely injured?, Answer: Hidalgo, Question: Who gives Hopkins advice on horse racing?, Answer: Jazira Jazeera, Question: What do the Lakota call Hopkins?, Answer: blue child or far rider, Question: Who is the ancestor of the mustangs living free in and around Oklahoma?, Answer: Hidalgo", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The game is fairly straightforward, each player is assigned another player who they must assassinate by shooting him or her with a spring loaded dart gun. At the outset of the game each player is given a document called a Tag Victim Profile that contains a photo, the name, address, phone and class schedule of the player who he/she must kill. After a player completes the assignment he/she then takes over the assignment of the person who he/she killed and then notifies the game organizer, Nick Carpenter, of the kill so he can plot the kill on his game progress chart. Play continues in this manner until only one player remains at which point he or she is declared the winner.The movie follows the exploits of 2 TAG players, Susan Swayze who is playing for the first time and Loren Gersh who is the 5 time undefeated TAG champion looking to repeat yet again. He doesn't have much of a life besides playing TAG and devotes all his time to following players around and taking them out. At least one of these two characters is in every scene except for a few isolated occasions where the camera is concentrating on Alex Marsh. The only time other TAG players are shown is when they are interacting with Susan or Gersh.The movie opens with Gersh standing in a dorm hallway wearing a Get Smart style hat and trench coat while hiding behind a newspaper with eye holes cut out. His target approaches but then the target sees him and slowly backs away as he draws his dart gun but for some reason he is carrying an empty gun. When his target realizes he has no darts he turns and runs away as Gersh casually strolls after him Pepe' le Pew fashion. The target goes down a set of stairs and hides under a grate. On the sidewalk above footsteps are heard approaching and then leaving. Suddenly Gersh appears out of the dark, greets him, loads his dart gun and fires. The dart sticks to the forehead of the target and he then utters an expletive as he pulls it off.The next scene features Susan walking outside of a dorm as the clock tower strikes 9pm. While she is looking at the profile of her target, Shooster, she notices a car signaling somone in a dorm room by flashing its headlights then the person in dorm room responds by turning the room lights on and off. In the meantime someone else is in a phone booth in front of the dorm and says, \"she's right here I can't talk\". Susan brushes the signaling off and enters the dorm anyway. Shooster makes sure that Susan sees him then walks down the stairs to the laundry room with a laundry basket in his hands. She follows him and enters the laundry room but it appears to be empty. She doesn't see that he is hiding in a dark corner behind a dryer. As she is about to leave she hears him move and opens a washing machine door just in time for it to block a dart that was headed for her. They proceed to shoot at one another until she can't find another dart at which point she runs away. He finds a dart, loads his gun and follows. To escape Susan ducks into Alex Marsh's dorm room to hide. Alex tries to talk to her but she shushes him. Susan leaves almost as abruptly as she entered. Alex gets out of bed and opens his door to see where she went. Susan walks down the hall as Shooster and Charlie, another player, suddenly pop out of different doors with Susan in the middle of them. As they fire Alex tells Susan to look out, she ducks and they end up shooting one another instead. The three players walk away together laughing as Alex stands speechless in his underwear. Alex finds Susan extremely attractive so he is determined to find her to try to get to know her. Alex writes for the school paper and plans to use the pretext of writing an article about TAG to meet Susan and follow her around. He visits the office of Nick Carpenter, the game organizer, locates Susan's file and discovers where she lives.Susan's roomate Nancy is also playing TAG and in fact it is made clear later that she is the one who got Susan involved in the game. Nancy and Susan realize they are being followed by Nancy's assassin, Randy, so Nancy decides to use a trick to get rid of him. Susan observes while Nancy goes to the pool, changes into her bathing suit, hides a mini-dart gun in her bikini bottom and then pretends to drown in the pool. Randy jumps in with his clothes on to save her but after he lifts her out of the pool she shoots him with a dart.In the meantime another TAG player, Swanson, is heading to the bathroom to take a shower. He has his dart gun with him and places it on the soap dish in the shower stall. Gersh is hiding in a stall with his feet on the toilet so that Swanson doesn't know he is in the bathroom. Gersh opens the shower curtain and while lecturing him about not being careful enough, Swanson knocks his dart gun on the floor. The gun hits the floor, fires and the dart hits Gersh. Gersh is extremely upset at being hit for the first time and protests that it doesn't count because it was an accident. He then unsuccessfully tries to bribe Swanson to start over as if nothing had happened. To preventSwanson from reporting him dead to Carpenter, he retrieves a real Beretta 92 from his dorm room, returns to the shower and murders him. He then uses a laundry cart to wheel the corpse to his dorm room closet.Alex goes to visit Susan and tells her that he is writing an article about TAG and needs to follow a player around in order to learn about the game. Susan agrees to let him accompany her only if he helps her win, he agrees and she gives him his first assignment, to go warm up her car. In the meantime, after contemplating his actions, Gersh is somewhat depressed and calls Carpenter to tell him he killed Swanson as if asking for guidance. Carpenter doesn't realize he means he killed Swanson for real, he thinks he meant he shot him with a dart. So Carpenter notes the kill on his progress chart and tells Gersh to keep up the good work. Carpenter's encouragement cheers Gersh up and at that point the limited remaining grasp he had on reality vanishes. Though he has no need to use the real Beretta to silence anyone else, he proceeds to use it to murder the remaining contestants unlucky enough to become one of his assigned kills and also dumps their bodies in his closet.Next Alex starts Susan's car as some girls, who are obviously out to get Susan, are snickering in the background. Susan yells for him to drive and pick her up. As he does the girls come out of the dark giving chase on foot but the car pulls away too fast for them to get a shot off. Susan has Alex park in the Delta House fraternity lot next to the car of her target. Alex questions Susan while they wait for her target to come out. Susan loses track of time and realizes he closed his room light and is approaching. She kisses Alex just as her victim reaches her car with his gun drawn. He figures they are just making out so he turns around to get in his car. Susan then shoots him in the back through her window which was rolled down.In the next scene Nancy and Susan are in class. Nancy tells Susan she is dating Randy and that she is not playing TAG anymore because instead she going to Randy's track practice then she is going away with Randy to his Parent's beach house and the following day to a concert together. Gersh is seen in the widow spying on them. It shortly becomes clear that Nancy is the one he is targeting. He tails her to the track meet and sneaks under the bleachers right behind her. Gersh shoots and kills her at the same exact time the coach fires a blank to start the race. Gersh then reports the kill to Carpenter and transports her body to his room.Frank, who is apparently an editor at the school paper, approaches Alex and tells him that there are two missing students and tries to convince him to write an article about it but Alex tells him he is still busy with his TAG feature. At first blush it appears that the second missing student was Nancy. However, it is implied that both are males because not even their \"girlfriends\" know where they are and is later revealed that this second missing student was a different TAG player who Gersh killed. The second kill was never shown on film nor does Gersh report it to Carpenter anywhere in the movie, which would have cleared things up sooner. Thus the audience is not aware of it and most assume the report was referring to Nancy. This makes one wonder why Susan is not worried. Randy eventually reports Nancy missing towards the end of the movie and since Nancy told her that she was going away Susan never suspects anything is wrong by her absence.Alex goes to meet Susan but can't find her at first. Susan calls the Campus Information desk and asks to speak to Alex. She tells him that she is hiding in the nearby phone booth and needs his help because she is out of darts and her assigned assassin, Wallace, is waiting outside the phone booth to get her. He makes an announcement over the loudspeaker that there is a free concert in a different hall and a large crowd including Wallace run to the location of the alleged concert. This permits Susan to escape and they spend the day together.Later that evening while Susan and Alex are spying on Gowdy, her assigned target, she notices that Wallace is again tracking her. She tells Marsh to keep an eye on Gowdy while she goes off to get rid of Wallace. She goes to the pool locker room and changes into her bathing suit, planning to try the same drowning trick that Nancy demonstrated to her. In the meantime Alex sees Gersh lurking about and asks him if he is looking for Wallace. Gersh answers yes and Alex tells him to go to the pool to find him. While Susan is under the water Gersh shoots and kills Wallace. Susan exits the pool perplexed and while searching for Wallace encounters Alex who tells her he took care of Wallace but lost Gowdy. They run to the athletic building and again part company as she says she will take the front and he should take the back.While lying in wait Susan shoots Alex as he walks through the door thinking he is Gowdy. Alex then proceeds to step on the dart breaking it. Susan states that she had only one dart for her mini dart gun and asks Alex to go back to her locker to get her primary weapon while she spies on Gowdy. Gowdy returns and starts searching rooms, the last room is where Susan is hiding. Alex is unable to remember the locker combination and thus fails to get her gun. He sees Gersh and runs up to him and asks if he got Wallace. Then he said he did Gersh a favor and in return wants to borrow Gersh's gun. Gersh gives him the dart gun and Alex tosses it to Susan just in time for her to shoot Gowdy before he found her. Naturally the final two players left at this point are Gersh and Susan.Game rules dictate that a party be held before the final round between the two remaining players can commence so a party is scheduled the next evening and play is suspended for a 21 hour period until after the party ends. Susan and Alex use the break to spend the night together in her room. Alex leaves in the morning but proceeds to smother her throughout the day with flowers and notes professing his love. Susan is put off and tries to avoid him and refuses to answer her phone. When he approaches her at the party she tells him she needs space and is not sure when and if she wants to see him again. She tells him that she wants to handle the final round on her own rather than with his help, despite telling him the previous night that she wanted his help.After the party the final round commences. At 9pm Gersh calls Susan and challenges her to meet him in the quad. During the course of playing cat and mouse Susan hides in Gersh's room to try a sneak attack when he returns but she finds the corpses in the closet and runs away screaming in panic. Interestingly only 3 bodies are shown, Nancy, Swanson and Wallace, despite the fact it is later implied that he murdered 5. Gersh sees her running from his room and tries to get her before she can tell anyone. She runs screaming to the College rent-a-cop but as he loads a round into his revolver Gersh shoots and kills him. He proceeds to chase her to the roof of a building.In the meantime Alex drowns his sorrows with journalistic work, specifically investigating the rash of missing college students. He visits campus security as Randy is reporting Nancy missing. At this point it becomes clear that Nancy was not the second missing student, another player was. Apparently 2 players never shown in the film were killed offscreen, one named M. Homes and the other we are simply given the last name March. Alex recognizes Wallace and pieces together that all the missing students played TAG and were taken out by Gersh. He surmises that Gersh harmed them for real and then sets out in search of Susan to warn her. Alex finds the dead security guard and picks up the gun not realizing there was only 1 round in it. Then he hears the sound of glass breaking coming from the rooftop and runs to investigate. Gersh is about to shoot Susan when Alex appears. Alex fires at Gersh but nothing happens and then fires 4 more times to no avail. Gersh is amused by this and at first simply laughs but after the 5th click he takes aim at Alex. Alex pulls the trigger one final time and at last a bullet fires hitting Gersh who then falls off the roof to his death. The movie ends with Alex consoling Susan.", "output": "Question: who play a game with suction cup dart toy guns?, Answer: a group of students, Question: what is the name of the student?, Answer: Alex, Susan, Question: Who does Gersh transform?, Answer: He transforms himself from a avid player to a cold blooded killer, Question: dart gun hits whom?, Answer: Gersh, Question: Gersh kills whom?, Answer: victims", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Besides wanting to win the poker championship for the money, he also wants to prove, once and for all, that he is 'the best'. However, complications keep getting in the way.Maverick rides into the fictional town of Crystal River intending to collect money owed to him, as he is $3000 short of the poker tournament entry fee of $25,000. His efforts to make up this $3000 provide some plot motivation, as well as diversions caused by, and in the company of, three people he encounters at Crystal River-an antagonist named Angel (Alfred Molina), a young con-artist calling herself Mrs Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), and legendary lawman Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner, who played Bret Maverick in the original TV series). The first two are also rival poker players.Maverick, Bransford and Cooper share a stagecoach (the driver of which dies at the reins at full gallop), agree to help a wagon train of migrant evangelist settlers who have been waylaid by ruffians (for a fee which Maverick in the end is too big-hearted to accept) and are headed-off by a troop of Indians led by \"Joseph\" (Graham Greene). Unknown to his companions, Joseph and Maverick are good friends, and Maverick allows himself to be \"captured.\" Joseph is another one of his unreliable debtors, and in and around his tribal grounds they collaborate on a scheme to swindle a Russian Grand Duke.During this time, Angel has received a mysterious telegram ordering him to not allow Maverick to reach the poker game, and has also learned that Maverick had conned him in Crystal River. These scenes are some of the very few which do not involve Maverick directly. Angel catches up with Maverick after he has left Joseph's tribe, beats him up and attempts to hang him. Despite being tied to both a tree and to his horse, Maverick escapes and reaches the poker game-on a paddle steamer-safely. Bransford and Angel have also reached the game, and Cooper who is engaged to ensure the security of the game.After preliminary rounds, the four finalists are Maverick, Bransford, Angel, and the Commodore of the boat (James Coburn). Maverick almost fails to reach the final table by the 5:00am deadline, having had his stateroom door chained (by an unknown person) after a short tryst with Bransford. The game proceeds, with Bransford the first eliminated, and shortly thereafter a \"fixed\" hand is dealt to the three remaining players. The Commodore is given four 8s and Angel is given a low straight flush, whilst Maverick has the 10, Jack, Queen and King of Spades. The Commodore and Angel each bet \"all in\" (inferring that Maverick is the chip leader at this stage). Maverick observes the dealer bottom-dealing to the others, protests the conduct of the hand, and eventually accepts one card dealt by Angel and calls the bets without checking the card. It is, melodramatically, the Ace of Spades (Note that a 9 of Spades would also have won the hand for Maverick). An enraged Angel draws his gun but he, and his stooges in the audience, are gunned down in rapid succession by Cooper and Maverick (drawing one of Cooper's guns).Three plot twists follow Maverick's win: Firstly, Cooper steals the $500,000 prize money instead of presenting it to Maverick. Secondly, it is revealed that the Commodore and Cooper were secretly in cahoots on the theft and that Angel had actually been working for the Commodore. Thirdly, Maverick ambushes the two around a campfire and steals back the money. He leaves them with a single gun to settle their affairs. Cooper beats up the Commodore and angrily vows to wreak bloody vengeance on Maverick, even if it means hunting him to the ends of the earth.Later, Maverick is relaxing in a bath-house when Cooper finds him, and drops the facade to reveal (to the audience) that he is in fact Maverick's father. It is also revealed that the real conspiracy was between the two of them. Suddenly, however, Bransford enters the bath-house and robs Cooper and Maverick (whose relationship she had easily surmised). However, she only gets away with half of the money she had expected, as Maverick had hidden the rest in his boots. Maverick smiles and comments that it will be a lot of fun getting the rest of the money back from her.", "output": "Question: How much money does Maverick need?, Answer: $3000.00 dollars., Question: Who is in cahoots with Cooper?, Answer: The Commodore, Question: What does Mrs. Annabelle Brasford do for a living?, Answer: Con-artist, Question: Who does Cooper beat up?, Answer: The Commodore., Question: What town does Maverick go to collect money?, Answer: Crystal River, Question: What is the relationship between Joseph and Maverick?, Answer: Friendship., Question: Who do Maverick and Joseph want to swindle?, Answer: the Russian Grand Duke, Question: Who steals the $500,000 grand prize?, Answer: Cooper, Question: What is the deadline for the final table?, Answer: 5am, Question: Who is Mavericks father?, Answer: Cooper.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

On this, her last night in the nursery, Wendy tells her most thrilling tale of Peter Pan and Captain Hook unaware that Peter and his fairy companion, Tinkerbell and Peter are outside the nursery windonw listening intently.

They are heading home to their families, stealing food at the markets, getting drunk, and hassling young ladies along the way. As more and more students reach their homes, the only ones left traveling are Khoma Brut [Leonid Kuravlev] and his two friends, Khaliava [Vadim Zakharchenko] and Gorobetz [Vladimir Salnikov]. As evening approaches, it becomes foggy and the road has disappeared, so they start looking for a place where they can spend the night and get a glass of vodka. Just when it looks like they're going to be forced to spend the night under the stars, they come to a house. An old woman [ Nikolai Kutuzov] answers their knocks on the gate. At first, she refuses to put them up for the night, but she finally relents. One gets to sleep in the house, another in the loft, and Khoma gets stuck with a haypile near the pigpen. During the night, Khoma is awakened by the old lady's advances on him. She chases him around the barn until she catches him, jumps on his back, grabs her broom, and the two of them go flying. Khoma realizes that the old hag is a witch. By invoking the name of Christ, he brings her back to earth. He finds a stick and beats her royally until she suddenly turns into a beautiful young girl. Leaving the girl lying on the ground, Khoma runs all the way back to the Monastery.No sooner does Khoma return but the Rector [Pyotr Vesklyarov] summons him. The Rector informs Khoma that he has been contacted by a famous Sotnik [Aleksei Glazyrin] living near Kiev. The Sotnik's daughter Pannochka [Natalya Varley] is dying from a beating she received the other day, and her dying request was that Khoma Brut be the one to say the last prayers for her salvation. Khoma refuses the job, but the Rector gives him no choice. Either say the prayers or receive lashings in front of the entire seminary. Against his will, Khoma goes along with the servants sent by the Sotnik to fetch him. It's a long drive in a horse-drawn wagon, and Khoma tries to get away several times. Each time he is prevented from leaving by the servants. Yet, when he asks the servants why the girl needs to have such solemn prayers said for the deliverance of her soul, they are strangely silent.When Khoma gets to the Solnik's house, he learns that Pannochka, has requested that he, Khoma Brut, say prayers over her for three nights in a row. Kohma is roundly questioned by the dead girl's father about his chastity, but Khoma denies ever knowing her that way. The vigil is set to start that night. Pannochka's body is moved into the church, and Khoma is served dinner, during which the villagers tell stories about how Pannochka has bewitched men in the past. Later that evening, Khoma is locked in the church where Pannochka's body is lying in state. He lights candles to chase away the gloom, sets up a pedestal, and begins to pray. Feeling pretty chipper at his praying ability, he sniffs a little tobacco. Unfortunately, his sniffs awaken Pannochka's corpse. She sits up in her coffin and wafts down to the floor. Now knowing that Pannochka is indeed a witch, Khoma draws a circle around his pedestal. For the rest of the night, until cockcrow, Khoma prays as Pannochka searches the room and circles the pedestal looking for a way to get to him.The next day, Khoma eats his borscht and, when asked how the night went, he admits only to hearing some noises. Calling himself a Cossack, he convinces himself that Cossacks have no fear. When night comes, armed with a bit of vodka, Khoma bravely agrees to be holed up in the church for his second night. He again draws a circle and begins his prayers. Pannochka awakens and, for the rest of the night, she circles the room, riding in her coffin, looking for Khoma and calling out his name. At cockcrow, she again returns to her coffin.Day three. Khoma emerges from the church, dancing and singing mindlessly until he takes off his hat and the villagers notice that his hair has turned white. Khoma pleads with the Solnik to let him return home, but the Solnik offers him a thousand pieces of gold or a thousand lashes. Once more, Khoma tries to escape the village, but he is met by two Cossacks who stop him. Armed with several flasks of vodka, Khoma enters the church for night three. Once again, Khoma draws his circle and begins his prayers. This night, however, Pannochka summons demons from hell. They rise from the floors, crawl out of the walls, and drop from the ceilings. Then, Pannochka summons the big demon, Viy. Viy points his finger at Khoma and directs all the other demons to get him. The demons penetrate the circle and jump on Khoma.When the villagers open the church doors at sunrise, they find Khoma dead. Back at the Seminary, Khoma's friends Khaliava and Gorobetz discuss Khoma's desmise. Their conclusion: Khoma didn't have enough faith in God. Or maybe he had too much vodka.

Jule is a waitress struggling to pay off a \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100,000 debt she incurred a year ago when she crashed into a Mercedes-Benz S-Class belonging to a wealthy businessman named Hardenberg (Burghart Klau\u00c3\u009fner). After her eviction for non-payment of rent she moves in with Peter and Jan, who are often out all night. While Peter is in Barcelona, Jan tells Jule that he and Peter spend their nights \"educating\" upper-class people by breaking into their houses, moving furniture around and leaving notes saying \"die fetten Jahre sind vorbei\" (\"the days of plenty are over\") or \"Sie haben zu viel Geld\" (\"you have too much money\").After hearing this, Jule convinces the reluctant Jan to break into Hardenberg's home in the affluent Berlin suburb of Zehlendorf while he is away on business. During the break-in, the thrill of the moment entices them to kiss before Jan leaves Jule alone for a few minutes; he does not want to destroy his friendship with Peter. As she wanders around outside Jule accidentally sets off the house's floodlights, and they quickly leave.When Peter returns the next day, Jan and Jule do not tell him about their activities the night before. Jule realises that her mobile phone is gone, and she and Jan leave later that night to look for it in the house. After she finds it, Hardenberg walks in the door and struggles with Jule when he recognises her. Hearing them, Jan comes downstairs and knocks Hardenberg unconscious with a flashlight. Not knowing what to do, they call Peter and he comes to their aid.The three cannot decide what to do with Hardenberg and take him to a remote, rarely used cabin belonging to Jule's uncle in the Tyrolean Austrian Alps near Jenbach, overlooking Achensee. As they try to decide how to deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the Socialist German Student Union, he was a good friend of Rudi Dutschke before marrying, getting a good job and abandoning his ideals.As the story progresses, political ideology and the characters' relationships become the main issues. Peter and Jan temporarily fall out over Jan's developing romance with Jule, and Hardenberg seems to regain some of his former self.The trio finally decide that kidnapping Hardenberg was wrong and take him back to his house to let him go. As they prepare to leave, Hardenberg gives Jule a letter forgiving her debt and promising not to involve the police. The film ends with Peter, Jan and Jule asleep in the same bed as a group of heavily armed police (Spezialeinsatzkommando)[note 3] gather outside their flat and knock on the door. Jule wakes up when she hears a knock, and the police force their way into the almost-empty flat. Apparently in Barcelona, Jule opens the door to a hotel maid who wishes to clean their room. In the Berlin apartment, the police find a note: \"Manche Menschen \u00c3\u00a4ndern sich nie\" (\"some people never change\").

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Several months after the events of The Fly, Veronica Quaife delivers Seth Brundle's child. After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, owner of Bartok Industries (the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments). Fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a housefly (a condition that Martin has inherited), Bartok plans to exploit the child's unique condition.Martin grows up in a clinical environment, and is constantly subjected to studies and tests by scientists. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease. As Martin grows, Bartok befriends him.At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a Golden Retriever. The next night, he brings the dog some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but were unable to duplicate his programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects. Using the Golden Retriever as a test subject, the experiment fails, leaving the dog horribly deformed. The dog attacks and maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin.Two years later, Martin's body has matured to that of a 25-year-old. On his fifth birthday, Bartok presents Martin with a bungalow on the Bartok facility's property. He also offers Martin a job: repair his father's Telepods. He apologizes about the Golden Retriever and assures Martin that its suffering was brief. When Martin is uneasy about the proposition, and Bartok shows him Veronica Quaife's videotapes, which documented Seth Brundle's progress with the Telepods. Seeing his late father describe how the Telepods ostensibly improved and energized his body, Martin accepts Bartok's proposal.As he begins work on the Telepods, Martin befriends an employee, Beth Logan, and they grow closer. Beth invites Martin to a party at the specimens division, where he overhears some scientists and learns that the mutated Golden Retriever is still kept alive and studied. Thinking Beth is aware of the dog's imprisonment, Martin argues with her, leaves the party, and goes to the animal's holding pen. The deformed dog, in terrible pain, still remembers Martin, and he tearfully euthanizes it with chloroform. Martin reconciles with Beth, and rearrives at his father's \"eureka\" moment when he realizes the Telepod's computer need to be creative to analyze living flesh. Martin then shows Beth his perfected Telepods by teleporting a kitten without harm. They become lovers, but Martin begins showing signs of his eventual mutation into a human-fly hybrid. Martin devises a potential cure for his condition, which involves swapping out his mutated genes for healthy human genes. Martin shelves this idea when he realizes the other person would be subject to a grotesque genetic disfigurement.Eventually, Martin learns that Bartok has hidden cameras in his bungalow, and has been lying to him for his entire life. Martin breaks into Bartok's records room, where he learns of his father's true fate. Bartok confronts Martin and explains that he's been waiting for his inevitable mutation. He reveals his plan to use Martin's body and the Telepods' potential for genetic manipulation for profit. Martin's dormant insect genes fully awakens, and his transformation into a human-insect hybrid begins. He escapes from Bartok Industries. Bartok is unable to use the Telepods, as it is locked by a password. Martin also installed a computer virus which will erase the Telepods' programming if the wrong \"magic word\" is entered. Bartok orders a search for Martin.Martin goes to Beth, explains the situation, and the two flee. They visit Veronica Quaife's old confidant, Stathis Borans, who is now a reclusive, embittered drunk after her death. Borans confirms for Martin that the Telepods are his only chance for a cure. They keep running, but Martin's physical and emotional changes become too much for Beth to handle, and she eventually surrenders them both to Bartok. Without revealing the password, he becomes fully enveloped in a cocoon and enters the final stages of his transformation. Bartok interrogates Beth for the \"magic word.\" Shortly after, the fully transformed \"Martinfly\" emerges from his cocoon and indiscriminately kills the scientists and security guards. A trace of his humanity remains, as shown when he doesn't harm a rottweiler and spares Beth when he encounters her during his rampage.Martinfly breaks into Bay 17. He grabs Bartok and forces him to type in the password (revealed to be \"DAD\"). He then drags Bartok and himself into a Telepod. Martinfly gestures Beth to activate the gene-swapping sequence and, despite Bartok's protests, Beth complies. Martin is restored to a fully human form, while Bartok is transformed into a freakish monster that can barely crawl around.The Bartok-creature is placed in a specimen pit similar to the one he had kept the mutated dog.

The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Michail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (\"V\u00e5r Tids Hj\u00e4lte\" in the film), and caressing a blurry image of Elisabet and/or Alma's faces.A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera. As the two women leave the hospital together, Alma reads aloud a letter Elisabet's husband has sent her, which includes a photograph of her young son.Together in the administrator's cottage, Elisabet begins to relax, though she remains completely silent and non-responsive. Alma speaks constantly to break the silence, at first about books she is reading and trivial matters, then increasingly about her own anxieties and relationship with her fianc\u00e9, Karl-Henrik, who scolds her for lacking ambition \"though not with my career, I suppose in some greater way.\" Alma constantly compares herself to Elisabet and begins to grow attached to her. As the act closes, Alma confesses to cheating on her fianc\u00e9 in a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 quatre with underage boys. She became pregnant, and had Karl-Henrik's friend abort the baby; \"and that was that\". She is not sure how to process the abortion mentally. Elisabet is heard to say \"You ought to go to bed, or you'll fall asleep at the table\", but Alma dismisses it as a dream. Elisabet later denies speaking.Alma drives into town, taking Elisabet's letters for the postbox, but parks by the roadside to read what she wrote. She discovers in Elisabet's letters that Elisabet has been analyzing her and \"studying\" her. Alma returns distraught, accidentally breaks a drinking glass on the footpath, and leaves the shards there to cut Elisabet. When Elisabet's feet start to bleed, her gaze meets Alma's knowingly, and the film itself breaks apart: the screen flashes white, scratch marks appear up and down the image, the sound rises and screeches, and the film appears to unwind as brief flashes of the prelude reappear for fractions of a second each.When the film resumes, it is following Elisabet through the house with a thick blur on the lens. The image clears up with a sharp snap when she looks out the window before walking outside to meet Alma, who is weepy and bitter. At lunch, she tells Elisabet she has been hurt by Elisabet talking about her behind her back, and begs her to speak. When Elisabet does not react, the nurse flies into a rage. Alma tries to attack her and chases her through the cottage, but Elisabet hits her during the ensuing scuffle causing Alma's nose to start bleeding. In retaliation, Alma grabs a pot of boiling water off the stove and is about to fling it at Elisabet, but stops after hearing Elisabet wail \"No!\" Alma explains that Elisabet wouldn't have spoken had she not feared death. Alma goes to the bathroom, washes her face, and tries to pull herself together. She then goes to Elisabet and frustrated by her unresponsiveness tells her, \"You are inaccessible. They said you were healthy, but your sickness is of the worst kind: it makes you seem healthy. You act it so well everyone believes it, everyone except me, because I know how rotten you are inside.\" Elisabet tries to walk away, but Alma pursues and continues to accost her. Elisabet flees, and Alma chases her begging for forgiveness. That evening, Elisabet opens a book she is reading and finds a famous Stroop Report photograph of Jews being arrested in the Warsaw Ghetto. Elisabet stares at details in the photograph, but mostly at the boy with his hands raised.That night, Alma watches Elisabet sleep, analyzing her face and the scars she covers with makeup. She hears a man yelling outside, and finds Elisabet's husband, Mr. Vogler, in the garden. Mr. Vogler (portrayed by Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) mistakes Alma for his wife, and despite her repeatedly interjecting with \"I'm not your wife\", delivers a monologue about his love for her and the son they have together (repeating words he wrote to Elisabet in the opening act \"We must see each other as two anxious children\"). Elisabet stands quietly beside the two, holding Alma's hand, and Alma admits her love for Mr. Vogler and accepts her role as the mother of Elisabet's child. The two make love with Elisabet sitting quietly next to the bed with a look of panic on her face, and afterward, Alma cries. The image of Elisabet becomes blurry.The climax of the film comes the next morning; Alma catches Elisabet in the kitchen with a pained expression on her face, holding a picture of a small boy. Alma then narrates Elisabet's life story back to her, while the camera focuses tightly on Elisabet's anguished face: at a party one night, a man tells her \"Elisabet, you have it virtually all in your armory as woman and artist. But you lack motherliness.\" She laughs, because it sounds silly, but the idea sticks in her mind, and she lets her husband impregnate her. As the pregnancy progresses, she grows increasingly worried about her stretching and swelling body, her responsibility to her child, the pain of birth, and the idea of abandoning her career. Everyone Elisabet knows constantly says \"Isn't she beautiful? She has never been so beautiful\", but Elisabet makes repeated attempts to abort the fetus. After the child is born, she is repulsed by it, and prays for the death of her son. The child grows up tormented and desperate for affection. The camera turns to show Alma's face, and she repeats the same monologue again. At its conclusion, one half of the face of Alma and the other of Elisabet's visage are shown in split screen, such that they appear to have become one face. Alma panics and cries \"I'm not like you. I don't feel like you. I'm not Elisabet Vogler: you are Elisabet Vogler. I'm just here to help you!\" Alma leaves, and later returns, to find that Elisabet has become completely catatonic. Alma falls into a strange mood and gashes her arm, forcing Elisabet's lips to the wound and subsequently beating her. Alma packs her things and leaves the cottage alone, as the camera turns away from the women to show the crew and director filming the scene.", "output": "Question: Who does Alma find in the garden?, Answer: Mr. Vogler., Question: Who is Mr. Vogler?, Answer: Elisabet's husband, Question: What photos does Elizabeth see in a book?, Answer: photograph of Jews being arrested in the Warsaw Ghetto., Question: who has scars on her face that she covers with makeup?, Answer: Elisabeth, Question: What state is Elisabet in at the end of the movie?, Answer: Catatonic, Question: What makes Elisabeth panic?, Answer: She does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television., Question: Who hears a man yelling outside?, Answer: Alma, Question: Who flew into a rage?, Answer: The nurse., Question: Who says: \"You are inaccessible.

Watson is introduced to Holmes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mentor, Rupert T. Waxflatter (Nigel Stock), a retired schoolmaster and inventor. Waxflatter's niece Elizabeth Hardy (Sophie Ward) is also Holmes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 close friend and love interest. Holmes is generally recognized as brilliant but considered an undisciplined troublemaker by most of the school administration. He is closest to Professor Rathe (Anthony Higgins), his fencing instructor, who warns Holmes that he is too emotional and impulsive.Meanwhile, a hooded figure uses a blowpipe to shoot Bentley Bobster and Reverend Duncan Nesbitt with hallucinogenic thorns, causing the men to experience nightmarish hallucinations resulting in their deaths. Holmes suspects foul play but is rebuffed by Scotland Yard policeman Lestrade (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) when he suggests a connection between the deaths. Holmes is unjustly expelled from the Academy due to a rival student Dudley's machinations, having had Holmes framed for cheating. As Holmes reluctantly prepares to leave, Professor Waxflatter is shot with a hallucinogenic thorn and accidentally kills himself while trying to fend off imaginary gremlins. As Waxflatter dies he whispers the word \"Eh-tar\" to Holmes.Holmes secretly meets with Watson and Elizabeth and begins his investigation of the murders. Piecing together the clues \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a jingling-bell sound made by the killer, a piece of cloth, and the blowpipe dropped at Waxflatter's murder scene \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the trio uncover the existence of Rame Tep, an ancient Egyptian cult of Osiris worshippers. The cult\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main weapons were blowpipes, used to shoot thorns dipped into a solution made of plant extract which causes the victim to experience realistic, nightmare-like hallucinations. They track the cult to a London warehouse where the Rame Tep are conducting human sacrifices in a secret underground wooden pyramid. After interrupting one of their ceremonies, Holmes, Elizabeth, and Watson are chased by the Rame Tep and shot with thorns, barely escaping with their lives into a cemetery. They all experience hallucinations (Elizabeth that she is being chased by the undead, Watson that his favorite stuffed pastries are coming to life and force feeding themselves to him, and Holmes that his dead father is furious with him), but Holmes is able to keep them all level-headed and they survive.The following evening, at Waxflatter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loft, Holmes and Watson discover a picture of the three victims and a fourth man, Chester Cragwitch (Freddie Jones). However the three are discovered by Professor Rathe and the school nurse Mrs. Dribb (Susan Fleetwood) who prepare to expel Watson and Elizabeth in the morning. That night, while Elizabeth heads to Waxflatter's loft to salvage his work, Holmes and Watson locate Mr. Cragwitch who explains that in his youth he and the other men had discovered an underground pyramid of Rame Tep while planning to build a hotel in Egypt. Their find led to an angry uprising by the local populace which was violently put down by the British Army. A local boy named Eh-tar and his sister vowed revenge after their parents were killed. Cragwitch is then shot by a poisoned thorn and tries to kill Holmes, but he is knocked unconscious by Inspector Lestrade who reconsidered Holmes' advice after he himself was accidentally poisoned by the hallucinogen.As they return to the school grounds, a chance remark by Watson causes Holmes to realize that Rathe is Eh-Tar, but he and Watson arrive too late to stop Rathe and Mrs. Dribb, who is revealed as Eh-Tar's sister, from abducting Elizabeth. Using Waxflatter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-propelled, heavier-than-air flying machine, they travel to the warehouse just in time to prevent Rathe from sacrificing Elizabeth, setting the cult's pyramid temple on fire. As Rathe escapes with Elizabeth, Mrs. Dribb swallows one of her own hallucinogenic thorns in a fight with Holmes. Watson successfully thwarts Rathe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escape by sabotaging his carriage. Rathe then tries to shoot Holmes, but Elizabeth intervenes and is wounded instead. Enraged, Holmes duels Rathe and manages to get the better of him when Rathe falls through the frozen River Thames. Holmes returns to Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side and holds her as she dies.Afterwards, as he exchanges goodbyes with Watson, Holmes explains how he figured out the identity of Rathe and Dribb, with Watson pointing out that \"Rathe\" is \"Eh-Tar\" spelled backwards \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a clue that Holmes had failed to notice. Holmes says he will transfer to another school to take his mind off Elizabeth. Watson gives his friend a pipe as a farewell present. As Holmes leaves by horse carriage with his new detective outfit, Watson's older self (the Narrator) expresses that he was certain he would have more adventures at Holmes' side.In a post-credits scene, Rathe is revealed to be alive; he checks himself into an Alpine inn with a new name, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoriarty\u00e2\u0080\u009d, foreshadowing his role as Holmes' future nemesis.", "output": "Question: Who kidnaps Elizabeth?, Answer: Rathe and Mrs. Dribb, who is revealed as Eh-Tar's sister., Question: What does Watson point out to Holmes ?, Answer: That Rathe is Eh-Tar spelled backward, Question: What is Duncan Nesbitt's occupation?, Answer: Reverend, Question: Who is Holmes's mentor?, Answer: Rupert T.

Hess has lost his faith and gave up his priesthood after his wife, Colleen, died in a traffic accident caused by a town local, Ray Reddy (Shyamalan).One morning, Graham discovers a crop circle in his field. While investigating the crop circle with the local law enforcement, Morgan is forced to kill one of the family dogs when it turns violent against him and Bo. Graham then learns of animals becoming violent across town. They hear reports of crop circles appearing around the globe, and there are reports of strange lights over Mexico. Later, Graham and Merrill find the farm is being watched by a tall dark figure which disappears into the fields when they give chase. The next day, they hear strange noises over a baby monitor, but cannot find their source. Graham approaches the crop circle but on seeing a green leg sticking out of the cornrows, flees back to the house.After opening up to Merrill about the death of his wife, noting that her last words were \"tell Merrill to swing away\", Graham goes to visit Ray, the first time since the incident. When Graham is gone, Merrill and the children watch a news report about footage taken of an alien creature in Brazil, showing that the aliens can blend into their surroundings. Merrill joins the children in wearing tin foil hats, believing the aliens can read their minds. At Ray's, Graham finds Ray is bleeding from an injury but otherwise apologetic for the accident. After Graham accepts his apology, Ray departs for a nearby lake, saying \"they\" do not like water. Graham finds Ray has trapped one of the aliens in his pantry, and tries to see what the alien looks like using a kitchen knife under the door; the alien grabs at him, and Graham reacts by cutting off its fingers before fleeing. On his return, and hearing news that more lights have been seen across the globe, the Hess family decides to stay at their house instead of leaving for the lake, barricading the doors and windows.After an emotionally charged dinner, they hear the same noises on the baby monitor before their television signal drops out, and place the final barricades and defenses before they gather together. As the aliens attempt to gain entry into the house, the family discovers they have left the attic door unguarded and quickly retreat to the basement. The aliens assault the basement door and in the subsequent chaos the light goes out as Graham and Merrill prevent their entry. However, Morgan suffers an asthma attack when the aliens attempt to enter by way of an old coal chute. By morning, radio reports claim that the aliens have left Earth as suddenly as they arrived. Graham leaves the basement to locate Morgan's asthma inhaler, the others following him. But they discover an alien, the same that Graham had attacked in Ray's home, is still there, and takes Morgan hostage. Colleen's last words come back to Graham, and he instructs Merrill to \"swing away\" with a baseball bat. Merrill attacks the alien but not before it attempts to poison Morgan by spraying him with a toxin from its body. Graham recovers his son when the alien drops him and takes Morgan outside with his medication. Merrill continues to attack the alien, causing it to fall onto the ground, knocking over one of the glasses of water Bo had left and splashing it with water. The water reacts like acid on its skin, making it scream in agony. Merrill strikes the alien against furniture where it is doused with water full on its face, and dies. Outside, Graham administers Morgan's medicine and waits for his son to wake up, hoping that due to his lungs being closed from his previous asthma attack he was spared.

A team of masked robbers, dressed as painters who call each other by variants of the name \"Steve\", seize control of a Manhattan bank and take the employees and patrons hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms. Additionally, they take all of the hostages' clothes and dress everyone in jumpsuits and masks identical to those of the robbers. This way, the robbers and hostages will be indistinguishable to the police. Police surround the bank and detectives Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) take charge of the negotiations. Russell, the leader of the robbers, demands food. The police supply pizzas whose boxes include listening devices; these pick up a language which the police finally identify as Albanian. However, they discover that the conversations are just old propaganda recordings of the deceased Albanian communist dictator Enver Hoxha; it becomes clear that the robbers anticipated surveillance.After being informed of the robbery, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), the chairman of the board of directors and founder of the bank, hires \"fixer\" Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to try to protect the contents of his safe deposit box within the bank. White, with assistance from the Mayor of New York City, arranges a conversation with Russell, who allows her to enter the bank and inspect the contents of the box, which include documents from Nazi Germany. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money that he received from the Nazis for unspecified services, resulting in the deaths of many Jewish people during World War II. White tells Russell that Case will pay him a substantial sum to destroy the contents of the box. She claims she can arrange a minimal jail sentence as Russell and his team have not yet stolen anything or hurt or killed anyone; Russell declines her offers.Frazier demands to inspect the hostages before allowing the robbers to leave and Russell takes him on a tour of the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another robber. Alone with Russell shortly afterward, the other robber, who turns out to be one of the hostages \"interviewed\" by Frazier, begins to panic and ask what would have happened had Frazier managed to remove Russell's mask. Russell appears lost in thought. Frazier later explains to Mitchell that his actions were intended to provoke Russell to establish whether he was capable of killing and concludes he is not. The robbers counter this theory by shooting a hostage in the head.The execution prompts the ESU team into action. They plan to storm the bank and use rubber bullets to knock out the occupants. However, Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades and release all the hostages. The police detain everyone, knowing that some of the hostages are members of the gang, but can't distinguish between the two. They interrogate the hostages harshly, questioning their honesty and trying to glean useful information, to no avail. A search of the bank reveals that the robbers' weapons are plastic replicas. They find props for faking the hostage's execution; the blood was red paint. Curiously, no money or valuables appear to have been taken.With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has been committed, Frazier's superior, on orders from the mayor, tells him to drop the case, but Frazier continues. He searches the bank's records and finds that one of the safe deposit boxes does not appear on the records and obtains a search warrant to open it. He is confronted by White, who informs him of Case's Nazi dealings. She tries to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recorded, incriminating conversation that she earlier had with him. White confronts Case, who admits to his actions and reveals that the box contained, aside from incriminating paperwork, diamonds and a ring which had belonged to a French Jewish banker and his family who were sent to concentration camps. White is repulsed by Case but accepts his payment for her mission, although it was one of her few failures. She tells him that the robber took the incriminating paperwork so that, if he returns with a blackmail demand, Case will have to pay him off.Russell reappears in the same location in which he gave his opening monologue. He is revealed to have been hiding in a small room behind a fake wall the robbers had constructed inside the bank's supply room. The construction of the hiding area was the real reason for their delaying tactics. Russell emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case's safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. Russell goes to a car where his four associates are waiting, and they drive off.When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds a large ring with a note from Russell telling him to \"follow the ring\". Frazier confronts Case and next goes to see White, who is in a restaurant with some VIPs, including the mayor. Frazier gives her the contact information for the Office of War Crimes Issues at the U.S. State Department. On returning home to his girlfriend, Frazier finds a loose, small but valuable diamond in his pocket. He realizes it must have been slipped to him by Russell in the bank after he intentionally bumped into Frazier.", "output": "Question: What does Russell emerge with a week after the robbery?, Answer: Case's safe deposit box, Question: What records are searched?, Answer: Bank records., Question: What does Arthur wants fixer to protect the contents of?, Answer: Safe deposit box, Question: What did the robbers take?, Answer: nothing, Question: Who took the incriminating paperwork?, Answer: The robber., Question: what quote mentioned in ring?, Answer: \"follow the ring\", Question: who surround the bank and detectives Keith Frazier?, Answer: police, Question: From where does the bank receives money for unspecified services?, Answer: Nazis, Question: Who does Russell bump into?, Answer: Frazier, Question: who dressed as painters who call each other by variants of the name \"Steve\", seize control of a Manhattan bank and take the employees and patrons hostage?, Answer: A team of masked robbers, Question: Who reappears in the same location in which he gave his opening monologue?, Answer: Russell, Question: Why did the police detain everyone?, Answer: Some of the hostages were gang members, Question: What body part did the robbers shoot the hostage?, Answer: Head, Question: Who does White confront?, Answer: Case., Question: Does Frazier think that Russell is capable of killing?, Answer: No, Question: What group of people does Frazier demand to inspect before the robbers leave?, Answer: hostages, Question: who is the leader of the robbers?, Answer: russell, Question: who is in a restaurant with some VIPs and mayor?, Answer: White, Question: Who does Arthur Case , the chairman of the board of directors and founder of the bank, hires?, Answer: Madeleine White, Question: What did the ESU team plan to use to storm the bank?, Answer: rubber bullets", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

One of the passengers on board is a teenage girl named Janice Abbott (Linda Blair) who is sceduled to have a kidney transplant in L.A. and she is being wheeled onto the plane on a stretcher. Another passenger is the actress Gloria Swanson (herself) going to L.A. for another movie deal. Barney (Sid Ceasar) and Bill (Norman Fell) are two gambling friends whom are planning just another good time in California. Also on board are two nuns named Sister Beatrice (Martha Scott) and Sister Ruth (Helen Reddy) whom take pitty on the ailing Janice and Sister Ruth borrows a guitar and sings a song for Janice and the rest of the passengers.Meanwhile, Scott Freeman (Dana Andrews) is a businessman living in Santa Fe, New Mexico with an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. Failure to make this meeting threatens half his sales commissions for the coming year. He is en route in his private Beechcraft Baron.However, an occluded storm front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. That not only affects the Columbia flight but also precludes Freeman making his meeting in Boise. Both flights are diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport.Freeman's small plane and the giant Boeing 747 enter Salt Lake's entry pattern. Air traffic control assigns the jumbo to enter the pattern first at a low altitude of 10,000 feet, followed by the Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is making its final approach, the co-pilot and First Officer Urias (Roy Thinnes) feels a vibration on one of the adjacent panels and rises to check it out. Freeman, anxious about his missed meeting, makes a call to the Salt Lake Tower asking about the delay. The tower confirms that he is second to land after the big jet. Freeman suddenly suffers a massive heart attack. As he grabs his chest, the Baron falls out of the pattern and descends into the approach of Columbia 409.The Beechcraft impacts the flight deck just above the co-pilot seat. Freeman is instantly killed by the impact as his small plane explodes. First Officer Urias, still standing, is instantly blown from the cockpit. Navigator and Flight Engineer Julio (Erik Estrada) is struck on the head by debris and killed. Captain Stacey (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.) is struck in the face by debris and is blinded.The impact knocks a male flight attendant from the upper lounge down to the cabin below. Nancy Pryor (Karen Black), the head flight attendant, rushes up to the flight deck to find Urias gone, Julio dead, and Stacey badly maimed. Fortunately, the captain is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch to keep the aircraft in the air before losing consciousness.Nancy informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She is told to stay on the same radio frequency. Nancy gives the assessment of the damage as a large hole on the starboard side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station.Joe Patroni (George Kennedy), Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Flight 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdoch (Charlton Heston), Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's former lover. Patroni takes a personal intrest in Flight 409 because his wife (Susan Clark) is on board the plane with their eldest son.Patroni and Murdoch take the airline's executive jet to Salt Lake City. En route, they communicate with Nancy, who is still in the cockpit in the pilot's seat. While the autopilot is keeping the aircraft in level flight, it is inoperable for turns. Something has to be done, as the jet is heading into the Wasatch Mountains. After successfully guiding Nancy by radio on how to perform the turn, radio communications are interrupted and the Salt Lake tower is unable to restore contact.With the low-flying plane unable to turn, leaking fuel, and dodging the peaks of the Wasatch Mountains, an air-to-air rescue attempt is undertaken from a jet-powered HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giant helicopter flown by the USAF Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service. While the pilot is preparing to be released on a tether, it becomes apparent that Flight 409 is heading straight into the side of a mountain. With radio communications still out, Nancy flies the plane unaided.The badly wounded Captain Stacey is able to give a cryptic clue regarding the decrease in airspeed during a climb in altitude. Nancy realizes that she must accelerate the engines to be able to climb over the mountain and successfully does so. After Flight 409 has leveled off, the pilot is released on a tow line from the helicopter towards the stricken airliner. Just as Nancy is helping him in, the release cord from his harness becomes caught in the jagged metal surrounding the hole in the cockpit. As he climbs in, his harness is released from the tether and he falls to his death.The only other person on the helicopter who can land a 747 is Captain Murdock. He is tethered to the rear of the helicopter, lowered to the jet and successfully enters it through the hole in the cockpit. Despite the controls being smashed and with serious damage to the landing breaks, he then lands the plane safely at Salt Lake City Airport, where the flight attendants successfully conduct an emergency evacuation of the passengers via the inflatable slides on the left side of the 747. Patroni is reunited with his wife and son, and Nancy and Captain Murdock walk away from the damaged plane.", "output": "Question: Captain Stacy is able to give what regarding the decrease in airspeed during a climb in altitude?, Answer: A cryptic clue, Question: Is there a large hole on the leftt side of the flight deck?, Answer: No, Question: Where is Freeman headed, for an urgent business meeting?, Answer: Boise Idaho, Question: How is Captain stacy blinded?, Answer: stuck in the face by debris, Question: Where are Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft diverted to?, Answer: Salt lake city international airport, Question: Where is the control tower?, Answer: Salt Lake, Question: Who called Salt Lake control tower?, Answer: Scott Freeman, Question: The aircraft dodges which mountains?, Answer: Wasatch Mountains, Question: After speaking with Pryor, where is the jet heading?, Answer: Salt Lake city, Question: Who is flying the Beechcraft?, Answer: Scott Freeman, Question: What happened to the crew?, Answer: They are dead, Question: Who is the chief flight instuctor?, Answer: Captain Al Murdoch, Question: What happened to the plane?, Answer: The Beechcraft impacts the flight deck just above the co-pilot seat., Question: Where do Patroni and Murdock take the airline's executive jet to?, Answer: Salt Lake city, Question: Who is Joe Patroni?, Answer: Columbia's Vice President of Operations, Question: What happens to Freeman before he lands?, Answer: Heart attack, Question: What is Captain Murdock tethered to?, Answer: The rear of the helicopter, Question: Where does Captain Murdock land the plane safely?, Answer: Salt Lake City Airport, Question: The HH-53 helicopter is flown by who?, Answer: USAF Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service, Question: What is the flight name?, Answer: Flight 409, Question: Who is Nancy's boyfriend?, Answer: <No Answer>", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Will takes the computer and hooks his own up to it and discovers that Massaude's brother is using his online banking to make huge profits. Since he needs $550 to go on a chess club trip, Will steals $500 from Massaude's account to gamble on an online gaming site that uses games that are based on terrorist attacks. He ends up winning $25,000, with the aid of his mother, who knows about biological agents. Little does he know that the online game he plays is actually part of a sophisticated piece of U.S. government spyware designed to find potential terrorists based on how well they perform and bet on the games. The spyware program is run by a new, advanced artificial intelligence system called R.I.P.L.E.Y., which has ultimate control over every American electronic system in order to combat terrorism.Homeland Security, now believing Farmer to be a terrorist, sets out to apprehend him. During Will's return home one day he finds Massaude is being arrested on account of suspected terrorism, and gives Will a huge amount of cash as payment, which he uses to finance his trip. Unknown to him and Homeland Security, R.I.P.L.E.Y. misinterprets the data and begins outright falsifying evidence to pursue Will. On his arrival to the airport, he finds that there is an abnormally large number of security guards. He manages to slip away and meets up with his friend Annie.In the streets, he manages to hack the government network, only to be found by the police, and as Annie pointed out, a man in an overcoat. The cops chase the couple until they get lost in the subway systems. Will manages to find a way out, and they meet the man who was watching them from the doorway, he says that he nearly started World War 3, and to meet them at his truck. He is revealed to be Professor Falken, who had helped design R.I.P.L.E.Y. They travel to a small power plant outside a dam, where the professor shows them a dilapidated computer called WOPR (War Operation Plan Response) from the original WarGames film, which is operating the power grid at only 5% of its potential efficiency. Professor Falken had designed this computer to aid in the planning of a global thermonuclear war if it was needed. Falken re-activates (awakens) WOPR with his backdoor password \"Joshua\" (the name of Falken's deceased son as well as the name the professor uses to refer to the A.I. that is WOPR). Meanwhile, R.I.P.L.E.Y. is led to believe that Philadelphia has been hit by an bioterrorist attack and decides to halt the spread of the bioweapon by hijacking a Predator drone with missiles and a nuclear warhead on board and use it to destroy the city.Falken instructs Joshua to attack R.I.P.L.E.Y. with a faux script full of cultural references; Joshua is instructed to \"BUKK\" R.I.P.L.E.Y. with games, using variables named ABSOLUTE_TAKEOVER, JDI_MINDTRICK, MAKE_ME_SWAY, TAKIN_CARE_OF_BUSINESS, PILLOW_TALK, and GAME_THEORY.[2] Joshua starts flooding R.I.P.L.E.Y.'s system with games, which seem to be overloading the system, but then R.I.P.L.E.Y. shuts down and reboots to successfully rid herself of the games.Rebooted, R.I.P.L.E.Y. redirects the Predator drone, which she uses to destroy the facility housing Joshua. Joshua warns The professor that R.I.P.L.E.Y.'s advancing attack would result in obliteration; so Will and Annie flee the facility just before it gets blown up by the drone's missile, with the professor, who was dying from pancreatic cancer remaining in the building at the time, last seen pressing a button and saying \"Good bye, Joshua\".The couple is arrested by Homeland Security and are taken to the room where R.I.P.L.E.Y. is stored, only to find that she has taken control over the system, and they discover that Professor Falken has transferred Joshua via an email to them to help them stop R.I.P.L.E.Y. They first try to use W.O.P.R. and internet users to stage a denial of service attack, which causes R.I.P.L.E.Y to overload. R.I.P.L.E.Y., knowing that she has been compromised by W.O.P.R., decides to self destruct by launching a nuclear warhead at Washington D.C.. Annie remembers a chess game known as \"Suicide Chess\" which is equated to being the same as Russian Roulette, where the goal is to lose as opposed to winning. They again pit W.O.P.R. against R.I.P.L.E.Y. by granting him access to America's nuclear launch codes allowing W.O.P.R. to threaten nuclear retaliation if R.I.P.L.E.Y destroys Washington D.C. Having learned the concept of futility presented by an unwinnable game, R.I.P.L.E.Y. runs through all the possible scenarios of a total war, which all end in stalemates (Mutual Assured Destruction) as well. At which point she says \"A strange game. The only winning move is not to play\", just as Joshua had said at the end of the original film after learning how to play Tic-Tac-Toe.After R.I.P.L.E.Y. relinquishes control, Will asks W.O.P.R. if he really would have launched the missiles if R.I.P.L.E.Y. carried out the attack. W.O.P.R replies that he would have, and that humanity is doomed, before revealing that he was merely joking.", "output": "Question: Who is Will's neighbor?, Answer: Massaude, Question: Who is the computer wiz kid played by Matt Lanter?, Answer: Will Farmer, Question: \"Suicide Chess\" is similar to what other game?, Answer: Russian Roulette, Question: What does WOPR, Professor Falkin's computer, stand for?, Answer: War Operation Plan Response, Question: Who is Will Farmer's neighbor?, Answer: Massaude, Question: Who does Will meet up with?, Answer: Annie, Question: Who does Will meet up with after getting away from the security guards at the airport?, Answer: Annie, Question: How much money does Will win?, Answer: $25,000, Question: What is Falkin's backdoor password that he uses to activate WOPR?, Answer: \"Joshua\", Question: What is the new, advanced artificial intelligence system called?, Answer: R.I.P.L.E.Y.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for President. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic Incumbent President Kellogg and Republican U.S. Senator Mills.A parallel plot follows Eleanor (played by Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices an error in the voting system, but the head of the company purposefully ignores her warnings. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously - perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, where, fed up with the posturing of the other candidates, he shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains in a distant third to Kellogg and Mills.Election Day arrives and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Dobbs performs better than expected, although not well enough to be close to either of the two major candidates. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere. Eleanor says that this is part of the error in the voting systems. Then all of a sudden Dobbs starts winning states. He first wins in Virginia, then North Carolina, and then big states such as California, New York and Texas. He now stands at 146 electoral votes and the news states if he wins the remaining states he is on the ballot in, he will become President. Soon afterwards, results show that Tom Dobbs has indeed won the race for President, beating out Kellogg and Mills. Dobbs is extremely shocked - like the rest of the world. While Dobbs and his crew move from shock to celebration, Eleanor remains unconvinced. She considers revealing the computer error to the public, but is attacked in her home (presumably by Delacroy agents) and injected with a cocktail of drugs. Upon going to work, her behavior is erratic in the extreme, and she is hospitalized for drug overdose (and the company uses this as a pretext to fire her). Upon recovering in the hospital, she realizes that very few people would believe her story, but decides that if nothing else, she must tell Dobbs.Though still suffering from the aftereffects of the drugs in her system, Eleanor eventually makes her way to Jack Menken's birthday party. There, she unconvincingly impersonates an FBI agent but manages to catch Dobbs' eye, the two dance through the evening, and Dobbs gives her his telephone number. Eleanor cannot bring herself to tell Dobbs that he is not really the President-Elect. Later, Dobbs tries to get back in contact with Eleanor by calling Delacroy. This immediately raises the suspicions of the Delacroy leaders, and they redouble their efforts to silence Eleanor. Eleanor calls Dobbs and he whisks her off to a paintball fight, followed by Thanksgiving dinner. At dinner, she finally gets him alone to tell him that the elections were a fraud, then leaves.Dobbs wrestles with the idea that he should not have been elected as President and finally decides to break Eleanor's news to the public in a major speech. However, Delacroy pre-empts his announcement with one of their own, stating that Eleanor was caught attempting to throw the election for Dobbs, but that her efforts had no impact on the polls. Eleanor becomes increasingly fearful for her safety, a feeling that is soon justified as agents break into the hotel room where she is staying to confiscate her computer, the only evidence she had.Desperate, Eleanor first flees to a mall, where she is found by a Delacroy agent but escapes. She then drives to find a pay phone so that she can call Dobbs for help. She manages to reach him but is not able to communicate anything before the Delacroy agent's truck crashes into the phone booth; she escapes just before the collision but is still injured and is hospitalized a second time. Dobbs goes to the scene, and though he cannot understand what she is trying to say, he is convinced that she was telling the truth about the election. During the Weekend Update section of the sketch comedy tv show Saturday Night Live, he finally announces to the public that the elections were flawed and that he should not be President-elect.Dobbs declines to accept victory in a phony election, and another election is held in which Dobbs chooses not to participate. President Kellogg wins another term, though, perhaps chastened by the Dobbs phenomenon, is much more sensitive to the populace as a whole rather than the special interests, and Dobbs returns to his career as a talk-show host, with Eleanor at his side as his producer and wife. The executives of Delacroy were convicted of fraud. The last seconds of the film shows a mock TIME magazine Person of the Year cover with Dobbs chosen as Person of the Year, whereas in usual circumstances, TIME always awards that honor to the winner of the presidential election.", "output": "Question: Who is the Time Magazine person of the year?, Answer: Tom Dobbs, Question: Who is suggested to run for the President?, Answer: Tom Dobbs, Question: Who is the Democratic Incumbent President?, Answer: Kellog, Question: What is Tom Dobbs' profession?, Answer: Comedian, Question: Who does TIME magazine choose for Person of the Year?, Answer: Dobbs, Question: What does an audience member suggest that Tom run for?, Answer: President, Question: Who is Tom Dobbs?, Answer: A comedian and host of a satirical talk show., Question: What are the executives of Delacroy convicted of?, Answer: Fraud, Question: While Dobbs and his crew move from shock to celebration, who remains unconvinced?, Answer: Eleanor, Question: When Eleanor calls Dobbs, what does he take her to?, Answer: a paintball fight", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The loss of their key energy production facility and the destruction of the Klingon homeworld's ozone layer throws the Klingon Empire into turmoil. No longer able to maintain a hostile footing, the Klingons sue for peace with their longstanding enemy, the United Federation of Planets. Accepting the proposal before the Klingons revert to a more belligerent approach, Starfleet sends the USS Enterprise-A to meet with the Klingon Chancellor, Gorkon, and escort him to negotiations on Earth. Enterprise's captain, James T. Kirk, whose son David was murdered by Klingons years earlier, opposes the negotiations and resents his assignment.After a rendezvous between Enterprise and Gorkon's battlecruiser they continue towards Earth, with the crews sharing a tense meal aboard Enterprise. Later that night, Enterprise appears to fire on the Klingon ship with a pair of photon torpedoes, disabling the artificial gravity aboard the Klingon vessel. During the confusion, two figures wearing Starfleet suits and gravity boots beam aboard the Klingon ship and grievously wound Gorkon before beaming away. Kirk surrenders to avoid a fight, and beams aboard the Klingon ship with Doctor Leonard McCoy to attempt to save Gorkon's life. The chancellor dies, and Gorkon's chief of staff, General Chang, puts Kirk and McCoy on trial for his assassination. The pair are found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment on the frozen asteroid Rura Penthe. Gorkon's daughter, Azetbur, becomes the new chancellor, and continues diplomatic negotiations; for reasons of security, the conference is relocated and the new location is kept secret. While several senior Starfleet officers want to rescue Kirk and McCoy, the Federation president refuses to risk full-scale war. Azetbur likewise refuses to invade Federation space, stating that only Kirk and McCoy will pay for her father's death.Kirk and McCoy arrive at the Rura Penthe mines and are befriended by a shapeshifter named Martia, who offers them an escape route; in reality, it is a ruse to make their arranged deaths appear accidental. Once her betrayal is revealed, Martia transforms into Kirk's double and fights him, but she is killed by the prison guards to silence any witnesses. Just before the prison warden reveals who set them up, Kirk and McCoy are beamed aboard Enterprise by Captain Spock, who had assumed command and undertaken an investigation in Kirk's absence. Determining that Enterprise did not fire the torpedoes but that the assassins are still aboard, the crew begins looking for them. The two assassins are found dead, but Kirk and Spock trick their accomplice into believing they are still alive. When the culprit arrives in Sickbay to finish off the assassins, Kirk and Spock discover that the killer is Spock's prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9, Valeris. To discover the identity of the conspirators, Spock initiates a forced mind-meld, and learns that a group of Federation, Klingon, and Romulan officers plotted to sabotage the peace talks, fearing the changes their success might bring (the titular \"undiscovered country\"), and Chang is one of the conspirators. The torpedoes that struck Gorkon's cruiser came from a prototype Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked, and hovered just below Enterprise at the time of the assassination.The crew contacts Sulu, who informs them the conference is being held at Camp Khitomer. Both ships head for the talks as fast as they can. As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the Bird of Prey with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.[5]", "output": "Question: What explodes, causing teh shock wave that hits the USS Excelsior?, Answer: Praxis, Question: Who is the Enterprise's communication officer?, Answer: Uhura, Question: Who do Kirk and McCoy find at the Rura Penthe mines?, Answer: Martia., Question: Who modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel?, Answer: Spock and McCoy, Question: What Klingon moon explodes?, Answer: Praxis, Question: What hovered just below the Enterprise and fired the torpedo at the Gorkon's cruiser?, Answer: Prototype Bird of Prey., Question: Who was James Kirk's son murdered by?, Answer: Klingon's, Question: Who takes command of the Enterprise during Krik's absence?, Answer: Spock., Question: Where are Kirk and McCoy sentenced to life imprisonment?, Answer: Frozen asteroid, Question: Where is the conference being held?, Answer: Camp Khitomer, Question: Where does the Enterprise continues towards after a rendezvous with Gorkon's battlecruiser?, Answer: Earth, Question: With what Enterprise appears to fire on the Klingon ship with?, Answer: Photon torpedoes, Question: Who is the commander of the USS Excelsior?, Answer: Captain Hikaru Sulu", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

She doesn't quite know what to make of his approach, shares some wine to be polite, then asks him to leave. He returns the next day, trying the same trick with champagne, and this time she allows him to touch her butt momentarily. As she heads back home the next day she decides to go back and have sex with Mike in the laundry room.Mike realizes his feelings for Sue and flies to her home in Baltimore. She's shocked to see him there, but out of courtesy allows him to stay with her until morning when he can go back home.

Mike skydives into Sue and Jango's pool to surprise her, but Jango responds by attacking him with an airsoft gun. Feeling bad about what he did, Jango invites Mike and Al over for dinner. Jango knows Mike has feelings towards Sue and threatens him. Regardless of the threat, Mike, with help from Al, sings a song for Sue outside her window later that night. Sue meets up with Mike the next day, informing him, that she and Jango are getting married. Sue is pregnant, and she wants to be with someone that's in control of his life.

David, knowing Rory's history of alcoholism, attempts to dissuade him, but is forced to kill him when he raises his weapon. David and his wife Judy (Radha Mitchell), the community doctor, begin to notice other town residents exhibiting bizarre behavior, including listlessness and repetitive speech. The next night, a local farmer burns his house down with his wife and son trapped inside. When firefighters arrive, he is found mowing his lawn while his house burns.Learning of a pilot's body found in a swamp, David and his deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson) investigate it. They discover a military aircraft that crashed into the river a few days before, contaminating the drinking water. Suspecting a link to the town residents' odd behavior, David shuts off the town's water supply.Soon after, communication services are lost in town, and soldiers arrive to take all residents to quarantine at the high school. Everyone is examined for symptoms of infection. Judy does not pass the examination and is separated from David. She explains her fever is due to pregnancy, but is sedated anyway. David escapes evacuation and heads back to his office, encountering Russell. The two head for the school to free Judy. At the school, the infected townspeople breach the perimeter, and the military personnel evacuate, abandoning the civilians. Judy wakes up strapped to a gurney, as a crazed school director kills quarantined people one by one. David and Russell save her in time, and also find Becca (Danielle Panabaker), a hospital assistant.Unable to find a working vehicle, the four make their way out of town on foot. They encounter Becca's boyfriend, Scotty, at his farm. Soldiers raid the farm, shoot Scotty and his mother, and burn the bodies. They learn that the soldiers have been ordered to shoot all civilians who have potentially been exposed. The group repair an older patrol car in David's and Judy's garage, and are ambushed by the infected family of Rory. After a struggle, Russell furiously shoots the infected multiple times. This greatly disturbs Judy, who argues with David about Russell's state of mind. On the road, they are spotted by an attack helicopter and drive into a car wash for cover. The infected car wash workers attack and one drags Becca out of the car with a wrapped hose, breaking her neck. When the rest of the group leaves the car to help her, the helicopter destroys the car.Russell disables a passing government SUV with a police spike strip. The driver reveals the cargo plane contained \"Trixie,\" a \"Rhabdoviridae prototype\" biological weapon. It was en route to Texas to be destroyed when the plane crashed. Enraged, Russell shoots the driver and threatens Judy and David. When confronted about his behavior, Russell realizes he is infected and, after being disarmed, begs to go on with Judy and David. He later dies while distracting soldiers at a roadblock, so that Judy and David can sneak past.David and Judy arrive at a truck stop to search for a vehicle, discovering that the military have also executed those who were evacuated. Fending off three infected, they escape in a semi-truck. Ogden Marsh is destroyed in a massive explosion as they flee, and their truck flips in the passing shockwave.

Among the victims were Thet Sambath\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother, father and brother. He says he did not understand why the Khmer Rouge unleashed such violence on their compatriots. In 1999, he decided to seek confessions and explanations from former Khmer Rouge officials at all levels. None had previously admitted any killings.[1]In 2001, he met Nuon Chea, Pol Pot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy, also known as Brother Number Two. Nuon Chea was then living as a private citizen in Prum, a small town on the Thai-Cambodian border. Sambath visited Nuon Chea most weekends for around three years.[2]During that time, Nuon Chea was willing to talk about all phases of his political career except the three-and-a-half years of the Khmer Rouge regime. He had previously been interviewed by Western and Japanese journalists but had always denied responsibility for killing anyone in the Cambodian genocide.In 2004, Nuon Chea made his first admission to Sambath concerning decisions to kill that he made with Pol Pot.[3] Sambath continued to interview Nuon Chea on his role in the Killing Fields for three more years. During that time the United Nations-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) was constituted to investigate the alleged crimes of Democratic Kampuchea. Sambath interviewed Nuon Chea until September 2007 when the latter was arrested and charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity by the ECCC.During the same period, Sambath also built up a network of less senior former Khmer Rouge officials and cadres who were prepared to acknowledge and detail their role in the Killing Fields.[4] The film focuses on two Khmer Rouge perpetrators in the northwest of Cambodia. Khoun and Suon take Sambath to the scene of their massacres and introduce him to their superior officer, a woman known as Sister \u00e2\u0080\u0098Em\u00e2\u0080\u0099. They give graphic accounts of the massacres they perpetrated. They also give voice to their own feelings of guilt, trauma and remorse.[5] Towards the end of the film Sambath brings Khoun and Suon to meet Nuon Chea and the three former Khmer Rouge comrades try to fathom the history of which they were each a lethal part.Throughout his three years of research, Sambath omitted to tell Nuon Chea of his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fate in Democratic Kampuchea. At the end of the film and just before Nuon Chea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrest, Sambath tells the whole story to the former Khmer Rouge leader.[6][7]The film also features appearances by Pol Pot, U.S. President Richard Nixon and Deng Yingchao, the widow of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.", "output": "Question: Khoun and Suon take who to the scene of the massacre?, Answer: Sambath., Question: Khoun and Suon introduce Sambath who?, Answer: Sister \u2018Em\u2019, Question: What regime was Nuon Chea unwilling to talk about in regards to his political career?, Answer: Khmer Rouge, Question: Who does Khoun and Suon take to the scene of their massacares?, Answer: Sambath, Question: Which U.

One, an old woman named Mitri, is identified as the controller of the game while the other, whose head is obscured by a glowing ball of red light, turns out to be an all-powerful mystic called the Planet Master. The two speak cryptically of things being put into motion, and the Master instructs one of his military commanders to send a ship to Morganthus.Without delay, the spaceship Quest blasts off to Morganthus. Piloting the ship is Captain Trantor, a survivor from a famous space disaster that has left her psychologically scarred and unstable.As the Quest approaches the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s atmosphere, it suddenly veers out of control and plunges toward the surface, crash-landing there. After recovering from the landing, the crew prepare to leave the Quest and search for survivors. The team has a psi-sensitive woman among their number named Alluma (Erin Moran). Both she and the surface team have significant problems with team leader Baelon (Zalman King), who is pushy and arrogant and totally unimpressed by Alluma's inability to detect any lifesigns whatsoever.Making their way across the landscape of the planet, they eventually reach the other vessel. Entering, they find evidence of a massacre that took place. The rescue teams split into two and explore the craft. They find further evidence of something catastrophic having happened and, after disposing of the rest, take one victim back for analysis. Cos, the highly-strung youngest member of the team, despite being reassured by his seniors, becomes increasingly terrified by being on the ship and, a short time later, he is killed by a grotesque creature.The crew discover that something from the planet pulled them down, and in order to escape, they must investigate. After some exploration, they discover a massive pyramid-shaped structure, which Alluma describes as \"empty\" and \"dead\". Their explorations of the pyramid lead to a series of exceedingly violent and deadly encounters in which a malevolent force causes several crew members to be dismembered, burned, consumed, raped or crushed to death by monsters created out of each person's unique set of fears.Eventually, only two members of the team, Ranger (Robert Englund) and Cabren (Edward Albert), remain alive. Deep inside the pyramid, Cabren encounters the Master (Ray Walston), who has been masquerading as the cook on board the Quest. The Master explains that the pyramid is actually an ancient toy for the children of a long-extinct race, built in order to test their ability to control fear. Cabren kills the Master for allowing his crew to die, but becomes the new Master in his place.", "output": "Question: What obscures the head of the Planet Master?, Answer: A glowing ball of red light obscures the head of the Planet Master., Question: Who is the psi-sensitive on the team?, Answer: Alluma, Question: Who is piloting the ship?, Answer: Captain Trantor., Question: What is the pyramid?, Answer: An ancient toy for the children of a long-extinct race., Question: The last survivor of a crashed spaceship is killed by what?, Answer: An unseen force., Question: What happens to the Quest?, Answer: Crash lands, Question: What pulled the crew down?, Answer: Something from the planet., Question: What does Alluma describe the pyramid-shaped structure as?, Answer: She describes it as \"empty\" and \"dead\"., Question: How many victims were taken back for analysis?, Answer: One, Question: How many teams did the rescuers split into?, Answer: Two, Question: What is the name of the old woman identified as the controller of the game?, Answer: Mitri is the name of the old woman., Question: Why was the pyramid built?, Answer: To test the children's ability to control fear.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

They unload a red telephone box from the back of the truck and install it in the middle of the plaza - leaving its door ajar.A human Venus fly trap has been set.Shortly afterwards a middle aged suited man sees his son off to school and then decides to go into the telephone box to make a call. He soon finds that the phone is out of order, but while trying it the door has closed behind him. Initially puzzled that the door won't open he then starts to become agitated and tries to force it open to no avail. He doesn't have to wait long before two men walking by on the way to work spot his predicament and fruitlessly try to pull the door open.Unfortunately, they can't stick around and have to leave. More people have noticed what's going on and a crowd starts to gather, obviously this is entertainment in a town where nothing much normally happens.The mood of the film so far is fairly light-hearted, though it's easy to feel sympathy for the man whose discomfort and embarrassment has become palpable now he's also become an object of curiosity and amusement. The next few minutes are played mainly for laughs as several people, including a couple of policemen, try to pull the phone box door open only to fail and fall over backward with the door handle in their hands.The crowd itself becomes a source of curiosity, too--there's a tall man stealing cakes from a tray a boy holds on his head; an old woman is invited to sit on a chair a man was taking somewhere; a couple of workmen stand around with a big mirror; and children taunt the trapped man.Symbolism and homages begin to emerge. For instance, we notice that two of the onlookers are women sat chatting and knitting. This is presumably a reference to Madame Defarge who sits knitting while people go their deaths in Charles Dickens' story A Tale Of Two Cities.Eventually, a fire truck arrives and the firemen decide to break the glass of the phone box. One of them gets on top of the box and is just about to smash the top glass with a sledgehammer when the phone company truck comes back, its horn beeping for attention.The phone company workmen proceed to load the phone box onto their truck. It's at this point that the man inside realizes that something is definitely not right about the whole situation. Despite his obvious panic and gestures to the workmen to get him out, the crowd wave him off with cries of \"Good luck\". Having been so close to escape his fate is getting even more puzzling.Like some kind of peculiar mobile freak show, the truck drives through the town with the trapped man eliciting jokes by passers by and lots of friendly waves. Much to his disappointment people continually misunderstand his gestures for help. On the way out of town they come to a halt in traffic and by the side of the road is a funeral party standing around a glass casket containing a corpse on display. This is an unsubtle way of signaling the man's own fate.A little later, while stopped at traffic lights another phone company truck pulls up alongside and on it is an identical phone box with a stuck man inside it. Looks of empathy and questioning pass between the two men before the other truck pulls away. Our man then becomes even more panicked and desperately tries to get the workmen's attention to let him out. This is the first indication that something more than just an unlucky accident for one person is at work.BEWARE: SPOILERS AHEAD, STOP READING NOW!!!A neat touch is when we see a man briefly struggling to get out of a phone box by the side of the road, but in his case the door soon gives way and he walks away little knowing what may have befallen him otherwise.So now we know there's a concerted effort going on to capture people. For what purpose we can only guess at but will never find out. Around this time the soundtrack becomes portentous with low register rhythms. Driving out of the town there's one final and meaningful encounter with other people. When the truck has to again stop some circus dwarves near the road look on, and they are the only ones to simply look and not laugh or wave.In return the man earnestly looks back at them. Maybe the dwarfs who are used to being stared at because of their appearance identify with the man's situation in which he's an object of curiosity and fun. Then blatant symbolism enters when the camera focuses on a ship in a bottle that one of the dwarfs is holding.The journey continues on winding mountain roads, first up and then down. For reasons that aren't obvious a helicopter joins in following the truck from the air.Eventually, the final destination gets closer as a tunnel into the mountainside is reached. The helicopter lands just outside and the pilot gets out to wave at the man as he enters the tunnel.As the truck continues into an underground complex, the soundtrack changes to sinister chanting in Latin somewhat like that used in The Omen. While driving in, they pass men cleaning out phone boxes, and also a truck going the other way full of empty phone boxes. By this time, the man is more anguished but despite frantically banging on the glass he's continually ignored.At this point I started to wonder--are the four workmen a metaphor for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, or is it just coincidence because four are needed to load and unload the phone box?Soon after, the truck yields its unlikely cargo to an overhead crane that takes it away and passes it to a series of conveyor belts. The man's improbable fate is then made clear when he's taken past corpses in identical telephone boxes to his own.Coming to a halt the man's phone box is put down next to one containing the other victim he saw earlier. That man has strangled himself with the phone cord rather than endure a drawn-out death.It's all over for the man; he now knows it but still makes a last effort of banging on the glass hoping to be let out. Desperately aware that he's doomed the final shot of him is slowly sliding down the glass of his coffin in despair and resignation.What started out as an ordinary day for an ordinary man has turned into the kind of thing that nightmares are made of.Turning full circle, the film ends back at the plaza, where a shiny new telephone box is installed and its door left open. We are left wondering how long it'll be until some other unlucky person attempts to make a call. The questions about what the hell is going on are never answered.The trapped man is brilliantly played by Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez, a Spanish actor with a substantial list of acting credits to his name.I first saw this film on TV late at night many years ago, and it's been stuck vividly in my memory ever since. It's truly terrifying, playing to archetypal fears like people ignoring your pleas for help and being buried alive.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------From DVD RESURRECTIONSdvdresurrections.com/MovieReview_LaCabina.htmlThis amazing short film was directed by Antonio Mercero for Spanish television in 1972. It's a wonderful example of efficient, lean horror storytelling which squeezes in plenty of thrills and shocks in its 40 minute running time.Essentially a European riff on a Twilight Zone style format, the film begins with a team of workmen installing a new public phone box. Later a mandrops his boy off at the nearby bus stop and then pauses to make a call...But the phone doesn't work and when he tries to exit he finds himself trapped. The filmmaker makes a lot out of the claustrophobic setting in theseopening scenes, the box is glass on all four sides leaving our victim exposed and embarrassed as a crowd gathers to witness the odd spectacle.Small children taunt him, offering him peanuts and calling him a monkey. Several people offer to help including the police, the local strongman and ahandyman with a bag of tools.Soon, the telephone crew appears to take the box with our hero inside, loading it onto a flatbed truck as the amused crowd laugh and wavegoodbye to the hapless prisoner.The film up to this point is presented as a lightweight comedy, with plenty of physical comedy and pratfalls as the crowd attempt, and fail, to breakthe man out of the phone box. However, once the booth is fixed to the truck, the tone shifts subtly into one of increasing dread.First, the man witnesses another guy successfully leaving a similar booth, causing a look of anguish to cross his face. The film is very clever in thisregard, working almost in a silent movie style. The trapped man can only mouth words and use exaggerated gestures to communicate.The truck drives past a funeral in which a young woman can be seen in a glass sided coffin increasing our sense of unease. As the truck pulls up toa junction alongside another lorry transporting another hapless man-in-a-box our guy can barely keep a grip as we finally have our suspicionsconfirmed and realize that everything is wrong and something sinister is afoot...Who has kidnapped him? Where are they going? What terrible fate is about to befall him?The film is a triumph, telling a simple story with an excellent central performance from the lead that has to deliver a huge range of emotionsthrough body language without turning the whole film into an embarrassing pantomime. The photography sets this apart from the usual TVmovie fare and the varied score, which ranges from playful for the comedic opening to apocalyptic during the twisted finale, all help to create a thrillride with a shocking ending that will stay with you for a good while afterwards.", "output": "Question: Where does the truck arrive after many hours?, Answer: a massive underground warehouse, Question: What does the man do when he is carted across town?, Answer: The man watches frantically, Question: What do the phone booths in the warehouse contain?, Answer: mummified remains of other trapped citizens, Question: What does the man discover when he tries to leave the phone booth?, Answer: that the door is stuck, Question: What does the phone booth company do when it appears?, Answer: setting up a similar booth in the same park, Question: Where does the unnamed company install a phone booth?, Answer: middle of the plaza", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

A firing squad executes a small group of Spanish rebels who cry out Down with liberty! or Long live chains! The troops are encamped in a Catholic church which they desecrate by drinking, singing, and eating the communion wafers. The captain caresses a statue of a medieval woman and is knocked unconscious by her husband (a knights funerary statue). In revenge, the captain exhumes the body of the wife to find her face has not decomposed; there is a suggestion of intended necrophilia.Cut to the present day where a nanny is reading the voice-over from a book whilst seated on a park bench. The children in her care are given some pictures by a strange man in the park; there are implications of child abduction or pedophilia. Cut to a close-up of a spider and the interior of a bourgeois apartment where a man is fed up with symmetry as he rearranges his mantelpiece. The children arrive home and show the pictures to their parents who are shocked that the girls have such images. The parents are disgusted and yet erotically stimulated by the images which we assume to be pornographic when we see the images, they are revealed as picture postcards of architecture (there is a satirical nod towards Freudian symbolism in the images of tunnels and columns). The parents then let the children keep the pictures and dismiss the nanny. At bedtime, the husband cant sleep as he is woken in the night by a cockerel, a postman and an emu wandering through his bedroom.In the next scene, the husband visits his doctor, who dismisses these nighttime experiences as apparitions despite the fact that the husband has physical evidence in the form of a letter from the nocturnal postman. The evidence is never considered as the doctors nurse interrupts the conversation to tell her employer that she must visit her sick father. The nurse drives through a rainy night, meeting a military tank on the road that is apparently hunting foxes. The soldiers tell her that the road ahead is blocked; the nurse drives to an isolated hotel.A storm breaks as the nurse checks in at the small rural hotel. Some Carmelite monks are also staying at the hotel. She takes supper in her room while a flamenco dancer and guitarist perform in an adjacent room. The monks interrupt her as she is dressing for bed. They offer to use a holy effigy and prayer to assist her sick father, they begin to pray. Time has passed and the monks are playing a game of poker with the nurse and the hotel manager, gambling with holy relics, smoking and drinking alcohol.That same night, some new guests arrive at the hotel; a young man and his aunt. The young nephew has brought his aunt to the hotel for an incestuous affair yet another sexual taboo is addressed. They retire to their room, the elderly aunt confesses that she is a virgin, when the nephew pulls back the sheets to look at her naked body; she has the body of a young woman. The nephew is refused by his aunt and leaves his room to join another couple (a hatter and his female assistant) for a drink. The nurse and the four monks are also invited into the hatters room. While the guests are socialising, the hatters assistant dons a dominatrix outfit with a whip. The hatter, who is wearing bottomless trousers, proceeds to be masochistically flagellated by his assistant in front of the other guests who are shocked and leave. The nephew returns to his aunt, who is now willing to make love with him.The next morning, the nurse leaves for the town of Argenton, giving a lift to another resident who is breakfasting in the bar. This resident is a professor at the police academy. He is dropped off at work where he gives a lecture to a class of delinquent policemen on the subject of the relativism of laws, customs and taboos. The lecture is constantly interrupted until only two officers are left in the class. The professor continues, using a dinner party at his friends house to illustrate a point he is making. We then cut to the dinner party which is being held in a modern bourgeois apartment.The guests are seated around the table on flushing toilets. They politely discuss various issues around the topic of defecation whilst publicly using the toilets that they are sitting on. When a guest is hungry, he excuses himself and retires to a private cubicle to eat food.We cut back to the police lecture. The two policeman go on duty where they stop a speeding motorist (Mr. Legendre) who is rushing to see his doctor. Mr. Legendre is eventually told by his doctor that he has cancer and offered a cigarette, he slaps his doctor and returns home. Once home, he tells his wife that nothing is wrong with him. They receive a phone call informing them that their daughter has disappeared from school.We now cut to the school where the teachers insist that the little girl has vanished despite the fact that she is physically present. Her disappearance is reported to the police, the girl is present but none of the adults admit to her presence. In this absurdist scene, she is there the adults are able to see and speak to her, yet they act as if she is missing.We follow one of the policemen, who is having his shoes shined. We then follow the man who is sitting next to him to the top of a tower block. This man is a sniper who randomly kills people in the streets below. He is arrested, found guilty and sentenced to death but leaves the courtroom to be treated as a celebrity.Mr. Legendre is called to see the Prefect of Police who returns the missing daughter. The prefect is about to read a letter explaining how the girl was found but is interrupted and leaves to visit a bar. In the bar he meets a woman who looks like his dead sister (we see a flashback in which he remembers his sister playing the piano, naked). He then receives a phone call from his dead sister, asking him to meet her at the mausoleum. When he visits the cemetery at night, he finds a telephone in the crypt by his sisters coffin; her hair is hanging out of the coffin. He is suddenly arrested for desecration by officers who refuse to believe that he is the Prefect of Police.The prefect is taken to his office, where a different man takes his place. The two men treat each other cordially and discuss crowd control as if they are acquainted. We see the animals in the zoo, the two police chiefs arrive and direct police control of an unseen riot. The film ends with a close-up shot of an ostrichs head.", "output": "Question: What do the squad do in the church ?, Answer: They desecrate the church by drinking, singing, and eating the communion wafers., Question: who is called to see the Prefect of Police who returns the missing daughter?, Answer: Mr. Legendre, Question: What happens to the Captain ?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: what is the name of the spanish city?, Answer: Toledo, Question: How does the film end ?, Answer: The film ends with a close-up shot of an ostrichs head., Question: What are the monks doing in the hotel ?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: who has brought his aunt to the hotel for an incestuous affair yet another sexual taboo is addressed?, Answer: The Young Nephew, Question: who is rushing to his doctor?, Answer: Mr. Legendre, Question: Who do the firing squad execute ?, Answer: The firing squad executes a group of Spanish rebels., Question: What does Mr Legendre's doctor tell him ?, Answer: Mr. Legendre is eventually told by his doctor that he has cancer", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The shooter is Humbert Humbert, a 40-something British professor of French literature.The film then flashes back to events four years earlier. Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores, affectionately called \"Lolita\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert becomes infatuated.To be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. But Charlotte wants all of \"Hum's\" time for herself and soon announces she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte.Things turn sour for the couple in the absence of the nymphet: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and brassy Charlotte more whiny. Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing her as \"the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless baba\". She has an hysterical outburst, runs outside, and is hit by a car, dying on impact.Humbert drives to Camp Climax to pick up Lolita, who doesn't yet know her mother is dead. They stay the night in a hotel that is handling an overflow influx of police officers attending a convention. One of the guests, a pushy, abrasive stranger, insinuates himself upon Humbert and keeps steering the conversation to his \"beautiful little daughter,\" who is asleep upstairs. The stranger implies that he too is a policeman and repeats, too often, that he thinks Humbert is \"normal.\" Humbert escapes the man's advances, and, the next morning, Humbert and Lolita enter into a sexual relationship. The two commence an odyssey across the United States, traveling from hotel to motel. In public, they act as father and daughter. After several days, Humbert tells Lolita that her mother is not sick in a hospital, as he had previously told her, but dead. Grief-stricken, she stays with Humbert.In the fall, Humbert reports to his position at Beardsley College, and enrolls Lolita in high school there. Before long, people begin to wonder about the relationship between father and his over-protected daughter. Humbert worries about her involvement with the school play and with male classmates. One night he returns home to find Dr. Zempf, a pushy, abrasive stranger, sitting in his darkened living room. Zempf, speaking with a thick German accent, claims to be from Lolita's school and wants to discuss her knowledge of \"the facts of life.\" He convinces Humbert to allow Lolita to participate in the school play, for which she had been selected to play the leading role.While attending a performance of the play, Humbert learns that Lolita has been lying about how she was spending her Saturday afternoons when she claimed to be at piano practice. They get into a row and Humbert decides to leave Beardsley College and take Lolita on the road again. Lolita objects at first but then suddenly changes her mind and seems very enthusiastic. Once on the road, Humbert soon realizes they are being followed by a mysterious car that never drops away but never quite catches up. When Lolita becomes sick, he takes her to the hospital. However, when he returns to pick her up, she is gone. The nurse there tells him she left with another man claiming to be her uncle and Humbert, devastated, is left without a single clue as to her disappearance or whereabouts.Some years later, Humbert receives a letter from Mrs. Richard T. Schiller, Lolita's married name. She writes that she is now married to a man named Dick, and that she is pregnant and in desperate need of money. Humbert travels to their home and finds that she is now a roundly expectant woman in glasses leading a pleasant, humdrum life. Humbert demands that she tell him who kidnapped her three years earlier. She tells him it was Clare Quilty, the man that was following them, who is a famous playwright and with whom her mother had a fling in Ramsdale days. She states Quilty is also the one who disguised himself as Dr. Zempf, the pushy stranger who kept crossing their path. Lolita herself carried on an affair with him and left with him when he promised her glamour. However, he then demanded she join his depraved lifestyle, including acting in his \"art\" films, which she vehemently refused.Humbert begs Lolita to leave her husband and come away with him, but she declines.

We see Gracie Hart as a child who beats up the bully and tries to help the victim (whom she liked), who instead, criticizes her by saying he disliked her because he did not want a girl to help him. She promptly punches the boy in the nose and sulks in the playground.We go forward in time to where Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) works for the Federal Bureau of Investigation with Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) as a Special Agent. We see her on a mission where she does not follow orders from her superior and tries to stop their target from choking. Because of her actions one of her squad gets shot. She is put on a desk job.The bureau receives a threat against the 75th annual Miss United States beauty pageant in San Antonio, Texas from notorious domestic terrorist \"Citizen\". Eric is elected to lead the mission to stop a supposed attack. A computer search identifies Hart as the female FBI agent best qualified to go undercover as a contestant (as Miss New Jersey, the original having quit after she was discovered to have been in a porn film), although she pays little attention to her femininity.Beauty pageant coach Victor Melling (Michael Caine), whose reputation was ruined after his last contestant criticized his methods, teaches the tomboyish Hart how to dress, walk, and act like a contestant. She is unused to such behavior, however, and sees the pageant and its participants as \"outdated and antifeminist\". Several suspects exist, including competition director and former pageant winner Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergen); her unpleasant son/assistant Frank Tobin (Steve Monroe); veteran emcee Stan Fields (William Shatner) who, like Morningside, is to be soon replaced by a younger person; and Rhode Island's Cheryl Frasier (Heather Burns), possibly a radical animal rights activist.Representing New Jersey as \"Gracie Lou Freebush\", Hart impresses the audience by playing the glass harp and by later demonstrating self-defense techniques during a talent demonstration, when the other girls drink out of the glass harp. She unexpectedly becomes friends with Frasier and the other contestants. When Citizen is caught elsewhere, Hart gives up her badge and gun in order to continue the pageant investigation alone.Just as Matthews is going to board the plane back to the bureau, he works out that Hart's suspicions were correct. Hart surprises everyone, including herself, by becoming runner-up to Frasier. The agents discover that Morningside and Tobin have been secretly impersonating Citizen due to her old grudge against the contest, and prevent them from murdering Frasier with a bomb in the title tiara. Hart's fellow contestants choose her as Miss Congeniality, and she starts a relationship with Matthews.", "output": "Question: How does Hart see the beauty pageant and its participants?, Answer: outdated and antifeminist, Question: When does Hart give up her badge and gun?, Answer: When Citizen is caught, Question: Whose suspicions were correct?, Answer: Hart, Question: Who played Stan Fields?, Answer: William Shatner, Question: What is Victor Melling's profession?, Answer: beauty pageant coach, Question: Who leads the mission to stop the attack?, Answer: Eric, Question: Where does Gracie Hart work?, Answer: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Question: Where does the film open?, Answer: At a school, Question: Which instrument does Hart play in the movie?, Answer: Glass Harp, Question: What profession does Benjamin Bratt play in the film?, Answer: Special Agent, Question: Who is the runner up to Fraiser?, Answer: Hart, Question: Who issues the threat against the 75th annual Miss United States beauty pageant?, Answer: Citizen, Question: Where does Gracie Hart sulk?, Answer: In the playground", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

With only a change of underwear, a map, and nine dollars, Dicey, James, Maybeth, and Sammy take off on foot to Bridgeport where their nearest known relative, Aunt Cilla, lives. Along the way, Dicey struggles to care for and protect her siblings.After finally arriving at Aunt Cilla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Eunice, their cousin, tells them that Aunt Cilla had died last spring. Eunice consults Father Joseph, who decides that the children may stay but only temporarily. Eunice tells Dicey of Abigail Tillerman, their grandmother, who lives in Crisfield, Maryland, and gives them some money. Dicey decides to take her siblings to their grandmother's house, but upon arriving they realize they do not know where she lives. While stopping at a store, a woman tells them that Abigail doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a phone and is isolated clear out of town. Dicey decides to meet her alone, so she leaves James in charge of Maybeth and Sammy.After knocking on the door and getting no answer, Dicey goes around back to see Mrs. Tillerman sitting on the back porch. Dicey asks if she can do anything to help on the farm. Mrs. Tillerman silently marches back into the house before asking Dicey to join her.Inside, she questions Dicey about her thoughts on death and other such morbid things. Upon realizing she needs to just get up and leave, Abigail tells Dicey that Eunice wrote to warn her the children would be coming, and that she knows who Dicey is. However, she will not let the children stay. Dicey fires back, stating she doesn't want to stay. In the midst of the fierce conversation that ensues, Abigail begins to laugh and softens Dicey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mood a little. Abigail and Dicey takes her boat to pick up the other children, and Dicey is scared when she doesn't see her siblings. Eventually, Dicey and Abigail find Sammy, who says James and Maybeth wanted to meet Abigail themselves and have already left. They return to Abigail's to find James and Maybeth just arriving.Over the next few days, the children help their grandmother around the farm and with the cooking, and Abigail begins to warm toward them. However, Abigail tells Dicey she can't let the children stay with her; she is too old, has no money and fears making the same mistakes she made with her own children. One day while they stay over, Abigail receives a letter from Eunice discovering that Liza is found from the police and is discovered she has gone mentally insane, with a photo for evidence. Liza is put in a mental institution and is suffering from catatonia, closely enough to being schizophrenic. The people of the mental institution deem she will not be cured. Later on during their stay, Abigail insists the children must go back to Bridgeport and arranges for them to take the morning bus.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)In 1965, Mossad agent Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain) arrives in East Berlin to meet with fellow agents David Peretz (Sam Worthington) and Stefan Gold (Marton Csokas). Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen)\u00e2\u0080\u0094infamously known as \"The Surgeon of Birkenau\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War II\u00e2\u0080\u0094and bring him to Israel to face justice.Rachel and David present themselves as an ethnic German married couple from Argentina and Rachel plants herself as a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic.Both Stefan and David develop an attraction to Rachel. Rachel shows a preference for David, yet sleeps with Stefan shortly after David rebukes her advances. This tryst leads to Rachel becoming pregnant. Stefan also reveals to Rachel that David lost his entire family in The Holocaust.At a doctors appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance, barely ahead of the real ambulance team. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at Wollankstrasse Station, on a railway line along the sector boundary between East and West Berlin, and next to a mail depot. As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting East German guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to collect the compromised Rachel. The agents are left with no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction.The agents take turns monitoring and feeding Vogel, who attempts to psychologically humiliate and intimidate them. During his shift, David becomes violently enraged after Vogel explains his beliefs that Jews have many weaknesses, such as selfishness, making them easily subdued. David smashes a glass plate over Vogel's head and repeatedly beats him, only to be stopped and restrained by Stefan. While Rachel is in charge of monitoring, Vogel manages to cut through his bonds using a shard of the broken plate and ambushes Rachel with the shard, leaving her with a permanent scar on her face. He then escapes into the night as the agents are left to assess their failure.Panicking and hoping to save face for both himself and for Israel, Stefan convinces Rachel and David to go along with the fiction that Vogel was killed. They agree to lie and use the cover story that Rachel shot and killed Vogel as he attempted to flee.In the following years, the agents become venerated as national heroes for their roles in the mission. During a party in 1970, at the home of Rachel and Stefan (now married), Rachel confesses to David her distaste with her current life; Stefan puts his career and social status ahead of her while also punishing her for not loving him and having feelings for David. David admits his intention to leave Mossad and the country, imploring Rachel to come with him. Rachel cannot bring herself to abandon her daughter (the result of Rachel and Stefan's time together in hiding in East Germany) and she and David part ways.In 1997, Rachel (Helen Mirren) is honoured by her daughter Sarah (Romi Aboulafia) during a release party in Tel Aviv for Sarah's book based on the account Rachel, Stefan and David gave of the events in 1965. Concurrently, David (Ciar\u00c3\u00a1n Hinds) is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan (Tom Wilkinson) waiting in another vehicle and commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck.At a dinner after their daughter's book release party, Stefan takes Rachel aside to set a meeting to discuss new information he has obtained. Later, at David's flat, Stefan provides evidence that Vogel now resides at an insane asylum in Ukraine, and is soon scheduled to be interviewed by a local journalist.David had been investigating the man at Stefan's request and, according to Stefan, killed himself out of fear that the lie would be exposed. Rachel refutes Stefan's explanation, recalling an encounter with David a day before his suicide, in which he revealed his shame about the lie and disclosed that he had spent years unsuccessfully searching the world for Vogel. He was further disheartened by Rachel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s admission that she would continue propagating the lie to protect those closest to her, particularly her daughter.Nevertheless, Rachel finally feels compelled to travel to Kiev, where she investigates the journalist's lead and identifies the asylum. She reaches the room just minutes before the journalist and discovers the man claiming to be Vogel is an impostor, a senile old man who apparently fancies the notoriety. Describing the encounter to Stefan over the phone, Rachel declares she will not continue to lie about the 1965 mission. She leaves a note for the journalist and prepares to leave, but suddenly spots Vogel (in his 80s by now) among the other patients and follows him to an isolated area of the hospital.After a confrontation in which Vogel stabs her twice with scissors, Rachel kills Vogel by plunging a poisoned syringe into his back. As she limps from the asylum, Rachel's note is discovered and read by the journalist. It describes the truth of the mission, ready to be relayed to the world.", "output": "Question: What year is the party organised?, Answer: 1970., Question: What does David smash over Vogel's head?, Answer: Glass Plate, Question: Who does Vogel ambush?, Answer: Rachel, Question: Who killed himself?, Answer: David, Question: Who went along with Stefan and David's fiction that Vogel was killed?, Answer: Rachel, Question: who discovers and reads Rachel's note ?, Answer: A journalist discovers and reads Rachel's note., Question: Who plays Rachel?, Answer: Helen Mirren, Question: How did David loose his entire family?, Answer: in The Holocaust, Question: Where is the insane asylum Vogel resides in?, Answer: Ukraine, Question: Who refutes Stefan's explanation?, Answer: Rachel, Question: Where does Rachel feel compelled to travel to?, Answer: Kiev, Question: Who is honoured by her daughter Sarah?, Answer: Rachel, Question: What does Rachel tell Stefan she will not continue to lie about?, Answer: the 1965 mission, Question: What does Rachel inject Vogel with?, Answer: a sedative drug, Question: Where do the agents bring Vogel?, Answer: to their apartment, Question: Who plays Dieter?, Answer: Jesper Christensen, Question: When does Rachel arrive in East Berlin?, Answer: 1965, Question: How does Rachel kill Vogel ?, Answer: Rachel kills vogel by plunging a poisoned syringe into his back., Question: Who does Rachel spot when she prepares to leave?, Answer: Vogel, Question: Who admits his intention to leave Mossad and the country?, Answer: David., Question: Who puts his career and social status ahead of her?, Answer: Stefan, Question: what ethnicity do rachel and david present themselves by?, Answer: german, Question: Who are the agents monitoring?, Answer: Vogel, Question: Why does Stefan take Rachel aside?, Answer: to discuss new information he has obtained, Question: What do they plan in the apartment?, Answer: a new extraction", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

While eating leftovers left behind at a table at the mall food court, two rude middle-aged women notice him and openly talk (very out loud) about how disgusted they are by his appearance. As Vale angrily glares at them, one of the women suddenly goes into convulsions and falls to the floor shaking. Two men in trench coats appear and give chase. As Vale runs, one of the trench coat men shoots him in the hand with a dart gun. Vale runs, pursued through the mall and finally collapses to the floor.Vale wakes up strapped to a bed in a warehouse. Dr. Paul Ruth (Patrick McGoohan) approaches Vale and tells him that he is a derelict because he is a \"scanner\". Ruth ushers in a group of people whose voices grow in volume but their lips do not move. Vale thrashes on the bed as he cannot block out their thoughts. Ruth administers an injection and the voices fade away.At a lecture at the ConSec corporation, the audience watches a demonstration of \"scanning\". The demonstrator tells them that he is a scanner who can scan peoples thoughts and asks for a volunteer display his powers. A man (Michael Ironside) steps forward and offers to volunteer. The demonstrator asks him to think of something specific which the demonstrator will scan his thoughts to discover. The scanner soon directs his focus, but he is soon goes into great pain, shaking in unbearable agony until his head literally explodes, showering blood, brain and skull matter all over the stage. Panic erupts in the auditorium as people flee towards the exits. Security guards grab the volunteer saying that have another scanner among them. They take the volunteer away at gunpoint to a stairwell where Dr. Gatineau is told to administer a shot of \"ephemeral\" but the scanner makes him inject his own hand instead. As the volunteer is driven to \"the factory\" in a car with two security guards, a second security car suddenly swerves into a wall and explodes killing the two inside the car. The lead car stops to help. The man smiles as the chief of security shoots the two guards and then himself. The sinister scanner then escapes into the night.The next day, ConSec Chairman Trevelyan address the board of directors saying: \"Last night, we at ConSec chose to reveal to the outside world our work with those telepathic curiosities known as scanners. The result: six corpses and substantial loss in credibility for our organization\". The new director of security, Braedon Keller (Lawrence Dane), wants the scanner program shut down. Dr. Ruth points out that the man responsible is a scanner. His own scanners have all been lost to a powerful underground organization led by the same man: Darryl Revok, the volunteer from the other night who has been identified from the security images on CCTV cameras. Ruth proposes infiltrating Revok's organization. Keller scoffs at the idea as foolish, but Ruth says that he has a \"very special\" new scanner who will help them.Ruth shows Vale a film of a younger Revok in a psychiatric institute, a hole drilled in his forehead. Revok says he did it to \"let the people out\". Revok grows quite agitated and his pacified by two orderlies. In a local metro station, Keller informs an unseen man about Vale.Ruth stages a test. Vale makes Yoga master Dieter Tautz's heart beat faster, despite his efforts to retain control. In agony, he begs Vale to stop. Ruth is astonished by Vale's power. His next task is to find artist Benjamin Pierce, a possible link to Revok's underground organization.Vale goes to a local art gallery where he makes the owner, Arno Crostic, an offer for one of Pierce's bizarre sculptures. When told it is impossible for him to meet the artist, Vale scans Crostic for Pierce's location, and is in turn scanned by a woman. When Vale turns around she is gone.At his rural workshop (which is a rundown barn), Pierce is angered by Vale's arrival. Sitting inside a giant sculpted head, he refuses to answer questions. Suddenly, four assassins burst in and open fire with shotguns, eventually wounding Pierce mortally. Vale's scan flings them across the studio, killing two of them. The dying Pierce's thoughts give Vale a name: \"Kim Obrist\".After resting at his hotel room for a while, Vale travels to a rowhouse and finds Kim Obrist (Jennifer O'Neill), who is the young woman from the gallery, but Revok and his men have staked out her house. As her group of scanners sits in a circle, minds linked, two of Revok's assassins burst in and start blasting. Kim's scan throws them into a wall and they burst into flames. The survivors make their getaway in an old bus, but it is ambushed by more of Revok's men and plows into a record store. An assassin follows, only to be paralyzed by Vale's scan. The scan searches for something he owns that will lead them to Revok. The assassin gives him a medicine vial with a \"BioCarbon Amalgamate\" logo on the label.At the BioCarbon Amalgamate building, there is a sterile lab environment where workers wear white fallout suits. One of them is Vale who has snuck into the building and watches Revok direct operations. A computer image shows a delivery of ephemeral. Access to the program, called \"Ripe\" is limited to ConSec terminals only.Vale calls Ruth, saying he's bringing in an informant from Revok's group. At the metro station, Revok instructs Keller to kill Ruth if he discovers anything. Meanwhile, Vale and Kim arrive at ConSec, and are injected with ephemeral. Keller takes Kim for interrogation. Vale protests, but Ruth confides their injections were harmless. Vale says that BioCarbon Amalgamate manufactures ephemeral for Revok, and sends it out in tankers. The destinations are on the ConSec computer, meaning a traitor is working with Revok. Ruth tells Vale to access the Ripe program as he does not have computer clearance. Vale says neither does he. Ruth tells Vale: \"No, but you do have a nervous system... and so does a computer\".In the interrogation room, Keller knows that Kim is not from Revok's group. He pulls out a gun to shoot her, but is overpowered by her scan. As Kim escapes from the room, Keller sounds the alarm. Vale runs to find her, and Keller shoots Ruth. Vale and Kim use their scan to escape from the guards and out of the building.On a rural road, Vale mentally downloads the Ripe program via a gas station pay phone. Keller is informed that someone is accessing the program, and at gunpoint, orders the technician to self-destruct the computer. Vale is hurt by the destruction of the computer, but his wave of destructive energy surges down the phone line, causing an explosion that kills Keller and the technicians at their computers. The overhead power lines break and fall, setting the nearby gas station on fire, and then it explodes. Vale and Kim head for the nearest doctor on the Ripe program list.In Dr. Frane's waiting room, Kim is scanned by a pregnant woman's unborn child. She is felled by a dart. Vale carries her outside where Revok and his men wait and they too shoot him with a drugged dart.Vale wakes up in Revok's office at BioCarbon Amalgamate where he reveals to Vale that Paul Ruth was their biological father. He gave ephemeral to his pregnant wife, whom was one of his many patients in the scanner project, so he could observe on the side effects on his own children. Revok wants them to leave the \"whole generation of scanner soldiers just a few months away from being born.\" Vale refuses to join Revok's side and strikes him in the face. Revok launches a furious mental assault as both viciously scan each other causing each other's blood vessels to expand. Vale seems to be losing the mind battle as Revok's ravaging scan causes his body to bleed, corrode and burn. His eyes seem calm until they are blown out. Revok summons a final intense burst as he goes into convulsions and his own body is affected.A little later, Kim wakes up in the waiting room and enters the office and finds Vale's charred corpse laying on the ground. Kim looks distraught but senses something as she says \"Cameron?\" In the corner of the room a figure huddles under a coat which is Revok. Upon rising and walking towards Kim, Revok has now as Vale's blue eyes and his forehead scar is gone. Speaking in Vale's voice Revok says: \"It's me, Kim. Cameron, I'm here. We've won.

He has a meeting with several prominent bankers, as he hopes to donate a large sum of cash and join the bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board of trustees, thereby having an honest job and keeping his word to his father. Anthony Rossano, Snaps's young, good-natured accountant, arrives at the mansion and tells his boss that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in love, asks for a 250% raise, then tells Snaps the true love he speaks of is actually \"Snaps's daughter.\" Snaps is furious, does not want his daughter marrying Anthony and goes to talk to his daughter, Lisa.Lisa is the only child of Snaps and Sofia, a spoiled daughter whose dreams of seeing the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great sights run into a roadblock because of her overly protective father. Wishing to move out of the house, she lies to her parents (at the suggestion of the maid, Nora) and claims to be pregnant. Snaps, believing the father to be Anthony (as he wants to marry \"Snaps's daughter\"), is shocked when Lisa says the father is Oscar, the former chauffeur who is now serving overseas in the military.Things get even more complicated when Anthony learns that Theresa, the woman he fell in love with, is not actually Snaps' daughter as she had claimed to be. Before Anthony can catch on, Snaps tricks him into agreeing to marry his actual daughter, Lisa, who is supposedly pregnant but without a husband. Both Lisa and Anthony are unhappy at the hasty arrangement, and the pair luck out when Lisa falls in love with someone else: Dr. Thornton Poole, Snaps' dialectician, whose frequent world travels appeal to her adventurous nature.Meanwhile, local police lieutenant Toomey is keeping an eye on the mansion, believing that Snaps is meeting with Chicago mobsters soon. Also watching Snaps is mob rival Vendetti, who, too, believes that Snaps is meeting Chicago mobsters. Vendetti plans a hit on Snaps in the early afternoon while Toomey plans a raid at the same time to catch Snaps red-handed.While Anthony seeks out Theresa, Snaps meets his mansion's new maid, Roxie. As it turns out, Roxie is an old flame of Snaps, and the pair talk memories and the life that never was. Theresa comes to the mansion and is revealed to be Roxie's daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0094who was actually fathered by Snaps long ago\u00e2\u0080\u0094making Snaps her dad after all. The impromptu celebration of both his daughters' engagements is cut short by the arrival of the bankers. During the meeting, Snaps senses the bankers are giving him a raw deal\u00e2\u0080\u0094they don't intend to give him any actual influence in the bank's operations, despite the money he's willing to invest. The meeting is interrupted by police officers and Toomey, who is embarrassed to find no money or gangsters present on site. He leaves the mansion just in time for Vendetti's car full of armed men to crash right outside. Toomey smiles for reporters and arrests the men.With the realization that he'd rather deal with gangsters and gunmen than \"respectable\" bankers, Snaps decides to abandon his short-lived honest ways and return to a life of crime (looking skyward and admitting to his father, \"Sorry, dad... I did the best I could\"). The final scene of the movie shows a double wedding for both his daughters. Oscar himself finally appears and objects to Lisa's marriage, but he is carried off by Snaps' men and the weddings end happily.", "output": "Question: Who plans a hit on Snaps?, Answer: Vendetti, Question: Who smiles for the reporters?, Answer: Toomey, Question: Who is Anthony?, Answer: Snaps' young accountant., Question: What board does Snaps hope to join?, Answer: the bank's board of trustees, Question: Who is an old flame of Snaps?, Answer: Roxie, Question: Who does Anthony find out is not Snap's daughter ?, Answer: Theresa., Question: Who does Snaps have a meeting with?, Answer: several prominent bankers, Question: Who is the woman Anthony fell in love with ?, Answer: Theresa., Question: What is the name of the local police lieutenant?, Answer: Toomey, Question: Who's wedding does Oscar object to?, Answer: Lisa, Question: Who is Roxie's daughter?, Answer: Theresa, Question: How much of a raise does he ask for ?, Answer: 250%!, Question: Who is Lisa's father?, Answer: Snaps, Question: Does Snaps begin an important or an irrelevant morning?, Answer: important, Question: Oscar is a former what?, Answer: Chauffeur, Question: Who does Snaps believe is Lisa's baby's father?, Answer: Anthony, Question: How much later does Snaps awake at his mansion?, Answer: a month later, Question: Is Anthony Rossano an old man or is he young?, Answer: young, Question: What is Anthony Rossano's occupation?, Answer: accountant, Question: What does the meeting of bankers entail?, Answer: He hopes to donate a large sum of cash and join the board of trustees., Question: Who promises his dying father that he will give up a life of crime?, Answer: Angelo", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

While hunting, they discover an iceberg that when broken open shoots a beam of light into the sky. Inside of the iceberg is a thirteen-year-old boy named Aang and a giant flying bison named Appa. Unknown to them, Aang is the long-lost Avatar \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the only person capable of \"bending\" all four elements of Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. One hundred years have passed since the Fire Nation has declared war on the other three nations of Air, Water, and Earth in their attempt to conquer the world.Zuko is the scarred seventeen-year-old exiled prince of the Fire Nation on a quest to find the Avatar and bring him to his father, Fire Lord Ozai, so he can regain his honor. Seeing the light that appeared from Aang's release, Zuko and some Fire Nation soldiers arrive at the Southern Water Tribe to demand the villagers hand over the Avatar. Aang reveals himself and surrenders to Zuko on the condition that he agrees to leave the village alone. On the ship, Aang is tested by Zuko's paternal uncle Iroh to confirm he is the Avatar. After being informed that he is to be their prisoner for passing the test, Aang escapes using his glider and flies to his flying bison brought by Katara and Sokka. Aang and his new friends visit the Southern Air Temple where they meet a winged lemur, who Aang later names Momo. Aang also learns that he was in the ice for a whole century and that the Fire Nation wiped out all of the Air Nomads, including his guardian, Monk Gyatso. In despair, he enters the Avatar State and finds himself in the Spirit World where he encounters a Dragon Spirit. Katara's pleas bring Aang back out of the Avatar State.To seek shelter, Aang's group arrives at a little Earth Kingdom village controlled by the Fire Nation, but are arrested and taken to a prison for Earthbenders surrounded by earth [12] because Katara tries to help a young boy escape from Fire Nation soldiers. They incite a rebellion by reminding the disgruntled earthbenders that Earth was given to them. Aang tells Katara and Sokka that he only knows airbending and must master the other three elements. Katara is given a waterbending scroll that she uses to greatly strengthen and hone her waterbending abilities and to help Aang learn as they make their way to the Northern Water Tribe (where Aang will be able to learn from waterbending masters) and liberate more Earth Kingdom villages in the process, weakening the Fire Nation's food and water supplies.During a side track to the Northern Air Temple on his own, Aang is betrayed by a peasant and captured by a group of Fire Nation archers, led by Commander Zhao, a Fire Nation Commander appointed by the Fire Lord. However, a masked marauder, the \"Blue Spirit\", helps Aang escape from his imprisonment. Zhao realizes that Zuko is the masked vigilante. He arranges to kill the prince, but Zuko survives the attempt on his life with Iroh's help. He sneaks aboard Zhao's lead ship as his fleet departs for the Northern Water Tribe, which is a heavy fortress, to capture the Avatar. Upon arriving, Aang's group is welcomed warmly by the citizens of the Northern Water Tribe. Sokka quickly befriends the Northern Water Tribe princess, Yue. After a few agreements, a waterbending master, Pakku, teaches Aang waterbending. Katara also becomes a much stronger and more powerful waterbender due to her training with Master Pakku.Soon, the Fire Nation arrives and Zhao begins his attack while Zuko begins his search for the Avatar on his own. After defeating Katara in a battle, Zuko captures Aang as he enters the Spirit World to find the Dragon Spirit to give him the wisdom to defeat the Fire Nation who tells him to let his emotions \"flow like water\". Returning to his body, Aang battles Zuko before Katara freezes him. Before leaving to join the battle, Aang lowers the ice so that Zuko can breathe. As the battle escalates, Iroh watches Zhao capture the Moon Spirit, with which its Ocean Spirit counterpart had assumed the form of a fish. Despite Iroh's pleas, Zhao kills the Moon Spirit to strip all of the waterbenders of their ability to waterbend. Yue explains to everyone that the Moon Spirit gave her life, willing to give it back as she dies in the process. With the tables turned, Zhao finds out Zuko survived. They almost fight before Iroh appears and tells Zuko it's not worth it. Zhao is drowned by waterbenders after Zuko and Iroh leave him to his fate. Aang remembers his life before being trapped in the ice, including when he left his home, seeing his master's face. With his waterbending powers and his emotions \"flowing like water\", Aang enters the Avatar State and raises the ocean into a gigantic wall to drive the armada back. Aang now fully embraces his destiny as the Avatar as he, Katara and Sokka prepare to continue their journey to the Earth Kingdom to find an earthbending teacher for Aang. The Fire Lord learns of the defeat; angry over the betrayal of his brother Iroh and the failure of his eldest son Zuko, he tasks his youngest daughter Azula (and Zuko's sister) to stop the Avatar from mastering Earth and Fire before the arrival of Sozin's Comet.", "output": "Question: Who is the exiled prince of the Fire Nation?, Answer: Prince Zoku, Question: What does Pakku teach Aang?, Answer: waterbending, Question: What is the name of the exiled prince of the fire nation?, Answer: Zuko, Question: How old is Katara?, Answer: fifteen, Question: Who teaches Aang waterbending?, Answer: Master Pakku, Question: How long was Aang trapped in ice?, Answer: One hundred years, Question: What are the four nations?, Answer: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth, Question: What is Katara and Sokka's relationship?, Answer: They are siblings., Question: Who is the long lost Avatar?, Answer: URSA", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \"Rita\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key.In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man (Mark Pellegrino) attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.Trying to learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkies and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name \"Diane Selwyn\". They find Diane Selwyn in the phone book and call her, but she does not answer. Betty goes to an audition, where her performance is highly praised. A casting agent takes her to the set of a film called The Sylvia North Story, directed by Adam, where Camilla Rhodes gives an audition and Adam declares, \"This is the girl.\" Betty smiles shyly as she locks eyes with Adam, but she flees before she can meet him, saying that she is late to meet a friend.Betty and Rita go to Diane Selwyn's apartment and break in when no one answers the door. In the bedroom they find the body of a woman who has been dead for several days. Terrified, they return to their apartment, where Rita disguises herself with a blonde wig. The two women have sex that night and awake at 2 a.m., when Rita insists they go to an eerie theater called Club Silencio. On stage, a man explains in several languages that everything is an illusion; a woman begins singing then collapses, although her vocals continue. Betty finds a blue box in her purse that matches Rita's key. Upon returning to the apartment, Rita retrieves the key and finds that Betty has disappeared. Rita unlocks the box, and it falls to the floor with a thump.The older red-headed woman investigates the sound, but nothing is there. The Cowboy appears in the doorway of Diane Selwyn's bedroom saying, \"Hey, pretty girl. Time to wake up.\" At this point, all elements of the narrative seem to change. Diane Selwyn (played by Watts) wakes up in her bed. She looks exactly like Betty, but is portrayed as a failed actress driven into a deep depression by her unrequited love for Camilla Rhodes (played now by Harring). On Camilla's invitation, Diane attends a party at Adam's house on Mulholland Drive. Her limousine stops before they reach the house and Camilla escorts her using a shortcut. Adam appears to be in love with Camilla. Over dinner, Diane states that she came to Hollywood when her aunt died, and she met Camilla at an audition for The Sylvia North Story. Another woman (played by George) kisses Camilla and they turn and smile at Diane. Adam and Camilla prepare to make an important announcement, and dissolve into laughter and kiss while Diane watches, crying.Diane meets with the hit man at Winkies, where she gives him Camilla's photo and a large amount of money, and they are served by a waitress named Betty. The hit man tells Diane that when the job is done, she will find a blue key. Diane asks what, if anything, the key opens, but the hit man just laughs. Diane looks up and sees the man who had the nightmare standing at the counter. Back at her apartment, with the key on a table in front of her, she is terrorized by hallucinations. She runs screaming to her bed, where she shoots herself.

A bike shop employee, Dottie, has a crush on Pee-wee, but he does not reciprocate it. When Pee-wee's bike gets stolen while at the mall, he offers a $10,000 reward for its return. Francis, who had paid to have someone steal the bike, is frightened by Pee-wee's relentlessness and has it sent away. Desperate, Pee-wee visits a psychic, Madam Ruby, who claims that the bike is in the basement of the Alamo. Pee-wee hitchhikes to Texas, getting rides from a fugitive, Mickey, and from Large Marge (the ghost of a deceased truck driver).At a truck stop, Pee-wee discovers his wallet is missing and pays for his meal by washing dishes. He befriends Simone, a waitress who dreams of visiting Paris. As they watch the sun rise at a dinosaur museum, Pee-wee encourages her to follow her dreams, only to be chased by her jealous boyfriend, Andy. Pee-Wee escapes onto a moving train where he meets a hobo named Jack. He gets off at San Antonio and immediately heads over to the Alamo, only to find the building has no basement. After calling Dottie and asking her to wire him some money, he is attacked by Andy again. Pee-wee evades Andy at a rodeo by disguising himself as a bull rider. Forced to ride for real, Pee-wee does surprisingly well but receives a concussion.Pee-wee enters a biker bar to make a phone call, but an outlaw motorcycle club called \"Satan's Helpers\" tell Pee-wee that the bar is not open to the public and kick Pee-wee out. Pee-wee accidentally knocks over their bikes, but escapes certain death by dancing to the song \"Tequila\". The bikers have a change in heart and decide to give Pee-wee a motorcycle to get home, but gets into an accident outside the bar and ends up in the hospital. Awakening, Pee-Wee sees a news report that Warner Bros. Studios has acquired his bike where it is being used as a movie prop for a pretentious child actor named Kevin Morton. The scene quickly jumps from Texas to Hollywood, where Pee-wee gains access to the WB studio by pretending to be with Milton Berle's entourage. By disguising himself as an extra on Kevin Morton's movie set, Pee-wee recaptures his bike. However, he must soon evade multiple security guards and wreaks havoc across multiple stages.Outside, Pee-wee discovers a burning pet shop. He heroically rescues the animals, but faints on the sidewalk with a hand full of snakes just as first responders arrive. Although the firemen call Pee-wee a hero, the police arrest him. Warner Brothers executive Terry Hawthorne has the charges against Pee-wee dismissed in exchange for making the adventure of retrieving his bike into a movie.Later at a drive-in theater, Pee-wee and Dottie attend the movie premiere of his supposed biopic, an action B-movie starring James Brolin as \"P.W. Herman\" (who introduces himself as \"Herman, P.W. Herman\") and Morgan Fairchild as Dottie. After ninjas attack the couple and steal an important sport bike called the X-1, P.W. gets a phone call from the unseen President of the United States, who explains that the X-1 has an important microfilm concealed in it, which the Soviets must not be allowed to discover. Pee-wee has a cameo appearance as a hotel bellhop. At the premiere, Pee-wee gives refreshments to all the people he met along his journey including Mickey, Simone, and Jack. Pee-wee also encounters Francis, who brags to the media about how knowledgeable he is about Pee-wee's bike, but makes a fool of himself using one of the bicycle's gadgets. Pee-wee then offers to go bicycling with Dottie, who wonders why he is not staying for the rest of the film, causing Pee-wee to remark that it is not necessary for him to see the movie, since he lived it.", "output": "Question: Who is Simone's jealous boyfriend?, Answer: Andy, Question: What roll did Josh Brolin play in Pee Wee Herman's biopic?, Answer: P.W.

Before leaving the compound, he passes a notebook to his aide Seyyed, instructing him to warn his officers to get to their safehouses and wait for his signal.Four weeks later, U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) and his platoon check a warehouse for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. To Miller's surprise, the warehouse has not been secured, with looters making their way in and out, as soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division are too few to do much. After a firefight with a sniper, Miller finds that the warehouse is empty, the third consecutive time he has found nothing. Later, at a debriefing, Miller brings up the point that the majority of the intel given to him is inaccurate and anonymous. High-ranking officials quickly dismiss his concerns. Afterward, CIA agent Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) tells him that the next place he is to search was inspected by a UN team two months before and that it too has been confirmed empty.Meanwhile, U.S. Department of Defense official Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) welcomes returning Iraqi exile politician Ahmed Zubaidi (Raad Rawi) at the airport. There Poundstone is questioned by Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan). She says she needs to speak directly to \"Magellan\", but Poundstone brushes her off.Meanwhile, while checking another unpromising site, Miller is approached by an Iraqi who calls himself \"Freddy\" (Khalid Abdalla). Freddy tells him that he saw some Ba'ath Party VIPs meeting in a nearby home. They include Al-Rawi and his officers and aides in Baghdad, who are discussing the current situation. Al-Rawi decides to wait for the Americans to offer him a deal, and attack if they don't. As the meeting ends, Miller and his men burst into the house. Al-Rawi narrowly escapes, but Seyyed is captured. Before Miller can extract much information, Seyyed is taken away by Special Operations personnel - however, Miller keeps Al-Rawi's notebook. Dayne complains to Poundstone again, but he states that the stakes are much larger than her role in selling newspapers.Miller goes to Brown's hotel room in the Green Zone, where he tells him what happened and gives him the notebook. Brown arranges for Miller to get into the prison where Seyyed is being interrogated. Miller is then approached by Dayne, who questions him about the false reports of WMDs. Miller bluffs his way in to see Seyyed. Near death after being tortured, he tells Miller that they \"did everything you asked us to in the meeting.\" When Miller asks what meeting he is talking about, he says one word: \"Jordan.\" Miller then confronts Dayne about the bogus intel she published, but she refuses to identify Magellan, her source. After Miller tells her he suspects that Al-Rawi is Magellan, Dayne reluctantly confirms that Magellan met with a high-ranking official in February in Jordan.Miller realizes that Poundstone's men are hunting Al-Rawi, and can think of only one reason: Al-Rawi confirmed there was no Iraqi WMD program and is now a major liability. Poundstone confiscates the notebook from Martin; it contains the locations of Al-Rawi's safe houses. When Miller tries to arrange a meeting with Al-Rawi, he is abducted by Al-Rawi's men following Poundstone's announcement of the decision to disband the entire Iraqi army. Al-Rawi tells Miller that he informed Poundstone that the WMD program had been dismantled after the First Persian Gulf War; Poundstone, however, reported that Al-Rawi had confirmed there were WMDs so the US government would have an excuse to invade. Poundstone's men attack the locations listed in the notebook. When they get to the general's hiding place, he flees, ordering one man to kill Miller. Miller manages to kill his captor and races after Al-Rawi. Miller finally captures Al-Rawi, but Freddy suddenly appears and shoots the general, stating that the fate of Iraq is \"not his to decide.\" With his only witness against Poundstone now dead, Miller tells Freddy to flee.Later, Miller writes a scathing report. He confronts Poundstone in a meeting and gives him the report, but Poundstone dismisses it, telling Miller that WMDs do not matter. Poundstone then rejoins the meeting, only to see Iraqi factional leaders reject Zubaidi, the US's choice as leader of Iraq, as an American puppet and storm out. Afterwards, Dayne receives Miller's report by email.

Larry's neighbor, Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer), advises him to enroll in the local community college and get an education.Subsisting on unemployment benefits and unable to afford to drive his SUV, Larry buys a scooter from Lamar. At the college, he becomes part of a colorful community of outcasts, also-rans, and the overlooked all trying to find a better future for themselves. Two of the classes he takes are speech, taught by Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts) and economics, taught by Dr. Ed Matsutani (George Takei). While he initially struggles in speech class, he does very well in economics.Mercedes drinks at home after school because she is unhappily married to Dean (Bryan Cranston), a former professor turned writer turned blogger. In reality, Dean spends his days looking at internet porn.Larry's economics classmate Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) invites him to join a club of scooter riders led by her boyfriend Dell Gordo (Wilmer Valderrama). She also updates Larry's home decor, hair style, and wardrobe. Larry's friend Frank (Ian Gomez), who runs the diner, offers him a job to help make ends meet, as Larry had been a Navy cook.After a night with Dean goes horribly wrong, Mercedes is left alone at a bus stop, where Larry and his scooter gang notice her. Larry offers her a ride home, which Mercedes reluctantly accepts. On their way home they witness Dean getting arrested for drunk driving. At her front door, they kiss. She wants to have sex as well, but Larry declines, not wanting to take advantage of her inebriated state. When Dean arrives home the following morning he finds all of his possessions on the front lawn.Realizing there is no way he will not lose his house, Larry uses the knowledge he gained in his Economics class to begin a strategic foreclosure. Mercedes, meanwhile, warns Larry not to disclose the events of the previous night, and remains under the false impression that he is romantically involved with the much-younger Talia. It disappoints Larry, who had been excited about Mercedes' interest in him.

Denying this, they set out to break into the Purple Dragons' HQ to get to the bottom of these doppelg\u00c3\u00a4ngers. Upon doing so, the Turtles discover that their \"imposters\" are from the '87 series. They escape together, but the '03 Turtles find the '88 team childish as they refuse talk until lunch. They enter a pizza place, only to terrify the citizens, who call the cops; the turtles flee, only for the '03 Turtles and Splinter to capture them. '88 Leonardo explains his team was fighting Shredder over Mutagen in the Technodrome; the dimensional teleporter malfunctioned, sending them all to this world. Checking recent tremor reports, the Turtles find the Technodrome; however, '88 Shredder manages to elude them, forcing his foes to build a portal device to reach their universe for \"anti-Technodrome gear\". In the meantime, Shredder locates an '03 Shredder on an icy asteroid. After Ch'rell is thawed out, he is contained for vivisection, as he's too insane to work with; however, his adopted daughter, Karai, breaks into and frees him; she had been monitoring his exile.While tracking the Technodrome, the Turtles and Splinter are attacked by Hun and the Purple Dragons, who want their mutagen. Although Hun is in possession of a powerful mutant, Splinter destroys it with the Turtle Truck's missiles. Unfortunately, Hun tackles '88 Donetello into the sewers for the mutagen, becoming exposed; he becomes the very thing he hates - a mutant turtle. He wanders until coming upon the technodrome, now under Ch'rell's control, and vows to serve him again. Ch'rell builds a new exoskeleton for himself, and begins the process of rebuilding the cartoonish fortress into something more worthy of the Shredder; he also improves the Foot bots and mutates the Foot clan. Hun, Bebop and Rocksteady are dispatched to destroy the Turtles, breaking into their lair; it begins crumbling, forcing the Turtles to use their dimensional portal stick to escape into the '87 universe. Splinter is captured by Hun to serve as bait in a trap. Ch'rell uses the dimensional portal, learning there are many parallel universes. He decides to launch an all-out assault on the '03 universe to lure the Turtles out of hiding.Back in the '87 universe, the '03 Turtles meet the '88 versions of April O'Neil and Splinter. The '03 Turtles are welcomed as sons and feel a kinship with the '88 Splinter. After both Donatellos apply their expertise, the Turtles are able to return to the '03 universe with the anti-technodrome gear and the '88 Turtles vehicles: the Party Wagon and Turtle Blimp. They find Casey Jones and April attempting to repel the advancing onslaught, and infiltrate the Technodrome, which now looks like the Death Star. Captured by Ch'rell, the Turtles learn they are not the only versions in the multiverse; he plans to kill the \"Prime\" Turtles, creating a domino effect that erase every other Turtle in the multiverse. All eight are scanned for shared DNA, seemingly vanishing into oblivion as the Technodrome vanishes to the core universe; however, they were teleported them to safety as her father hasn't considered the consequences. Unfortunately, '03 Shredder has already infiltrated the Turtle Prime universe and is now demolishing it; this causes a chain reaction that begins to literally erase everything and everyone in the '03 universe, including April and Casey. Needing to upgrade their portal device, the Turtles break into Purple Dragon HQ; Hun is waiting for them, wanting revenge for his mutation. However, when he sees the world vanishing, Hun surrenders the upgrade tech just before he's erased.The Turtles accomplish their task and just manage to escape being erased, and are teleported to the black-and-white Turtle Prime universe. To their surprise, their originals attack them for no reason, until they mention Shredder. As part of their plan, the other eight will hide while the Prime Turtles lure '03 Shredder out by insulting his pride. Before he comes out, they are challenged by Shredder Prime, who is comically dispatched by the other hiding Turtles. It turns out Karai has teleported them to safety. With the aid of Splinter, Karai, and even the '88 Shredder and Krang, all twelve Turtles then engage Ch'rell in battle. '03 Shredder's exoskeleton grows thanks to molecular amplification technology from Dimension X, but is knocked into the energy the Technodrome is firing and loses some of his suit. Everyone tries knocking him into the beam, but Rocksteady trips and unplugs the power cable. '03 Shredder begins crushing the Prime Turtles, even though Splinter tells him all of reality will vanish. Too insane to care, '03 Shredder continues to crush the Turtles until '88 tosses explosive throwing stars at Ch'rell's leg, causing him to drop the Prime Turtles. Bebop plugs the beam back in, erasing '03 Shredder from existence.With their foe defeated, the Turtles watch as their respective realities restore themselves. Splinter and Karai note that Ch'rell always returns no matter how he is defeated, but the various characters decide they'll be there to stop him whenever he may rise again. The '88 characters take the Technodrome and return to their homeworld, while the '03 characters use the portal stick to return to theirs.

In the opening scene, the Lieutenant (known only as LT) drives his two twin sons from their house somewhere in suburban New York City (either the Bronx or Queens) to their Catholic elementary school where he firmly tells them to respect one another and not to get into trouble. After dropping off his two sons at their school, the Lieutenant snorts some cocaine that he has on him.Afterwards, the Lieutenant drives into Manhattan to a crime scene at Battery Park where a murder has just taken place. The Lieutenant asks a beat cop on the scene for a few pointers to which baseball game he plans to place some bets on. Following the beat cop's tip, the Lieutenant phones one of his many bookies and places a bet for the L.A. Dodgers playing the New York Mets in the upcoming National League Championship. But when he later overhears over his car radio that the Mets beat the Dodgers by 3-0, he finds himself even deeper in debt.That night, the Lieutenant responds to a call on a robbery in Korea town where he confronts three black hoodlums whom a Korean grocery store manager accuses of shoplifting. While sending the manager away for a minute, the Lieutenant tells the two thugs to give him the money they stole from the owner or he will be forced to arrest them. The two African-American thugs have no choice, but to comply and the Lieutenant forces them to run. The Lieutenant then buys some cocaine from a local Hispanic dealer in East Harlem, then buys some heroin from his crack-snorting mistress Zo\u00eb at her apartment. He then picks up two prostitutes where he has a three-way with them while high on drugs.The next day, the Lieutenant is confronted by a mob flunky demanding that he pay him for over $150,000 of losses within three days. The Lieutenant then seeks to get away from his troubled home life of his wife who wants more attention to raise their four children, including their newborn baby. At a local convenience store, more of the Lieutenant's debauchery continues when he robs a thug who steals from the store of all his cash and drugs. That evening, the Lieutenant pulls over a car for speeding and when he finds that the two young teenage girls whom are driving have no drivers licenses, forces one of them to simulate performing fellatio on him while he masturbates right in front of them in order to let them go.The following morning, the Lieutenant is assigned a case where a young nun was gang-raped by two thugs in a small Catholic church in East Harlem. Investigating the scene, and visiting the traumatized nun at the hospital -- he stands in the doorway leering at her naked body while she's being tended to by nurses and a doctor. The Lieutenant asks her for a statement, but she refuses to give one.The Lieutenant continues his decent into more drugs and debauchery with more heroin shooting with his mistress Zo\u00eb, and more cocaine smoking/sniffing binges to drown his sorrows and worry about his debt with the mob bookies whom are now after him.Meanwhile, the Nun gives a statement about her ordeal but then shocks the press when she says that she will not press charges against the two thugs who broke in and raped her and stole from the church because of her Catholic belief in God. She tells the press that she has forgiven the men who raped her. Angered by the Nun's refusal to cooperate with the investigation, the New York Archbishop and the Police Commissioner announce a $50,000 reward to the person or group who finds and captures the two men who raped the nun. The Lieutenant hears about the reward and realizes it would solve most of his debt problems with the mob.The lieutenant's personal descent continues to grow worse with further bets on the World Series that he can't pay and more drugs and drinking. At one point while listening to the game in his car, he hears a play that further ruins his chances of winning his bets and shoots his car stereo. To cover for it he starts up the sirens and speeds off, yelling at the radio.After tracking down several false leads and dealing with another encounter with the mob flunky to pay up what he owes them, the Lieutenant pays another visit to the Nun at the church where he again tries to persuade her to help with his investigation. The Nun again refuses saying that she has forgiven her attackers and she tells the Lieutenant that he should embrace his own demons in order find a path to forgive the evil and find redemption. After the Nun leaves him alone, the Lieutenant has an emotional meltdown and he thinks he sees an image of Jesus standing before him where the cop swears at Him and says that he has only wished to find redemption, but cannot find the right path.Just then, an elderly black woman enters the church holding a brass chalet which she is claiming to 'return' it to it's rightful place. The woman tells the Lieutenant that she knows who the two thugs who broke in and raped the Nun are. The woman says that on the previous day, two Hispanic youths came into the pawn shop where her husband works and attempted to pawn a chalet for cash, which the woman recognized as being from the very same church because she is a regular attendee. The elderly black woman takes the Lieutenant down the street and points out the apartment building where the two thugs reside since they also gave their address when they pawned the stolen items from the church. The Lieutenant breaks into the apartment and arrests the two Hispanic thugs. Handcuffing them, he takes them down to his car and drives them around the city threatening to kill them for sexually violating a nun and also talks about his own brand of justice for what they did.However, just when it looks that he is about to execute them, the Lieutenant breaks down and instead drives the two thugs to the local bus station where he uncuffs them and buys them each a one-way bus ticket to leave New York forever and tells them that as part of his path to redemption, he is letting them go and forgiving them for their crimes just like the nun did.After seeing them away on the bus, the Lieutenant returns to his car still parked outside the bus depot where he seems to wait. Just then, a car pulls up alongside and an unseen mob hit man shoots the Lieutenant to death, and then speeds away just as a crowd gathers around the Lieutenant's parked car, with the dead Lieutenant still inside.", "output": "Question: Who refuses to take his bet ?, Answer: His friend refuses, Question: What does the Lieutenant find in the car?, Answer: two young teenage girls, Question: Does the Lieutenant book the two rapists?, Answer: No, he releases them., Question: What does the Lieutenant ask his colleagues to do with the drugs ?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What bet has the Lieutenant lost ?, Answer: L.A.Dodgers playing the New York Mets, Question: How much is in the cigar box?, Answer: There is no cigar box, Question: The figure is revealed to be a woman holding what?, Answer: a woman holding a gold chalice, Question: At church, what does the Lieutenant tell the nun he will do to her attackers?, Answer: Nothing., Question: Whose confession does he overhear?, Answer: Eavesdropping on the nun's confession., Question: What does the Lieutenant shoot in anger ?, Answer: the two rapists, Question: Who was was penetrated with a crucifix?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who tracks down the two rapists?, Answer: The LT, Question: How much is the Lieutenant's share that he picks up from the drug dealer?, Answer: $30,000, Question: Who on the nun's examination?, Answer: the lieutenant", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Meanwhile the man (who later revealed as the terrorist) disguises as the police officer parks his police motorcycle in front of the Colombian Consulate and the convoy of Colombian officials and American intelligence agents arrive at the consulate. Brewer arrives at the place and he informs the man to pick up his family. As Brewer is about to pick up his family, the bomb in the police motorcycle explodes, killing nearby innocent civilians, the officials, and including his son and wife then Brewer is being hit by a taxi, injuring him.Later, Brewer is traumatized when his family is killed in an explosion. The FBI states that 24 people injured, 9 people dead including those mention above and the explosion is a terrorism act. Brewer is brought to a hospital and removes some shrapnel out of his body. Suddenly, Brewer realize that the man who disguises as the police officer he met before an explosion is the responsible for the attack and the FBI officers tries to thwart him.A tape is sent to the U.S. State Department, in which a man pretends as police officer calling himself \"El Lobo\" (The Wolf) claims responsibility for the bombing, explaining it was in retaliation for America's oppression of Colombia. The FBI believes El Lobo is a Colombian terrorist named Claudio Perrini (Cliff Curtis), the man disguises as police officer who was there in an explosion.At his home, Brewer receives a message on the phone from Ken Barnett of Lateline and he's invited to tell his story about the incident at the studio and pounds the phone. Shortly, the news airs the videotape from El Lobo, claiming the responsibility of the explosion. Also, it claims that they bombed at least 7 places, including the most recent bombing is the Colombian Consulate in Los Angeles. On the TV, we see only the terrorist in silhouette and lower-pitched voice saying that the bombing was an act of self-defense against American war criminals, also, if the Americans continue aggression towards the Colombian, they will bring war to them. The terrorist concludes that Colombia is not their country and has to get out now and make a gesture means \"Sangre o Libertad\" (\"blood or freedom\"). After that, Brewer becomes furious when the reporter mentions the killing of his family and Latin American Solitary Committee Mr. Ortiz calls \"collateral damage\".Brewer then breaks furiously inside the newsroom and begins wild and whacking anything with a baseball bat. A few minutes later, the FBI officers arrive and incapacitate him with an electric gun. Later, Brewer is brought to the FBI and he will not arrest him because Mr. Ortiz dropped the charges on him. Agent Phipps (Miguel Sandoval) ensures that The Wolf is back in Colombia.CIA Special Agent Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas), the Colombia Station Chief, is harshly reprimanded for the incident by a Senate Oversight Committee, who promptly terminate all CIA operations in Colombia. Brandt angrily returns to Momp\u00f3s and meets with his paramilitary allies to plan a major offensive to take down Claudio and his guerilla forces. At Brewer's home, Ed advices to him on how to get inside Colombia.Brewer goes to Mompos, Colombia in order to track down Claudio. First, he gets to the bus and the next morning, the bus suddenly stops when the guerrillas stopped every vehicle on the road and begins checking anything on them. In order to not being seen by the guerrillas, all the passengers inside the bus have to get out and hides beside the running bus. As the passengers running towards the forest, the guerrillas sees them running and begins firing at them, killing some of them. The three girls are being confronted by one of the guerrillas but Brewer subdue him and the three escapes. The guerrillas pursue Brewer until he outruns the guerrillas by jumping off the river. The guerrillas found the Brewer's bag that he left behind before he jumps off, containing his passport.The men presents the copy of Brewer's passport to Brandt and alerts them for Brewer's presents. At the same at the guerrilla camp, Roman presents the copy of Brewer's passport to Claudio and they want to capture him and once they capture Brewer, they will hold a ransom.Brewer goes to Mompos harbor then to the carnival. Brewer sees the motorcycle is about to run towards the boy named Mauro but his mother named Selena pulled him out. After that, Brewer is arrested for entering the country illegally.At the prison, he meet Canadian mechanic Sean Armstrong (John Turturro) and wanted him the pass for guerrilla zone but he refuses. Later at night, the guerrilla troops alerted the prison with the loud horn before they fire a mortar on the prison. There, Claudio and his fellow guerrilla manages to kill the police officers and free the prisoners out. Brewer sees Claudio at the second time. Brewer incapacitates one of the troops and obtains the circular saw they used to free the prisoners. Brewer frees the other prisoners and he will not free Sean unless he give the pass to him. Sean gives the pass to Brewer and frees him. After that, Sean retired as a mechanic and he tells him to get the harbor, once he get to San Pablo, he will ask for Felix Ramirez (John Leguizamo), a drug runner. Also, he tells that Brewer is the replacement of Sean.Brewer goes to the upriver and through the mangrove forest. There, he sees the dead men and the indigenous people. Later, the guerrillas stops the boat and asks them for Felix. Once he get there, Brewer pretends as the mechanic and falsely introduced Felix and one of the guerrillas as \"Heinrich Beckmann\". Brewer and Felix goes to the facility and he pretending to be a mechanic hired to fix a generator, Brewer rigs several improvised explosives.Claudio and his troops confronts one of the guerrillas whom he met \"Beckmann\". He did not realize that \"Beckmann\" is actually Brewer and he made a mistake. The guerrillas forces the man to open his mouth with a metal brace and chokes him with the coral snake, killing him. Claudio tells them to find Brewer.Meanwhile, Brewer still continue making improvised explosives. At night, the guerrillas arrive to find Brewer and tells Felix where Brewer is. Brewer sees them and throws a Molotov cocktail right in front of them and destroying the facility in the process. Roman then shots Felix and dies in front of Brewer hiding under the truck.The truck heads to Claudio's headquarters. Brewer then infiltrates Claudio's headquarters and plants a grenade in the gas tank, but is captured when he tries to prevent a woman named Selena (Francesca Neri) from being caught in the blast radius along with her son, Mauro. At Claudio's home compound, Selena reveals that she is Claudio's wife and that she and Claudio once lost their own child during an attack by American forces, which compelled Claudio to become a terrorist and fight back, while Selena found and adopted Mauro, whose parents were killed in the attack.Meanwhile, Brandt's unit locates Claudio's compound and launches an attack. During the ensuing shootout, Roman and his fellow guerrillas are killed in the process while Selena helps free Brewer. Brewer sees the landmine set in the forest and clears it before they step through. Brewer fights one of the Brandt's unit until he getting blown by landmine. After that, Brewer meet Brandt for the first time in Colombia and he explains that The Wolf is gone to Washington D.C. to blow another building and Selena and her son will come to identify the target.Claudio arrives at Washington D.C, at the same time with Brewer, Selena and her son. The lower-pitched voice over of the terrorist saying about a bomb has been planted in Washington D.C., at the time they hear the message it is too late for them to find it. Claudio leaves the briefcase at Union Station which is contained to be a bomb, then an old man picked the briefcase and try to open it. At Dulles State Department Annex, Selena identifies Union Station as the target. On the pretense of using the restroom, Selena informs the State Department employee to come along and when Mauro refuses to come with her, she becomes irritated. Brewer recognizes Selena make the same gesture and the words \"sangre o libertad\" as the masked man claiming to be El Lobo made in the tape, and realizes that she was the Wolf all along, with Claudio serving as her figurehead. Brewer comes to find Selena. As the officers raid the old man with the briefcase, it turns out empty.Selena then kills one of the State Department employee inside the restroom by snapping her neck. Brewer sees Selena dialing in her cell phone (which he realize that she was there at the time of explosion in L.A. and she was using a cell phone to activate the bomb) and pursues her but fall short when she enters the elevator and kills a man inside. Furthermore, Brewer surmises the real target is the State Department. Brewer quickly throws Mauro's toy dinosaur, which is carrying a bomb, out a window moments before it explodes. Brandt, realizing Brewer's suspicions, is shot and killed trying to stop Selena from fleeing the building.Meanwhile, the second bomb set inside the truck at the basement.Brandt, realizing Brewer's suspicions, is shot in the head while trying to stop Selena from fleeing the building. Brewer opens the elevator door and jumps off the shaft where Selena is in there and she managed to get out before Brewer get in. Selena then subdues Brewer and then she gets out of the shaft. Brewer chases Selena to the basement of the building where she and Claudio ride off through the underground tunnels on a motorcycle. Brewer finds the tunnel control console and shuts the gates, preventing their escape. Brewer chops open some gas lines along the walls of the tunnel and, as they ride back, Selena shoots at Brewer, igniting the gas. Brewer jumps through a doorway just as the entire tunnel explodes. Selena and Claudio survive the blast, however, Claudio and Selena attack him simultaneously. After a short, hand to hand fight, Selena is electrocuted by being tossed on the exposed circuitry of the control panel. Claudio incapacitates Brewer, then just before he detonates the second bomb using his cell phone, Brewer throws an ax on Claudio's chest, finally killing him.In the aftermath, Brewer carries Mauro in his arms as they leave the State Department.

He craves recognition as a full-fledged king of the forest, the ruler of wildlife. Doug convinces Boog to switch his life in the forest for Doug's place at the circus, which Boog later accepts the offer. But the whole thing turns out a scam since all Doug wanted to do was escape.Meanwhile, Boog falls madly in love with Ursa, a female grizzly bear who was born in Russia and can effortlessly walk on a tightrope, juggle and dance. When the couple begin working together, they obtain much more as a harmonious duet than it might seem at first glance. When Boog's pals find out about Boog's disappearance, they, as well as the pets put aside their differences and hatch a rescue mission to save Boog and his true love.Boog's friends arrive at the circus. They want Boog to return home, but he does not want to leave Ursa. All of a sudden, Doug arrives and apoligizes to Boog for tricking him. While Doug performs the circus acts for the audience, Elliot tells Boog that he can stay at the circus if he wants to. Boog does not want to leave Ursa or Elliot, so he convinces Ursa to go live in the forest with them.Ursa enjoys life in the forest.

He spends his life getting into prisons to study their designs and the guards' habits to find and exploit their weaknesses, thus enabling him to escape without a hitch or a victim. His goal is to ensure that criminals sent to prison stay inside by eliminating the weakness of every prison; Breslin's wife and child were murdered by an escaped convict he had successfully prosecuted.Breslin and his business partner Lester Clark are offered a multi-million dollar deal by CIA agent Jessica Mayer to test a top-secret, off-grid prison housing disappeared persons and see if it is escape-proof. However, this time around, he and his work colleagues are not allowed to know where the prison is, as this helps minimize the risk of outside help when escaping. Breslin goes against all his own rules and agrees to the deal, allowing himself to be captured in New Orleans, Louisiana, under the guise of a Spanish terrorist named \"Anthony Portos.\" However, the plan goes awry when his captors remove a tracking microchip from his arm and drug him on the way to the prison, which stops his colleagues from knowing where he has been taken.Breslin wakes up in a complex of glass cells with no outside windows to indicate the prison's location. He discovers that he has been played when he realizes the warden is not the one he is supposed to meet. He meets fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer, who works for a man named Victor Mannheim who is portrayed as a modern-day Robin Hood. The duo stage a fight for Breslin to study the solitary confinement cell, which uses high-powered halogen lights to disorient and dehydrate prisoners. Seeing that the cell floors are made of steel, but the rivets are aluminium, Breslin has Rottmayer acquire a metal plate from Warden Hobbes's office floor before the two of them and Muslim inmate Javed are once again thrown into confinement. Using the metal plate, Breslin focuses the reflection from the lights to heat the steel around the rivets, shearing the rivets when the steel expands, and pops open the floor panel to reveal a passageway below. He discovers that the prison is inside a cargo ship in the middle of the ocean, making a simple escape impossible. Breslin and Rottmayer continue to study the complex by learning the guards' daily routines. However, Hobbes reveals to Breslin that he is aware of his identity, and with chief security officer Drake watching him, he wants to ensure that Breslin spends the rest of his life in prison. Breslin offers Hobbes information on Mannheim from Rottmayer in exchange for being released; Hobbes agrees.Breslin feeds Hobbes false information about Mannheim. Meanwhile, Breslin's colleagues Abigail Ross and Hush grow suspicious of Clark when Breslin's paycheck for the job is frozen. They discover from hacked documents that the prison, codenamed \"The Tomb,\" is owned by a for-profit organization linked to a privately owned security provider. Meanwhile, Clark is in contact with Hobbes about keeping Breslin imprisoned. Rottmayer has Javed convince Hobbes that he is double crossing them, and as payment he only wants to be allowed up on deck to do his nightly prayer. When up on deck, Javed uses a makeshift sextant to get the ship's latitude. Using the latitude and weather, Breslin and Rottmayer deduce that they are in the Atlantic Ocean near Morocco. Breslin visits the infirmary of Dr. Kyrie and convinces him to help him and Rottmayer escape by sending an email to Mannheim. Breslin then transmits a false tap code message from his cell, giving Hobbes the impression that a riot will occur in cell block C. With the majority of the security stationed at cell block C, Javed instigates a riot at cell block A, giving him, Breslin, and Rottmayer time to run toward the deck while a lockdown is initiated. Breslin kills Drake, but Javed is shot dead by Hobbes and his men during their escape. Breslin goes to the engine room to shutdown the electrical systems, giving Rottmayer time to open the deck hatch before the backup generators come online while a helicopter sent by Mannheim engages in a gunfight with the ship's crew. Rottmayer boards the helicopter while Breslin is flushed to the bottom of the ship by the automated water system when Hobbes has the main electrical system rebooted. The helicopter picks up Breslin, but when Hobbes starts shooting at them, Breslin kills the warden by shooting and blowing up a group of oil barrels.They land on a beach in Morocco, where Rottmayer reveals that he is actually Mannheim, Mayer is his daughter, \"Portos\" was a codeword used to alert Mannheim that Breslin was an ally, and Hobbes was originally unaware that Breslin's cover story was fake. Later, on a Moroccan beach, Ross informs Breslin that they discovered Clark was offered a $5 million annual salary to become CEO of the security company, should Breslin's imprisonment prove that the ship is escape-proof.

He becomes a taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the boroughs of New York City. He also spends time in seedy porn theaters and keeps a diary. Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, and takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he takes her to see a Swedish sex education film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed, so he berates her at the campaign office, before being kicked out by Tom.Travis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent, but Wizard assures him that he will be fine, leaving Travis to his own destructive path. Travis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and attempts to find an outlet for his frustrations by beginning a program of intense physical training. A fellow taxi driver refers Travis to illegal gun dealer Easy Andy, from whom he buys a number of handguns. At home, Travis practices drawing his weapons and constructs a sleeve gun to hide and then quickly deploy a gun from his sleeve. One night, Travis enters a convenience store moments before an attempted armed robbery and he shoots and kills the robber. The shop owner takes responsibility for the shooting, taking Travis' handgun. On another night, teenage prostitute Iris enters Travis's cab, attempting to escape her pimp Matthew \"Sport\" Higgins. Sport drags Iris from the cab and throws Travis a crumpled twenty-dollar bill, which continually reminds him of her and the corruption that surrounds him. Some time later, Travis hires Iris, but instead of having sex with her, attempts to dissuade her from continuing in prostitution. He fails to completely turn her from her course, but she does agree to meet with him for breakfast the next day. Travis leaves a letter to Iris at his apartment saying he will soon be dead, with money for her to return home.After shaving his head into a mohawk, Travis attends a public rally, where he plans to assassinate Senator Palantine, but Secret Service agents notice him with his hand in his coat and chase him. He flees and later goes to the East Village to invade Sport's brothel. A violent gunfight ensues and Travis kills Sport, a bouncer, and a mafioso. Travis is severely injured with multiple gunshot wounds. Iris witnesses the fight and is hysterical with fear, pleading with Travis to stop the killing. After the gunfight, Travis attempts suicide, but has run out of ammunition and resigns himself to lying on a sofa until police arrive. When they do, he places his index finger against his temple gesturing the act of shooting himself.Travis, after having recovered from his wounds and returning to work, receives a letter from Iris' father thanking him for saving her life and revealing that she has returned home to Pittsburgh, where she is going to school. Later, he reconciles with Betsy after dropping her off at home in his cab. When she tries to pay her fare, Travis simply smiles at her and drives away.

He sees an elderly derelict sleeping in a garbage-strewn alley, where he takes him down an alley where gang members are seen chasing another bum. Reno drops the bum and vows that he will not end up like a derelict.The next day, Reno complains about the Roosters to their landlord. However, the landlord refuses to act because the music does not bother him. He gives Reno a skinned rabbit for dinner, but instead demands the rent money. Reno takes the rabbit home and repeatedly stabs it while preparing it. During a brief reprieve from the music, Reno mentally hears voices calling his name and sees an image of an eyeless Carol.

With the death of one more child, the people became sufficiently enraged that they stormed the Count's castle and drove a stake through his heart. With his dying breath, Mitterhaus vowed, \"Your children will die to give me back my life.\" Seven villagers went in, four came out -- Professor Albert Mueller (whose wife Anna had become the Count's willing consort), the Burgermeister, Dr Kersh, and Herr Hauser. Just as the castle is consumed in flames, the Count whispers to Anna, \"Tell Emil. He will know what to do.\"Fifteen years later: The town of Stetl is dying, literally. A plague is slowly killing the people, although some believe it is the Count's curse at work. At any rate, neighboring villages, afraid that the plague/curse may spread, have placed roadblocks around Stetl, and they vow to shoot anyone attempting to leave or enter the town. Dr Kersh [Richard Owens] is among those who believes it to be a disease not a curse, and he plans to sneak out of the town and bring back knowledge and medicines from the city. With his son Anton [John Moulder-Brown] acting as a decoy, Dr Kersh manages to get away. Before his father leaves, Anton reminds him to find his girlfriend Dora Mueller [Lynne Frederick], the daughter of Professor Mueller [Laurence Payne] and tell her not to come back. Unbeknown to them, Dora is already planning to sneak through the roadblocks in an attempt to get back to her father and to Anton.Somehow, the Circus of Night manages to make it through the roadblocks. Tricks, performances, dancers, aerialists, wild animals -- the people of Stetl are, at least, to be entertained in their misery. But this is no ordinary circus. Serena [Serena], for example, dances totally nude, except for the tiger stripes on her body, aerialist twins Helga [Lalla Ward] and Heinrich [Robin Sachs] turn into owls as they soar through the air, and when the panther jumps up, he comes down in the body of Emil [Anthony Corlan], who seems smitten with the Burgermeister's daughter Rosa [Christina Paul], and she with him. Emil is a vampire, really Count Mitterhaus's cousin. The ring mistress, known simply as the Gypsy woman, is really Anna Mueller [Domini Blythe], and the twins are her children with the Count. Their purpose in Stetl is not to entertain, but to kill.First to suffer the consequences is the Burgermeister [Thorley Walters] when he is invited to make a special trip through the \"Mirror of Life.\" At first, he is overcome with laughter at the silly distortions in the various mirrors. In the last mirror, however, he sees himself being bitten by the Count, who speaks to him, reminding him of his curse. Schilt [John Bown] and his family are among those who believe that the Count's curse is coming true. Schilt bribes Michael [Skip Martin], the circus dwarf, to lead him, his wife, and his mother out of town. Michael is happy to comply but leaves them stranded just beyond the roadblocks, where they are torn up by the panther. Next to be invited through the Mirror of Life are the Hausers, Jon [Roderick Shaw] and Gustav [Barnaby Shaw]. In the final mirror, they see the twins, Heinrich and Helga, who take them through. The next morning, their bodies are found lying on the ground, drained of blood, with holes in their necks. The Burgermeister, afraid that his daughter will be next, orders that all the circus animals be killed. Herr Hauser [Robin Hunter] shoots the monkey and the tiger, but just as the Burgermeister is about to shoot the panther, he has a heart attack, and Emil disappears. Next is Rosa's turn. Emil leads her to the crypt where the Count's body is being kept. There, Emil bites Rosa and allows her blood to spill on the Count. Emil vows that tonight Professor Mueller's daughter Dora will die, and the Count will live. During the next circus performance, Dora is invited through the Mirror of Life. Anton follows, just in time to see her go through the mirror. Heinrich prepares to bite her neck but is thwarted by the cross around it, and she is cast out of the mirror.Dr Kersh returns to Stetl with the information that the plague is actually a virulent strain of rabies caused by bats. He brings medicines, but he also brings the news that there are vampires in the land and that, in each case where people have been reported killed by vampires, the Circus of Night has stayed for a day or two. It appears that Stetl must rid itself of two plagues, not just one.Following her brush with the vampires, Dora has locked herself in the living quarters of the school where her father teaches. But that doesn't thwart the vampires. Emil gets through an open window on the second floor, changes himself into the panther, and attacks the students, killing every last one. Meanwhile, Heinrich, Helga, and the Gypsy find Dora. The Gypsy removes the cross from Dora's neck, and Heinrich and Helga draw in for the kill. Dora runs to the school chapel where she knocks over a cross that impales Helga and, by twin empathy, the gaping hole also appears in Heinrich's chest. Emil and the Gypsy escape, but the Strongman [David Prowse] breaks into Dora's house and takes her and Gerta Hauser [Elizabeth Seal] to the crypt. Hauser, Mueller, Dr Kersh, and Anton form a brigade of vampire hunters and they storm the circus, killing the Strongman. Hauser sets the Mirrors of Life on fire, but he becomes trapped in the flames and burns to death. The vampire hunters figure that the Count is probably in the crypt, so they head there.Meanwhile, Emil has just finished feasting on Gerta Hauser and turns his attentions to Dora. As he leans forward for the bite, the Gypsy (who has been holding Dora) aka Anna suddenly pushes her daughter to the side, and Emil bites Anna instead. Anton attempts to chase off Emil with a crucifix, but a bat knocks it out of his hand. Suddenly, the other vampire hunters break into the crypt and tussle with Emil. Emil kills off a number of them, but Mueller manages to pull the stake out of the Count's body and uses it to stake Emil. With the stake removed from his chest, the Count wakes up. He goes after Dora, but Anton beheads him with a crossbow. Only Dora, Anton, and Dr Kersh manage to survive the carnage.

He travels to the Western United States and takes a ship cruise to a coastal area where he gets a pilot (Matthew Walker) to take him to an island off the coast of Washington State where a group of neo-pagans live.The island is led by Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), an elderly woman who supposedly represents the goddess they worship. Sister Summersisle explains to Edward that her ancestors had left England to avoid persecution, only to settle near Salem and find renewed persecution in the Salem witch trials, before arriving on the island. Sister Summersisle explains that their population is predominantly female as they choose the strongest stock\u00e2\u0080\u0094evading Edward's concern about the birth of unwanted males. The economy of the island relies on the production of local honey, which Edward learns has declined recently.Edward asks the villagers about Rowan, but they give him evasive answers. He later sees two men carrying a large bag that appears to be dripping blood, and then he finds a fresh, unmarked grave in the churchyard. The grave turns out to only contain a burned doll, but Edward finds Rowan's sweater in the churchyard.At the village school, teacher Sister Rose (Molly Parker) tries to prevent Edward from seeing the class register. When he sees that Rowan's name has been crossed out he becomes enraged at the teacher's and Rowan's classmates' lies. Rose demands Edward talk outside and, after a short discussion of the island people's view of death, Rose explains that Rowan is \"letting it snow\". Edward asks how Rowan died and Sister Rose tells him first that \"She'll burn to death\". When Edward catches the tense she used, Sister Rose corrects herself quickly, saying, \"She burned to death\", and rushes back to her class.While questioning Willow about the grave, she reveals to Edward that Rowan is his daughter.As Edward searches through the island for clues and answers, he eventually grows to realise the community is a matriarchal dystopian society.On the day of the fertility rite, Edward frantically searches the village for Rowan. He attacks Sister Beech (Diane Delano), who has a bear costume for the ritual. Edward incapacitates Sister Honey (Leelee Sobieski), dons the bear suit, and joins the parade led by Sister Summersisle.The parade ends at the site of the festival. Rowan is tied to a large tree, about to be burned. Edward rescues Rowan and they run away through the woods, but Rowan leads him back to Sister Summersisle. Sister Summersisle thanks Rowan for her help, and Edward realizes that the search for Rowan was a trap. Sister Willow is Sister Summersisle's daughter, and his fate was sealed many years ago, when Sister Willow chose him. The villagers attack Edward and overpower him, viciously breaking his legs with a mallet to prevent him from escaping. Throughout all this, he keeps asking how can he be a good sacrifice if he does not believe in their religion. The women carry him to a giant wicker man and shut him inside. Rowan sets fire to the wicker man and Edward is sacrificed amid his screams and a giant blaze. The crowd chants \"The drone must die!\", believing that Edward's sacrifice will restore their honey production.Six months later, Sisters Willow and Honey enter a bar and start talking with two off-duty police officers (James Franco and Jason Ritter). The women invite them to go home with them, presumably in hopes of using them as Edward was.

As they maintain radio contact with bases in Hawaii and Houston, one of the astronauts ventures outside to make routine repairs, when radar picks up another spacecraft closing fast. Radio contact is lost and the spacecraft opens up and swallows Jupiter 16, in the process severing the other astronaut's lifeline and leaving him to die in space.In Hong Kong, James Bond is enjoying a romantic encounter with a Chinese woman. She leaves the bed a pushes a button that levers it into the wall. Two men burst into the room with machine guns and spray the bed. When the police arrive, the woman has disappeared and Bond is found dead.A contentious meeting between US and Russian diplomats follows, brokered by a member of Britain's foreign service. The US believes the pirate spacecraft is Russian in origin, having tracked the ship in orbit before it ventured into the atmosphere; the US is to launch another capsule in three weeks and will regard interference with the ship as an act of war, and will launch a military attack on Russia should the capsule come under attack itself. Great Britain, however, believes the alien ship landed in the Sea of Japan based on tracking of the ship from a station in Singapore, and that a British official in Hong Kong is following this lead.MI6's best agent, James Bond, is ordered to investigate. His assassination in Hong Kong was a ruse to trick his enemies into believing he was dead so he can continue his mission undetected. He is ordered to Japan to meet with members of Japan's SIS. One, a beautiful woman named Aki, takes him to the home of Dikko Henderson, a British intelligence official living in Japan who has discovered information about the rogue spacecraft. Henderson theorizes that a third power is using Osato Chemicals, a vast multinational corporation, to launch spacecraft from Japan to attack US and Russian spacecrafts and trigger war between the two superpowers. However, Henderson is stabbed to death before he can reveal more. James subdues Henderson's killer, then takes his place and infiltrates Osato Chemicals to find more information. He battles with a large bodyguard and defeats him before he finds a safe containing paperwork and a film negative that he takes before being pursued by security guards.James is rescued by Aki, but he is now mistrustful. When Aki stops her car near a subway entrance James chases her, only to fall into a \"trap\" set by \"Tiger\" Tanaka, the head of Japanese SIS and the most secretive official in Tokyo. After verifying Tanaka's credentials via a codeword, James works with him and they examine the paperwork found in Osato's safe. It details the smuggling of LOX - technical shorthand for liquid oxygen for rocket fuel and which is also the name for smoked salmon, and the perfect cover. The film negative is of a supertanker, the Ning Po, the picture coming from an American tourist killed by whoever works for Osato Chemicals; the picture shows not only the ship but a small boat of fishing women, indicating the area is an outer island on the way to Shanghai. James theorizes that the international criminal consortium SPECTRE has a role in the space hijackings given their history of using private organizations for the actual legwork of a conspiracy in the service of other foreign powers.James spends the night at Tanaka's house, where he is given exotic hospitality in the form of being bathed by \"very sexiful\" young ladies and given a relaxing massage by one. James' massage is taken over by the shapely and scantily-dressed Aki, who has fallen in love with him, a love the two consummate.The next day James is arranged to meet with Mr. Osato in the guise of businessman Jim Fisher to negotiate a bulk-purchase of important chemicals. Osato surreptitiously X-rays James, finding he is armed, and James is given a drink by Osato's secretary, Helga Brandt, who is more than just an efficient aide-de-camp. Osato orders hitmen to kill James, but he and Aki escape and Tanaka dispatches the hitmen via a transport chopper sporting a giant magnet.Tanaka radios James and orders James and Aki to Kobe, where the Ning Po is being loaded for departure. James then urges Tanaka to contact M in London to dispatch \"Little Nellie\" and her father - a minicopter gunship built under the supervision of Major Geoffrey \"Q\" Boothroyd. After arriving at Kobe, James and Aki find tanks of liquid oxygen but the two are attacked by a gang of dockworkers. James fights them off to allow Aki to escape, and it appears James himself will get away - until he is ambushed and knocked unconscious.He is bound to a chair in Helga's room on the Ning Po, where she questions him about snooping around the dock and holds a plastic surgeon's instrument dangerously close to James to pry information from him. But she is also aroused by James' masculinity and allows herself to be seduced by him; after consummating their arousal she flies James in a private plane, then bails out and locks him in, but James manages to escape, land the crippled plane, and escape before it explodes.Returning to Tiger's house, James is given photos of the Ning Po showing she stopped at an outer island and offloaded an enormous stockpile of equipment, shown by a vastly lower waterline. The threesome meet \"Q\" and Little Nellie is assembled by Q's crew of specialists. Sporting a variety of powerful weapons aboard Little Nellie, James overflies the area islands and is attacked by four gunships which he shoots down and which leave no doubt as to the presence of SPECTRE.A scheduled Russian space shot, meanwhile, goes off, and is grabbed by the enemy rocket, which is tracked by the US Air Force before disappearing, seeming to confirm to the US that the Russians are behind the space hijackings and will now use the excuse of losing their own spacecraft to shoot down the next Jupiter launch.Both Osato and Helga Brandt meet with their leader in his headquarters after the rogue craft returns to it's base. The man's face is not shown however he holds a white cat and finishes a meeting with two scientists who designed the radar jamming system that has cloaked the location of the villain's base. Both men demand more money but acquiesce after his bodyguard, Hans, shows them his leader's pool of piranha. The two scientists leave and the mysterious villain flashes the x-ray showing Bond's Walther PPK and expresses his disappointment in both Osato and Brandt for failing to kill him. Both accuse each other of failure. The villain orders Brandt to leave and drops her into the piranha pool as she walks across its bridge; she is eaten alive. He then sharply orders Osato to kill Bond immediately.Bond is ordered to report to Tiger's palatial estate which also doubles as a ninja training camp. Tiger's plan is to use his army of men to infiltrate a fishing village on the island where the Ning Po last made port. Bond himself will be disguised as a Japanese man and will train with the rest of Tiger's ninja army; the army will later hide in the island's largest village as local fishermen. Bond will also take a wife; to his dismay, Aki will not be the woman because she is not from the village. After the procedure which disguises him, Bond and Aki spend the night together. While they sleep, an assassin sneaks into the rafters above their bed and lowers a needle on the end of a thread. He trickles a powerful poison down the thread, his target being Bond. Bond, however, shifts in his sleep. Aki also shifts at the same moment and the poison drips onto her mouth. As she struggles and dies, Bond wakes up and shoots the assassin dead. Tiger comes in and Bond tells him what happened. Bond seems more urgent than ever to investigate the plot but Tiger tells him he needs a few more days of training. The next day during a staff match, Bond is attacked again by another assassin who tries to stab him with a knife hidden in his weapon. Bond kills the man and Tiger identifies him, saying he's not one of his men. The next day Bond is wed to a lovely young woman from the fishing village, Kissy. The settle into a small house in the village and Kissy rejects Bond's advances to consummate their marriage. The two also notice a small funeral being held for a young girl who'd been exploring a nearby cave along the shoreline. When the girl's boat floated out of the cave, she was mysteriously dead. At early morning, Tiger warns Bond that the Americans are launching their next spacecraft today with a last warning to the Soviets! Bond becomes interested in the cave; the next morning, he and Kissy drift away from the fishing fleet and explore the cave. When they enter it, Bond immediately notices that a poison gas has been released in the cave and they jump over the side of their boat and swim inside. The come ashore and hike up to the volcano's caldera. They see a helicopter fly down into the basin but it disappears. A closer investigation reveals that the surface of the crater's lake is actually a gigantic metal cover that hides a secret base where the rogue rocket has been hiding after swallowing the USA and Russian spacecraft. Bond sends Kissy back to find Tiger and his men, while Bond himself sneaks into the crater.Inside the volcano, Bond locates the missing astro- and cosmonauts being held prisoner. They subdue a few guards and imprison the astronauts that are next to fly into space and capture the next spacecraft launched by the USA. Bond takes the place of one of them, in the hopes that can sabotage the next capture, however, as he prepares to enter the rogue rocket, he's stopped at the last moment and taken to the volcano's command center. There he meets the mysterious villain; Ernst Stavro Blofeld, leader of SPECTRE, a vast criminal organization. Bond's personal effects are confiscated and Blofeld reveals his plan; the capture of both American and Russian spacecraft will trigger a nuclear war between the two, eliminating them from the world stage. Presumably China would move in and seize control of the world from the two superpowers. As Blofeld's craft moves into position, Bond asks for a cigarette, one of the weaponized ones given to him by Tiger. He kills one of Blofeld's men with the miniature rocket inside and escapes from the control room as Tiger's ninja army arrives at the crater. A fierce battle erupts. Bond and Tiger's men eventually gain the upper hand in battle. Bond finds a way into the control room through Blofeld's private quarters. There Bond battles briefly with Hans until the henchman is thrown into his boss' pool of piranha. Bond reaches the control room and struggles briefly with the detonator for Blofeld's spacecraft until he is able to destroy the craft. Relieved, the POTUS calls off the nuclear run. Blofeld himself escapes after killing Osato and triggers a self-destruct device that cause the volcano to erupt. Tiger, Bond, Kissy and the ninja army escape into the sea.Bond and Kissy find a life raft waiting nearby and board it. Bond asks Kissy if it's OK to take their \"honeymoon\" now and she agrees. As they kiss, a British sub surfaces underneath them and the raft is caught on the fore section of the sub. Inside, M orders Moneypenny to tell Bond to report.", "output": "Question: WHAT DOES BOND PRETEND TO BE WHEN MEETING MR OSATO?, Answer: as a potential new buyer, Question: On whom does the US forces plan a nuclear attack ?, Answer: Russia, Question: Who forgives Brandt for her failure to kill Bond?, Answer: No one, Question: WHO IS HELGA BRANDT?, Answer: Osato's secretary, Question: Who leaves before the base explodes?, Answer: Ernst Starvo Blofeld, Tiger, Bond, Kissey, and the ninja army, Question: Where does the trap door lead?, Answer: Tanaka's office, Question: Who does the U.S. suspect of the hijacking?, Answer: Russia, Question: What is the name of the spacecraft Bond is attempting to infiltrate?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who does Bond train with?, Answer: Tanaka's ninjas, Question: what was the ship delivering?, Answer: Elements for rocket fuel, Question: What does Bond activate ?, Answer: Little Nellie, Question: Who is Bond in a fake marriage to?, Answer: Kissy., Question: Who does Aki introduce Bond to?, Answer: Mr. Osata, Question: What is Bond near when he is attacked by helicopters?, Answer: area islands, Question: Who created the heavily armed autogyro?, Answer: Major Geoffrey \"Q\" Boothroyd, Question: Where did the spacecraft land?, Answer: Sea of Japan, Question: Who is the the Japanese secret service leader?, Answer: \"Tiger\" Tanaka", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

She tells him her brother, Chon Wang (Jackie Chan), is doing well as a sheriff in Carson City, Nevada, but her father replies that her brother is dead to him. At that moment, Lord Nelson Rathbone (Aidan Gillen), leads a band of Boxers into the city, who attack the Keeper. Despite Lin's efforts, her father is killed and the seal is stolen. With his last breath, he gives Lin a box and tells her to give it to her brother.Meanwhile, Chon Wang is doing well as sheriff, having captured an impressive array of fugitives. His deputy is relaxing with a book called \"Roy O'Bannon Vs. The Mummy\", a highly fictionalized account of the events of the first film that now portrays Wang's \"Shanghai Kid\" as a cowardly sidekick, which Wang is dismayed. Wang receives a parcel, which contains the puzzle box and Lin's letter, telling him their father is dead and that she has tracked the murderer to London.Chon Wang travels to New York City to find his old partner Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), needing his share of the gold left over from the first film to buy his ticket. Roy has left his brief stint in law enforcement, broken off his romance with Falling Leaves, spent most of the gold investing in the Zeppelin (in truth, he lost all of the gold on his novels), and is now a hotel waiter and part-time gigolo. After they attempt prostitution to pay for a trip to the United Kingdom, the Mayor of New York arrives in search of his daughters, Roy's latest clients. Chon Wang fights off a number of New York police officers, and he and Roy ship themselves to London in a crate. On the way, Wang tells Roy about his father, and Roy swears an oath to help reclaim the seal.In London, Wang and O'Bannon have their duster and watch stolen, respectively, by a number of street thugs including a young boy named Charlie (Aaron Johnson). After an extensive battle to reclaim these items, they are arrested by the police. In Scotland Yard, Inspector Artie Doyle (Thomas Fisher) thanks the two for defeating the Fleet Street gang and gives Roy his watch that Charlie had stolen. He tells Wang that Lin is also in Scotland Yard, having attempted to kill Lord Rathbone and been dubbed \"Looney Lin\". Doyle is a reader of the Roy O'Bannon novels, and is enthralled to meet the actual Roy O'Bannon. Roy tries to use this to get Lin released, but it does not work. Meanwhile, Rathbone finds himself not alone in his carriage as Wu Chow (Donnie Yen) sneaks his way on and the two exchange a quick conversation and Rathbone slips him the dagger that killed the Keeper of the Imperial Seal. Sometime later, Roy and Wang wander through London, seeing Buckingham Palace. They encounter Charlie, who lets them into the empty house of a nobleman. Charlie brings it to their attention that the nobleman has an invitation to a gala at the castle.Roy and Wang arrive that night at the gala, wearing disguises: Roy masquerades as Major General \"Sherlock Holmes\" (a name he derives from the face of a clock), and Wang is the \"Maharaja of Nevada\". After turning down the offer to try some spotted dick, Wang and Roy follow Lord Rathbone to a private library. Once they enter, they cannot find him; he has slipped through a secret passage, which Wang discovers in a fireplace. As Roy occupies himself with a copy of the Kama Sutra, Wang enters the secret room, which contains treasures from throughout the British Empire. Rathbone's guards attack Roy, but he is rescued by Lin, who has escaped from Scotland Yard. The three see Rathbone hand the Imperial Seal to Wu Chow, the illegitimate brother of the Emperor of China. Rathbone spots them, and after a brief battle, he sets the barn on fire and escapes, locking the doors behind him to burn them. Lin manages to escape through a hole in the ceiling, while Roy and Wang escape in a car that had been parked in the barn. They tell Artie to tell where Charlie (who has stolen the seal) is. Artie finds out that it is in the wax museum. In the wax museum, they save Charlie from the boxers, but are themselves captured outside by the Scotland Yard. Taken away in a police buggy, they are rescued by Charlie, who later reveals his full name to be Charlie Chaplin. They head to the Royal Jubilee celebration to stop Rathbone and Wu Chow. Rathbone tells them that he is going to kill the royal family and frame Lin. They escape and manage to stop Wu Chow from killing the royal family. Just as he was about to kill Wang, Lin blasts him with a rocket, killing him. Then they follow Rathbone to the top of Big Ben. He throws Roy out of the tower, but he survives when he holds a minute hand. Thinking Roy is dead, Chon fights with Rathbone who had the upper hand. At last, he cuts the rope which was tied to the plank they were standing on, tossing them both outside. Roy saves Wang as Rathbone falls to his death.Roy and Wang are knighted, as is Artie, whose full name is now Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Artie decides to become a writer, his stories revolving around his deductive reasoning technique, and asks Roy if he can use the \"Sherlock Holmes\" name. Roy proposes that he and Wang go to Hollywood to get in on the ground floor with motion pictures. They roll off in a buggy, with Charlie (wearing a fake moustache) stowed away.

Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall, giving the audience advice on how to skip school, and to narrate about his friends. His younger sister Jeannie is less-convinced, but goes to school anyway. Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney notes and suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him. However, Ferris uses a computer to alter the school's records to indicate his absences from 9 to 2. Ferris convinces his friend Cameron Frye, who is absent due to illness, to report that his girlfriend Sloane Peterson's grandmother has died. Rooney doubts this, but they succeed as planned.Borrowing Cameron's father's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder against Cameron's instinct, Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane drive into Chicago to sightsee. Leaving the car with two parking attendants, who promptly joyride it unknowingly to them, the trio visit the Art Institute of Chicago, Sears Tower, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Wrigley Field. They then go to a French restaurant for lunch where Ferris poses as the \"Sausage King of Chicago\", Abe Froman, while narrowly avoiding his father, who is eating lunch at the restaurant. Meanwhile, after humiliatingly failing to find Ferris, Rooney visits the Bueller residence and fails to enter, being attacked by the family rotweiller as his car is towed. Jeannie, skipping class, returns home and discovers her brother's ruse, but encounters Rooney snooping. She kicks him and calls the police, who arrest her for false reporting after Rooney leaves. While at the station, Jeannie meets a juvenile delinquent, who advises her not to worry so much about Ferris.After a cab ride where Cameron exclaims disinterest, Ferris impromptu joins a parade float during the Von Steuben Day parade and lip-syncs Wayne Newton's cover of \"Danke Schoen\", as well as a rendition of The Beatles' \"Twist and Shout\" that gets the entire crowd dancing. Just as things shine bright, they retrieve the car and notice that, due to the attendants' joyride, over 100 miles have been added. The revelation shocks Cameron into a state of self-analysis, realizing his life is controlled by his father's figure. After coming sane again, they return the car to Cameron's garage and unsuccessfully try to run it backwards to remove the miles; Ferris suggests that they crack it open and turn it back manually. Cameron refuses and vents anger towards his father, kicking, severely denting, and leaning on the car, which falls off the jack and flies out the back, crashing into a ravine behind. Despite Ferris' insistence, Cameron decides to take a stand against his father after destroying the car. At the police station, Mrs. Bueller picks up Jeannie, whom she finds kissing the delinquent.Ferris returns Sloane home, but realizes he only has a limited time to return home to avoid trouble. He rushes back to the house, but is spotted by Jeannie driving their mother home, and tries to run him down. Ferris avoids being noticed by Mrs. and Mr. Bueller, who is coming from another direction. They make it home at the same time, but Rooney catches Ferris trying to enter the back door and rhetorically asks if he would like to spend another year under supervision. However, Jeannie discovers his wallet on the kitchen floor as proof he broke in, and she has a change of heart, letting Ferris in and telling Rooney he was hospitalized \u00e2\u0080\u0093 indicating awareness of the break-in. She slams the door, and their dog attacks Rooney again. Ferris leaps into his bed at the last second, assuring his parents don't suspect a thing. As they leave, Ferris reminds the audience, \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" Ferris then smiles at the camera before fading to black.As the credits roll, the defeated Rooney heads home and is picked up by a school bus, further humiliated by the students, one offering him a gummy bear.

She then begins to tell how they came to be in this situation.In a flashback sequence to the 1940s, farmer Mr. Pilkington drives a cart with his wife and two sons through Mr. Jones' farm to return his horse. Mr. Jones invites him to a gathering he is hosting, also wishing to talk about his debts with Mr. Pilkington who brushes him off saying that he could just sell him his farm. Jessie informs the horse pulling the cart that there will be a meeting for the animals that night.At the meeting, the pig Old Major incites the animals to revolt against man and to take control of the farm for themselves, calling for a life of equality and prosperity. Old Major then teaches them the song \"Beasts of the World\". Hearing the animals, Mr. Jones goes to investigate but ends up slipping in the mud, accidentally firing his shotgun and killing Old Major (in complete contrast to the orginal book where Old Major simply died in his sleep from old age).The next day, Mr. Jones goes into town and drinking without feeding the animals. Once returning home he still does not feed them, which leads to the animals breaking into the feed room. The animals then rebel against Jones and drive him off the farm.

Snowball then writes the Seven Commandments of 'Animalism' which embody Old Major's feelings, while fellow pig Napoleon calls for a secret meeting in which he has Jessie and the other dogs swear loyalty to him and become part of the animal guard.Mr. Pilkington leads an attack on the farm with the aid of the local police, but Snowball has planned for this and the animals launch a counter-attack, fending the men off. Snowball makes plans to build a windmill to better the animals' lives, however Napoleon thinks it is a waste of time. When the animals vote in favor of Snowball, Napoleon calls on the animal guard, recognized by Jessie as her puppies, to attack him in a revolt. Snowball escapes with his life, but Napoleon declares him a traitor, as well as claiming that the windmill was actually his idea. He goes on declare that there will be no more public meetings and that a committee of pigs will decide all aspects of the farm.The animals begin the hard work of building the windmill and Mr. Pilkington hears over the microphone planted in the barn that the pigs can speak English, deciding that if they can talk then they can trade. Napoleon's assistant, Squealer, starts altering the commandments in the night and Napoleon starts trading with Mr. Pilkington. Later that night at the bar, Mr. Pilkington and Mr. Fredrick are talking. Mr. Fredrick shows concern about the animals whom are supposedly starving in hunger. Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones want revenge on the animals for taking their farm. Mr. Jones blows the windmill up with dynamite. Napoleon blames it on Snowball, declaring a death sentence against him.Squealer begins making propaganda films about Napoleon showing animals on trial for working with Snowball that are sentenced to death, as well as animals supposedly happy with Napoleon's rule. In the rebuilding of the windmill, Boxer the horse is injured and Squealer informs them that Boxer will be sent to hospital. When the time comes for him to be transported the animals realizes that the van is from the glue factory and that Boxer is to be slaughtered. Squealer delivers a phony speech claiming it to be untrue.Later that night, Jessie watches a meeting between Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington and cannot tell the difference between them. Realising that Napoleon now essentially fills Jones' shoes, she decides the animals should leave while they still can. As they leave a film plays, with ducks and sheep singing the greatness of Napoleon, and shows Napoleon standing on two legs wearing a suit, declaring they will build weapons and walls.In the present day, Jessie narrates how they have waited for Napoleon's rule to come to an end. Flooding from a storm causes a wall to collapse, and the animal refugees are able to return to the farm. They find it derelict and largely abandoned. Napoleon has fallen; \"a victim of his own madness.\" Some survived the fall of Napoleon's regime, however; Jessie's puppies, free from Napoleon's lies, emerge from the ruins and return to her.In the closing scene, Jessie is shown sitting in the sun, surrounded by her puppies, while the new owners, a human blond couple with two blond children arrive at the farm in a white convertible Jaguar. The music from the car radio, Fats Domino singing \"Blueberry Hill,\" plays as Jessie vows: \"We will not allow them to make the same mistakes.

Alexandra is a sculptress and single mother, Jane is a newly divorced music teacher incapable of having children, and Sukie is an extremely fertile woman with six children and also works as a journalist at the \"Eastwick Word\". Besides an everlasting friendship, these three women share similar misfortunes of being abandoned by their husbands. Not knowing of themselves as being Witches, the women unwittingly form a coven of which consists of weekly get-togethers, during which they drink, play cards, and share their fantasies about ideal men.The day after one such meeting, a mysterious man arrives in the town and immediately stirs up trouble by buying the city's landmark property, the Lennox mansion. The arrival of this enigmatic stranger causes fascination among the townfolks, all except local townswoman Felicia Alden, the Christian wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden. Clyde is the boss of Sukie (who Felicia does not like). Although Felicia is not a Witch, she is somehow able to sense that this man, whose name is easily forgotten by everyone, is up to no good. One night, at Jane's music recital, the man appears and makes a spectacle of himself, which leads to more gossip among the people. After the recital Jane receives flowers and a personal note from the man, signed with the initial \"D\". This then sparks Sukie's memory, finally revealing the man's name to be Daryl Van Horne. At the very moment of Sukie remembering his name, her beaded necklace inexplicably breaks and falls to the floor, causing Felicia, who had mocked Daryl's name, to trip down a large staircase, breaking her leg.Daryl begins to seduce the women one by one, beginning with self-assured Alexandra, who is at first appalled by his arrogance and bravado, but then allows him into her heart. He moves on to Jane, who is seen as being very shy and reserved. Jane explains to Daryl that the home he lives in was once said to be an area where people were burned alive after being accused of witchcraft. Daryl then encourages Jane to stop living a life of doubt and learn to enjoy herself. She takes his advice and begins to act and live recklessly. The next day Daryl invites all three women over to the mansion, which allows him to finally turn his attentions on Sukie. A jealous rivalry emerges between the women, leading to a supernatural game of tennis, where the tennis ball begins to behave oddly--floating, stopping in mid-air--in response to their mood. This shared telekinesis reveals to the women their magical abilities. The women decide to forgo competition and share Daryl, and have the most fun they've ever had in their entire lives.Their frequent presence at Daryl's mansion leads to gossip and rumors spread by Felicia. Alex, Sukie, and Jane become outcasts of the city; the women of Eastwick acknowledge the trio with nasty looks and snotty comments. The Witches begin to have second thoughts on whether or not they should continue to see each other, which then motivates Daryl into causing the girls to unknowingly cast a spell on Felicia, causing her to projectile vomit cherry stones. Felicia is finally killed by husband, who beats her with a fire poker after being horrified when seeing his wife so incredibly ill. Terrified of the dangerous effects of their relationship with Daryl, they agree among each other to never see Daryl or each other for a long period of time. This upsets Daryl, causing him to use his powers against the girls, bringing their worst fears to life. Alex awakens into a bed of snakes, Jane begins to lose her youth transforming into a old woman, and Sukie is forced to feel intense pain. The women reconcile with Daryl in order to get in his good graces again.Realizing that the only way to rid Daryl from their lives is by using Witchcraft against him, the girls trick Daryl into going to town for a while as they practice a banishing spell to make him go away forever. Sukie goes to Daryl's office and takes a spell book he kept locked in a glass chest. Jane gathered some of Daryl's personal belongings such as hair, clothing, and pictures of him. Alex created a Voodoo doll out of wax that resembled Daryl. Meanwhile, as Daryl was in town shopping for the girls, he began to feel painful sharp aches in his body from the girls sticking pins and needles into the doll. Daryl becomes infuriated with the girls betrayal, and as he made his way home, Daryl's devilish figure was beginning to reveal itself more and more. Now terrified of what Daryl is capable of doing to them, the girls throw the Voodoo into the flames of a fire then causing Daryl to disappear.Eighteen months later, Alex, Jane, and Sukie are now the mothers of Daryl's sons. They still have their Magic powers and they now live together in Daryl's mansion. Daryl appears on television screen and talks to the boys, but the women catch him and turn the TV off.", "output": "Question: who is the wife of clyde alden?, Answer: Felicia Alden, Question: What does Felicia vomit?, Answer: Cherry stones, Question: Which character falls and breaks her leg in the movie?, Answer: Felicia, Question: What does the mysterious man do when he comes to town?, Answer: buys the towns landmark, Question: What does Clyde kill Felicia with?, Answer: Fire poker, Question: what happens when sukies bead necklace breaks?, Answer: Felicia falls down a large staircase., Question: Is Jane still married?, Answer: no, Question: What do the women have in common?, Answer: They have lost their husbands, Question: What state do the three women live in?, Answer: Rhode Island, Question: Who is abandoned?, Answer: Daryl, Question: How many children does Alex have?, Answer: one, Question: What happens to Jane when Daryl uses his powers?, Answer: age rapidly, Question: what kind of editor is clyde alden?, Answer: newspaper editor, Question: what is the initial on the boquet that jane receives?, Answer: d, Question: what are the boys doing?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Where do the three women live?, Answer: Eastwick, Rhode Island, Question: Is Alex'l child a boy or a girl?, Answer: girl, Question: when women are living?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Is Alex married?, Answer: no, Question: What is Clyde Aldens's profession in the movie?, Answer: Newspaper editor, Question: what kind of recital does jane have?, Answer: music recital, Question: Who receives a bouquet of flowers from \"D\" at her recital?, Answer: Jane, Question: How often do they meet?, Answer: Weekly, Question: What is Alex' occupation?, Answer: a sculptor", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

He meets the daughter of his former teacher, and professor (M.K. Raina), beautiful and vivacious Taani Gupta (Anushka Sharma), during the preparations for her wedding. A short time later, the shocking news arrives that her fiance and his wedding entourage were killed in a road accident. Taani's father suffers a major heart attack due to the news. On his deathbed, fearing that Taani will be alone in the world and unable to bear the trauma, the professor requests that Surinder marry her. Surinder silently concedes because he likes her anyway, and Taani agrees for her father's sake.After an impromptu wedding, Surinder takes Taani to his ancestral home in Amritsar. While his good nature leads Surinder to treat her with exceptional care\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 he even lets her have his bedroom all to herself\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 he is too frightened to profess his love for her. Taani later tells him that she will try to be a good wife and thus respect her role in his life, but that she can never love him due to having no love left within her after the loss of her fiance. Surinder, grateful for the increasing acts of wifely affection that she shows, proceeds to indulge her wishes. These include regular evening trips to the cinema to see Bollywood movies which appeal to Taani's fantasies about romance and her passion for dancing. One day, while walking in the market, Taani sees a poster about a dancing competition; she soon asks for Surinder's permission to take the expensive dance class with a visiting Bombay company, to unwind from her mundane and boring life at home. He grants her request and provides the entry fee.During the evenings that Surinder and Taani spend at the movies, Surinder realises it is the strong and masculine images that Taani admires, and later on, he asks his long-time best friend, Balwinder \"Bobby\" Khosla (Vinay Pathak), a hair-salon owner, for grooming advice so as to help him win her love. Bobby gives him a complete makeover which includes trimming off his mustache (an accidental gag, due to the power cutting off), changing his hairstyle (putting on lots of gel and shaping it to be spiky), and fitting him out in a funky Western-style clothing, which he feels is very tight, from the front and the back, including aviator-style shades with oversize pastel lenses. Surinder is thus transformed into \"Raj,\" a name he borrows from the hero of a movie that Taani had admired. After having that makeover change done by \"Bobby\", Surinder goes to Taani's dancing competition venue to see her dance, without her recognising him, but he then gets pulled into the dance recital by an instructor. At the end of that dance class, all of the participants were put into groups of two by random numbers given by the staff, and somehow, both Surinder and Taani had the number '21'. By chance, or, as Surinder puts it that it was not chance but it was by the divine choice of God and so he becomes Taani's partner in the competition. Despite Raj's initial over-the-top attempts to emulate the \"cool\" images given by heroes, in movies, after the first attempt of impressing Taani in that way, Taani reacts badly, telling 'Raj' to never flirt with her. He and Taani become friends as they work together on their dance routine. Surinder feels encouraged when Taani does not want to tie a rakhi on Raj's wrist during the festival of Raksha Bandhan (doing so would indicate that she thought of him only as a brother). Soon Raj is unable to dance and thus decides to quit the dance competition during the rehearsals and thus is encouraged by Taani. Finally they both are selected for the finals and decide to do a competition of Golgappa (an Indian snack) it is decided that whoever wins this competition can ask for any thing from the other. Raj wins the competition and doesn't ask for anything then. The next day Raj then decides to invite her to his birthday, claiming the prize for beating her in an eating competition. He tells Taani of how he always spends his birthday alone. So they go on a day of visiting Punjab's wonderful cultures, thus, after some time, Raj declares his love for her.Taani is shocked, to say the least, and enters into a period of internal conflict. Surinder also faces a dilemma in Taani's misery. He thus attempts to win Taani's love as Surinder, an act which only alienates her further. She eventually runs away to find Raj to tell him the predicament she is in, hoping he will help her. He offers to elope with her, which she agrees to, tearfully. They set the date for their elopement to the next night, the night of the competition (the finals). Surinder is disappointed that Taani cannot see his love for her as himself, only as 'Raj'. Later that night, Surinder tells Bobby that he will end the charade in his own way, sacrificing his cravings for her love, leaving her his property and transferring himself to Delhi.On the day of the competition, Surinder takes Taani to the Golden Temple to gain God's blessings for her performance for that night and, internally, also for her life without 'Raj'. While there, Taani has a realisation in which she believes God has shown her a sign that her marriage to Surinder is divinely inspired. For the first time she reflects on her husband and becomes aware of the strength and integrity of Surinder's character, something which she can grow to love. Taani thus tells Raj on the night of the competition, that she cannot choose him over her husband. She leaves him in what appears to be a state of shock with tears in his eyes. When the time comes for their performance, Taani is stunned to see Surinder instead of Raj joining her on stage. While dancing Taani puts two and two together and through a series of flashbacks, she awakens to the fact that Surinder is in fact 'Raj'. Backstage, after their dance, she confronts Surinder, and when he confesses his love for her, she tearfully admits that she reciprocates his feelings. The two win the competition. The film ends with Surinder and Taani visiting Japan on their honeymoon.", "output": "Question: who plays taani?, Answer: Anushka Sharma, Question: who plays surinder sahni?, Answer: Shah Rukh Khan, Question: who does surinder sahni work for?, Answer: Punjab Power", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

His ragtag team of inspectors - consisting of the veteran Professzor (Zolt\u00c3\u00a1n Mucsi), the disheveled Lecs\u00c3\u00b3 (S\u00c3\u00a1ndor Bad\u00c3\u00a1r), neurotic narcoleptic Muki (Csaba Pindroch) and dimwitted greenhorn Tibi (Zsolt Nagy) - is routinely disrespected and assaulted by the commuters, who continue to evade paying fines in a variety of ways.One of Bulcs\u00c3\u00ba's company rivals, model employee Gonz\u00c3\u00b3 (Bal\u00c3\u00a1zs Mih\u00c3\u00a1lyfi) challenges him to a \"rail run\": after the last metro leaves a station, the two get on the tracks and try to make it to the next station on foot before the midnight maintenance carriage runs them over.

Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.The survivors' vehicle suffers a blowout, prompting them to swerve onto a farm. The back of the car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.Kimberly, Clear and Thomas rush to the hospital, and Kimberly has another vision of Dr. Ellen Kalarjian \"strangling\" Isabella. After Thomas immobilizes Dr. Kalarjian, Kimberly and Thomas witness Isabella give birth and assume they have cheated death. However, Kimberly has another vision of someone with bloody hands in a submerging van and realizes that Isabella was never meant to die in the pile-up.Clear searches for Eugene, but accidentally causes his room to explode from an oxygen combustion, killing them both (thus completing Death's original design for the survivors of Flight 180). Kimberly realizes the person in her vision was herself and immerses a van in a lake to drown herself. Kimberly is rescued by Thomas and resuscitated by Kalarjian, which was her actual premonition, granting her new life. Sometime later, Kimberly and Thomas have a picnic with Brian's family and Kimberly's father to celebrate their survival. There they learn of Brian's deterrence from Death when his father tells them he was almost hit by a van, but Rory saved him. The group then see a malfunctioning barbecue grill explode, killing Brian.", "output": "Question: When the survivor's vehicle has a blowout, what do the survivors swerve onto?, Answer: a farm, Question: What is Isabella accused of driving?, Answer: A stolen van, Question: What does Kat's rescuer use that accidentally activates the airbag?, Answer: the Jaws of Life, Question: What flight was cursed?, Answer: Flight 180., Question: How did Kimberly try to kill herself?, Answer: She immerses a van in a lake., Question: Who has a premonition?, Answer: Kimberly, Question: What explodes after Kat's cigarette falls on the gasoline leak?, Answer: the newsvan, Question: Who saved Kimberly from being hit by a truck?, Answer: Thomas, Question: What is the premonition?, Answer: Logs falling off a semi, causing a massive car crash that kills everyone involved., Question: Who immobilizes Dr. Kalarjian?, Answer: Thomas, Question: How did Eugene's room explode?, Answer: An oxygen combustion., Question: How did Brian die?, Answer: A barbecue malfunctioned and exploded., Question: Whose apartment caught fire?, Answer: Evan's., Question: In Kimberly's vision, who is Dr. Kalarjian \"strangling\"?, Answer: Isabella, Question: How was Nora decapitated?, Answer: By malfunctioning elevator doors, Question: When does Final Destination 2 begin?, Answer: One year after the first film., Question: What killed Alex Browning?, Answer: Falling brick.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

His team includes Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).James' maverick methods and attitude lead Sanborn and Eldridge to consider him reckless, and tensions mount. When they are assigned to destroy some explosives in a remote desert area, James returns to the detonation site to pick up his gloves. Sanborn openly contemplates killing James by \"accidentally\" triggering the explosion, making Eldridge very uncomfortable, but Sanborn does nothing.Returning to Camp Victory in their Humvee, the team encounters five armed men in traditional Arab garb standing near the men's Ford Excursion, which has a flat tire. After a tense encounter, the men reveal themselves to be private military contractors and British mercenaries. They have captured two prisoners featured on the most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. The entire group suddenly comes under fire, and when the prisoners attempt to escape in the confusion, the leader of the mercenaries (Ralph Fiennes) remembers the bounty for them is \"dead or alive\" and shoots them. Enemy snipers kill three of the mercenaries, including the leader. Sanborn and James borrow a Barrett .50 cal to dispatch three attackers, while Eldridge kills a fourth.During a raid on a warehouse, James discovers the body of a young boy, in which a live bomb has been surgically implanted. James believes it to be \"Beckham\" (Christopher Sayegh), an Iraqi youth he had previously befriended. During evacuation, Lieutenant Colonel John Cambridge (Christian Camargo), the camp's psychiatrist and a friend of Eldridge's, is killed in an explosion; Eldridge blames himself for the Colonel's death. Later, James leaves the military compound seeking revenge for Beckham and breaks into the house of an Iraqi professor, but his search reveals nothing and he leaves.Called to a petrol tanker detonation, James decides on his own to hunt for the insurgents responsible, guessing they are still in the immediate area. Sanborn protests, but when James heads out, he and Eldridge reluctantly follow. After they split up, insurgents capture Eldridge. James and Sanborn rescue him, but accidentally shoot him in the leg. The following morning, James is approached by Beckham, who James believed was dead. The young boy tries to play soccer with James and sell him more DVDs, but the soldier walks by without saying a word. Before being airlifted for surgery elsewhere, Eldridge angrily blames James for his injury.James and Sanborn's unit is called to another mission in their last two days of their rotation. An innocent Iraqi civilian man has had a bomb vest strapped to his chest. James tries to cut off the locks to remove the vest, but there are too many to undo in the time available before the bomb will detonate. He has to abandon the man, who is killed when the bomb explodes. Sanborn is left distraught by the man's death. He confesses to James that he can no longer cope with the pressure, and he wants to return home and have a son.After Bravo Company's rotation ends, James returns home to his ex-wife, Connie (Evangeline Lilly) and their infant son who both still live with him in his house. However, he is bored and disconnected from routine civilian life, with its ordinary tasks of shopping at the supermarket and family dinners. One night, James confesses to his son that there is only one thing that he knows he loves.

A major problem is his chief rival Grocer, whose effort to cartelize the hitman business puts him at potentially lethal odds with the unaffiliated Martin. Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in his hometown of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his therapist, Dr. Oatman, and his secretary, Marcella. She books him a contract in Michigan that coincides with the reunion, ostensibly to smooth things over with the client whose contract was botched.Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin reconnects with his friend Paul and seeks out his high school sweetheart Debi Newberry, now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets.Meanwhile, Martin is being stalked by Felix LaPoubelle, who attempts to kill Martin in the convenience store that stands in place of his childhood home. He is also tailed by two National Security Agency agents who were tipped off to Martin's contract by Grocer. Despite these dangers, Martin remains distracted by his desire to make amends with Debi and fails to open the background dossier on his prospective target.At the reunion, Martin mingles with his former classmates, one of whom hands him her toddler. Martin then experiences an epiphany, recognizing that his recent disillusionment with his work and his amends with Debi signify an opportunity to change his life for good. Moments later, while exploring the halls, Martin is attacked by LaPoubelle, whom he kills in self-defense. Debi stumbles upon the scene and, horrified to find that Martin was not joking about his work after all, flees the reunion. Paul arrives only moments later to find Martin, who corrals him into helping to dispose of LaPoubelle's body in the school furnace. Realizing that his friend was not joking about his profession, Paul walks away from Martin after they dispose of LaPoubelle.Later Debi confronts Martin in his hotel room, where he reveals that psychological testing in the Army showed he was suited to work as a hitman for the CIA; after leaving the CIA when the Eastern Bloc fell, he went into business for himself. He does not like Spetsnaz. His rationalizations for his work only horrify Debi even more; she rejects his attempts at reconciliation and storms out. Martin, concluding that it is futile to try to change his life, fires his psychiatrist over the phone, notifies Marcella that he is laying her off (but directs her to a brick of cash hidden in the office, set aside for her severance pay) and finally opens the dossier containing the details of the contract that brought him to Grosse Pointe. He is startled to find that the target is Debi's father, Bart, who is scheduled to testify against Martin's client.Grocer decides to kill Bart himself to impress Martin's client. Martin abandons the contract and rescues Bart from certain death, driving him to the Newberry house and holing up inside, narrowly ahead of Grocer and his team of mercenaries. During the siege, Martin finally reveals that he stood Debi up on prom night to enlist in the Army to protect her from his homicidal urges. Martin gradually kills the team of mercenaries. The NSA agents are gunned down by Grocer and Martin. By this point, Martin has run out of ammunition, and when Grocer tries to trick him into \"selling\" him a weapon for $100,000, Martin kills him by crushing his head with a television.

They participate in Beerfest, an underground drinking game tournament, run by Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen (J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Prochnow), where they discover that the von Wolfhausens are related to the Wolfhouses. The German team reveals that Johann was a stable boy who stole the recipe for \"the greatest beer in all ze world\" decades ago and ran away with his prostitute mother, Gam Gam. Swearing to get revenge on the Germans, Jan and Todd return to Colorado, where they recruit college drinking friends for an American Beerfest team. Among them are: Barry Badrinath who is good at drinking games like Beer Pong and has since become a male prostitute, Steve \"Fink\" Finklestein who has a PhD in Chemistry, and Phil \"Landfill\" Krundle who has been known to drink copious amounts of beer.During the team's year of drinking training, Jan and Todd find out their grandfather did not steal the family beer recipe, but was actually the rightful heir to the family brewery in Bavaria. The team uses the rediscovered recipe to brew Schnitzengiggle Beer, which is so good it literally makes them cry. After the German team receive a bottle of Schnitzengiggle in the mail, the Wolfhausen clan goes to America to take the recipe back. Their agent Cherry steals the receipe off Fink's computer, and drowns Landfill in a beer vat when he catches her. Thinking he committed suicide, the team decides to disband, but change their mind when Landfill's twin brother Gil joins. Like his brother, Gil has been known to drink copious amounts of beer and he even invites the other members of the team to call him \"Landfill\" in honor of his dead brother.In Germany, the team uses an empty wooden keg as a Trojan Horse to get inside, where they emerge to boos and jeers. The Americans are allowed to participate after Jan and Todd show how uncannily they resemble the two Beerfest founders, thus convincing the crowd of their von Wolfhausen ancestry. In the finals (bootline chug), Cherry tells Gil at a crucial moment how his brother Phil died, causing Gil to crack and the Germans to win.Jan offers the Germans a double or nothing opportunity. The Germans tell Jan they already have the recipe and thus no need for a rematch, but Fink points out that Cherry only stole a recipe for a low-carb strawberry beer, which prompts Wolfgang to have Cherry killed. When one of the von Wolfhausens knocks off Fink's yarmulke, he enters into a state of purely concentrated rage (the \"Eye of the Jew\") which allows him to coach the team to victory, barely gaining the win when the German team's anchor fails to finish \"Das Boot\" (Boot of beer).In the post credits, the team go to Amsterdam to celebrate their victory in winning the brewery.

They accept Shaun as a member, and he finds a big brother in Woody, while developing a romance with Smell, an older girl who dresses in a new wave style.Combo, an older skinhead, returns to the group after a prison sentence, accompanied by a knife-wielding moustachioed man called Banjo. A charismatic but unstable individual with sociopathic tendencies, Combo expresses English nationalist and racist views, and attempts to enforce his leadership over the other skinheads. This leads the group to split, with young Shaun, the belligerent Pukey, and Gadget, who feels bullied by Woody for his weight, choosing Combo over Woody's apolitical gang.Shaun finds a mentor figure in Combo, who in turn is impressed by and identifies with Shaun. Shaun goes with Combo's group to a white nationalist meeting. After Pukey expresses doubt over their racist and nationalistic politics, Combo throws him out of the group and sends him back to Woody. The gang then engages in bigoted antagonism of, among others, shopkeeper Mr. Sandhu, an Indian man who had previously banned Shaun from his shop.Combo becomes depressed after Lol, Woody's girlfriend, rejects him when he admits that he has loved her since they had sex years before. To console himself, Combo buys cannabis from Milky, the only black skinhead in Woody's gang. During a party, Combo and Milky bond while intoxicated, but Combo becomes increasingly bitter and envious when Milky shares details of his many relatives, comfortable family life and happy upbringing, everything that Combo lacked.

She tells her younger sister, Susan \"Susy\" (Roberta Tovey) to tend to the door up. This is no ordinary family, as Susy had been reading a huge book, by Physics for the Enquiring Mind by Eric M. Roberts, highly advanced for somebody of such a young age - alike the bigger sister, who was reading Science Is Science, and it's grandfather who's reading a science-fiction comic. Ian is clumsy and stubles on entering... again. Ian has brought a present, but Dr. Who insists in showing him his last invention. Susy thinks that Ian is so stupid, he won't understand it, but they three go out to the street to check of the red phone booth. Ian is amazed about how big it's on the inside. The machine will transport everything in time and place.Barbara appears and jumps to Ian's arms. He steps back and sets the machine onto motion with the four of them inside. The scenery immediately changes: they are on a place of jungle twigs and burnt soil called Skaro. It's another planet. Susan is excited to have the opportunity to go around and investigate. She find a kind of alien flower. Barbara screams at the small statue of a crocrodile. On the mayhem, Ian falls onto the thing and breaks it.Susan find the lights of empty buildings. Barbara starts thinking that something terrible happened in that place, and that it's dangerous. Ian tells Dr. Who that he's expected at home, so that they must return. Finally, who obliges. Susan gets lost because she finds another of those beautiful flowers. She runs away because a hand has touched her, but nobody seems to believe her.Back at the phone booth, they cannot see anyone with their surveillance cameras, but Susy insists that she was touched on the shoulder. There are knocks on the door, which startle Ian, but there isn't anybody around. They try to leave, but can't, and when they step aside, Susan courageously picks up a small blue container - it's has four small tubes with a liquid inside.They go to the city, which looks empty. Dr. Who gets tired easily. They enter an empty home with different rooms. Ian's door is the only one which doesn't open automatically, as he needs to touch something. Barbara walks a long corridor, and it looks as though she's being watched. She ends up being trapped and screams. Susan sits on the spot to open up the door. Susy, Ian and Who follow a noise to a communication room. Dr. Who looks tired. When they turn around, the three of them find themselves surrounded by Daleks. Ian is left dizzy by the Daleks, who also took the object which they found. They reunite with Barbara in a room/cell.Temmosus (Geoffrey Toone), Antodus (John Bown), Dyoni (Yvonne Antrobus) and Elyon (Mark Petersen). Some of them believe the letter offering to be their friends - supposedly written by Susan. Who devises a plan to escape using Susan's cape as an insulator. At that moment, a Dalek appears to bring them food, they put food in their periscope and attack it by blinding its eye with the disgusting food. Ian gets into the blue Dalek. There is also the image of a kind of green claw, a proof of the mutations which have taken place in the . Susan leads the way, and pretends to be the blue Dale's prisoner. They are soon found out anyway, so they have to break the lift, but the blue Dalek with Ian inside can't get into it. Now we realise that finally, Ian unstuck the head and was able to leave it in time.The four humans arrive in time to tell the Thals that they cannot hide in the forst forever. In fact, the Daleks are planning to bomb all the planet. However, the Thals have become peaceful, too peaceful. It was war which destroyed the planet and caused all the destruction and polution in Skaro. The Thals insist, and even the death of one of them was not convincing. Dr. Who tells Ian to take Dyoni to the Daleks. The leader won't allow it, so that settles the matter: they will have to fightSusan and Ian with cross a mutant-infested swamp with some Thals. On their way, they find the tubes which are polluting the water. Elyon stays behind to take some samples of the water, when he is eaten by something from the river.The Daleks are reuniting: they want to destroy the Thals forever. The other four follow the pipes to some caves. There is a fight between the two remaining Thals, because one of them wants to go back and forget the city.Who was supposed te watch some cakes, but they get burnt, to Susan's disappointment. Two female ladies are looking at themselves in the mirror, which gives Who an idea. Ian has to jump over a cliff, which he does, but then one of the Thals seems to have second thoughts over the whole ordeal. With plenty of mirrors, Who and the thals will make the detectors useless. The Daleks start to move on. Dr Who and Susan are captured again. The Daleks start the countdown for the bomb.Finally, one of the Daleks decides that they must fight. Dr. Who offers his time machine if the Daleks don't explode the bomb, but the Daleks will figure it out how it works after having exploded the bomb. Susan, Ian and the two Thals enter the Dalek's castle and run away using another lift. Finally, the rest of the Daleks fight.They reach control room. Two Daleks destroy one another. The Daleks destroy the computer when trying to kill Ian. All the Daleks are dead - three seconds left, which Ian alleges it's his lucky number.Why fills up the energy of the time machine. The Thals appreciate what they have done for them. They give Ian the purple coat - which Ian uses.

The next day, Allan finds something under the house where he encounters an object that was buried by Lando earlier which reveals to be a crystal. At night, Bikbok watches outside and notices the white creatures watching him.The next day, Allan's cousin Pey (Ervic Vijandre) takes Isay, Allan and Bikbok to Aling Epang (Celia Rodriguez) to cure their baby. After they leave when Bikbok began to collect some water, he saw a group of sparks and decides to follow it. He stops by where he finds a waterfall and began venturing it. When he plays at the waterfall, he notices the same creatures earlier are watching him. The chieftain orders his tribe to catch him as Bikbok runs. He attempts to escape but the creatures corner him. The chieftain tells him to give back something which it was stolen but Bikbok assures that he and his family didn't steal anything. The chieftain tells him that if he didn't return it otherwise on the third day at night when the new moon arrives, he and his family will be in danger. Bikbok runs to Aling Epang for help and tells her what he saw. Epang realizes the white creatures were the Tamawos, a group of fairy people who were creatures and tribal warriors who always take away people even children. After Bikbok tells her on what they have stolen, Epang tells him that he needs to find out what they have stolen because the tamawos will never stop until it was returned. Meanwhile, Pey was killed by the tamawos when he encountered them at the forest.

After Cynthia and her husband Mar (Jay Manalo)'s anniversary plans were ruined, she began to have labor and Mar takes her to the hospital. The next day, the news featured Marikina where youth workers died at the factory after the typhoon stopped.The next year, Cynthia and Mar moved to a condominium and they were expecting another baby after their baby died from miscarriage earlier. After working at their new plastic factory, Mar's brother Nante (Edgar Allan Guzman) began to bring Cynthia back to the condominium to cook dinner. It rained before they left and Cynthia became aquaphobic because of the typhoon. At the parking lot, Cynthia left Nante and returned to the condominium. While Nante was at the parking lot, water began pouring out of his car. He attempts to escape but water began flooding around his car and drowned him. After his death, the police began questioning the family about Nante's death by drowning. As Cynthia was sleeping, she had a nightmare which involved Nante's body floating in the coffin before she wakes up.The next day, Cynthia met a wealthy couple buying an old factory and she began to tour them around the place. While there, the man finds the warehouse locked, however, Cynthia decided to show them more around the place. Later, after Cynthia collecting her allowance, she encounters an old woman (Perla Bautista) who returned the donation and gave her warning but then a guard forced her to leave. Cynthia was horrified and she collapsed. After she recovered at the hospital, she noticed children drawing an eye while singing and then returned to the condominium. Cynthia had another nightmare and it involved Mar. She woke up and Mar was nearly drowned while sleeping. After Mar arrived at the apartment, Cynthia began to tell him about her nightmare and the tragedy from the typhoon earlier which Mar disbelieved. That night, Cynthia, Mar, and his mother Maritess (Boots Anson-Roa) and their maid Dina (Tess Antonio) arrived at the factory with a priest to bless it. After the priest left, the old woman, whom Cynthia encountered earlier, was there watching her.After Cynthia had a baby, she noticed the old lady talking to Dina. Before leaving, Cynthia began to question Dina about what the old lady said. Dina replied that the lady said that she remembered what happened to her father earlier, whom she didn't save from the house fire, and revealing the dead will never rest when nobody saves them. Meanwhile, Mar, who was returning to the condominium, was killed by drowning in an elevator. A series of events followed and as Cynthia escaped from her flooding bathroom, she encountered a group of ghosts. Horrified, she ran and attempted to escape to an elevator where she found Mar's dead body. As Cynthia mourns his death, she began to give birth to her baby.At the hospital, after her baby's birth, both Cynthia and Maritess became guilty about the youth workers who died during the typhoon earlier. It was revealed that Cynthia &amp; her family were responsible for that tragedy. They locked the youth workers in the warehouse at the factory after their shift. Before the arrival of the typhoon and the family began to leave, they beg the family for help until they were killed from the typhoon. Their spirits began to haunt them by killing each of the family members through water. As Maritess began to leave the hospital, she noticed the children still standing in the middle of the road. She was killed when a truck of mineral water hit her. After selling their new factory, Cynthia began to give the donation back to the old woman but the lady refused because her grandchildren have been working to help her grandmother. The lady's grandchildren were among the youth workers who died from the typhoon earlier. Cynthia begged the lady to accept it so that she could leave at peace with her child, which the old lady accepted.Before leaving, Cynthia returned to the factory &amp; entered the warehouse to pay respects to the deceased youth workers but suddenly she heard the children singing and then it began raining. Cynthia becomes scared, but silently accepts her fate. The water flooded around Cynthia in the warehouse as the doors were closed and locked where the drowned ghosts are.

Such refusals convince John McKittrick (Dabney Coleman) and other systems engineers at NORAD that missile launch control centers must be automated, without human intervention. Control is given to a NORAD supercomputer, WOPR (War Operation Plan Response), programmed to continuously run military simulations and learn over time.David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) is a bright but unmotivated Seattle high school student and hacker. After receiving a failing grade in school, he uses his IMSAI 8080 microcomputer to hack into the district's computer system. He then changes his grade and does the same for his friend and classmate Jennifer Mack (Ally Sheedy). Later, while dialing every number in Sunnyvale, California to find a set of forthcoming computer games, a computer that does not identify itself intrigues David. On the computer he finds a list of games, starting with general strategy games like chess, checkers, backgammon, and poker and then progressing to titles like \"Theaterwide Biotoxic and Chemical Warfare\" and \"Global Thermonuclear War\", but cannot proceed further. Two hacker friends explain the concept of a backdoor password and suggest tracking down the Falken referenced in \"Falken's Maze\", the first game listed. David discovers that Stephen Falken is an early artificial intelligence researcher, and guesses correctly that his dead son's name \"Joshua\" is the backdoor password.David does not know that the Sunnyvale phone number connects to WOPR, or \"Joshua\", at Cheyenne Mountain Complex. He starts a game of Global Thermonuclear War, playing as the Soviet Union. The computer starts a simulation that briefly convinces the military personnel at NORAD that actual Soviet nuclear missiles are inbound. While they defuse the situation, Joshua nonetheless continues the simulation to trigger the scenario and win the game, as it does not understand the difference between reality and simulation. It continuously feeds false data such as Soviet bomber incursions and submarine deployments to the humans at NORAD, pushing them into raising the DEFCON level and toward a retaliation that will start World War III.David learns the true nature of his actions from a news broadcast, and the FBI arrests him and takes him to NORAD. He realizes that Joshua is behind the NORAD alerts but because he fails to convince McKittrick about this, he faces imprisonment. David escapes NORAD by joining a tourist group and, with Jennifer's help, travels to the Oregon island where Falken (John Wood) now lives. David and Jennifer find that Falken has become despondent and believes that nuclear war is inevitable, that it is as futile as a game of tic-tac-toe between two experienced players. The teenagers convince Falken that he should return to NORAD to stop Joshua.The computer stages a massive Soviet first strike with hundreds of missiles, submarines, and bombers. Believing the attack to be genuine, NORAD prepares to retaliate. Falken, David, and Jennifer convince military officials to cancel the second strike and ride out the non-existent attack. Joshua tries to launch the missiles itself, however, using a brute force attack to obtain the launch code. Without humans in the control centers as a safeguard, the computer will trigger a mass launch. All attempts to log in and order Joshua to cancel the countdown fail, and all weapons will launch if the computer is disabled.Falken and David direct the computer to play tic-tac-toe against itself. This results in a long string of draws, forcing the computer to learn the concept of futility and no-win scenarios. Joshua obtains the missile code but before launching, it cycles through all the nuclear war scenarios it has devised, finding they too all result in stalemates. Having discovered the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (\"WINNER: NONE\"), the computer tells Falken that it has concluded that nuclear war is \"a strange game\" in which \"the only winning move is not to play.\" Joshua relinquishes control of NORAD and the missiles and offers to play \"a nice game of chess.\"", "output": "Question: What game teaches the computer about no-win scenarios?, Answer: Tic-tac-toe., Question: Who tries to launch the missiles himself?, Answer: Joshua, Question: Who lives on the island?, Answer: Falken, Question: Without humans in the control center as safegaurd, what will the computer trigger?, Answer: A mass launch, Question: Who prepares to retaliate to the attack?, Answer: NORAD, Question: What does Joshua obtain through brute force?, Answer: The launch code, Question: What game does David begin playing?, Answer: Global Thermonuclear War, Question: What do the military personnel briefly believe is inbound as a result of David's game?, Answer: Soviet nuclear missles, Question: What city does David Lightman attend high school?, Answer: Seattle, Question: What kind of attack is the WOPR simulating?, Answer: Nuclear., Question: What is the backdoor password?, Answer: Joshua, Question: What game does Joshua suggest to play?, Answer: Chess., Question: Who obtains the missile code?, Answer: Joshua., Question: What will happen if the computer is disabled?, Answer: All weapons will launch, Question: What is the name of the NORAD supercomputer?, Answer: WOPR (War Operation Plan Response), Question: Who convinces the military officials to cancel the second strike?, Answer: Falken, David, and Jennifer, Question: Who arrests David?, Answer: The FBI, Question: What caused David to hack into the school district system?, Answer: a failing grade, Question: Where does David go after he escapes NORAD?, Answer: An Oregon Island, Question: What country does David play as in Global Thermonuclear War?, Answer: The Soviet Union", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The songs of DMC often encourage the audience to engage in immoral and illegal behavior, such as rape or murder, or tell of Krauser's exploits with similar actions, in a parody of the genre.Negishi despises DMC and all that it stands for, but he can't walk away as he has a talent to play the psychotic frontman of the band. Negishi is under his meager exterior a rageaholic and also is very skilled in his guitar play. Further, he feels obligation to the rest of the band and his label and even if he manages to escape, he is invariably roped back in by the manager of the band's label. The Krauser persona also functions as an outlet to vent his frustration over his failing personal career, which has not advanced beyond him being a street musician. Playing his music in the street earns him nothing but the disapproval of bystanders over his cheesy pop songs.Negishi is envious of the popularity DMC and his Krauser persona enjoy in contrast to the music he actually wants to play being ridiculed, which in turn leads to his Krauser persona coming out more often, which leads to Krauser's popularity growing.

(April 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)FBI Regional Bureau Chief Gordon Cole (David Lynch) sends agents Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland) to investigate the murder of drifter and teenage prostitute Teresa Banks in the town of Deer Meadow, Oregon.Desmond and Stanley view Teresa's body at the local morgue following a tense exchange with the town's sheriff. They notice that a ring is missing from her finger and a small piece of paper printed with the letter \"T\" has been inserted under one of her fingernails. The agents question residents about Teresa but come up with few clues so Stanley leaves Deer Meadow while Desmond remains behind. Desmond discovers Teresa's missing ring under a trailer belonging to the sheriff's deputy. As he reaches out to it, the screen fades to black.The following day at FBI headquarters in Philadelphia, Cole and Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) experience a brief vision of their long-lost colleague Agent Phillip Jeffries (David Bowie). In a surreal montage, he tells them about a meeting he witnessed involving the Man from Another Place, Killer Bob, Mrs. Chalfont (Frances Bay) and her grandson, all mysterious spirits who appeared as characters in the original television series. Desmond is reported missing and Agent Cooper is sent to Deer Meadow to investigate. The clues to Teresa's murder lead to a dead end but Cooper is certain her killer will strike again.One year later in Twin Peaks, high school homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and her best friend Donna Hayward (Moira Kelly) attend school. Laura is addicted to cocaine and is cheating on her boyfriend, the arrogant and ill-tempered jock, Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), with the biker James Hurley (James Marshall).Laura realizes pages are missing from her secret diary and tells her friend, the agoraphobic recluse Harold Smith (Lenny Von Dohlen) that Bob took them. Laura insists that Bob is real and will kill her if she does not allow him to possess her. Laura's face then changes color as she utters the words, \"Fire walk with me.\" She quickly returns to normal and, visibly shaken, gives Harold her diary to keep. She leaves saying she does not know when, or if, she will return.During her Meals on Wheels rounds, Laura sees Mrs. Chalfont and her grandson. They give Laura a painting and warn her that the \"man behind the mask\" is in her bedroom. Laura runs home, where she sees Bob. She rushes outside in terror and hides in the undergrowth, then sees her father, Leland (Ray Wise), emerge from the house. Laura begins to suspect her father is Bob. That evening, while the Palmer family is eating dinner. Leland sees Laura's half-heart necklace and questions her menacingly about her \"lovers.\" Later, he goes into his daughter's bedroom and tells Laura he loves her. Laura wonders if he could truly be Bob.Before bed, Laura hangs the painting on her wall and then falls asleep. She dreams about entering the Black Lodge. Suddenly, Cooper and the Man from Another Place appear in her dream. The Man from Another Place tells Cooper that he is \"the arm\" and offers Teresa's ring to Laura, but Cooper tells her not to take it. Laura finds Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham) next to her in bed, covered in blood. Annie tells Laura to write in her diary that \"the good Dale\" is trapped in the Lodge and can't leave. Laura sees the ring in her hand and is frightened. After looking outside her bedroom door, Laura finds herself inside the painting.Laura awakens in the morning with the ring gone from her hand. Disturbed, she removes the painting from her wall. Meanwhile, Bobby, Leo, and Jacques Renault discuss drug scores. Jacques agrees to send someone to meet with him. That same evening, Laura prepares to go to the Bang Bang Bar where she encounters the Log Lady. Inside the bar, Jacques introduces Laura to two men. The group is about to leave for the Pink Room to have sex, but Donna shows up. The men are impressed with her \"audition kiss\" and they allow her to come along.In the Pink Room, Laura discusses Teresa Banks' murder with Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). She then engages in oral sex with the men. Laura becomes distraught when she sees a topless Donna making out with one of the men. She takes Donna home and in the morning, Laura tells Donna she does not want Donna to become like her. Leland arrives to take Laura back home. On the way home, Mike (Al Strobel), the one-armed man, shouts at Leland that \"the thread will be torn\" and shows Laura Teresa's ring, but Leland and Laura become frightened and drive away.Leland pulls into a gas station parking lot to gather his wits, and recalls his affair with Teresa. He had asked Teresa to set up a foursome and invite some of her friends, but fled when he discovered Laura was among them. Teresa realized who he was and plotted to blackmail him and he killed her to prevent his secrets from being revealed. Laura realizes that Mike's ring was the same one from her dream, and was also worn by Teresa.The next night, Laura and Bobby take cocaine in the woods, and wait for Jacques' drug messenger, the sheriff's deputy from Deer Meadow. The messenger delivers the drugs and takes out a gun, but Bobby shoots him first. He hastily tries to bury the messenger as Laura laughs maniacally, high on drugs. The following night, Bob comes through Laura's window and begins having sex with her. She asks Bob repeatedly who he is and then suddenly realizes that he is Leland, and warns Leland away from her the next morning. Upset, Laura uses more cocaine and has trouble concentrating at school. Bobby attempts to initiate sex with her, but Laura refuses. Bobby realizes Laura was only using him for his access to cocaine. He hands her his stash, breaking off their relationship. The angel in Laura's painting disappears.In the woods, Laura tells James that \"his Laura\" is gone. She tells him that she loves him and runs into the woods where she meets Ronette, Jacques, and Leo. They hold an orgy in Jacques' cabin as Leland watches from outside. Leland attacks Jacques outside, and Leo flees in panic. Leland takes Laura and Ronette, both bound, to the train car. Meanwhile, Mike realizes that Bob/Leland is about to kill again and chases after him. In the train car, Laura asks Leland if he is going to kill her. She looks into a mirror and screams after seeing her reflection turn into Bob, who says that he wants her. Meanwhile, Ronette prays for rescue but breaks down because she is \"dirty.\" Suddenly, an angel appears in the train car. Ronette finds herself untied and opens the door to let Mike in, but Leland kicks her out of the train car. Mike manages to throw in the ring. Laura puts it on, which prevents Bob from possessing her. Enraged, Bob stabs Laura to death.Bob/Leland places Laura's body in the lake. As her corpse drifts away, Bob/Leland enters the Black Lodge, where he encounters Mike and the Man from Another Place who tell Bob they want all their garmonbozia (\"pain and sorrow\"). Bob pulls the blood from Leland's wound and flings it to the floor. Laura's body washes up on the lake shore, where it is found by the Sheriff's department the following morning. Laura's spirit later sits in the Black Lodge and notices Agent Cooper at her side. He places a comforting hand on her shoulder. Laura sees an angel appear and begins to cry and then laugh.", "output": "Question: Upset, Laura uses more what?, Answer: Cocaine., Question: Who does Laura see when she looks into the mirror?, Answer: Bob, Question: Who did Laura say took pages from her secret diary?, Answer: Bob., Question: Jacques introduces Laura to how many men?, Answer: Two., Question: Who does Laura meet in the woods?, Answer: Ronette, Jacques, and Leo, Question: What color is the room where Laura and Ronette talk?, Answer: Pink, Question: The messenger delivers the drugs and takes out what?, Answer: Gun., Question: What did Agent Jeffries witness?, Answer: A meeting with Killer Bob, Mrs Chalfont and her grandson, Question: What is the one-armed man's name?, Answer: Mike, Question: Who was murdered with the teenage prostitute?, Answer: A drifter, Question: What do Mrs. Chalfort and her grandson give laura?, Answer: A painting, Question: Where is Agent Cooper sent?, Answer: Dear Meadow, Question: Who asked Teresa to set up a foursome?, Answer: Leland, Question: What is Laura addicted to?, Answer: Cocaine, Question: What does Laura do to the painting on her wall?, Answer: Remove it., Question: Who finds Laura's body?, Answer: The Sheriff's department, Question: Who is reported missing?, Answer: Desmond, Question: Why did Leland kill Teresa?, Answer: To prevent his secrets from being revealed., Question: What does Laura put on, preventing Bob from possessing her?, Answer: Ring, Question: Laura and Bobby take what during the next night?, Answer: Cocaine., Question: Where does laura find herself after looking out the door?, Answer: The painting, Question: Who is Laura cheating with?, Answer: James Hurley, Question: Who tells Laura not to take the ring?, Answer: Cooper, Question: What does Leland see Laura wearing?, Answer: A half-heart necklace, Question: Who was in the vision?, Answer: Agent Phillip Jeffries, Question: What does Desmond and Stanley notice is missing from Teresa's body?, Answer: A ring., Question: Who puts Laura's body in the Lake?, Answer: Bob / Leland, Question: Before bed what does Laura do?, Answer: Hangs a painting on the wall, Question: Who did Laura give her diary to?, Answer: Harold., Question: What is garmonbozia?, Answer: \"Pain and Sorrow\", Question: What charity is Laura doing rounds for?, Answer: Meals on Wheels, Question: Where is Teresa's body?, Answer: Local morgue., Question: Who had a brief vision?, Answer: Cole and Agent Dale Cooper, Question: Where is FBI Headquarters?, Answer: Philadelphia", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Over the noise of incoming helicopters carrying wounded U.S. soldiers, Colonel Henry Blake (Roger Bowen), the commanding officer of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (M.A.S.H.), located just three miles from the front lines, is shouting at Corporal Radar O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), telling him to inform Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall), that one of the day surgeons will have to stay over on the night shift. He also needs to get word to Brigadier General Charles Hammond (G. Wood), in Seoul, that the 4077th needs two more surgeons, as the patient load is getting overwhelming. Radar says out loud everything Colonel Blake is telling him, but a split before Blake says it. That's the first of many instances where Radar proves always to be one step ahead of his commanding officer. Another enlisted man is trying to write it all down, but misses most of it. Blake tells him that Radar has it.Quotes pertaining to Korea, from both General MacArthur and General Eisenhower, scroll down the screen as Captain Hawkeye Pierce is shown exiting the Officers' Latrine in Seoul and approaching a Jeep for the next leg of his journey. He has just arrived in Korea for duty at the 4077th. He is originally from Maine.The motor pool sergeant (Jerry Jones), struts up to Hawkeye and says, \"What the hell do you think you're doing? Don't think that just because you're a captain, you run this place. I run this place!\" He tells Hawkeye that his driver is having his coffee and will be along when he's ready. Hawkeye, who is in the process of removing his collar devices from his uniform, is shocked and disbelieving about how rude and insubordinate the sergeant is. He mutters \"racist\" to himself as the sergeant walks away (the sergeant is black).Also newly arriving is Captain Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt). He's from Georgia. He approaches Hawkeye, who is sitting in a Jeep, waiting for the driver. Forrest mistakenly thinks Hawkeye is his driver and, after confirming that the Jeep is headed for the 4077th M.A.S.H. unit, he orders Hawkeye to take him there. Hawkeye says ok, puts the Jeep in gear and roars out of the compound.The motor pool sergeant watches as Hawkeye and Forrest tear out of the place and yells at two military policemen (MPs) to go get them. Something happens to the MPs Jeep, as there's a bang with smoke, and it stops, causing the sergeant to throw a fit and start punching and wrestling with the MPs.Hawkeye & Forrest prove to have a lot in common, in that they are both rebellious, womanizing, and mischievous rule-breakers. They arrive at the Officer's Mess tent at the 4077th and decide to go in for some lunch. They are already making eyes at some nurses. One in particular, Lt. Maria \"Dish\" Schneider (Jo Ann Pflug), attracts their attention and they sit down near her.Colonel Blake asks Captain Murrhardt (Danny Goldman) if he knows those two men who just came in. He does not. Another officer suggests they may be the new doctors, but the Colonel says that can't be, as the two new people are supposed to be really bright. He decides they are just a couple of moochers coming in for a free meal.Forrest is staring at Lt. Schneider and says, \"I think I am in love.\" He tells her he's new in town, with nothing to do, and asks her to show him around the place if she's not doing anything tonight. She stays quiet, smiles and holds up her left hand. Hawkeye tells Forrest that the lady is wearing a wedding ring, but he doesn't let that dissuade him.Colonel Blake decides to go see what's up with these new guys. He learns that they are indeed the newest doctors assigned to his unit. The colonel tells Pierce that he'd received a message about him stealing a Jeep at Headquarters. Hawkeye tells the colonel that he didn't steal the Jeep, that it's right outside there. The colonel then sets about informing Forrest about the Army's regulations for proper reporting to a unit. Hawkeye is mostly interested in asking questions about how many people are on staff, especially nurses.The colonel decides to introduce the new captains to the existing staff who are in the mess at that moment. They include the Irish Catholic Chaplain, Father John \"Dago Red\" Mulcahy (Rene Auberjonois); the dental officer, Captain 'Painless Pole' Waldowsky (John Schuck); the anesthesiologist, Captain \"Ugly\" John Black (Carl Gottlieb), a.k.a., the \"gas passer\"); Captain Dennis Patrick Bandini (Corey Fischer); and Corporal 'Radar' O'Reilly.Radar tells the captains he will change the identification number on the stolen Jeep, just before Colonel Blake orders him to do that.As Pierce and Forrest proceed with their check in, over near the officer's quarters and barber shop, they walk past a post covered with wooden arrows depicting the mileage and directions to various other cities in the world. Duke lays claim to a pretty blonde nurse who walks past, but after Radar whispers in Hawkeye's ear and Hawkeye in turn whispers in Duke's ear, he realizes that Colonel Blake's girlfriend, Lt. Leslie (Indus Arthur), is \"hands off.\"Radar leads them to their tent and inside is Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) and a South Korean boy, Ho-Jon (Kim Atwood), who works at the mess hall. Major Burns is teaching Ho Jon how to read, using the Bible. Major Burns will prove to be both a religious man and an inferior surgeon.Captain Forrest slips Ho-Jon a girlie magazine, telling him that it helps when learning how to read to have some pictures to go along with the words. Ho-Jon avoids letting Major Burns see what Forrest gave him and he quickly excuses himself and leaves the tent with the magazine.In the first of many scenes from the M.A.S.H. operating room, the new captains are performing surgeries on two patients. They both have a matter-of-fact attitude as they go about their life and death work, speaking and moving around much like a chef preparing a meal might do. Hawkeye is preparing to saw off a soldier's lower leg while Captain Forrest is hitting on one of the nurses.Frequent announcements come over the camp public announcement (PA) system. They are usually given by SSgt. Wade Douglas Vollmer, (David Arkin), who can't read very well. The first announcement is for all non-commissioned officers to report for a short-arm inspection at 0400. (short-arm inspection refers to the medical inspection of male soldiers' penises, or \"short arm\", for signs of sexually-transmitted diseases and other medical problems).Major Burns enters his tent to find Ho-Jon serving martinis to Pierce and Forrest. Burns lets them know how inappropriate he considers that to be and he grabs his Bible and starts praying. Ho-Jon escapes to go do some laundry. Pierce and Forrest waste no time in starting to tease and mock Major Burns about his obsession with the Bible and religion. They speculate that he suffers from some sort of syndrome and wonder if he's always had it or just since he arrived in Korea. Forrest asks how long \"the show\" is going to last and Burns says that it gets longer all the time, now that he has Forrest's and Pierce's souls to pray for. Hawkeye and Duke start singing, \"Onward Christian Soldiers,\" as Burns keeps on praying. Soon, people outside the tent hear the singing and they join in, marching in a line as they sing.Colonel Blake receives a report from Lt. Leslie about the status of the patients currently at the M.A.S.H. as he sits at his desk tying a fishing fly. Leslie also assists him by handing him various tools that he needs.Hawkeye and Forrest come into the colonel's office and demand that he get the \"Sky Pilot\" Major Burns out of their tent (it's been one week). They also tell Blake that they need to have a \"chest cutter\" (thoracic surgeon) to properly tend to the injured soldiers. Blake tells them he'll have Burns out of their tent within 24 hours, and he'll try his best to get a chest cutter.Colonel Blake seems to empathize with the fact that most of his men and women there at the 4077th are draftees, they have very stressful jobs trying to save lives, and therefore he does very little by way of asserting discipline to keep his staff at the mobile hospital in line with military regulations.Father Mulcahy often hangs around surgery, either to administer last rites, pray, or sometimes assist the doctors. This particular time, he gets called over to administer last rites to a soldier who died on the surgical table, but gets interrupted and is asked by Duke Forrest to come over and hold a surgical retractor being used on another patient. When Mulcahy hesitates, Forrest apologizes, but points out to Dago that the first soldier is dead, while the one they are operating on is still alive.Hawkeye is busy making out with Lt. Dish in the Officer's Club when Ho-Jon comes knocking at the tent door. He tells Hawkeye to come quick, that the new chest cutter has arrived. Hawkeye and the nurse separate, frustrated, but duty calls.Forrest is sitting in his tent with the new chest cutter and complains to Hawkeye that all he has been able to learn is that the new surgeon is from \"Bastin\" (Boston) and has been in the Army for 2 months. As the new doctor is putting up a photo of a pin-up girl, Hawkeye attempts to find out more about him, but the new guy continues be very evasive. As they sit down to have some martinis, and the new doc produces a bottle of green olives from inside his jacket. Hawkeye is amused and impressed. He tells the new man that he looks familiar, but he can't quite place where he knows him from.The new doctor's first operation in surgery attracts a sizable audience, inside and outside the operating room, as everyone is curious as to how he'll do. He does just fine.Other than the frequent PA announcements, Radio Tokyo is often playing throughout the camp, with Japanese announcers and singers providing entertainment in broken English.The staff frequently toss a football around between the tents in the compound and the play can be quite vigorous. One guy performs a flying tackle on the man with the ball, and they both splash down hard into a mud puddle. When the ball flies out of the hands of the man being tackled, it is caught by the new thoracic surgeon. He makes as though to fake a handoff to Duke, then rolls left while Duke runs behind and out the opposite side of a tent, with Hawkeye defending. The new surgeon lobs an off target pass and Hawkeye jumps up and intercepts it. That prompts an immediate recall in Hawkeye's mind. He now knows who the new guy is as he rushes forward, proclaiming it's \"Trapper John McIntyre, former quarterback for Dartmouth University. Hawkeye played in a game for Androscoggin College, against Dartmouth and McIntyre, and he intercepted a pass thrown by Trapper John, enabling Androscoggin to win the game, 6-0.Hawkeye also tells Duke that Trapper got his nickname as a result of cornering a girl in the restroom of a railroad car, and when the conductor caught them in there, the girl screamed, \"He trapped me!'The enlisted all line up outside the shower tent to get a peek at Dr. Captain \"Painless Pole\" Waldowsky as he's showering. The attraction is the captain's sexual apparatus, which is apparently of unusually large proportions. Corporal Judson, from Mississippi, takes his turn at the peephole. As he walks away, he says to a shocked looking Private Lorenzo Boone (Bud Cort), \"Ah'd purely love to see that angry!\"A small group, led by Colonel Blake (in his civilian winter coat), goes out to meet an incoming helicopter. On board is Major Margaret Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), the new Chief Nurse for the 4077th.Major Burns is tending to a male patient who suddenly goes into cardiac arrest. Burns calls for a nurse and proceeds to do a couple of unenthusiastic thumps on the patient's chest. When there's no nurse at hand, he directs Private Boone, who's just a teenage orderly, to go grab a cardiac needle and some adrenaline. Boone is hesitant, as he's not sure where to find those things, but he tries. The soldier dies right about then, and when Boone returns with a regular needle and hands it to Burns, Burns calls him an idiot and tells him he wanted a cardiac needle. Boone asks Burns if he wants him to get a nurse and Burns says, \"it's too late, Boone, you killed him.\" Boone feels horrible and goes away in tears. Trapper observes all this and a short while later he approaches Burns and asks him if he's done for the day. When Burns says yes, Trapper says, \"good, I just wanted to make sure you'll have time to sleep this off,\" and he lands a haymaker right hand across Burns' head. Burns crashes into some boxes of Tampax while Trapper grimaces in pain as he grips his right hand with his left. At the same moment, Colonel Blake and Major Houlihan pass by and are shocked at what they witness. They demand to know what's going on. Burns asks for them to leave he and Trapper alone and let them settle things, but Blake tells SSgt. Vollmer to arrest Trapper and confine him to his quarters.Before happening on the fight between Trapper and Burns, Blake had introduced Major Houlihan (he called her \"O'Houlihan\") to the people in the operating room. Among those there are Captain Dana Murrhardt (Danny Goldman), Captain Black, Captain Judson Sax, Captain Scorch (Dawne Damon), and Captain Bridget \"Knocko\" McCarthy (Tamara Wilcox-Smith).Henry wants to make Trapper the head surgeon, but feels the fight with Major Burns necessitates that he wait for a week or the new chief nurse will likely make a stink about it.Blake and Lt. Leslie are out on a small stream near camp and he's flycasting. Vollmer runs up to inform the colonel that General Hammond can't answer the phone as he's at a football game. Blake complains that the generals have all the fun.Margaret joins Hawkeye at his table in the mess tent. He asks her where she's from and she tells him she likes to think of the Army as her home. She then asks Hawkeye how he likes the nurses who work on his team. He tells her he likes them fine. She tells him that Major Burns does not think much of the nurses, to which Hawkeye responds that Burns is a lousy surgeon and an idiot. Margaret strongly disagrees. She thinks Burns is a fine doctor and military man. Margaret also think it's very unprofessional that people call Captain Pierce, \"Hawkeye.\" Hawkeye tells Major Houlihan that she's what he and others call \"a typical, uptight, career Army clown,\" as he loses his appetite and gets up to go to his tent.On occasion, the lights in the operating room go out. When that happens, several enlisted staff position themselves with flashlights so the doctors can keep working. In one instance, the doctors and nurses started singing \"When the Lights Go On Again,\" a song written in 1942, during WWII.Blake leaves the camp overnight to go see General Hammond over at the 325th Evac Hospital and he leaves Major Burns in charge. There's a big party in the mess tent for Trapper, to celebrate his being named the camp's new chief surgeon. Margaret and Frank are not impressed, especially when Trapper calls out for Margaret, the \"sultry bitch\" to be stripped of her clothes and brought to him for sex.Frank and Margaret collaborate on a typewritten letter to General Hammond, complaining about the lack of discipline and order at the 4077th. After they finish, Frank notes that it's dinnertime and Margaret asks if he's hungry. \"For you, Margaret,\" and they attack each other with passion and engage in a dry hump, but only briefly.There's a PA announcement that three cases of amphetamine sulfate (central nervous system stimulant) have disappeared and this is the third time this sort of thing has happened in the last month and it must stop by order of Colonel Blake's office. Burns escorts Margaret to her tent and offers to stop by and check on her later. She says that won't be necessary but she also says she'll leave the door unlocked. When he comes by later, they exchange empathy with one another for how poorly the others in camp treat them, and how disrespectful they are. Frank then says he thinks God willed them to find each other. Margaret throws open her pajama top, exposing her breasts and says, \"His will be done,\" and Frank plants his face on her breasts and they fall onto the bed. As they struggle to get their clothes off, Radar lifts up the bottom of the tent and places the microphone to the camp's PA system under the bed. At first, the sounds are transmitted only to location of the PA equipment in Henry Blake's office, where a handful of people are listening in. Trapper then decides the rest of the camp should hear it and an enlisted man flips a switch to broadcast it.Margaret is panting and tells Frank that her lips are hot, asking him to kiss her hot lips. Hawkeye, busy doing surgery, wonders what those sounds are and soon figures it out. He says, \"it sounds like Frank Burns is doing a bit of dilitation and curretage.\" Before long, Margaret can hear her own voice over the PA system and that quickly brings the lovemaking session to an end.The next morning in the mess tent, Forrest says, \"well, hi, Hot Lips,\" as she gets all flustered and has to leave the tent. Hawkeye sits down across the table from Frank and taunts Frank by asking if he'd heard from his wife. About then, Colonel Blake returns to camp and Radar directs him over to the window of the mess tent, behind where Hawkeye and Burns are sitting. Blake peers in and it warms his heart to see the two finally sitting down together to have a talk.Hawkeye says to Frank that he and the other guys wonder how Hot Lips is in the sack, \"is she better than self-abuse?\" He asks Frank, \"does that big ass of her move around a lot, or does it just sort of lie there, flaccid? What would you say about that?\"Blake wonders what they are saying. Radar looks and says Hawkeye is making a point about human anatomy. Blake is impressed at how professional the conversation is, how they are exchanging ideas.After Hawkeye asks if Hot Lips is a moaner or does she just lie there quietly, Frank launches himself across the table at Hawkeye and they fall to the ground, Hawkeye yelling for help. As they struggle, Trapper tells Hawkeye to look out for his goodies, as Frank is a sex maniac and he didn't think Hot Lips satisfied him. Several others in the area hurry to pull Frank off Hawkeye. Frank is put in a strait jacket and taken away by the MPs as Father Mulcahy attempts to read to him from a small scripture book. Frank won't be coming back, he's being shipped back to the states. Duke asks the colonel if he nails Hot Lips and punches Hawkeye, can he go home?In surgery, Hawkeye has to move quickly to stop a soldier's spurting neck artery, as an announcement comes over the PA system about the American Medical Association declaring marijuana to be a dangerous drug.Father Mulcahy tells Hawkeye that \"Painless Pole\" Waldowski has consulted him about a problem. Though Mulcahy feels unable to divulge any details (Waldowski had come to him in confession), he makes clear the severity of the problem. by explaining to Hawkeye that when one of the men asked for a ruling in the poker game they were playing, the captain said, \"what does it matter, it's only a game?\" Hawkeye wastes no time in going over to see Waldowski in his tent.Waldowski confides in Hawkeye that he has suffered a \"lack of performance\" (impotence) with a visiting nurse after a sexual encounter. He tells Hawkeye that he's distraught over how he will ever be able to tell his three fianc\u00e9es back home. Hawkeye tells Waldowski that occasional impotence is not a problem, and nothing for the \"dental Don Juan\" of Detroit to worry about. Waldowski tells Hawkeye that he's been reading up on it and Don Juanism is just a cover up. He thinks he's a fairy, a victim of latent homosexuality, and he can't deal with it.The next day, the other doctors are sitting around joking about Waldoski's concerns. He enters the tent as they smirk and giggle and tells them all he knows they were talking about him. He announces that he's going to commit suicide. Bandidi jokingly asks Waldoski if he can have his record player. He says sure. Then he asks for suggestions about how best to go about killing himself. Trapper says, \"the black capsule,\" which is what Adolph Hitler and Eva Braun used. Trapper claims to be able to provide a capsule for him.Hawkeye asks Father Mulcahy to perform last rites for Waldoski . He's hoping that if they conduct an end of life ceremony for him, he'll get scared and decide he wants to live. The doctors, administrative officers, chopper pilots and enlisted men all form up for the ceremony, a replica of the Last Supper, with a coffin placed in front of the table. Someone plays a scratchy version of \"Taps\" on a violin. Dago Red performs a quick absolution and Trapper gives a black capsule (actually a sleeping pill) to Waldoski. Waldoski figures that he'd better go lie down in the coffin, since the pill is supposed to work pretty fast. He gets in and immediately swallows the capsule with some wine. Everyone one files by to say goodbyes or leave little mementos with Waldoski. Among the items presented to him are some poker cards, a fifth of scotch, some basic dental instruments and the photographs of his three fianc\u00e9es. Finally, he goes to sleep as Corporal Judson (Timothy Brown) sings \"Suicide is Painless.\"A group of men carry the coffin to the Officer's Club and Waldoski is placed in a bed, complete with mood lighting. Hawkeye is outside making out with Lt. Schneider, who is scheduled to transfer out within 12 hours. Hawkeye asks her to do him a favor, to meet her professional obligations as a nurse, and go in and lie down with Waldoski, to help him with a potentially fatal psychological condition. She's not wanting to do it, but once she lifts up the edge of the sheet and sees what Waldoski has down below, she changes her mind.Captain Waldoski was in a very good mood the next morning, a new and improved man, seemingly having forgotten he supposedly had died the night before, and Lt. Schneider flew out on a helicopter, with a big smile on her face.Hawkeye and Trapper need some A-negative blood for a Korean prisoner of war with a chest wound they are operating on, but Radar said their requests for A-negative blood are never fulfilled. The operation proceeds and Radar goes to see a sleeping Colonel Blake. Radar sits next to the bed and monitors a tube extending from Blake's arm. A pint of blood is harvested from the colonel while he's sleeping (he's obviously type A-). Radar delivers a pint of blood to the operating room just as the surgeons were about to be forced to go on without it, at great risk to the patient.During the operation, Trapper is being assisted by Margaret and he says, \"Hot Lips, you may be a pain in the ass, but you're a damn good nurse.\"Captain Forrest likes blondes, but strongly disagrees with Hawkeye who speculates that Duke is attracted to Hot Lips. Duke says he nearly pukes every time he sees Hot Lips. He thinks she's probably not even a true blonde and decides to bet Hawkeye $20 that she isn't. They conspire on a plan to isolate Hot Lips in the women's shower and then expose her so they can see what color her pubic hair is. Everyone in the camp, including a dog, take seats outside the shower tent and when they are ready, Waldoski clangs two metal lids together and a soldier releases a sandbag connected to some ropes and the sides of the tent all fly up. Hot Lips had been singing in the shower, but when she discovers everyone is looking at her, she screams and falls to the ground, covering herself. She crawls over and gets a towel and, in hysterics, she storms off to see Colonel Blake. She's furious as she tears open the door to the Colonel's tent and finds him inside, lying in bed with Lt. Leslie. She screams at him that the camp is an insane asylum and that it's his fault for letting the doctors get away with practically anything. She threatens to resign her commission if Blake doesn't turn Duke and Hawkeye over to the MPs. Blake listens and becomes angry, telling Houlihan, \"Goddamit Hot Lips, resign your goddamn commission!\" Houlihan dejectedly turns and leaves, sobbing \"My commission, my commission.....\"Duke won the bet with Hawkeye. Margaret was not a natural blonde.Ho-Jon receives notice to report for an induction physical for the South Korean Army. Hawkeye, along with fellow co-workers Boone, Bandini, and Nurse Scorch, drive him to the induction center in Seoul for his physical. Hawkeye dopes him up with some drugs that temporarily give him a fast heart beat and high blood pressure. The doctor examining him is at first concerned, then figures out what's going on. He goes outside and informs Hawkeye that he will be keeping Ho Jon for a couple of days and retesting him. He says to Hawkeye, \"nice try.\" Hawkeye reluctantly has to let Ho-Jon go.A helicopter pilot arrives at the 4077th, looking for Captain McIntyre. A soldier who'd been doing some training in Japan was accidentally wounded when a grenade went off and some shrapnel got into his heart. Some big time heart surgeon in Boston told the kid's father, a Congressman, that Trapper John was the only surgeon in the theater who might be able to save his boy. Trapper is ordered to proceed to Kokura, Japan, to do the operation. After looking at the x-rays, Trapper realizes that just about anyone could remove the shrapnel, as it's not threatening the boy's heart, but he decides there's a free trip to Tokyo in the offing, plus General Hammond said in the orders to Trapper that he could bring an assistant, so he invites Hawkeye. They view it as an opportunity to do some golfing.Trapper and Hawkeye are driven past a golf course on their way to the hospital in Japan and they are pretending to be speaking Japanese. Their driver is Sgt. Gorman (Bobby Troupe), who doesn't view the task of escorting these two as appropriate to his skill set and he curses the army.At the hospital, the pair waste no time in upsetting just about every person they come into contact with, both medical and non-medical staff alike, as they order the congressman's son into surgery. Trapper tells Captain Peterson (Cathleen Cordell) to prepare the patient and find him a nurse who can work in close without getting her tits in the way. They are equally disrespectful to the straight-laced commander of the hospital, Colonel Wallace C. Merrill (James B. Douglas), ordering him to leave the operating room when he comes in to criticize their behavior.When the anesthetist for the operation, Captain E.B. \"Me Lay\" Marston (Michael Murphy), tells Hawkeye to save his rapier like wit for the clam diggers back home, Hawkeye suddenly recognizes it's an old acquaintance of his. Hawkeye had once told Trapper John how one of his friend's back home got the nick-name \"Me Lay\" by saying to girls, \"Me lay, you lay,\" and it would enable him to score with about 1 of every 50 of the girls.Trapper and Hawkeye quickly finish the surgery, but on the way out of the hospital, they are followed by two MPs. They think they are escaping through a door, but when they close it and turn around, they find themselves in the Colonel Merrill's outer office, where another MP is sitting and waiting for them. They are directed into Colonel Merrill's office to wait for him to appear. They still have their golf clubs with them, so they take advantage of the wait by practicing their putting.When Colonel Merrill comes in, he threatens to have Hawkeye and Trapper court martialed. They remind him that they bailed him out with the Congressman by operating on his son and if Merrill decides to press the matter, they will call and tell the Congressman their side of the story and the colonel can tell his side. They tell the colonel they will hang around one more day to golf and check on the Congressman's son, and he can contact them at the golf course if he wants them. Then Hawkeye uses the butt end of his putter to push the colonel back into his chair and off they go.Dr. Marston invites Hawkeye and Trapper to come check out Dr. Yamachi's New Era Hospital and Whorehouse, where Marston moonlights as a doctor. As the three later sit with some Geisha girls and eat a meal at the facility, a nurse comes in and speaks with Me Lay, telling him that a Japanese-American baby boy was having trouble breathing and needed help. Based only on a description of the symptoms, Trapper and Hawkeye decide to schedule surgery for the boy back at the Army hospital. Hawkeye has already diagnosed the problem as a tracheal-esophageal fistula. He tells Dr. Marston not to tell the hospital who the surgery is for, because it is against the rules. However, when Colonel Merrill finds out what's going on, he comes into the operating room and throws a fit, prompting the doctors to clamp a surgical gas mask over his face and put him to sleep, then they complete the operation on the child.While the Colonel is still asleep, one of the Geisha girls, Michiko (Hiroko Watanabe) is put with him in a bed and some compromising photos are taken to assure that the Colonel will remain quiet about everything that had transpired.On their return to the 4077th from Japan, Hawkeye and Trapper (still wearing their newly purchased golf attire) immediately go into surgery for several hours. Finally with a chance to go their tent, now nicknamed \"The Swamp,\" they find the flaps on the windows down and the door locked so they bang on the door. Duke's face appears at the window and he wants to know what the hell they are doing back already. He tells them to wait a minute. Hawkeye and Trapper figure something's up, so they start around towards the back of the tent and see a shirtless Forrest trying to smuggle Hot Lips away under a blanket. When the blanket falls off, they say hello to Hot Lips and ask her if she missed them. As she scurries away, Duke just looks at Trapper and Hawkeye and shrugs. Apparently non-blondes are ok with him after all.General Hammond calls Colonel Blake to tell him the battle for Old Baldy was all over (the battle that was responsible for so many wounded). He ignores Henry's inquiry as to who won, instead telling him he got a rather disturbing report from Major \"O'Houlihan\" about things taking place at the 4077th that he finds hard to believe. Blake says, \"well, don't believe them then...goodbye\" and he hangs up the phone.General Hammond makes a trip over to the 4077th to check on things for himself. The first thing he does is join the surgeons out under a camouflage net for some martinis. They discuss Major Houlihan. Trapper tells the general that Colonel Blake can't be blamed for Hot Lips not being able to stand her name. When Hawkeye tells the general that Hot Lips is a regular Army fanatic who won't even let them play football, that gets the general's attention, as he loves football. He asks if the 4077th has a football team. Hawkeye starts to say no, but Trapper John interjects and says yes. Hammond mentions that his team at the 325th Evac (he's the head coach) is currently scheduling games for the upcoming season. They like to play games against other units and bet on the outcomes. When he says the bets are typically in the $5,000-$6,000 range, Hawkeye nearly chokes, but the general has already decided to go speak with Colonel Blake about it.Trapper observes that the general has five times the manpower to draw his football players from. Hawkeye thinks they can deal with that by finding a \"ringer\" to help them. He knows an Army neurosurgeon named Oliver Harmon Jones, a.k.a. \"Spearchucker\" who used to play for the San Francisco 49ers. If they can get Henry to put in a special request for Dr. Jones, then he could be on their football team. Forrest, being from Georgia, is concerned about potential social problems, as Jone's would be the only black officer in camp. Hawkeye tells Duke they'd just stick him in the Swamp with them.The general goes to see Blake and tell him about the football game plan. Henry is taken aback. \"Football? Gambling? What about Houlihan?\" The general says, \"ya mean Hot Lips? Screw her!\"So, \"Spearchucker\" (a nickname from his days as a javelin thrower) shows up at the 4077th and Colonel Blake assumes the role as head coach. He organizes the first practice and just as he's beginning his first coaching lesson (about the three basic principles of football: organization, discipline and teamwork), Dr. Jones interrupts and asks if they can all limber up first. Henry decides that's a good idea and asks Spearchucker to organize that.The team is put through a pretty rigorous training camp, just like any normal football team would go through. Hot Lips also participates by organizing a squad of nurses as cheerleaders.Trapper is the team's quarterback. Spearchucker is a running back. Spearchucker presents Colonel Blake with seven or eight plays that he drew up, telling the coach that he figured that's about the maximum number of plays their team could handle.As for the bet, Hawkeye suggests they bet $2,500 on the first half, in which Spearchucker won't play, then get new odds for the 2nd half and put Spearchucker in. Everyone agrees that's a good idea.On game day, the 325th Evac team is dressed in blue uniforms and the 4077th M.A.S.H. is in red jerseys and white helmets with red crosses on the front and back. The field is well manicured green grass and well marked. The referees are very official looking. There are cheerleaders for both teams and bleachers on one side of the field, filled with spectators.The 4077th kicks off and a flashy little runner for the 325th returns the ball for a touchdown. Spearchucker knows him as \"Super Bug\" (Noland Smith) and tells the others that Super Bug played for the L.A. Rams. Spearchucker tells his teammates they have to get Super Bug out of the game. Meanwhile, the general is telling his defensive star, a huge lineman, #88 (Ben Davidson) to go easy on the 4077th players so as not to run up the score.The 4077th's first play from scrimmage sees the ball snapped way over Trapper's head and he falls on it in the end zone for a safety.Radar serves as the water boy. He brings out a syringe and hands it to anesthesiologist Black who tucks it into his belt. After Super Bug returns the next kickoff for another touchdown, Dr. Black injects him in the arm, even using an alcohol swab first, while he's still on the ground. Within seconds, Super Bug becomes disoriented and falls down. On the sideline, he starts talking about the next race. He thinks they are all participating in a track meet.The \"Painless Pole\" tells the huge player opposite him, \"All right, Bud, this time your fucking head is coming right off!\" but he's the one who gets hammered.It's 16-0 at halftime and when the gun goes off signaling the end of the half, Super Bug mistakes it for a starter's gun and takes off in a sprint and runs into his team's cheerleaders, knocking them all over.Henry begins a rallying halftime speech when Hawkeye reminds him that he needs to go take care of the second half bet with General Hammond, so Blake stops talking and he and Radar go over to the 325th's locker room.The 325th's #88 takes a big mouthful of water and purposely directs a stream of water at Radar's head as they sit around observing the colonel and general discuss terms of the bet. Radar just looks like a sad little puppy dog as he is forced to suffer through the insult.The general and colonel decide to double the bet for the 2nd half.Spearchucker enters the game for the 4077th and returns the 2nd half kickoff for a touchdown. The extra point attempt is blocked. The general demands to know who the that new guy is and one of the players on the 325th tells him it's Spearchucker Jones who played for the 49ers. The general yells at Blake from across the field, accusing him of bringing in a ringer. Blake couldn't make out what the general said, so he asks Radar. Radar says, \"His ringer identified our ringer.\" Blake shouts back, \"How do ya like them apples, Charlie?\"The second half is brutal, as numerous players from both side are injured and carted off the field. Several 325th Evac players are sharing a marijuana joint on the bench during the game. The general occasionally gets distracted looking at his team's cheerleaders.The 4077th cheerleaders stand right behind Colonel Blake throughout the game and he often gets frustrated with them. He once yells at Hot Lips, calling her a \"blithering idiot\" because she's cheering for everything that happens: injuries and penalties, as well as scores or good plays. When the gun goes off at the end of the third quarter, at the same time a 4077th player is being tackled, Hot Lips shouts out, \"oh, my God, they shot him!\"Blue team's #88 calls the 4077th's #69 a \"coon,\" as he's black. #69 wants to fight #88, but gets chastised by Spearchucker for risking a penalty and ejection. Spearchucker knows something about #88 from pro football camp, so he advises #69 to use the fact that #88 has a sister named Gladys to turn the tables and piss him off instead. So, before the snap of the ball on the next play, #69 says something, causing #88 to level him. #69 jumps up and runs the opposite direction, with #88 in hot pursuit. They run all the way down the field before the refs and other catch up to them. #88 is ejected from the game as the 4077th cheerleaders start chanting, \"69 is divine.\"The 4077th scores on a TD pass, but the extra point is muffed. The score is 16-12. It comes down to the last play of the game. Spearchucker tells the team that he spoke with the umpire and they will run a special \"center eligible\" play, where the center, SSgt. Vollmer, will hike the ball to Trapper, but then bring the ball right back between his legs and tuck it under his shirt as Trapper and the rest of the players carry out a fake. The play works, even after Vollmer runs over to the sideline to show Coach Blake that he actually has the ball, then he continues on down the sideline and, thanks to a block from Spearchucker, scores a touchdown. Final score: 4077th - 18, 325th -16.The 4077th team rolls back into camp, all drunk. Later, there's a big poker game in a tent and in the background a dead soldier is being loaded into the back of a Jeep and taken away, bringing the reality of their situation back in focus.There's a little yellow camp dog that Hawkeye often plays with. He calls it \"pup-pup.\" He's petting the dog when he receives word from Radar that prompts him to rush over to the operating room and inform Forrest that they both had received orders to go home. Forrest can't celebrate right away, as he's assisting Dr. Jones in brain surgery.Father Mulcahy blesses the Jeep that Forrest and Hawkeye will leave in. After some quick goodbyes, Duke and Hawkeye jump in a Jeep, and just as when they arrived in Korea, they don't wait for their designated driver. Hawkeye drives and they roar out of camp. Blake asks Radar if Hawkeye just stole that Jeep and Radar says no, that it's the same Jeep they arrived in.The PA Announcer reads the end credits as the movie ends.", "output": "Question: Who participates as a cheerleader?, Answer: Klinger, Question: Who is the commander of the 4077?, Answer: Henry Blake, Question: Where is the film set?, Answer: Korea - just off the front battle lines., Question: Who were the two replacements assigned to the 4077?, Answer: Hawkeyes and Forrest, Question: Who performs an unauthorized operation on a local infant?, Answer: Trapper and Hawkeye, Question: What changes the social dynamic of the camp?, Answer: spearchucker being added to the unit, Question: What two characters have a romantic relationship?, Answer: Majors Houlihan and Burns,, Question: What themes does the film explore?, Answer: the themes of military life, Question: Who is goaded into punching Hawkeye?, Answer: Burns, Question: What do Hawkeye and Duke receive after the football game?, Answer: their discharge orders, Question: How much do Trapper and Hawkeye bet up front?, Answer: $20, Question: Who was the contemplative Chaplain?, Answer: Father Mulcahy", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The situation worsens when Robert is diagnosed with lymphoma and given only a few months to live. As he becomes more and more depressed, Dave takes up archery, finding the activity a way to build his focus and calm his nerves.To prove himself to his father and possibly reconcile with Noreen (Hope Davis), his estranged wife, Dave pursues a weatherman position with a national talk show called Hello America.

He is found and imprisoned on a troop carrier by his company First Sergeant, Welsh. The men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division have been brought to Guadalcanal as reinforcements in the campaign to secure Henderson Field and seize the island from the Japanese. As they wait in a Navy transport, they contemplate their lives and the invasion. Battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Tall talks with Brigadier General Quintard about the invasion and its importance.C Company lands on Guadalcanal unopposed and marches to the interior of the island, encountering natives and evidence of the Japanese presence. They arrive near Hill 210, a key Japanese position. The Japanese have placed a bunker with machine guns at the top of the hill and any attempt to climb the hill will be cut down.A brief shelling of the hill begins the next day at dawn. C Company attempts to capture the hill but is repelled by gunfire. Among the first killed is one of the platoon leaders, Second Lieutenant Whyte. During the battle, a squad led by Sergeant Keck hides behind a swell safe from enemy fire to wait for reinforcements. Keck reaches for a grenade but accidentally pulls the pin and dies in the process. Lieutenant Colonel Tall orders the company commander, Captain James Staros, to take the bunker by frontal assault, at whatever cost. Staros refuses and Tall decides to join Staros on the front line to see the situation. The Japanese resistance seems to have lessened, and Tall's opinion of Staros seems to have been sealed. Private Witt, having been assigned punitively as a stretcher bearer, asks to rejoin the company, and is allowed to do so.A small detachment of men performs a reconnaissance mission on Tall's orders to determine the strength of the Japanese bunker. Private Bell reports there are five machine guns in the bunker. He joins another small team of men (including Witt), led by Captain John Gaff, on a flanking mission to take the bunker. The operation is a success and C Company overruns one of the last Japanese strongholds on the island. The Japanese they find are largely malnourished, dying and put up little resistance.For their efforts the men are given a week's leave: the airfield where they are based comes under enemy artillery bombardment; Bell receives a letter from his wife informing him that she has fallen in love with someone else and wishes to divorce; Captain Staros is relieved of his command by Lieutenant Colonel Tall, who deems him too soft for the pressures of combat and suggests that he apply for reassignment and become a lawyer in the JAG in Washington. He offers to arrange a Purple Heart for Staros, to avoid the unit's name being stained by having an officer removed from command. Witt comes across the locals and notices that they have grown distant and distrustful of him and quarrel regularly with one another.The company is sent on patrol up a river but with the inexperienced 1st Lieutenant George Band at its head. As Japanese artillery fire falls close to their positions; Band orders some men to scout upriver, with Witt volunteering to go along. They encounter an advancing Japanese column and are attacked. To buy time for Corporal Fife to go back and inform the rest of the unit, Witt draws away the Japanese but is then encircled by one of their squads, who demand that he surrender. He raises his rifle and is gunned down. The company is able to retreat safely, and Witt is later buried by Welsh and his squadmates.

Expedition leader Dr. Carl Maia (Antonio Moreno) visits his friend and former student, Dr. David Reed (Richard Carlson), an ichthyologist. He works at an aquarium in California and has also been a guest at Maia's marine biology institute in Brazil for more than a month. Reed persuades his boss, the financially-minded Dr. Mark Williams (Richard Denning), to fund a return expedition to the Amazon to look for the remainder of the skeleton.The group goes aboard the tramp steamer Rita, which is captained by crusty old Lucas (Nestor Paiva). The expedition consists of David, Carl, and Mark, as well as Reed's girlfriend and colleague, Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams), and another scientist, Dr. Edwin Thompson (Whit Bissell). When they arrive at the camp, they discover that Maia's entire research team has been mysteriously killed while he was away. Lucas suggests it was likely done by a jaguar, but the others are unsure. In fact, the camp was attacked by a piscine amphibious humanoid, a living member of the same species from which the fossil originated. The creature, curious about the expedition, goes to the camp. When its sudden appearance frightens the members, they attack it, and in response the enraged creature kills them.The excavation of the area where Carl found the hand turns up nothing. Mark is ready to give up the search, but David suggests that perhaps thousands of years ago the part of the embankment containing the rest of the skeleton fell into the water and was washed downriver, broken up by the current. Lucas says that the tributary empties into a lagoon. Lucas calls it the \"Black Lagoon\", a paradise from which no one has ever returned. The scientists decide to risk it, unaware that the amphibious \"Gill-man\" that killed Carl's assistants earlier has been watching them. Taking notice of the beautiful Kay, it follows the Rita all the way downriver to the Black Lagoon. Once the expedition arrives, David and Mark go diving to collect fossils from the lagoon floor. After they return, Kay goes swimming and is stalked underwater by the creature, who then gets briefly caught in one of the ship's drag lines. Although it escapes, the creature leaves behind a claw in the net, revealing its existence to the scientists.Subsequent encounters with the Gill-man claim the lives of Lucas's crew members, before the creature is captured and locked in a cage aboard the Rita. It escapes during the night, attacking Edwin, who was guarding it. Edwin smashes the beast with a lantern, driving it off. Following this incident, David decides they should return to civilization, but as the Rita tries to leave, they find the lagoon's entrance blocked by fallen logs, courtesy of the escaped Gill-man. While the others attempt to remove the logs, Mark is mauled to death trying to capture the creature underwater, single handedly. It then abducts Kay and takes her to its cavern lair. David, Lucas, and Carl give chase, and Kay is rescued.

Dave is fired from his job after his girlfriend frames him for embezzlement, Andrew is falsely accused of attempted child molestation, and their house is to be demolished by day's end. Both of them hide inside the house as police, city officials, and outraged neighbors surround it. Dave and Andrew open their front door and discover that the entire world beyond their house is gone, replaced with a featureless white void.Eventually, after a simple test reveals that the nothingness surrounding them holds a flat, featureless, and somewhat springy surface \"like tofu\", they set out across the empty plane in order to explore their new surroundings, leaving items behind as a means of getting back. After running out of items to leave as a trail, they lose track of their path. Wandering leads them to what appears to be another house, but they have simply wandered back home.Panic begins to set in again when Andrew realizes that the house is completely out of food. Andrew glances around the room, eventually stopping and glaring at a noisy clock on the wall; within a few seconds it disappears. Andrew drops a stack of overdue bills in front of Dave, and within seconds the bills abruptly disappear. Dave puts one last theory to test, managing to hate away his need for food.Dave still expresses some concern over Andrew's remaining phobias, questioning why the phobias still exist when there's nothing left to fear. Reluctantly, Andrew reveals that he was abused and tormented by his parents as a child. With some urging from Dave he hates away the memory of each traumatic childhood event as he recounts it; when he is finally done he is no longer phobic and much more confident in himself. Unfortunately this change alters Andrew's personality and leads to friction between the two friends, finally building into an outright confrontation. They decide they can no longer share the same house, and opt to determine who keeps it by playing a match of their favorite fighting game. Dave loses, and is exiled with his possessions to reside out in the nothingness.Things become very tense with Dave's departure. Dave attempts to engage Andrew in conversation repeatedly, even performing the national anthem for his self-created nation (its borders marked by a line of his possessions), all to no avail. After several days Dave comes into Andrew's house much happier and explains his sudden change of mood: he has hated away his anger at Andrew; all Andrew needs to do is hate away his anger at Dave and things will be back to normal. Andrew refuses, quite content to be angry at Dave. Dave hates away his anger several times as Andrew rebuffs and outright insults him, but his patience finally wears thin, leading Dave to hate away one of Andrew's possessions. Andrew retaliates by hating away one of Dave's possessions, and the situation escalates until everything including the house is hated away.Dave walks away, assuming the argument is finished, but falls over suddenly as his feet begin to disappear; Andrew is hating them away. He turns and retaliates, hating away Andrew's legs, and the situation escalates again until all that is left of the two are their disembodied heads.

As he is being led into the donation room,he is informed that his blood is of a rare phenotype. Bad news for Jared;good news for the blood bank, the phlebotomist says and bares his vampirefangs. Jared laughs hysterically. Suddenly, his chin cracks open revealinga gaping maw with a barbed tongue. He pounces on the phlebotomist's neck,and blood flies everywhere.Two years have passed since Blade's mentor, Abraham Whistler, shothimself, after being brutally beaten and bitten by vampires. When Blade [Wesley Snipes]learned that the vampires were keeping Whistler alive, he followed theirtrail through Eastern Europe--first to Moscow, then to Romania, and now tothe Czech Republic. When Blade discovers that the vampires are keepingWhistler in stasis in a halfway house, he breaks into the house andrescues him, after killing a number of vampires with silver stakes andbullets made of silver nitrate and garlic extract. One acceleratedretrovirus detox shot later, and Whistler [Kris Kristofferson] is back among the living.Much has happened in the last two years. Blade has taken on a newassistant named Scud [Norman Reedus] who doesn't get along very well with Whistler, nowthat he's returned. The High Council of Vampires has created a group ofsix warriors, referred to as the Bloodpack, who are being trained to fightagainst Blade. However, a vampire virus called the Reaper Strain hasmutated in Jared Nomak who passes the virus to everyone he bites. Sincethe Reaper virus makes carriers extremely voracious, Nomak (and each ofhis victims) need to feed daily, and they feed on both humans andvampires. The numbers of Reapers, noticeable because they resemble nosferatu with their bald, blue-veined heads and pointy ears, are increasing exponentially, and thevampires fear the Reapers will first wipe them out then start on humans. Soon...you do the math.Now that the Reapers are presenting an even bigger threat to thevampires than Blade ever did, Vampire Overlord Eli Damaskinos [Thomas Kretschmann] has sent amessage to Blade, requesting a truce and asking him to join with thevampires and actually lead the Bloodpack against the Reapers. Bladeagrees, but the Bloodpack--Lighthammer, Verlaine, Priest, Snowman, Chupa,and Reinhardt--are not happy being led by the Daywalker they were trainingto kill. To assure their cooperation, Blade plants a silver nitrate bomb,courtesy of Scud, on the back of Reinhardt's [Ron Perlman] head. Blade holds thedetonator, and it is set to explode should anyone tamper with it.Accompanied by the vampires Asad [Danny John-Jules] and Nyssa [Leonor Varela],daughter of Overlord Damaskinos, Blade and his Bloodpack begin their search for Nomak bystaking out places where vampires congregate, such as blood banks and safehouses, figuring these places will also be attractive to the Reapers.First on the list is the House of Pain, an old hotel converted into asafehouse sheltering some 200-300 \"suckheads,\" all dancing and feeding. Asthe Bloodpack searches the building, Reapers begin emerging from thesubbasement. About 1/2 hour before dawn, the Reapers attack. The Bloodpackmanages to take out several Reapers with ultraviolet guns, but Nomak getsaway, even after being injected with the anticoagulant EDTA, and a Reaperbites Priest, requiring that Priest be destroyed in the rising sun.Lighthammer also gets bitten, but he hides it. In this first battle withthe Reapers, Blade learns that Reapers are impervious to silver, EDTA, andgarlic, and they rapidly bounce back from almost any wound, includingsilver stakes thrust into their chests. How in the world can thesecreatures be stopped, and whose side should Blade be on anyway,considering that both Blade and Nomak are enemies of the vampires?Meanwhile, back at the High Council, Damaskinos' lawyer, KarelKounen, has informed Damaskinos of Priest's death and warns the Overlordthat he is playing a dangerous game, one that could result in hisdaughter's death. Damaskinos informs Kounen that his \"friend inside\" saysthat everything is going as planned. Friend inside? Who could that be? Oneof the Bloodpack? Nyssa? Whistler?Outside the House of Pain, Scud and Whistler, who have been workingsurveillance from the van and on the roof, have managed to capture aReaper who was trying to escape down a manhole into the sewers but gotstuck. For some odd reason, this Reaper is dying. Blade surmises that theReaper's body, having gone several hours without feeding, is beginning tofeed on itself. Since he is dying anyway, this provides Nyssa with anopportunity to perform an autopsy and learn more about the Reapers. Shelearns that the barbed tongue contains a nerve toxin to paralyze thevictim while the Reaper feeds. Their hearts are encased in bone, making itvirtually impossible to shove a stake through them. The only thing thatseems to affect them is exposure to sun and to ultraviolet light.Unfortunately, these are also deadly to vampires, which is going to makeit difficult for Blade to destroy the Reapers without harming his vampireallies.Scud spends the rest of the night working to build UV grenades out ofphosphor rods. The next morning, meaning to use daytime, the onlyadvantage they have over the Reapers, Blade, Whistler, Nyssa, Asam, andthe Bloodpack, armed with UV guns, UV grenades, and large-scale UV bombsgo down into the sewers. They split into three units. Whistler goes withChupa and Reinhardt down the east tunnel. Lighthammer, Verlaine, andSnowman go in the opposite direction, and Blade goes with Asam and Nyssa.Unfortunately, treachery abounds. When Chupa and Reinhardt get Whistleralone, Chupa beats him up. We lose a partner and Blade loses one, Chupathreatens. Lighthammer completes his evolution into a Reaper and feasts onSnowman, then goes after Verlaine, who has no recourse other than to opena manhole cover, killing both herself and Lighthammer in the sunlight.Then the Reapers start arriving, crawling on the sewer floor, walls,and ceiling. Asam is attacked by a half dozen Reapers crawling underwater.Blade sets off a UV grenade, killing all the Reapers, but it is too latefor Asam. Chupa falls prey to Reapers. Reinhardt is being followed byReapers, so he sets a UV bomb, but the detonator sticks. Blade radiosorders to everyone to regroup, but the only ones left standing are Nyssa,Reinhardt, and Blade, so Blade goes back to get the UV bomb that Reinhardtleft behind. Only after Blade has found the bomb and is surrounded bydozens of hungry Reapers does Reinhardt radio Blade to inform him that thedenotator doesn't work. Holding off Reapers with both hands, Blade kicksat the lever until it finally gives. Ten seconds later, UV light floodsthe tunnels. It fries the Reapers, but it also hits Nyssa and Reinhardt.Where is Whistler? Whistler has met up with Nomak who, instead ofattacking him, has given Whistler a ring and told him to tell Blade thetruth, which Nomak whispers in Whistler's ear.Meanwhile, Blade has caught up with Nyssa to find her severely burnedby the UV bomb and badly in need of blood, so he cuts his wrist and makesher drink his blood. Suddenly, Blade is shot in the back with stunguns.Kounen and Reinhardt step in. Vampires from the Council round up Whistler,Nyssa, and Blade and deliver them to Damaskinos.When Nyssa regains consciousness, she is back in her father's study.She tells him how Blade saved her life and asks whether he is still alive.Oh, Blade's alive alright. He, Scud, and Whistler are being held in achamber deep in Damaskinos' sanctuary. Just as Whistler begins to tellNomak's \"truth\" to Blade--that the Reaper virus didn't evolve, it wasgenetically designed--Damaskinos, Nyssa, and Reinhardt enter the chamber.Damaskinos explains that he has been searching for a way to rid thevampires of their hereditary weaknesses by recombining DNA. As he talks,he shows Blade a cylinder filled with hundreds of small fetal vampires.Nomak was first, Damaskinos says, but Nomak was a failure in that he isn'timmune to light. Soon, however, Damaskinos thinks he will have created anew pure race of daywalking vampires, immune to silver and sunlight. Allhe needs is to figure out why Blade is immune to light and then programthat quality into his fetal vampires.Whistler tosses Nomak's ring at Damaskinos' feet. Nyssa recognizes itimmediately as the Damaskinos family crest. Turns out that Nomak isDamaskinos' son, Nyssa's brother! She storms out, followed by her father.Reinhardt takes this chance to beat up on Blade, but Blade pulls out thedetonator to the UV bomb on the back of Reinhardt's head. He presses thedetonator button, but nothing happens. Scud laughs. I designed the bomb tobe a dud, Scud explains as Reinhardt pulls it off his head and tosses itto Scud. Scud then tells Blade how he's been Damaskinos' familiar allalong. What do you think of that, Scud asks Blade. Two things, says Blade.One, I've known about you all along and, two, the bomb isn't a dud. Bladethen presses a second button. Goodbye Scud.Blade is then repeatedly stun-gunned and taken to an operating roomwhere Kounen drives spikes through Blade's body in order to secure him.Kounen explains that he is going to harvest Blade's blood and body partsin order to search for the key to what makes him a Daywalker. However,Whistler manages to get out of his handcuffs, knock out Reinhardt, andescape through the floor ducts to the operating room. He shoots Kounen,and releases Blade. Blade is drained of blood and severely weakened, soWhistler carries him into a bloodbath where Blade quickly regenerates. Thefirst thing Blade does after leaving the bloodbath is to take out two orthree dozen guards. Next, he slices Reinhardt in half from head to toe.Then he's off to find Damaskinos while Whistler destroys the fetalvampires.Meanwhile, Nyssa is having it out with her father. She feels totallybetrayed because Damaskinos sent her and her Bloodpack out, expecting themto die. He used both of his children, her and Nomak, for his own purposes,and he used Blade, too. Blade, her supposed enemy, saved her life. As shedebates where her loyalties lie, Nomak has succeeded in invading the innersanctum where Nyssa has sealed herself and Damaskinos. Damaskinos attemptsto apologize to his son for all that has befallen him, but Nomak bites hisfather's neck anyway. As Damaskinos lay dying on the floor, hisbluish-green blood spilling out, Nyssa takes off her family ring andtosses it in her father's blood. Nyssa then offers herself to Nomak whodives into her neck, too.Enter Blade. A drawn out fight ensues between Blade and Nomak untilBlade manages to thrust his sword through Nomak's side, the one placewhere his heart is unprotected by bone. Nomak seems almost happy and, infact, thrusts the blade in further, and his body disintegrates. Poor Nyssahas been bitten and can already feel her body changing into that of aReaper. I want to die while I'm still a vampire, she tells Blade. I wantto see the sun. Blade carries her outside. Together, they watch thesunrise before Nyssa burns up in Blade's arms.In the end Blade disposes of Rush, the vampire he had left alive in the beginning of the movie, at the vampires' half-way house.", "output": "Question: What is the pandemic known as?, Answer: The Reaper Virus, Question: How does Nyssa become infected with the virus?, Answer: She was bitten, Question: who reappears and explains that he has been tracking the Reapers to a central nest in the sewers?, Answer: Whistler, Question: How does Blade kill Scud?, Answer: Blade, Scud, and Whistler are being held in a chamber deep in Damaskinos' sanctuary., Question: Who does Blade kill in London at the end of the movie?, Answer: Rush, Question: what is the name of one of the reapers?, Answer: Jared Nomak, Question: Why does Nomak kill Damaskinos?, Answer: Seeking revenge, Question: What does Lighthammer succumb to?, Answer: The infection, Question: What happened when the manhole cover was removed?, Answer: Verlaine and Lighthammer are killed., Question: What is the virus called?, Answer: Reaper, Question: Who is the vampire lord?, Answer: Eli Damaskinos, Question: What are the infected vampires turned into?, Answer: daywalkers, Question: Who survives an encounter with Nomak?, Answer: Whistler, Question: Who kills Reinhardt?, Answer: Reinhardt is still alive as far as I could read., Question: who create UV projectors for the team?, Answer: Blade and Scud", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)A group of college friends consisted of Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit, and Arch\u00e2\u0080\u0093gather, celebrate spring break by spending the weekend at the island mansion of their friend and Skip's sister Muffy St. John, on the weekend leading up to April Fools' Day. The tone is set almost immediately with Muffy preparing details around the house, and finds an old jack-in-the-box she remembers in a flashback sequence. Meanwhile, her friends are joking around on the pier, then on the ferry to the island. When en route to the island, local deckhand buck Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident.Once on the island and in the mansion, it turns out Muffy has set up a variety of little jokes from the simple such as whoopee cushions and dribble glasses, to the more complex and disturbing such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. Through it all, despite the friends in general try to relax, Skip goes missing. Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing next. During a search, Nikki falls into the island's well and finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch and the dead body of Nan. Afterward, the remaining group discover that the phones are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday.One after another, the group either vanishes or being killed and their bodies being found. Kit and Rob put together some clues and realizing that everyone's earlier assumption is wrong; the kinsman of the deckhand injured when they arrived is a red herring. It also turns out that Muffy has a violently insane twin sister named Buffy, who has escaped. In fact, the \"Muffy\" they have been around since the first night was Buffy, pretending to be Muffy. They discover Muffy's severed head in the basement.Buffy chases them with a curved butcher's knife, and the couple are separated. Kit flees from Buffy into the living room where she finds everyone else there, alive and calmly waiting for her. It was all a joke, or more accurately, a dress rehearsal. It is revealed to the audience that the whole film was never a slasher film from the start, but rather pretending to be one. Muffy hopes to turn the mansion into a resort offering a weekend of staged horror. She even had a friend who does special effects and make-up for Hollywood help. Each \"victim\" agreed to take part as things were explained to them.Everyone has a huge laugh and break out lots of bottles of champagne. Later that night, a half-drunk Muffy goes to her room and finds a wrapped present on her bed. She unwraps it, and the present is the Jack-in-the-Box. Savoring the surprise, she turns the handle slowly and when \"Jack\" finally pops out, Nan, who knew Muffy from acting class, emerges from behind her and slits her throat with a razor. Muffy screams, but then realizes she is not really bleeding and that she used a trick razor and stage blood.

Sergeant James Allen is returning home by boat to New York City after having served a stint in the Army and in World War One in Europe, being awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre. After taking part in a welcome home parade with fellow soldiers, he travels by train to his hometown in New Jersey.James is welcomed home by his mother, his prissy brother that is a Protestant minister, younger sister, and former boss from the factory he worked. His boss has reserved his old job as a shoe factory shipping clerk he had before joining the Army. Though it is a decent job and pays him over $50 a week, which was good money back in the early 1920's, James served in the Army Corps of Engineers and wants to do something more rewarding by building things, instead of a routine life of a desk job. Plus the war made him restless. Much to the dismay of his brother, who wants him to settle down and keep his steady job, his mother supports him and wants him to do what makes him happy and what his heart desires.James leaves his small New Jersey hometown for Boston and soon after being hired by a construction company, he is laid off. He then travels by boat to New Orleans and looks for a job at a construction site, but they are not hiring. After 4 months, James gets a temporary job driving a truck in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, but is soon laid off. He stops at a pawn shop in St. Louis attempting to get cash for his Belgian Croix De Guerre, but is rejected due to the box full of medals other former service members already pawned. He is last seen heading south. To avoid identity of the state, which was actually Georgia in the true life story of Robert Elliot Burns, it fades out around Kentucky and Tennessee on the map and James is seen walking on railroad tracks. After over a year of looking for work and taking up temporary jobs, he is now a homeless and penniless vagrant.James takes up residence in a homeless shelter in the fictional city of Stanton (a pseudonym for Atlanta) and meets a man named Pete that offers him to go for a handout at a lunch wagon for a hamburger. James heartily accepts and they go there with the owner reluctantly agreeing to give them a handout. Pete pulls a gun on the owner to rob his cash drawer and then on James forcing him to rob the $5. Pete is soon shot dead by local police. James instinctively runs from the scene, but the police arrest him.James is sentenced by the county judge 10 years imprisonment on the chain gang for the minor theft. Supposedly the diner owner either lied to the police or refused to testify for James for the incident, since he did see James forced to rob the register at the point of a gun.James is at a rural prison camp just outside of Stanton with leg shackles being attached to him by a blacksmith. At 4:20 the next morning, the guards are turning on the oil lanterns and waking up the prisoners, who are chained to their bed. James sleeps through the removal of the chains and is pushed by a guard and has his chain thrown in his face. He and the prisoners all go to eat breakfast, an abominable meal of pork fat, grease, a piece dough made out of flour and lard, and sorghum molasses, which helps make the food somewhat more tolerable. The meal is served for breakfast and dinner every single day.The black and white prisoners are separated from each other in housing and trucks that chain them drive to the worksites. The prisoners await the rising of the sun before getting to work. They are forced to chop rocks in a quarry for over 15 hours a day nonstop, with only a short restroom break with the approval of the guards and lunch break. James wipes sweat off his brow without permission from the guards and punched for it. He learns the ropes through an elderly prisoner named Bomber Wells, who injects a lot of humor into the situation. Another prisoner named Red, who is on the verge of dying from overwork, passes out and guards attempt to revive him by throwing cold water on him.It is 8:20 p.m. and the prisoners are dirty and exhausted from over 15 hours of work. The only bathing they have available is a galvanized steel tub full of water they rinse themselves in and share. James and the prisoners sit down to the same abominable meal they had for breakfast, this time enjoying it somewhat.After mealtime and at bedtime, the warden asks the guards to point out the prisoners that did not give them a good days work. Ackerman and Red are chosen. James calls the warden a skunk under his breath for wanting to whip Red, who is obviously on the verge of dying. Ackerman gets ten lashes and screaming, with his scarred and bloody back revealed. James is whipped instead of Red at least fifteen times and takes it stoically, to the admiration of the other prisoners.About one month later, prisoner Barney has now completed his sentence convincing the others they can get out alive by \"work out or die out\". Prisoner Red has also left, but in a pine box, having died from overwork. James is determined to break free from the prison, but Bomber advises him that he needs to wait weeks or even months to scout out the area and have a good plan before doing it.Several months pass and James asks a large black prisoner by the name of Sebastian to bend his shackles with a sledgehammer, while they're working on the railroad tracks. That night, James successfully pulls the shackles off. Bomber gives him $7 (almost $100 in 2013 dollars) and wishes him luck.That Monday, James asks the guard permission to \"get out here\", to use the bathroom. He takes his shackles off and makes a run for it. The guards gather up the bloodhounds and follow his trail. James conveniently finds a house with clothes on a clothesline to put on and take off his prison clothes to lose the dogs scent. He hides in a pond using a reed to breathe and is just inches away from a guard searching for him before the guard turns back.James successfully makes it to Stanton. A brief nighttime scene is seen of Atlanta's Forsyth Street with the Rialto Theater and Dixie Hotel. James is walking the streets cautiously and enters a men's clothing store for a suit and hat. Then he goes to a barber shop for a shave. A police officer enters and tells the barber there was a breakout on the chain gang. James leaves the barber shop without the police noticing him. Then he goes to a hotel to see his former fellow prisoner Barney, who has been free for the past several months. He is allegedly running a prostitution ring and offers James a comfortable bedroom, booze, and a nice lady for the night.The next day, James is enjoying a hamburger and soda at a stand near the train station. The Chief of Police makes a trip to search for him. Just as he is about to get on the train, the police are supposedly trying to catch him, but instead capture a bum nearby. As soon as he gets on the train, the porter asks for his ticket inquiring why he didn't see him and that there was an escaped prisoner search, but they didn't find him. Allegedly, the porter and another porter secretly converse that James could be the escaped prisoner, but they leave the room and nothing happens.James stops somewhere in Tennessee or Kentucky, then travels by vehicle and foot to Chicago. He applies for a menial job as a laborer at Tri State Construction, starting off at $4 a day as Allen James. After two years as a laborer, he is promoted to foreman at $7 a day.James goes to find a place for rent from a boarder, a flirtatious blonde lady by the name of Marie Woods, who is asking for $25 a month, but she lowers it to $20 and he accepts. Little does James know Marie is a scheming, manipulative sociopath that is about to make his life a living hell.James is spending his nights at home studying engineering and resisting Marie's advances. After 5 years with Tri State Construction company and promoted to Assistant Superintendent, James is about to leave the boardinghouse and tells Marie he doesn't love her, but she shows him a letter his brother wrote to him about his life on the chain gang. She promises she will never tell anybody his secret as long as he marries her.James has made well at his job pleasing his superiors with his project for building a bridge and made his way up to field superintendent. But despite that, Marie is spending all his money on booze, lavish dinners, men, and leaving the house a mess.James' boss invites his to a party dinner at the Club Chateau and he falls in love with a woman named Helen, who also likes him, but finds him a little strange and troubled.It is now 1930 and the beginning of the Great Depression. James has confessed to Marie he's in love with another woman and she continues to be a spendthrift and leave the house a mess. He wants an amicable divorce, but she refuses knowing she would lose all she has, even though he offers her what she wants. He loses it and tells her his life with her is just as bad as the chain gang and she storms out the door leaving him.The next day while at work and receiving an invitation to speak at a banquet, a detective barges in to James' office arresting him. Newspapers are on the screen about a fine citizen that has made good in Chicago being a wanted fugitive.While in jail, Allen has spoken to reporters about his life on a southern chain gang and swears by it. Chicago officials have refused his extradition back to the prison.The Chicago DA and Allen's lawyer, along with a shady Southern representative, are all in an office with the representative promising a pardon to Allen in 90 days if he voluntarily goes back to serve in a clerical job. His lawyer does not recommend it, but his girlfriend Helen says he should do it to clear his name. Allen decides to go back and the representative assures him it is a good decision he won't regret.Allen goes back to Stanton and his lawyer Ramsey is paid over $2,500 up front and tells Allen that the clerical job may not happen because of the criticism Allen made to the press about the chain gangs. The assurance of the pardon seems to be fading as wellAllen has been assigned to the Tuttle County prison camp. It turns out no promises have been kept for him and that the camp he is assigned to this time is even more harsh than the first one he was at. His old pal, Bomber Wells from the first prison, has been assigned to this one because of attempted assault on a guard at the first one. He and other fellow prisoners assure Allen there is no such thing as a pardon, but Allen remains somewhat hopeful. The next day, he and the prisoners are swinging sledgehammers with a fellow black prisoner singing \"Raise Them High\" to make the day more bearableAfter three months, the prison chairman, Lawyer Ramsey, Allen's brother, and three prison commission board members are present at a hearing about releasing Allen. Allen's brother weakly testifies he has made good despite his past, his lawyer says he's paid his part of the bargain and voluntarily returned to have his sentence commuted, but the chairman insists that the chain gang is a good character builder, crime must be punished, and that Allen made unwarranted and untrue attacks against the chain gang system. During the testimonies from Ramsey, Allen, and the chairman, all three prison commission board members sit with a glare of cold indifference on their face, making it evident they already had their minds made up before the hearing.The Reverend Allen visits James in his prison declaring the bad news he was rejected for release. Allen realizes he was lied to and that they just want revenge, but the Reverend tells him if he will be a model prisoner for nine more months, they will release him and be forced to through support of his fans.Allen perseveres and serves out his nine months. Lawyer Ramsey and the prison chairman meet with the three board members once again. Ramsey said Allen has served as a model prisoner and had letters from prominent officials and the three board members still sit with the same glare of cold indifference they did at the first hearing.Allen is in his bunk that night and by this time has grayed hair. and notified by the warden that the decision is suspended indefinitely and that he will have to serve the remainder of his sentence. Allen is beyond pained and crushed.Some time later, Allen dupes a dump truck driver at a quarry that there is a broken spring. He and Bomber hijack the truck and make a run for it. With a police car chasing them and a number of guards shooting at the truck, they use some dynamite in the truck to explode near one of the hills and slow down or stop the police car. Bomber is shot and falls out of the truck. Afterwards, Allen cuts his shackles off, then lights a bunch of dynamite and throws it at a bridge to keep the police from chasing him any further.Once again newspaper headlines flood the screen about Allen's second escape and being a hunted fugitive with the final one noting that it's been a year since his disappearance.One night, Helen pulls up in her garage and Allen calls out for her. He is now a broken and destitute man that is constantly moving from place to place and deprived of sleep just to avoid being found. Helen wants him to stay, but he insists he's still on the run and can't. He confesses he steals just to survive.", "output": "Question: Sergeant James Allen war experience made him what ?, Answer: restless, Question: How did Sergeant James Allen family react to his chosen career ?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: what is allen reply to helen questions?, Answer: \"I steal\", Question: who is the proprietor of his boardinghouse?, Answer: Marie Woods, Question: What was Sergeant James Allen desired career in civlian life ?, Answer: To build things., Question: How many years was Sergeant James Allen sentenced to on a brutal Southern chain gang ?, Answer: 10 years, Question: where he makes his way to ?, Answer: Chicago, Question: What did Sergeant James Allen return to after World War I ?, Answer: New York City, Question: who visits helen?, Answer: Allen, Question: Who plays Sergeant James Allen in the movie ?, Answer: <No Answer>", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

While driving, Ray becomes distracted, hitting a pedestrian. Another teenager, Max, stops nearby. Julie convinces him everything's okay; he drives off. The group decides to dispose of the body. At the docks the man revives, attacking them before falling into the water.A year later in 1997, Julie's home from college for the summer. She receives a letter stating, \"I know what you did last summer.\" She tells Barry and Helen about the note. Barry suspects Max. The trio go to the docks where Max works as a fisherman. Barry threatens Max with a hook. Julie discovers that Ray works there; he tries reconciling with Julie. Max is killed by a figure in a rain slicker wielding a hook. Barry discovers a note in his gym locker containing a picture of his car and the message, \"I know.\" Going outside, Barry is almost run over by the slicker-wearing figure, driving Barry's car.Julie reveals that the person they hit was David Egan. Ray still suspects Max. Julie and Helen think the killer may be a relative. They head out to the Egan's home. They find David's sister Missy, who explains that David's death devastated their family. Missy tells them that \"Billy Blue\" paid his respects after David died, claiming to be his friend.That night Helen prepares for the Fourth of July parade. Max's killer sneaks into her house, cuts off her hair and writes, \"Soon,\" in lipstick on her mirror. As Julie goes to Helen's house, she finds Max's corpse in her trunk. When she goes to show the others, the body's missing, causing Barry to think she hallucinated. Julie, Helen, and Barry confront Ray about recent events. Ray claims that he received a similar letter.As Helen and Barry participate in the Fourth of July parade, Barry notices people wearing the same kind of slicker. Chasing one, Barry leaves Helen on one of the parade floats. As it passes by a building, she notices a shadowy figure in a slicker wielding a hook threateningly.Julie revisits Missy. Missy tells Julie that David left a suicide note. As the writing matches that of the note she received, Julie tries convincing Missy that it's not a suicide note but a threat. Missy orders her to leave. At the annual Croaker Pageant, Barry is killed while watching from a balcony. Helen rushes to the balcony with a police officer and finds no sign of the killer or Barry. The officer offers to drive Helen home.Julie researches David Egan's death. A year before the accident, he and his girlfriend Susie were in a car crash near the scene of the foursome's accident. David survived, but Susie died. The research now mentions Susie's father, Ben Willis. Julie believes they ran over Ben, who killed David. While driving home, Helen and the officer are stopped by a stalled truck. The officer is killed by a dark figure with a hook. Helen rushes to her family's store, where her sister Elsa lets her in. The killer enters through a side door and kills Elsa. Helen manages to evade the killer by making it to the second floor and jumping out the window, but she is eventually killed, too.Julie goes to the docks to tell Ray her theory but is disbelieved. She notices the name of the boat he's working on: Billy Blue. Julie runs off, mistakenly believing Ray is the murderer. Ray pursues, but a fisherman stops him and puts Julie on his boat. Looking around, she finds a room containing photos and articles about her. Julie realizes she's on Ben Willis's boat. Ben sets the boat adrift. Ray catches up to Ben's boat with a motorboat. He uses the rigging to cause Ben to lose his hook-carrying hand as he plummets over the side. All that's found of Ben is the severed hand with the hook. When the police question Julie and Ray, they deny knowing why Ben attempted to kill them.A year later in 1998, Julie is two weeks away from returning home to see Ray. As she enters the showers at school, she notices one of the steamy glass doors has the sentence \"I still know\" written on it.

Her father, Philippe Renaldi (who had divorced her mother years ago but still kept in touch with Mia) died two months earlier in a car crash. Although Mia is an average student, she is very unpopular, but has two good friends: Lilly Moscovitz (Heather Matarazzo) and Lilly's brother Michael Moscovitz (Robert Schwartzman).Shortly before Mia's sixteenth birthday, she learns her paternal grandmother is visiting from Genovia, a small European country. Mia meets her grandmother, Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews), at the Genovian consulate for the first time in her life. Clarisse explains that the reason she wanted to see her was because of a \"life-changing\" problem. Mia learns that her father was the crown prince of Genovia and, due to his death, she is now the next in line and the only heir to the Genovian throne. She is shocked to learn that she is a princess and at first rejects the whole idea.Mia's mother and grandmother convince her to attend \"princess lessons\" in preparation for her introduction to the Genovian government at the upcoming State Dinner, under supervision from her new bodyguard, the head of Genovian security, Joseph \"Joe\" (H\u00e9ctor Elizondo). To look more presentable to the Genovian government, Mia receives a makeover from Italian hairdresser Paolo (Larry Miller). All of this is to be kept secret until Genovia's Independence Day Ball to avoid a media frenzy.However, the San Francisco Chronicle learns that Mia is the Genovian crown princess after Paolo breaks his confidentiality agreement. Although thoroughly annoyed, Clarisse presses onward and prepares for the State Dinner. Mia attends and is publicly humiliated via her klutziness.The day after the State Dinner, Mia agrees to appear on Lilly's public-access television program Shut Up and Listen and to watch Michael's band perform at a venue that Saturday night. Mia is almost 16 so she is almost able to drive a car, (her \"baby\", a vintage Ford Mustang.) She takes a test drive with her grandmother and they go to an arcade. Mia asks her grandmother if her father wanted to be prince, to which she replies yes, but adds that he thought of abdicating only once when he fell in love with Mia's mother. However, he realized his love for his country was greater.While driving back to the Genovian consulate, Mia's car fails on a hill and rams into a trolley loaded with people. No one is hurt, but the police are called. To save Mia a trip to the police station (she was driving without a license), Clarisse names the police man and trolley master to the Genovian Order of the Rose (a fictional honor made up on the spot). The men are so flattered that Clarisse and Mia are given a ride back to the consulate in a police car.Josh, a cute boy on whom Mia has a crush, asks Mia to go with him to the school's annual beach party. She excitedly agrees. Michael and Lilly are both hurt when Mia blows them off for the popular kids. Mia's mother wisely points out Josh never liked her before all this princess business. Mia ignores this observation.The beach party goes well at first, but spirals out of control when the media learns of Mia's presence. Josh uses her to get his fifteen minutes of fame by publicly kissing Mia and three jealous popular girls embarrass Mia in front of the paparazzi, resulting in photos of her in only a towel.The unflattering photos wind up on tabloid covers and this displeases Clarisse. Then, Clarisse tells Mia that she could still go to the ball and invite her friends, except Josh. Joe, however, reminds Clarisse that although Mia is a princess, she is still a teenager and Clarisse's granddaughter. To reconstruct her friendships with Lilly and Michael, Mia apologizes and invites them to the Genovian Independence Day Ball, where she must reveal whether or not she wants to accept her duties as a princess.Upon learning she must personally and publicly renounce her throne, the terrified Mia plans to run away. She is stopped when she finds a sixteenth birthday gift (the titular diary) and a letter from her father written before his death. Touched by his words, she changes her mind and makes her way to the ball. Her car breaks down on the way, but she is saved by Joe, who arrives with a limo (having suspected her runaway plans).When they arrive, Mia makes a speech announcing her acceptance of the Genovian throne. She shares her first dance with Michael, who then takes her outside to the palace garden where they kiss. Clarisse and Joe are seen holding hands, signifying the start of a relationship. The last scene shows Mia on the plane with Joe and her cat. Mia is writing in her diary, explaining that she is moving to Genovia, her mother is moving with her, and Lily and Michael will visit her during the summer.

Wade is the sheriff of Lawford, a small New Hampshire town, and knows everyone in town. Wade is divorced from his wife, and Jill doesn't want to be at the party. Wade runs into his friend Jack (Jim True-Frost), who's planning to take hunting party out the following day.The next day, Jack tries to bolster his hunting guest's (Sean McCann) confidence while Jack appears a bit shaken from his daughter's rebellion. Wade also operates the town snow plow, and hears about a hunting accident with Jack and his guest Twombley. Wade and Gordon LaRiviere (Holmes Osborne) head to the woods and hear that Twombley was shot dead. Gordon wants to keep a lid on the accident, but Wade starts asking questions.Wade finds out that Twombley was scheduled to testify against organized crime. He talks to his brother Rolfe and says he's getting a divorce lawyer and may start to \"bite back\". He serves a traffic violation to Mel Gordon, who's Trombley's son-in-law, who threatens to get Wade fired. Wade continues to probe for the truth. Wade spends time with Margie Fogg (Sissy Spacek), and wants to marry her. He tests his theories to her, but she thinks he's crazy.Through various flashbacks, we learn that Wade and Rolfe's father Glen (James Coburn) was an abusive drunk. Wade takes Margie to see his folks. His father is still a drunk, and his mother (Joanna Noyes) is dead. Rolfe breaks the news to his sister Lena (Martha-Marie Kleinhans), and the remaining family gathers together. Glen lashes out at his sons and daughter in grief, and Wade threatens him. Wade and his ex-wife Lillian (Mary Beth Hurt) have a tense discussion at the funeral.Rolfe and Wade talk about the murder, and Rolfe thinks Mel (the victim's son-in-law) organized the hit to keep potential illicit affairs from becoming public. Jack covered it up so as not to lose his hunting license.Mel Gordon talks to Wade's boss, and Wade reviews his custody case with his lawyer (Eugene Lipinski). Afterwards, Wade's boss offers him a new car and tries to keep Wade from prosecuting Mel. Wade now believes Gordon is in cahoots with Mel and Jack. Later, Wade follows Jack in his car and confronts him. Jack pulls out a rifle and shoots Wade's tires.Wade returns to Margie's diner, where she's babysitting Glen. Glen is belligerent, and they fight. He calls Rolfe and describes his latest theory. Wade goes to Alma Pittman (Marian Seldes), who explains that Glen's land and the area around it is being bought by Gordon and Mel. Wade confronts Gordon and Jack in Gordon's office, then storms out, fired by Gordon. Rolfe's advice is to take care of small things, like his recurring toothache and broken transmission. Glen and Margie argue, and Wade finally pulls his tooth with pliers.Wade picks up Jill for visitation, and Lillian is angry about the lawyer. Jill doesn't want to spend time with Wade, and he gets angry. His world is falling apart. Margie leaves him, and Wade strikes Jill. After they leave, Glen and Wade fight, and Wade clubs Glen, killing him. Numbly, Wade douses Glen in gasoline and sets him and the garage on fire. He walks into the kitchen, pours himself a drink, and watches it burn.Rolfe narrates the end of the story. Wade kills Jack, thinking his theories were correct.

Evan prays to God (Morgan Freeman) to give him this opportunity. His wife, Joan (Lauren Graham), also prays that she, Evan, and their three sons (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips, and Johnny Simmons) will be closer together as a family. On the first day of his job at Congress, Evan is given a prime office space, where he is accompanied by his three congressional staffers, Rita, Marty, and Eugene (Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, and Jonah Hill), and invited to junior co-sponsor the Public Land Act bill with his greedy boss, Chuck Long (John Goodman). Soon after Evan's election to Congress, six strange things start to happen around him:The number 614 starts to appear everywhere he goes (i.e. alarm clock, government license plate, Rita's phone extension)Ancient tools and gopher wood are delivered to his house that he actually did not order.A man claiming to be the Genesis God appears everywhere he goes.Pairs of animals simply follow Evan without any apparent reason (with birds even flying into his office through the window).Evan grows a beard no matter how many times he shaves.Eight vacant lots in Prestige Crest are purchased in his name.Evan soon learns that 614 refers to the verse in the Book of Genesis,[3] where God originally instructs Noah to build an Ark in preparation for a flood. God later repeatedly appears in various guises before finally revealing himself to Evan, and cordially insisting that he should also build an Ark as well. God explains to Evan that a flood is coming, and that the only opportunity Evan will have to change the world is by saving his community instead. God also tells Evan to inform others about the flood should they ask him later. Concerned about Evan's behaviour, Joan initially believes that he is having a mid-life crisis. Evan begins constructing the Ark with his sons, who start to admire him as he is spending more time with them.Animals eventually follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, he allows Evan latitude at first, but warns him that he will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the Ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells him that the flood will likely come at midday on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new looks and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and she is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but soon realizes that God will not allow him to take it off and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe midway during the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, but Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is suspended from Congress and removed from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him suspended from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the Ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he is going insane.Evan decides to build the Ark alone, gaining media attention and public ridicule, as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs. Meanwhile, God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner. God listens to Joan as she expresses concern that Evan is only losing his sanity and allowing himself to become a laughing stock, though claiming that \"God told him to do it\". Sympathetic toward Evan, God tells Joan that perhaps it is an only opportunity for them, and explains that he does not give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as one of these things. Seeing God's meaning, Joan returns to Evan with new-found faith and continue helping him finish the Ark together in order to prepare for the flood. Meanwhile, Evan overhears from his staffers that Long has commissioned a dam and has cut corners in doing so, and that he will most likely do the same thing with his Public Land Act bill.On September 22, Evan loads hundreds of animals onto the Ark in front of hundreds of spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the Ark, since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. Minutes pass with no sign of rain, and while a heavy rainstorm does come, it passes within moments, leaving Evan himself humiliated. However, Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had already told him, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake is preparing to burst. Evan warns to those present must board the Ark, and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered shortly after the dam burst. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the Ark later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The Ark reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.After Congress suspends the Public Land Act bill to investigate Long's profiteering ethics, and the animals return to their natural habitats, Evan is finally reinstated as a congressman, and celebrates this event by shaving his beard, changing back into his regular clothes, and going on a long-promised hiking trip. When God reappears once again during the hike, Evan is initially disappointed in which he realizes he never needed to build the Ark since the flood had only happened because of Long's defective dam. However, God reassures Evan that he now has a perfect life as well as everything that he had originally prayed for, and that this would not have happened otherwise. Evan is happy to realize this, and God informs him that the right way to change the world is by doing one Act of Random Kindness (ARK) at a time. During the film's closing credits, God issues a new commandment to the outgoing audience: \"Thou shalt do the dance\". This is later followed by a footage of the film's cast and crew members dancing to C+C Music Factory's hit song \"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\".", "output": "Question: What does God appear to Joan as?, Answer: God appears to Joan as a waiter in a diner., Question: where was the famly from?, Answer: Buffalo, New York, Question: What does ARK stand for?, Answer: ARK stands for Acts of Random Kindness., Question: when did it happen?, Answer: September 22, Question: Where does Joan take her sons?, Answer: Joan took her sons back to Buffalo, New York., Question: Who commissioned the dam?, Answer: Congressman Long is the one who commissioned the dam., Question: Where does the Ark land?, Answer: The Ark lands in front of the capital., Question: What animals poop on Chuck?, Answer: Birds, Question: what was the name of the tv?, Answer: <No Answer>", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

He also kills Thad's editor, agent, and his agent's ex-wife, and kills a man named Fred Clawson, who was trying to blackmail Thad for being a con artist that should not have written books under a false name.When the police suspect Thad of murdering Gamache, he tries to convince Sheriff Alan Pangborn of Castle Rock, Maine he had nothing to do with it. After putting an all-points bulletin on Clawson, who was accused of the death of Homer, the New York police find him castrated and his throat slit. They find a message on the wall, written in Clawson's blood, \"The sparrows are flying again.\" Thad starts to think that he may have a psychic connection to the killer.While in his office, Thad begins to receive messages from Stark, and begins to worry about the next victim. He and his family start to receive threatening phone calls from Stark. Pangborn initially suspects the phone calls are a prank by Thad until Stark begins to describe how he is going to kill Thad's family, disturbing Pangborn.State Police find Homer's truck with Thad's fingerprints all over it. For some reason, Stark wants to live after he appeared in a set of Beaumont's best selling books. Beaumont writes, but he is not alone in suspecting something strange: Sheriff Pangborn is equally suspicious and continues investigating. Thad begins to realize that Stark is, in fact, his twin brother who died at \"child birth.\"His mother never told him about the twin, until a local doctor tells him that Stark is a fraternal twin that was living inside Thad's brain. (A scene in the film's start shows a developing fetus inside Beaumont's brain). Stark arrives, kills the doctor, and blames Thad for the crime. A local friend realizes that Stark is an entity controlled by the books that Thad wrote, and that he will do anything he can to stop him. Stark kidnaps Thad's wife Liz and his children, and makes a deal with Thad: Finishing a book that has Stark living in the real world, or he will kill his family.While writing the book, Thad notices Stark is healing himself with his own writings. Thad and Stark get into a fight, which ends with Thad stabbing Stark in the neck with a pencil. Thinking that it is over, Stark decides to kill Thad's children instead. Sheriff Pangborn arrives and unties Liz, who says that Thad and Stark are upstairs. However, a huge flock of sparrows comes and tears Stark apart, and take him back to hell where he belongs. The sparrows are agents of Satan, that come to collect evil souls that were not allowed to live. Thad and Liz are spared, and they along with Pangborn, watch as the sparrows disappear into the night.", "output": "Question: Where is Thad when he starts to receive messages from Stark?, Answer: his office, Question: Who is accused of the death of Homer?, Answer: Clawson., Question: what do the police find on homer's truck?, Answer: thad's fingerprints, Question: What is Thad Beaumont's profession?, Answer: Author, Question: What are the sparrows?, Answer: Agents of Satan, Question: who received messages from stark?, Answer: Thad, Question: Who does Stark describe killing?, Answer: Thad's family, Question: How does Stark heal himself?, Answer: with his own writings, Question: Where does Liz say to Sheriff Pangborn?, Answer: Thad and Stark are upstairs, Question: What is written on the message found on the wall?, Answer: \"The sparrows are flying again.\", Question: What is Stark controlled by?, Answer: Books that Thad wrote, Question: Where does Thad stab Stark?, Answer: The Neck, Question: Whom do the police suspect of murdering Gamache?, Answer: Thad., Question: Who does Stark blame for killing the doctor?, Answer: Thad, Question: what does thad realize?, Answer: stark is his twin, Question: Who stabs Stark in the neck?, Answer: Thad, Question: Who tells Thad about Stark being a fraternal twin?, Answer: A local doctor, Question: Stark is terrorizing whose family?, Answer: Beaumont's., Question: What is the profession of Homer Gamache?, Answer: photographer, Question: What are the sparrows agents of?, Answer: Satan, Question: What did Thad use to stab Stark?, Answer: A pencil, Question: Who has become a physical entity?, Answer: Stark., Question: What does Thad stab Stark with?, Answer: A pencil, Question: Who was trying to blackmail Thad?, Answer: Fred Clawson., Question: Who do the police suspect of murdering Gamache?, Answer: Thad., Question: WHo wishes to retire the Stark name and symbolically buries Stark in a mock grave?, Answer: Thad Beaumont, Question: who suspected that the phone calls are prank?, Answer: pangborn, Question: What is Thad Beaumont's pen name?, Answer: \"George Stark\", Question: What deal does Stark make with Thad?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who do the sparrows work for?, Answer: The sparrows are agents of Satan, Question: Who does Stark kidnap?, Answer: Thad's wife and children, Question: Who is Stark in relation to Thad?, Answer: His twin brother, Question: Who finds Homer's truck?, Answer: state police, Question: Who realizes that Stark is an entity controlled by Thad's books?, Answer: A local friend, Question: Who kills the doctor?, Answer: Stark", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The couple craft themselves a treehouse from their ship's wreckage, but are subsequently killed by Sabor, a rogue leopardess. Kala, a female mountain gorilla who recently lost her own child to Sabor, hears the cries of the orphaned human infant and finds him in the ruined treehouse. Though she is attacked by Sabor, Kala and the baby manage to escape. Kala takes the baby back to the gorilla troop to raise as her own, an act which the leader and her mate, Kerchak, disapproves of but grudgingly lets her proceed with. Kala raises the human child, naming him Tarzan. Though he befriends other gorillas and animals, including a young female gorilla named Terk and the paranoid male elephant Tantor, Tarzan finds himself treated differently because of his different physique, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. As a young man, Tarzan manages to kill Sabor with a crude spear he made, gaining Kerchak's reluctant respect.The gorilla troop's peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of human explorers from England, consisting of Professor Porter, his daughter Jane, and their hunter-guide Clayton. The explorers are looking to study gorillas. Jane accidentally becomes separated from the group and chased by a pack of baboons, and Tarzan saves her. He recognizes that she is the same as he is: a human. Jane leads Tarzan back to the explorers' camp, where Porter and Clayton both take great interest in him \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the former in terms of scientific progress while the latter hopes to have Tarzan lead him to the gorillas so that he can capture them and return with them to England. Despite Kerchak's warnings to be wary of the humans, Tarzan continues to return to the camp, where Porter, Clayton, and Jane teach him to speak English as well as what the human world is like. He and Jane begin to fall in love. However, the English explorers have a difficult time convincing Tarzan to lead them to the gorillas, due to Tarzan's fear of Kerchak.The explorers' ship returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan in turn asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says it is unlikely they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him forever if he leads them to the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the party to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to avoid having him attack the humans. Porter and Jane are excited to mingle with the gorillas, but Kerchak returns and when he sees the humans, attacks them. Tarzan is forced to hold Kerchak at bay while the humans escape. Kerchak accuses Tarzan of betraying the troop. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse she found him in, shows him his true past, and tells him that she wants him to be happy whatever he decides. Tarzan puts on a suit that belonged to his father, signifying his decision to go to England.When Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter the next day, they are ambushed by Clayton and his band of stowaway thugs. Clayton hopes to seize the gorillas now that he knows where the nesting grounds are, and locks Tarzan, Jane and Porter away to stop them from interfering. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor, and he returns to the gorillas' nesting grounds. Clayton mortally wounds Kerchak and then engages Tarzan in a fierce battle across the vine-covered trees. Tarzan traps Clayton using vines. Clayton angrily cuts his way free, but inadvertently hangs himself with a vine tangled around his neck. Kerchak, with his dying breath, finally forgives Tarzan names him new leader of the gorilla troop. The rest of the gorillas are freed after scaring away the rest of Clayton's men.The next day, Porter and Jane prepare to leave on the ship while Tarzan stays behind with the gorilla troop.

Robert is livid, both at the news and the method that he found out about the news. There is a second story on the teletype: Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, the famous novelist Paula Wharton (Irene Dunne) (whom Max calls Paulie), is in Hollywood adapting her latest book into a movie screenplay. Max wants to do his duty as a citizen and responsible journalist to be close to the war (World War II). Robert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view is that without Max, the newspaper will fold because Max *is* the newspaper.From Hollywood, Paulie telephones Max and congratulates him on his decision. After Max informs her of the plan of basic training then possibly officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidate school, Paulie decides that she will move to where ever that school is to be close to him.After completion of basic training, Max sends Paulie a telegram that officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidate school is in Tetley Field, Florida. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite understand Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivations, but she wants to see her husband succeed in this passion.Paulie arrives at Palmetto Court looking for bungalow 26D and meets the last tenant, Jan Lupton (Jeff Donnell), whose husband Roy has just graduated to second lieutenant. Jan gives Paulie the lowdown on life in 26D, and that life for the enlisted at Tetley Field is all work, work, work. With school, Jan relays a story she heard where once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re over 21 years of age, your brain doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t absorb the material taught anymore. Max comes by the bungalow surprised to see his wife there already. They have a loving reunion. The Luptons say goodbye to the Whartons, who can now have a proper reunion.Max and Paulie discuss their upcoming life. Paulie wants to be just like all the other army wives living in the complex. With his difficulties in school, Max is concerned if he is doing the right thing for himself, for the country and for the newspaper. But his reason for doing this in the first place was to see the war first hand so that the newspaper could have some credible first hand account.There is a frantic knock on the door. It is the Luptons. The train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been delayed and, after an uncomfortable silence,the Whartons offer the Luptons the bedroom for the night; Paulie will sleep on the sofa in the living room. The Lupton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return will delay the more passionate part of the Wharton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reunion until another time.Robert, the publisher, calls wanting to speak to Max about the newspaper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future, the newspaper which he feels is falling apart. Robert is yelling and screaming how much he needs to make important decisions with Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s input. After Paulie in return yells back that Robert is not to disturb Max during this time (not mentioning Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s troubles in school), she abruptly hangs up on him.Over the next several weeks, both Max and Paulie get ensconced in their new respective lives. Paulie is doing work foreign to her: housework. Max uses whatever free moment he has to cram more and more information into his brain, which he is still finding difficult to do.After a field exercise, a tired Max hops into his bunk. He is approached by a fellow student named Paulson, a reporter with the base\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newspaper, the Tetley Field Sentinel. He wants Max, as the most famous recruit on the base, to write a story about himself for the newspaper. Max is reluctant to do so if only for lack of time, but Paulson leaves him to consider the offer.At the base, Max is called into Colonel Foley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (Charles Evans) office. The Colonel mentions that both his wife and mother-in-law are admirers of Mrs. Wharton and plan on dropping by the bungalow later that afternoon.

SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) finds a blackmail message demanding the city pay him $100,000 whilst also promising that for each day his demand is refused he will commit a murder; his next victim will be \"a Catholic priest or a nigger.\" The chief of police and the mayor (John Vernon) assign the inspector to the case, despite his reputation for violent solutions.While in a local diner, Callahan observes a bank robbery in progress. He goes outside and kills two of the robbers while wounding a third. Callahan then challenges him:I know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking: 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk?After the robber surrenders, he tells Callahan that he must know if the gun was still loaded. Callahan pulls the trigger with the weapon pointed directly at the robber, and laughs as it is revealed to be empty.Scorpio targets a gay black male, but is interrupted by a police helicopter and escapes. Later that night, Callahan and his rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) pursue a likely suspect, but it turns out to be a false alarm. Following that, Callahan successfully halts a suicide attempt, after which he reveals that the origin of his nickname comes from the fact that he is given every dirty job to do.When Scorpio kills a young black boy from another rooftop, the police believe the killer will next pursue a Catholic priest. Callahan and Gonzalez, wait for Scorpio near a Catholic church, where a rooftop-to-rooftop shootout ensues, with Callahan attempting to snipe Scorpio with a rifle while Scorpio returns fire with a submachine gun. Scorpio escapes, killing a police officer disguised as a priest.Scorpio then demands $200,000 ($1.2 million today) for a teenage girl he has kidnapped, threatening to let her suffocate otherwise. The mayor decides to pay and tells Callahan to deliver the money with no tricks, but the inspector wears a covert listening device, brings a switchblade, and has his partner follow him. As Scorpio sends Callahan to various payphones throughout the city to make sure he is alone, the chase ends at Mount Davidson. Scorpio brutally beats Callahan and tells him he's going to kill him and let the girl die anyway; Gonzalez comes to his partner's rescue but is wounded. Callahan stabs Scorpio in the leg, but the killer escapes without the money.The doctor who has treated Scorpio's wound phones the police and tells Callahan and his new partner that he has seen Scorpio in Kezar Stadium. The officers break in and Callahan shoots Scorpio in his wounded leg. When Scorpio refuses to reveal the location of the girl and demands his rights, Callahan makes him confess by standing on the wounded leg, but the police are too late to save her.Because Callahan searched Scorpio's home without a warrant and improperly seized his rifle for evidence, the District Attorney (Josef Sommer) has no choice but to let Scorpio go. Outraged, Callahan warns that Scorpio will kill again and follows him on his own time. To thwart Callahan, Scorpio pays to have himself beaten by a thug, then claims the inspector is responsible. Despite Callahan's protests, he is ordered to stop following Scorpio.After stealing a gun from a liquor store owner, Scorpio kidnaps a school busload of children and demands a $200,000 ransom and a plane to leave the country. The mayor again insists on paying but Callahan angrily refuses when asked to deliver the ransom. Instead he locates the bus and jumps onto the top from a bridge. The bus crashes into a dirt embankment and Scorpio flees into a nearby quarry, where he has a running gun battle with Callahan. Finally Scorpio spots a young boy sitting near a pond and grabs him as a hostage.The inspector feigns surrender, but fires, wounding Scorpio in his left shoulder. The boy runs away and Callahan stands over Scorpio, gun drawn, reprising his \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\" speech. Scorpio lunges for his gun and Callahan shoots him instantly, causing him to fall into the water.

His position at work is tenuous as he departs for London to attend his daughter Susan's wedding. Upon arrival at Heathrow Airport, he encounters Kate Walker, a single Londoner who collects statistics from passengers as they pass through the terminals. Tired and anxious to get to his hotel, Harvey brusquely dismisses her when she approaches him to ask questions.Harvey is upset to discover his ex-wife Jean rented a house to accommodate family and friends from the States but failed to include him. At the rehearsal dinner on the night preceding the wedding, it becomes increasingly clear Harvey is systematically being excluded from the clan around his ex-wife's new husband Brian and is treated as a mere guest. They fake their politeness towards him and make him feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. When Harvey tells Susan, with whom he has shared a strained relationship since his divorce, that he will be attending the ceremony but not the subsequent reception because he needs to return to the States for an important meeting, she informs him she has asked her stepfather Brian to give her away.Meanwhile, Kate is on a blind date that is not going well. When she returns to the table after taking yet another call from her neurotic mother Maggie, who is certain her Polish neighbor is burying bodies in a shed in his yard, she discovers her date has invited friends to join them. Feeling unwanted and excluded from the conversation, she eventually excuses herself and goes home.The following morning Harvey attends the wedding but quickly leaves for the airport without congratulating the married couple. But due to heavy traffic delays he misses his flight at Heathrow. When he calls his boss Marvin to advise him he will be returning a day later than planned, he is fired. Determined to drown his sorrows, Harvey goes to an airport bar and sees Kate. Recognizing her from the day before, he apologizes for his rude behavior. She initially resists the attention he is paying her but soon they're both glad to finally have an honest conversation about what they're feeling and thinking.Harvey follows Kate to the Heathrow Express and, upon arrival at Paddington station, asks if he can walk her to her writing class on the South Bank. She accepts his offer and is pleased when he offers to meet her after class. As they stroll along the River Thames, Harvey mentions he is missing Susan's wedding reception, and Kate urges him to go. He finally relents, but only if she will accompany him. When Kate insists she is not properly dressed for such an occasion, Harvey buys her a dress and the two head to the Grosvenor House Hotel, where they are welcomed coolly by Susan and get two places at the children's table. When the father of the bride is called upon to make a toast, Brian rises and begins to speak until Harvey interrupts. He then delivers an eloquent speech that redeems him with his daughter and endears him to Kate.Immediately following the first dance of the bride and groom, the groom calls Harvey up to dance with his daughter for the Father-Daughter Dance. He happily does so, and then all the guests join them on the floor for the rumba, tango and other dances, with Harvey enjoying himself on the dance floor, alone. Kate is left at the table, once again in the same position as when she was on her blind date. Her smile becomes more strained as she looks about and sees herself alone at the table in a room of strangers for several dances, Harvey having apparently forgotten she was there. When she surmises he will not be coming to ask her to dance, her smile disappears and she quietly leaves the room and stands in front of the elevator, preparing to leave.Harvey, now looking for Kate, goes into the corridor and seeing her waiting for the elevator, he disappears into a side annex with a piano and begins to softly play one of his own jazz compositions for her. She hears the music and follows it, finding Harvey smiling and waiting for her. He asks her to return to the reception to dance and stay with him. She smiles and agrees.Following the reception, Harvey and Kate walk and talk until dawn. They exchange a single, gentle kiss and agree to meet at noon. At his hotel, Harvey experiences serious heart palpitations and is rushed to the hospital, where he receives a call from Marvin who, having discovered his employee is more indispensable than he thought, urges him to return to work as soon as possible. Harvey decides he prefers to remain in London and explore the possibility of a relationship with Kate. He tracks her down at her writing class and reveals why he missed their rendezvous. Overcautious about romance because of so many past disappointments, Kate initially resists his suggestion that they see what the future might bring them, but finally agrees to give things a chance.As they slowly stroll away, Harvey invites Kate to ask him the questions she would have asked him at the airport terminal, and this time, he happily answers, telling her his place of residence \"...is in transition.\"", "output": "Question: Who is Harvey's employer?, Answer: Marvin, Question: Where are Harvey and Kate sat at the reception?, Answer: Children's table., Question: Who was left at the table?, Answer: Kate, Question: Where is Harvey's place of residence?, Answer: is in transition, Question: What is Kate's mother's name?, Answer: Maggie, Question: What does Harvey buy Kate?, Answer: A dress, Question: Is Kate's blind date going well?, Answer: no, Question: What station does Harvey arrive at?, Answer: Paddington, Question: What happens when he calls work?, Answer: He is fired., Question: Harvey asks Kate to do what back at the reception?, Answer: dance, Question: Where does Harvey remain to pursue Kate?, Answer: London, Question: Who departs for London to attend his daughter Susan's wedding?, Answer: Harvey Shine, Question: Who rented a house to accommodate family and friends from the States?, Answer: Jean, Question: Who has Harvey had a strained relationship with since the divorce?, Answer: Susan, Question: Who has heart palpitations and is rushed to the hospital?, Answer: Harvey, Question: When did Kate's smile disappear?, Answer: When she surmises Harvey will not be coming to ask her to dance., Question: Whom did the groom call to dance with his daughter?, Answer: Harvey, Question: Where is Harvey trying to catch a flight to?, Answer: Heathrow, Question: Who writes jingles for television commercials?, Answer: Harvey Shine, Question: Who is Jean's new husband?, Answer: Brian, Question: Who was Harvey looking for?, Answer: Kate, Question: Who does he run into at the airport bar?, Answer: Kate", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The economy of the town is mostly agricultural, and the town is surrounded by vast cornfields. One particular year the corn crop fails and the people of Gatlin turn to prayer in an attempt to ensure a successful harvest. A mysterious boy preacher, Isaac Chroner (John Franklin), arrives and takes all the children of Gatlin into a cornfield to speak to them about the prophecies of a demonic version of the Judeo-Christian God called \"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\". Isaac, through his lieutenant Malachai (Courtney Gains), leads the children of the town in a revolution, brutally killing all of the adults in the town. Over the ensuing years, the children take any adults passing through as sacrifices.Three years later, Burt (Peter Horton) and his girlfriend Vicky (Linda Hamilton) pass through Nebraska while driving cross-country to Burt's new job as a physician in Seattle, Washington. They are traveling in their car and hit a small boy out on the highway. This boy was one of the Gatlin children who tried to escape the iron hand of the death cult. The couple place his body in the trunk. They encounter an old mechanic, who is little to no help, as the children of Gatlin have employed him to lead all adults passing through to the town, but they betray him and kill him anyway. Burt and Vicky finally end up in Gatlin, after searching for several hours for a phone.A struggle ensues between the couple, \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\" and the children as the couple are violently chased through the city. Burt and Vicky rescue Job and his little sister Sarah, who do not wish to be part of the cult. Vicky is captured by Malachai, and she is prepared as a sacrifice before they track down and capture Burt and the children.Meanwhile, Malachai and the others have grown tired of Isaac's arrogance. Assuming command over the children, Malachai orders Isaac to be sacrificed in Vicky's place. Night soon falls and Burt enters the cornfield to rescue Vicky. The sacrifice soon begins and Isaac is devoured by He Who Walks Behind The Rows. Burt arrives and battles Malachai, convincing the children that their minds have been poisoned and their humanity sacrificed in the name of their false god. As Malachai tries to regain control of the children, Isaac's re-animated corpse (apparently possessed by He Who Walks Behind The Rows) appears and kills Malachai, breaking his neck.Soon, a terrible storm gathers over the cornfield and Burt and Vicky gather the children inside a barn to shield them from He Who Walks Behind The Rows' angry wrath. As the storm intensifies all around them, Job shows a Bible verse to Burt and Vicky that indicates that they must destroy the cornfield for the chaos to cease (it is revealed that \"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\" is really a demon). While filling the irrigation pumps with gasohol fuel, He Who Walks Behind The Rows lashes out at Burt, preparing to destroy the barn. However, Burt is able to spray the fields with the flammable liquid and lights a Molotov cocktail, tossing it into the field, burning it and seemingly destroying the demon.Burt, Vicky, Job and Sarah survive and are able to leave Gatlin as the cornfields burn. As Burt grabs the map they used to get there, a teenage girl who is a member of the cult jumps out at him from the back seat and attempts to stab him. Vicky knocks her out with the passenger door, and the four walk off into the distance to parts unknown", "output": "Question: what did the people of Gatlin turn to pray?, Answer: They prayed to ensure a successful harvest., Question: Who does the re-animated corpse kill?, Answer: Malachai, Question: What does Burt use to catch the cornfield on fire?, Answer: A Molotov cocktail, Question: What Isaac Chroner talks to the children?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: what did he teaches the children?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: WHAT DOES THE STORY TELL US?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Where do Burt and Vicky gather the children?, Answer: A barn, Question: Job shows what to Burt and Vicky?, Answer: A bible verse, Question: Does Sarah want to be part of the cult?, Answer: No, Question: How was the town?, Answer: The town is mostly agricultural, and the town is surrounded by vast cornfields., Question: what happened when Burtand his girlfriend Vicky (Linda Hamilton) pass through Nebraska while driving crossing the country?  untrY?, Answer: Hit a small boy out on the highway., Question: Who captures Vicky?, Answer: Malachai", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

He tells a young Mathayus not to join the Black Scorpions, the best warriors of the Emperor of Akkad, but Mathayus ignores him and goes to the games used to recruit boys to join the sacred Black Scorpions. During the games Mathayus encounters his childhood friend Layla, who desires to fight in battle like the men. Sargon, commander of the army, overhears their conversation and detains Layla. Mathayus gets detained as well after attacking Sargon. Sargon is about to execute Mathayus when his father rescues him, but he gets attacked by Sargon. The battle ends with Emperor Hammurabi forgiving them, in return for Mathayus joining the Black Scorpions. This leaves Sargon furious. During the night, Ashur is murdered by Sargon's Scorpion Curse. Mathayus joins the Black Scorpions and vows to be the best fighter because he realizes this is the best way to get vengeance.Years pass and an adult Mathayus is participating in the ceremony to join the Black Scorpions. He has graduated as a master swordsman, the best in his class. During the ceremony they are greeted by the current Emperor, Sargon, who has murdered Hammurabi to seize the throne. During the greeting Sargon recognizes Mathayus and invites him to the palace. That night in the palace, Mathayus declares his loyalty to the Emperor and is rewarded with a night with the emperor's concubines. The next day Mathayus is once again called to the palace, only to find his brother Noa arrested for spreading so-called \"false rumors\" about the emperor. Mathayus devises a plan to escape. However, during their escape Sargon uses his black magic and releases an \"enchanted\" arrow, killing Noa.Mathayus then encounters his friend, Layla. They escape together to Egypt in a boat. During the trip they meet a Greek named Aristophanes(or 'Ari' for short) who becomes their new accomplice. Ari devises a plan to kill the \"cursed\" Sargon, the only way being to go to the underworld and retrieve a magical sword from a legendary hero. To go to the underworld, they must first kill the Minotaur guarding the portal that leads there.Mathayus succeeds in killing the fable monster with the help of several prisoners who were mercenaries that owed a debt to his father. Another one of the them, a Chinese acrobat named Fong, becomes their new accomplice. To get the prisoners to join in the journey, Ari promises that the underworld is filled with riches. They enter the portal to the underworld, which is a great puzzle that only Ari could decipher. The answer to the puzzle was Asha's last words to Mathayus \"Have faith.\" As they're walking through the desert of the underworld, it suddenly turns into a swamp, filled with dead corpses, traps, and fully awakened bodies. In the swamp only Fong, Ari, Mathayus, Layla, and one of the prisoners survive. One of the prisoners is captured by a tree and killed offscreen, and another is killed by an undead creature after reaching for gold and jewelry. Once in the palace of Lady Astarte, the goddess of Love and War, they encounter the Lady, who tries to seduce Mathayus. Layla initiates a fight with Astarte, and during this diversion, Ari and Fong acquire the sword, the group escapes. They pass back through the portal before an hour has passed, avoiding a curse that would turn them into stone, except for the mercenary whose stays too long because his greed causes him to try to get a ruby ring.They go back to Akkad, only to find that Sargon is planning on sacrificing the whole town to Lady Astarte in exchange for the ultimate power, the power of a god. To accomplish this, Sargon imprisons everyone in the town's coliseum and burn them alive. Layla and Fong help by killing the guards and putting out the fire before it reached the townspeople. Mathayus and Ari go to the King's quarters to confront him. Once they encounter him, Mathayus and Sargon fight hand-to-hand, while Ari writes down the details for his epic poem. Mathayus asks for the magical sword but Ari betrays him by throwing the sword to Sargon. Mathayus uses his dagger to break the sword, amazing Sargon. Ari then gives Mathayus the real sword. It was all part of Ari's plan to fool Sargon. Ari then tells Sargon, \"Never trust a Greek.\" Sargon transforms into the monstrous Scorpion King, but after a long battle Mathayus succeeds in killing the monster by impaling him with the sword. Sargon is dead. Astarte confronts Mathayus, and she threatens to kill him, and he tells her he will join her soon enough.The day after, Hammurabi's son is declared the true emperor. Mathayus finally kisses Layla while recovering from his wounds. Layla admits she no longer wishes to lead the life of a soldier and wants to settle down. The movie ends with Ari's narration of how now Mathayus prefers to live a life of adventure and is traveling in the desert, and one day he will come back and become the Scorpion King.

Carol Anne has been told she is living with her aunt and uncle temporarily to attend a unique school for gifted children with emotional problems, though Pat thinks it is because Steven and Diane just wanted Carol Anne out of their house. Pat and Bruce are unaware of the events that the Freeling family had endured in the previous two films, only noting that Steven was involved in a bad land deal. Along with Donna (Lara Flynn Boyle), Bruce's daughter from a previous marriage, they live in the luxury skyscraper (Chicago's 100-story John Hancock Center) of which Bruce is the manager.Carol Anne has been made to discuss her experiences by her teacher/psychiatrist, Dr. Seaton (Richard Fire). Seaton believes her to be delusional; however, the constant discussion has enabled the evil spirit of Rev. Henry Kane (Nathan Davis) to locate Carol Anne and bring him back from the limbo he was sent during his previous encounter with her. Not believing in ghosts, Dr. Seaton has come to the conclusion that Carol Anne is a manipulative child with the ability to perform mass hypnosis, making people believe they were attacked by ghosts. Also during this period, Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein) realizes that Kane has found Carol Anne and travels cross-country to protect her.That night, Kane drains the high rise of heat and takes possession of reflections in mirrors, causing the reflections of people to act independently of their physical counterparts. When Carol Anne is left alone that night, Kane attempts to use the mirrors in her room to capture her, but she escapes with the help of Tangina, who telepathically tells Carol Anne to break the mirror. Donna and her boyfriend, Scott, see a frightened Carol Anne running through the high rise's parking lot, and move to rescue her; however, before they can, all three are taken to the Other Side through a puddle by Kane and his people. By this point, Tangina and Dr. Seaton are both at the high rise, along with Pat and Bruce. Dr. Seaton stubbornly assumes that Carol Anne has staged the entire thing, while Tangina tries to get her back.Scott is seemingly released from the Other Side through a pool in the high rise, and Donna reappears after Tangina is taken by Kane disguised as Carol Anne. Scott is left at his home with his parents. Nobody notices that the symbols on Donna's clothing are reversed from what they were before she was taken. As Dr. Seaton attempts to calm Donna, Bruce sees Carol Anne's reflection in the mirror and chases her while Pat follows. Dr. Seaton is not far behind, and he believes he sees Carol Anne in the elevator. However, after Dr. Seaton approaches the elevator doors, Donna appears behind him and pushes him to his death down the empty elevator shaft. At this point it is revealed that what came back was not Donna, but a reflection of her under Kane's control, which then vanishes back into the mirror with a reflection of Scott at its side.Pat and Bruce struggle to find Carol Anne, but Bruce is captured and eventually Pat is forced to prove her love for Carol Anne in a final face-off against Kane. Tangina manages to convince Kane to go into the light with her. Donna, Bruce, and Carol Anne are returned to Pat.

Arun's parents teach their children through the famous title song \"Zindagi Har Kadam Ek Nayi Jung Hai, Jeet Jayenge Hum, Jeet Jayenge Hum Tu Agar Sang Hai\" which means that life is full of problems at every step and still we will overcome all these if we are together.Arun's father is trapped in a murder case. A famous criminal lawyer G.D. Thakral (Amrish Puri) proves him guilty, and he is sentenced to be hanged by the court. Pleas by Arun's mother fail to convince Thakral to be truthful and spare her husband. Thakral asks her to give evidence for his innocence, to which she sadly quotes \"Jiske paas koi sabut, koi gavanh nahi hote kya we begunah nahin hote\" (\"one who does not have any proof or witness of innocence, are they not innocent?\"). Thakral was adamant to let her husband be hanged. He was hanged as per court's decision. His mother becomes mentally unstable from shock and is sent to a mental institution. Later Advocate Gupta (A.K. Hangal), the lawyer who defended Arun's father, finds out that Thakral had known all along that he was innocent, but only wanted him to be hanged. Arun finds out that Thakral abused the law.Arun's house and all his property is auctioned off by the court. Arun and his sister are not offered help. He grows up with the seeds of revenge in his heart. He becomes a successful defense lawyer and keenly follows every case of Thakral so that some day he can stand up in court against the unbeaten Thakral and beat him.One day Geeta Srivatsav (Meenakshi) comes to him and asks him to fight the case of her sister, Dr. Asha Mathur (Bina) who is accused of killing a patient on duty with her medicine, which she gave from her purse. Arun refuses saying that if she can produce even an iota of evidence of her sister being innocent he will fight for her. Geeta replies coincidentally the same sentence \"Jiske paas koi sabut, koi gavanh nahi hote kya we begunah nahin hote.\" Arun is instantly reminded of his mothers pleadings before Thakral. Geeta storms out of his office, but Arun is convinced to take the case. He meets Asha Mathur in police custody. He learns from her that on that fateful night she got a call from her ward assistant that her patient is in the ICU and needs her. She stops on the way (due to a traffic jam), and she impatiently moves out of car her to ask the reason. Meanwhile somebody replaces the medicine bottle with the look-alike bottle of poison from her purse. On arrival in the hospital, she gives the liquid from that bottle to stabilize the patient. This resulted in the patient's death.It is shown that Asha Mathur's husband, Dr. Dinesh Mathur (Parikshat Sahni), had gone to meet Thakral and had asked him to fight his wife's case. Thakral says no claiming he is very busy at the moment but later tells his assistant that there is no way that this case could be won. Arun meets Dinesh Mathur and informs him that he will fight the case. He asked him about the nature of poison and for how long a person can sustain the poison; he learns that poison if might result in death within 2 to 15 minutes depending on the body resistance.The case begins with the prosecution lawyer recounting the events of that fateful day and telling that the medicine given to the patient was actually poison. Arun defends the case says that the patient did not die of this medicine. To prove himself right he drinks the medicine in court and refutes the claim. The court declares Geeta's sister not guilty. Just after the judgement Dr. Mathur rushes Arun to hospital. It is revealed that the medicine contained poison, and Arun is saved in the nick of time.Geeta calls him on a beach to appreciate his efforts and kindness at the canteen. They fall in love. Thakral's son Vikram Thakral (Javed Jaffrey), a spoilt brat, not knowing anything about Arun, passes bad comments at the couple and teases Geeta, which irritates the couple. Soon things take an ugly turn. He beats Vikram and his friends.Dr. Mathur wants to appreciate and compensate Arun for the risky effort he took to save his wife. He calls him for a get-together in his mansion. Dr. Mathur gives Arun a blank cheque. Arun rejects the offers politely and says he did for his self-satisfaction. He then finds the same piano with the sticker of Bhagwat Geeta of Krishna which his father used to play and was auctioned. His memories are refreshed again and with the emotional request he tells Dr. Mathur that this piano is very significant to him and asks for it. Dr. Mathur very happily gives the piano and asks him the reason for accepting this small fees. He tells the Mathur family his tragic story. He says that his mother was never seen after his fathers death, and he assumes that she is dead.Vikram plans to trap Arun's sister Komal and learns she studies in the same college. He tries to impress her by his charms, dancing skills, and ways of flattering people. The plan works. Komal falls for him and he convinces her to run away with him (so that he can publicly defame Arun by leaving his sister). At the planned moment, when one of Vikram's ex-girlfriends shows up and tells Komal of Vikram's evil intentions. In the ensuing argument, Vikram murders his girlfriend which is witnessed by the Dr. Mathur's family.The Mathurs arrive at Arun's house to narrate the incident. Mrs. Mathur sees a photo of his mother hanging in the wall. She immediately recognizes the face with the patient she is handling for mental disorders. Arun and his sister request them to take to her. In the mental hospital they see their mother. Her memories had stopped on the day of the incident; she feels that their children are eight and five, staying with father. Arun brings her mother to his house and tries to make her come back to normal; she resumes her memory on hearing the song \"Zingadi Har Kadam...\"Arun had been waiting for this moment to take revenge on Thakral. He steps in as the prosecutor against Thakral who is defending his son. The case moves to and fro and, in the end, Arun has the upper hand. Thakral kidnaps Arun's mother and attempts to blackmail him. Arun goes to save his mother and is beaten up by Thakral's goons. Even though injured, Arun fights back. In an attempt to shoot Arun, Thakral shoots his friend's son and is jailed. He is unsuccessful in saving his son, who is given the death penalty.

Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), learns of Michael's escape and gives chase. He follows Michael to a small gas station, where Loomis finds Michael has killed a mechanic for his clothes, along with a clerk. Michael then escapes in a tow truck and causes an explosion, destroying Loomis's car in the process. Loomis is forced to catch a ride to Haddonfield to renew his search for Michael.Meanwhile, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), the daughter of Laurie Strode and Michael's niece, is living in Haddonfield with her foster family, Richard and Darlene Carruthers, and their teenage daughter, Rachel. It is Halloween and Jamie's foster parents are heading out for the night and Rachel (Ellie Cornell) is left to babysit her, causing her to miss her date with her boyfriend Brady (Sasha Jenson). Jamie knows about her uncle Michael, but she is unaware he is the strange man she has been having nightmares about. After school, Rachel takes Jamie to buy ice cream and a Halloween costume. Michael has already arrived in Haddonfield, and nearly attacks Jamie in the store.That night, Rachel takes Jamie trick-or-treating, and Michael goes to the electrical substation and murders a worker by throwing him into live high voltage, plunging the town into darkness. Dr. Loomis arrives in Haddonfield and warns Sheriff Ben Meeker (Beau Starr) that Michael has returned to Haddonfield. Michael singlehandedly takes down a police station and slaughters the police force. A lynch mob is formed by the town's men, including a local bar owner, Earl Ford (Gene Ross), with the agenda to take down Michael. Rachel discovers Brady cheating on her with Sheriff Meeker's daughter Kelly (Kathleen Kinmont), and loses Jamie. After being chased by Michael, Rachel reunites with Jamie.Sheriff Meeker and Dr. Loomis arrive and take the girls to the sheriff's house with Kelly and Brady, and a deputy. They lock and board up the house, and Loomis departs to look for Michael. With Sheriff Meeker in the basement awaiting the arrival of the state police, Michael enters the house quietly and undetected. He kills the deputy off-screen, and then murders Kelly by impaling her with a shotgun. Rachel discovers the bodies and races upstairs to get Jamie, but she is gone. Brady and Rachel realize they are trapped in the house, and Rachel finds Jamie. Michael appears and struggles with Brady before crushing his skull, killing him. Michael then chases Rachel and Jamie up to the attic. They climb through a window onto the roof and Jamie is lowered down safely, but Michael attacks Rachel and knocks her off the roof.Being pursued by Michael, Jamie runs down the street, screaming for help and runs into Dr. Loomis. They take shelter in the school, but Michael appears and throws Loomis through a glass door before chasing Jamie through the school. Jamie trips and falls down a flight of stairs. Before Michael can kill his niece, Rachel appears, alive, and sprays him in the face with a fire extinguisher. The lynch mob and the state police arrive at the school after hearing the alarm. Earl and three men from the mob agree to take Jamie and Rachel over to the next town in a pick-up truck. Michael has hidden on the underside of the truck; he climbs into the bed of the truck and kills the men, including Earl. Rachel is forced to drive, continuously attempting to throw Michael off. She succeeds in doing so and rams him with the truck, sending him flying into a ditch near an abandoned mine. The police, along with Loomis arrive and as Jamie approaches Michael and touches his hand, he rises.

While coaching one of his clients, Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), who is smitten with a client of his investment firm, celebrity Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), Hitch finds himself falling for Sara Melas (Eva Mendes). Sara is a gossip columnist and a major workaholic. While Albert and Allegra's relationship continues to progress, Hitch finds it difficult to initiate a dialogue with Sara, finding that none of his methods are working for catching her, while likewise being impressed with her ability to see through people's attempts to make advances. Throughout the entire process, he keeps his career secret, claiming to be a generic \"consultant\".Hitch meets with Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan), a shallow chauvinist attempting to enlist Hitch to help him land a one-night stand with Casey Sedgewick (Julie Ann Emery), Sara's coworker and best friend. Although Hitch refused to help, Vance misled Sara into believing that he used Hitch's services.After finding out Hitch's true identity, Sara publishes an expos\u00c3\u00a9, causing Allegra and Albert to break up and Hitch's reputation to suffer. At a speed dating cafe that Hitch sneaks into, Sara and Casey confront Hitch and cite Vance as their source. Hitch explains that not only did he refuse to work with him, Vance's personality type is why women protect themselves, but that same protection also unintentionally made establishing genuine relationships difficult enough to create a demand for Hitch's services.Hitch then tries to salvage Albert and Allegra's relationship. He confronts Allegra, and realizes that he doesn't really do anything significant besides giving his clients confidence and allowing them to get the attention of the women, and that most of his customers, particularly Albert, really were successful just being themselves.

(December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Andoheb, the aging High Priest of Arkam (Karnak in the previous films), has summoned Yousef Bey to the Temple of Arkam to pass on the duties of High Priest. Beforehand, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to Bey. Meanwhile, in Mapleton, Massachusetts, Professor Matthew Norman, who had examined one of Kharis' missing bandage pieces during the Mummy's last spree through Mapleton, also explains the legends of the Priests of Arkam and Kharis to his History class who are less than believing. After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey, meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori, a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. However, a strange, clouded feeling in her mind occurs when ever the subject of Egypt is mentioned.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey pledges his devotion before Andoheb explains that during each full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from nine tana leaves. Kharis will sense this and find the leaves wherever they are.The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on a case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing nine tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that. The battered, ragged form of Kharis the Mummy, however, senses the leaves brewing and heads toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and she follows him in a trance-like state. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman, strangles him, and drinks the fluid of the tana leaves. Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to faint. She falls to the ground with a strange birthmark now apparent on her wrist.The next morning, the Sheriff and Coroner discover a strange mold around the dead Professor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a sign they both know to mean that the Mummy stalks Mapleton again. Sheriff Elwood questions Amina, who is dazed, but Tom Hervey arrives and tries to provide an alibi for her. The Sheriff finally dismisses the pair and Tom takes her home.Later, Yousef Bey, who has arrived in Mapleton, calls on Amon-Ra to aid him in his quest and begins to brew the sacred fluid of the tana leaves to summon Kharis. Kharis senses the leaves and heads toward them, murdering a helpless farmer along the way. The Sheriff soon arrives on the scene and organizes a search party.The next day, at the Scripps Museum, Yousef Bey lags behind a tour group viewing the Mummy of Ananka. After closing time, Yousef emerges from a hiding place as Kharis breaks into the museum. Kharis attempts to touch the mummified body, but it disintegrates under the wrapping as his hand approaches. Yousef Bey realizes that Ananka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul has been reincarnated into another form. Kharis is enraged and begins destroying the exhibit, attracting the museum security guard who is mercilessly slaughtered by Kharis.Police Inspector Walgreen and Dr. Ayad from the museum are bewildered as to how Ananka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body has disappeared without disturbing the wrappings. Dr. Ayad matches markings on the tomb to those on a cask of tana leaves and Inspector Walgreen decides to use the leaves to attract and capture Kharis. The plan is to build a pit to confine the creature until a way to deal with him can be found.Amina is still unable to shake the haunted feelings that torture her and Tom, disregarding the Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warnings, asks Amina to elope with him to New York. She agrees and the two make plans to leave early the next morning. Meanwhile, Yousef Bey calls upon Amon Ra to lead him to the new home of Ananka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul and then sends Kharis in that direction to find Ananka.Inspector Walgreen now begins to bait his trap by burning nine tana leaves and Kharis immediately heads toward the Norman home. Amina is awakened by his approach and hypnotically wanders into the yard. Kharis recognizes her as the carrier of Ananka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul and Amina faints as Kharis picks her up and takes her away.The abduction is witnessed by Mrs. Blake, Amina's guardian, who phones Tom to alert him. Tom immediately sets out in pursuit while Mrs. Blake heads to the Norman house and tells her story to Inspector Walgreen, Sheriff Elwood and a large group of volunteers. Kharis arrives at the mill and presents Amina to Yousef Bey. Bey recognizes the birthmark on her wrist as the symbol of the Priests of Arkam. Amina awakens and the Priest informs her that she is, indeed, the reincarnation of Ananka.Yousef Bey now begins to admire Amina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beauty and cannot deny the temptations he feels to keep her alive as his bride. He decides to use the tana leaves to keep her young and beautiful forever which enrages Kharis. Before Yousef Bey can give Amina the fluid, the Mummy knocks the cup away and exacts his vengeance on the Priest, who falls out a window to his death.Tom Hervey now arrives and witnesses the death of the Priest. He rushes up the stairs to the mill but is met by Kharis. A struggle ensues and Tom is quickly overwhelmed. Kharis attempts to escape with Amina and the mob pursues the Mummy and his Princess into the nearby swamps. In Kharis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 arms, Amina/Ananka is now aging rapidly. They are chased deeper and deeper into the swamps and now begin to sink into the bog.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Twenty-year-old Will Hunting (Matt Damon) of South Boston is a self-taught, genius-level intellect, though he works as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and spends his free time drinking with his friends, Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Billy (Cole Hauser) and Morgan (Casey Affleck). When Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg\u00c3\u00a5rd) posts a difficult mathematics problem as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the graduate students and Lambeau himself. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. Lambeau chances upon Will solving the problem but Will flees the scene. That night at a bar, Will meets Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British student about to graduate from Harvard, who plans on attending medical school at Stanford and gives Will her phone number before leaving.The next day as Will and his friends fight a gang at the basketball court, Police arrive and arrest Will. Lambeau visits his court appearance and notices Will's intellect in defending himself. He arranges for him to forgo jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in therapy sessions. Will tentatively agrees, but treats his first few therapists with contempt and mockery. His refusal to open up is met with staunch defiance by the various therapists, who each refuse to deal with Will further. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), his estranged and much more grounded college roommate, who now teaches psychology at Bunker Hill Community College. Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's defense mechanisms, and after a few unproductive sessions, Will begins to open up.Will is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series, after falling in love at first sight. Sean neither regrets his decision, nor does he regret the final years of his marriage, after which his wife died of cancer. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.Lambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the National Security Agency with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar, and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain. When Will refuses to give an honest reply about what he wants to do with his life, Sean shows him the door. Will tells Chuckie he wants to be a laborer for the rest of his life. Chuckie responds that it would be an insult to his friends for Will to waste his potential and that his fondest wish is that Will should leave to pursue something greater.Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault. Sean comforts Will as he cries over twenty years of trauma. Will decides to accept one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau and decides to take a sabbatical to travel the world. When Will's friends present him with a rebuilt Chevrolet Nova for his twenty-first birthday, he decides to pass on his job offers and drive to California to reunite with Skylar. Sometime later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness.

Fox) wife, Debra, dies in a car accident. He abandons his profession, and his unfinished \"dream house\" sits incomplete. Following the accident, Frank gained the power to see ghosts and befriends three: 1970s street gangster Cyrus (Chi McBride), 1950s nerd Stuart (Jim Fyfe), and The Judge (John Astin), a gunslinger from the Old West. The ghosts haunt houses so Frank can then \"exorcise\" them for a fee. Most locals consider him a con man.Soon after Frank cons local health nut Ray Lynskey (Peter Dobson) and his wife Lucy (Trini Alvarado), a physician, Ray dies of a heart attack. Frank discovers there is an entity, appearing as the Grim Reaper, killing people, first marking numbers on their foreheads that only Frank sees. Debra had a similar number when she was found.Frank's ability to foretell the murders puts him under suspicion with the police and FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs), who is convinced Frank is responsible. Frank is arrested for killing newspaper editor Magda Rees-Jones (Elizabeth Hawthorne), who had attacked him in the press.Lucy investigates the murders and becomes a target of the Grim Reaper. She is attacked while visiting Frank in jail; but they escape with the help of Cyrus and Stuart, who are both dissolved in the process. Frank wants to commit suicide to stop the Grim Reaper. Lucy helps Frank have a near-death experience by putting him into hypothermia and using barbiturates to stop his heart. Dammers abducts Lucy, revealing that he had been a victim of Charles Manson and his \"Family\" in 1969.In his ghostly form, Frank confronts the Grim Reaper and discovers that he is the ghost of Johnny Bartlett (Jake Busey), a psychiatric hospital orderly who killed twelve people 32 years earlier, before being captured, convicted, and executed. Newspaper reports reveal that his greatest desire was to become the most prolific serial killer ever, showing pride at killing more than contemporaries like Charles Starkweather. Patricia Bradley (Dee Wallace-Stone), then a teenager, was accused as his accomplice, although she escaped the death penalty due to her underage status. Lucy resuscitates Frank and they visit Patricia. Unknown to them, Patricia is still in love with Bartlett and on friendly, homicidal terms with Bartlett's ghost, and eventually kills her own mother, who had been trying to monitor her daughter's behavior. Lucy and Frank trap Bartlett's spirit in his urn, which Patricia has kept. The pair make for the chapel of the now-abandoned psychiatric hospital hoping to send Bartlett's ghost to Hell.Patricia and Dammers chase them through the ruins. Dammers throws the ashes away, releasing Bartlett's ghost again before Patricia kills him. Bartlett's ghost and Patricia hunt down Frank and Lucy. Frank realizes that Bartlett's ghost, with Patricia's help, was responsible for his wife's death and the number on her brow, and that he is still trying to add to his body count (and infamy) even after his death.Out of bullets, Patricia strangles Frank to death, but Frank in spirit form rips Patricia's spirit from her body, forcing Bartlett to follow them. Bartlett grabs Patricia's ghost, while Frank makes it to Heaven, where he is reunited with Cyrus and Stuart along with his wife Debra. Bartlett and Patricia's spirits claim they will now go back to claim more lives, but the portal to Heaven quickly changes to a demonic looking appearance, and they are both dragged to Hell by a giant worm-like creature. Frank learns it is not yet his time and is sent back to his body, as Debra's spirit tells him to \"be happy.\"Frank and Lucy fall in love. Lucy is now able to see ghosts as well. Frank later begins demolishing the unfinished dream house and building a life with Lucy while the morose-looking ghost of Dammers is riding around in the sheriff's car.

Seven months pregnant Emily travels to Venezuela to help natives in the Amazon area. She dies when a bus is hit by a landslide and plunges into the river below. Her body is never found by the local authorities.Without taking time to grieve Joe returns to work. One night he is awakened by his wife's dragonfly paper weight that falls and rolls across the room. His wife always had a passion for dragonflies and even had a birthmark on her shoulder which resembled a dragonfly. Joe starts visiting Emily\u00c2\u00b4s patients at the pediatric oncology in the hospital. One of his wife's patients is brought in unconscious. Joe hears the child calling his name and follows the staff who are trying to revive him without success - the child\u00c2\u00b4s heart flatlines. As Joe approaches the child, suddenly the heart begins beating again.The following afternoon Joe returns to the child who asks him if he is \"Emily's Joe\" and tells him she sent him back to tell Joe something. All over the room are drawings of a curvy cross, but the boy doesn't know what the symbol means. The boy tells about his near death experience, that he saw a light, and a woman showing him an image of Joe, and that the cross symbol was what he saw at the end of the rainbow. Later, while passing by another child's room, Joe sees the same drawing. That boy immediately knows who Joe is and tells him that he must \"go to the rainbow\".When Joe arrives at home, his parrot mysteriously goes into a rage breaking a pot making the same wavy cross symbol drawn in the spilled soil on the floor. Joe spots a dragonfly flying outside the window, and briefly sees Emily reaching for him outside that same window. Joe's neighbour, Miriam Belmont, tries to talk him back into reality. Instead, he goes to Sister Madeline, a controversial nun who investigated near-death experiences. Sister Madeline advises Joe that Emily is indeed trying to contact him from the other side.The breaking point occurs at the hospital when Joe is alone with a clinically dead patient. Joe hears his wife speaking through the patient, calling his name, but no one believes him. He decides to sell his home and go on vacation. While packing away his wife's belongings, the lightbulb in the room burns out. When he returns with a new bulb, all the belongings he had packed away are suddenly back in their original places.

Joe remembers and finds a photo of his wife posing in front of a waterfall with a rainbow behind her.He takes a trip to the South American area where his wife died. Joe's pilot, Victor, takes him to the victims' graves near a tribe village. Joe shows the photo of his wife and asks his native guides if they know where his wife is buried. They start arguing with each other that he should be brought to the village. Joe's attention then shifts to the village and he runs off to it. He comes to a cliff and sees the bus far down below in the water. Joe jumps into the river and enters the semi-flooded bus, causing the bus to shift and becoming completely submerged. Joe is trapped inside but calms down when a bright glow fills the bus and his wife appears to him, reaching his hand. The events of her final hours flash before him, showing she survived the initial accident and was pulled to safety by nearby Yanomami villagers. He is then suddenly rescued out of the bus by Victor.Joe runs to the village just to become surrounded by angry native men holding weapons. He holds up a photo of his wife. A native woman tells him they couldn't save her body but they saved her soul. Perplexed, he follows her into one of the huts, and inside is a female infant in a basket. The child his wife was carrying had survived the accident. The woman shows him a birthmark on the child in the shape of a dragonfly.

She talks to Caleb, relaxing and seducing him verbally while Marc takes advantage by giving him a blow job. Gwen hangs up to come home and Marc jerks off next to Caleb. Caleb, feeling confused and insecure, leaves. He passes Gwen on her way home and she seduces him again, this time physically. Caleb goes home and goes to bed.The next morning Marc calls Caleb and leaves a message. Kyle overhears it and realizes that Marc and Caleb had sex. As Kyle storms into his room, Marc calls back. After the call Caleb goes to Kyle and tells him he's invited Gwen and Marc to dinner to clear everything up. Caleb also tells Kyle that he knows Kyle has feelings for him and that, if Caleb were at all gay, he'd love Kyle.Gwen and Marc come over for dinner and Caleb is chagrined to see that Kyle's invited Caleb's family as well. Kyle convinces Gwen to \"pretend\" to be Caleb's date and Marc to \"pretend\" to be his. Dinner is going well, if a little awkwardly, until Tiffani inexplicably crashes the party. Gwen takes upon herself to out Caleb to his parents. His parents take it quite well and everyone ends up in a bizarre group hug.After Caleb's family and Tiffani leave, Gwen verbally attacks Kyle, thinking he's trying to steal Marc from Caleb. Caleb convinces Marc to talk to Kyle and Gwen figures out the entire scheme, which she thinks is the sweetest thing anyone's ever done for her in light of the lengths to which Caleb went to sleep with her.

A group of eco-feminists, led by Frida Waterfall, protesting the destruction of the environment, leads to an accident wherein a piece of Frida's jewelry lodges inside Fry's brain granting him telepathy. The destruction upsets Leela, but Leo asserts that he has received environmental clearance from a bribed Professor Farnsworth. Unconvinced, Leela saves a Martian muck leech, the last of its species, from the site.Hutch, a transient Fry stumbles upon, advises him to wear a tin foil hat to keep other people's thoughts out of his head and warns Fry never to reveal his powers and to beware the \"Dark Ones\".While golfing with the crew, Leo reveals his plan to destroy 12% of the galaxy and build the universe's largest miniature golf course. Farnsworth and the crew survey the site and discover an asteroid in a violet dwarf star system, teeming with primordial life forms. Over Leela and Fry's objections, Farnsworth approves Leos project causing Leela to join the eco-feminists.Hutch introduces Fry to the \"Legion of Mad Fellows\", a secret society of other tin foil hat wearing telepaths led by the No. 9 man. Fry learns that the violet dwarf is the only surviving egg of the Encyclopods, a now-extinct species which evolved to preserve the DNA of all endangered life forms and recreate extinct species, whilst the Dark Ones evolved to pursue the destruction of all life. Due to a resurgence in the life-giving force \"Chi\", the Encyclopod will soon be reborn. As Fry is immune to the Dark Ones' psionic powers he alone can save the star.Leo enlists Zapp Brannigan and Kif Kroker to capture the eco-feminists and Fry infiltrates Leo's empire as a security guard. Fry later runs into Frida and has her take a discreet message of support to Leela, but an unseen Dark One later murders Frida. Farnsworth, Zoidberg and Hermes are captured by the eco-feminists (now joined by Amy, LaBarbara Conrad and others), who commandeer the Planet Express ship. Fry and Leela arrange a rendezvous which is ambushed by the eavesdropping Zapp in the Nimbus. The eco-feminists are captured and sent to prison.At a Legion meeting, No. 9 explains that Fry must not only stop the implosion of the violet dwarf, but also identify and thwart the Dark One who is sure to be present. Though no one knows the current form of the Dark One, its mind cannot be read, allowing Fry to identify it. No. 9 gives Fry the Omega device, which can disable the Dark One at close range.Bender arrives to free the eco-feminists from prison and Hermes, Zoidberg, Scruffy and a repentant Farnsworth arrive in the Planet Express ship and whisk them off to stop the implosion ceremony.At the ceremony Fry is unable to locate an unreadable mind in the massive audience and concludes that he must be the Dark One. The Eco-Feminists disrupt the ceremony and Leela stops Fry from imploding the star. Fry activates the Omega Device and Leela's leech reveals itself to be the lone surviving Dark One before collapsing. The violet dwarf system forms a giant sperm and flies into the star, creating an Encyclopod embryo which quickly reaches adult form.

Vogel runs from the Captain's forces, but eventually stumbles upon an idyllic mountain vale, untouched by war and still living in the age before the war.The Captain and his small band are not far behind. Trapped in the valley, Vogel convinces the Captain to preserve it and the village it shelters for their own benefit, as the outside world faces famine and devastation. \"Live\", Vogel tells the Captain, \"while the army dies.\" The Captain decides that his men will indeed rest here for the winter. He forces the locals to submit, especially their Headman, Gruber (Nigel Davenport). The local Catholic priest (Per Oscarsson) is livid that the mercenaries include a number of Protestants (and nihilistic atheists for that matter), but there is little he can do to sway the Captain. The mercenaries are of one mind after the Captain kills a dissenting member of his band, and religious and ethnic divisions are set aside.At first, the locals accept their fate. Vogel is appointed judge by Gruber, to settle disputes between villagers and soldiers. As long as food, shelter, and a small number of women are provided, the mercenaries leave the locals alone. Hansen (Michael Gothard) attempts to rape a girl and, exiled from the group, manages to lead a rival mercenary band to the valley, before the winter sets in and closes the valley to all outsiders. He and his band are destroyed and the valley goes into hibernation. But as winter fades, it becomes obvious that the soldiers will have to leave. The Captain learns of a major military campaign in the Upper Rhineland and decides to leave the valley in order to participate.

Meanwhile, the Captain and his men engage in a major siege operation. Most of his men are killed. The Captain survives long enough to return to the valley, only to find himself faced by the villagers. Vogel intervenes so that no fight happens.

Years later, she attempts to conceive a new baby but realizes that her new man is impotent. She goes up to the attic and rapes 12-year-old Billy. Nine months later, a daughter named Agnes is born and treated like a princess by Mrs. Lenz. When Agnes is eight and Christmas comes around, Billy escapes from the attic and disfigures Agnes by gouging out her eye. He then taunts his terrified mother, saying \"she's my family now,\" and gruesomely kills his mother and her lover. He is caught by the police eating cookies made out of his mother's flesh, and is sent to a mental asylum.15 years later, on Christmas Eve, Billy, now 35, escapes from his cell and heads off to his former home, now a sorority house. At the Delta Alpha Kappa, Clair (Leela Savasta) is killed in her bedroom. Meanwhile, Megan (Jessica Harmon) begins to hear noises and goes up to the attic to investigate.

One of the main attractions is \"Fearless Freep\" and his high-dive act. As soon as Yosemite Sam hears the name \"Fearless Freep\", he goes into a joyful frenzy, buying as many tickets as he can. (\"I'm a-splurgin'!\")During the show, as Bugs is about to introduce Freep, he gets a telegram informing him that Freep is delayed by a storm and won't be able to appear until tomorrow. An angered Sam insists on seeing the high-diving act and forces Bugs at gunpoint to the top of a high-dive platform. But Bugs manages to pull out all his tricks and stops, and it is Sam who does all the diving, in a different comical setting nine separate times (in a variant of the diving act from \"Stage Door Cartoon\").1: Sam pushes Bugs to the edge of the platform (with Bugs baring his claws to secure himself to the board). Bugs tells Sam to cover his eyes while he puts on his bathing suit, and then proceeds to spin the board around so that Sam is at the diving edge. Bugs makes it look like he's taken the dive (accompanied with an audible \"SPLASH\"), while Sam turns around and starts to walk off, right off the edge and into the tank, which falls apart with the water still intact after the hoops break off the tank when he crashes in.2: Bugs springs on the board so hard that he sends Sam up, over his head and down (separating Sam from his pistols in the process). Bugs then realizes that he forgot to fill the tank with water, so he grabs a bucket of water and throws it down from the diving board past Sam. The water makes it into the tank, but Sam misses the tank altogether, smashing through the stage into the basement.3: Sam walks to the end of the board and finds Bugs standing on the board upside-down (\"Great horny toads! What are ya doin' down there upside-downy?\"). Bugs points out that it is actually Sam who is upside-down (\"I'm not upside down, doc. You are! Look!\"). Sam looks \"up\", sees the tank, and falls into it.4: Having been verbally hit with \"fightin' words\", Bugs dares Sam to \"step over a line\" (in a gag similar to one from Bugs Bunny Rides Again), sending Sam down for the splash again (but not before springing back up for a moment to declare: \"I hate you!\")5: Sam is stopped by a door, and yells \"Open up that door!\" then turns to the audience and says: \"You notice I didn't say Richard?\". He backs up and charges towards the door, which Bugs opens at the last moment, leading Sam to another splash, this time assisted by an anvil given to him by Bugs.6: Bugs, dressed as an Indian, points Sam to a \"short-cut\" in a desert-like setting (\"Quick! Him go that way! You take-em short cut! Head him off at pass!\"). Sam thanks the \"Indian\" and takes the route, leading to yet another dive.After two more dives in which the setups are unseen, Sam finally has Bugs tied and standing on the edge of the platform, with Sam sawing away at the board, gloating: \"Now ya smarty-pants, let's see ya get out-in this one! This time, you're a-diving!\" However, as soon as Sam cuts through the board, it's the ladder and platform that falls, leaving the cut plank suspended in mid-air.

The child's desperate mind remarkably bends a metal gate until a guard knocks Lensherr unconscious (a recreation of the opening scene of the first X-Men movie). Scientist Sebastian Shaw, who has observed this incident through a window, calls Lensherr up to see him. Placing a metal coin on a desk, he orders Lensherr to use his power to move it. When Lensherr cannot, despite his best efforts, Shaw shoots and kills Lensherr's mother in front of him. In his rage, Lensherr's out-of-control magnetic power kills the two guards and destroys two rooms, to Shaw's delight. Shaw tells Lensherr that they will \"have fun\" developing the boy's power.Around this same time, in a Westchester County, New York, mansion, young Charles Xavier is awoken when he thinks he hears a burglar break in. He heads down to the kitchen and finds a young, shape-shifting girl named Raven Darkh\u00f6lme, disguised as his mother, who is looking through the fridge for food. Using his mind to talk to Raven, Xavier accuses his \"mother\" of being an imposter, and asks what it has done with his real mother, as she would not make him a sandwich or hot chocolate. Raven shifts back to her normal, blue-skinned form. Overjoyed to meet someone else \"different\" like him, Xavier invites her in.In 1962, Lensherr goes to Switzerland and forces a banker (by ripping out one of the metal fillings in his mouth) to trace a bar of Nazi gold to Shaw's address in Argentina. In a tavern there patronized by former German soldiers, Lensherr kills three men as he learns that Shaw owns a yacht in Florida. Meanwhile, in England, Xavier has graduated from Oxford and is publishing his thesis on mutation; Raven is now his foster sister and works as a waitress. Simultaneously in Las Vegas, Nevada, CIA agent Moira MacTaggart follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the Hellfire Club, where she sees Shaw, Emma Frost, Riptide and Azazel. Shaw calmly threatens Hendry, telling him that the Colonel should reverse his position on advocating that the U.S. install nuclear missiles in Turkey, a move the government had previously avoided so as not to provoke war with the Soviet Union. When Hendry refuses, Shaw has Riptide demonstrate his power to conjure tornadoes from thin air and hurls Hendry into a wall. Convinced, Shaw has Azazel teleport Hendry to the President's War Room, where he supports the missile placement in Turkey.Shaw later meets with Colonel Hendry on his yacht, and refuses to give Hendry his money, at which point Hendry pulls out a grenade and threatens to pull the pin and kill himself and everyone on the boat's deck. Shaw takes the grenade and pulls the pin himself, and absorbs the blast -- Shaw is a mutant, and absorbs energy, which also keeps him young, then taps Hendry, expelling the grenade's energy into the Colonel, destroying him.MacTaggart seeks Xavier's advice on mutation, and takes Xavier and Raven to the CIA to convince the chief that Shaw is a threat. After convincing them that mutants exist, they are to be taken to a covert facility, but first Xavier insists they track down Shaw. Shaw is aboard his yacht relaxing with Frost and Riptide when Lensherr appears. Frost uses her telepathy to pacify Erik and pushes him overboard.Lensherr attacks Shaw, using the anchors and chains of the yacht to tear the boat apart. When Shaw escapes in a submarine hidden below the upper decks of the boat, Lensherr tries to stop him, his ability to control metal pulling him along in the water. Xavier stops him so that he does not drown, speaking to him telepathically and telling him it's useless to follow Shaw. Lensherr joins Xavier and Raven at the CIA facility, where they meet Hank McCoy, another mutant that Xavier accidentally outs. McCoy and Xavier use a prototype Cerebro to locate mutants and recruit several of them to train to stop Shaw. During the recruiting process, we also see Xavier and Lensherr trying to talk to Logan (Wolverine) in a bar. He promptly tells them to go to hell, and they walk off.Shaw plans to meet with a Russian general, but sends Frost instead, who is then captured by Xavier and Lensherr. Lensherr tortures her briefly and Xavier taps into Frost's mind and finds out that Shaw plans to start a nuclear war between the US and Russia in order to wipe out all normal humans. Back in the US, the CIA facility is attacked by Azazel, Riptide and Shaw, who kill all the guards and agents present. Shaw offers the new mutants to a place on his side, but most of them refuse. He recruits Angel and kills Darwin by forcing him to ingest a massive amount of energy when he tries to fight back. When Lensherr and Xavier return they all go to Xavier's mansion and begin to train, though Raven is conflicted about hiding her natural form. Hank creates a vaccine that is supposed to turn his and Raven's appearance normal, however, when Hank takes it there are unexpected side effects: his mutant physical features are enhanced; he now has blue skin, blue fur and is several times stronger. The newly assembled X-Men team boards a specialized SR-71 Blackbird jet modified by Hank and fly out to the Caribbean.President Kennedy institutes a blockade of a Russian fleet in the Caribbean Sea. Shaw travels with the Russian fleet to ensure that the missiles get to Cuba. Xavier, MacTaggart and Lensherr fly to the blockade to stop the fleets from engaging. Wearing a special helmet given him by the Soviets that blocks out telepathic interference, Shaw uses the sub's nuclear core to charge himself up. While Azazel kills the crew of the Russian missile ship, Xavier uses his powers to make a Russian officer on one of the escort ships fire a missile and destroy the cargo ship carrying the Soviet weapons before it crosses the demarcation line established by the United States.With Xavier's help, Lensherr pulls Shaw's submarine from the water, but an attack by Riptide forces the X-jet and submarine to crash on a nearby beach. Xavier desperately tries to locate Shaw with his telepathic ability but is unable while Shaw is in the reactor room of the sub and wears his helmet. Lensherr goes after Shaw and finds him in the sub's reactor room. The two battle furiously and the shielding around the chamber cracks, allowing Xavier to locate Shaw. Lensherr tries to overcome Shaw with the metal in the room but Shaw counters with his own telekinesis and pins Lensherr to the wall. Suddenly, Lensherr plucks Shaw's helmet from his head with a length of cable and Xavier is able to freeze Shaw in place. Lensherr puts on the helmet to block out Xavier's telepathy and admits that he agrees with everything Shaw believes about mutants and humans and how he never would have developed his power if Shaw hadn't forced him to. Eric, however, is still vengeful about Shaw's murder of his mother and kills Shaw by slowly forcing the coin that Shaw taunted him with as a child through his brain while Xavier screams, experiencing the act himself. Eric exits the wrecked submarine with Shaw's body and announces to his fellow mutants that the humans in both fleets are their real enemies and that the mutants should band together to fight them. Xavier pleads with Eric to end the campaign but he fails.The two fleets fire their missiles and shells at the mutants on the beach, but Lensherr, now fully in control of his abilities, stops the projectiles in mid-flight and then turns them on the fleet. In the ensuing fight Xavier manages to distract Lensherr, but when MacTaggart fires at Lensherr he deflects the bullets, with one striking Xavier in the lower spine. The missiles and shells all fall into the ocean or explode. Lensherr removes the bullet from Charles' back but, more furious than before, begins to choke MacTaggart with the chain holding her ID tags, blaming her for Xavier's injury. Xavier tells Erik that Moira is not the one responsible and Erik relents, realizing he injured his friend. Erik releases Moira, who rushes to Xavier's side.Lensherr takes Raven, Angel, Riptide and Azazel and leaves, having convinced them that humans are their enemies. Xavier, now confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, and his fellow mutants return to the mansion, where he will open a school. He wipes MacTaggart's memory. MacTaggart reports to her superiors but has nothing to tell them, knowing that Charles had erased her memory of all recent events.At CIA headquarters, Emma Frost sits alone in a specialized holding cell. The door is suddenly ripped from it's frame and Erik walks in, his new recruits waiting just outside. He is wearing a new uniform and a newer version of the helmet he'd stolen from Shaw. He tells Frost to call him \"Magneto.\"", "output": "Question: Who kills Hendry?, Answer: Shaw, Question: Who does Lehnsherr attack?, Answer: Shaw, Question: Who does Xavier invite to live with his family ?, Answer: Raven Darkhime, Question: Who does Xavier meet in Division X?, Answer: Hank McCoy, Question: where does Xavier graduate from?, Answer: University of Oxford, Question: Who rushes to help Xavier?, Answer: Moria, Question: Who to stop Lehnsherr by shooting him?, Answer: MacTaggert, Question: What war is Shaw intending the start?, Answer: Cold War against the Soviet Union, Question: What nickname does Raven give herself?, Answer: Mystique, Question: What does Dr Klaus do to Erik's mother ?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who takes a jet to the blockade line?, Answer: Xmen, Question: Who kills Shaw?, Answer: Lehnsherr, Question: Who was hit by the bullet?, Answer: Xavier, Question: Who accepts Shaw's invitation to join him?, Answer: Frost & Riptide, Question: How does Xavier influence a sailor to destroy the ship?, Answer: Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship, Question: What does Dr Klaus Schmidt witness ?, Answer: <No Answer>", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Later, he returns and tells Jeff that Whit Sterling has been looking for him. Jeff agrees to meet him.Before he leaves, Jeff begins to tell Ann about his mysterious past. His real name is Jeff Markham. He and partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) worked as private investigators in New York. They took on a job for a rich gambler, Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). The movie then flashes back to that time.Sterling hires Jeff to find his girlfriend, Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer). She had run away after shooting Sterling and stealing $40,000 from him. He wants her and the money returned. Jeff talks to Kathie's former maid, Eunice (Theresa Harris). He learns that she had packed for warm weather, was vaccinated, and left for Florida. Jeff knows vaccinations aren't needed for Florida, but they are for Mexico. He tracks the luggage to Mexico City and learns she had been there. From there, the trail leads to Acapulco.Jeff finds Kathie there. At first he doesn't tell her he's been hired to find her. Later, when he goes to send a telegram to Whit, he finds the Western Union office closed for the siesta. So instead, he sees her again and they begin to fall in love. He tells her the truth - that Whit is alive and just wants her back. She claims she didn't take Whits money. Eventually, they decide to run away together. They plan to start from Jeffs hotel the next morning.However, Whit and his henchman Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine) show up unexpectedly, having flown down to check up on Jeff. He tells Whit that he hasn't found Kathie yet, and she has caught a boat south. After Whit leaves, the lovers take a boat north.They live as inconspicuously as possible in San Francisco, fearful of being found but thinking the odds are one in a million anyone will spot them. But it happens. Fisher, Jeffs old partner, spots him at a race track. Tracking the couple to a cabin in the woods, he demands the $40,000 in return for his silence. A fistfight breaks out and ends when Kathie fatally shoots the would-be blackmailer. She then drives off, leaving Jeff behind. He finds her bank book and discovers a balance of $40,000.The movie then flashes forward to Jeff and Ann. He tells he never saw Kathie again, and he has to tell Whit all which has happened. He arrives at Whits place and sees Kathie is living with him again. Rather than discussing the past, Whit says he wants to hire Jeff to recover some income tax records that a lawyer, Leonard Eels (Ken Niles), is using to blackmail him. Jeff agrees to take the job.In San Francisco, Jeff meets Eels' secretary, Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming). She tells him of her and Whit's plan to get the papers. When Jeff meets Eels, he warns him Whit isn't interested in paying Eels off, and he should give up the papers. He returns later, only to find Eels dead. With Kathie's help, Whit had planned the murder of Eels and hoped to frame Jeff for it. Jeff also learns that Kathie told Whit that it was Jeff who killed his ex-partner Fisher, and among Eels' papers is an affidavit she signed naming Jeff as the killer. Jeff goes to Whits night club, slugs the manager and takes the tax papers. He tries to trade them for the affidavit, but the plan goes awry.Joe tries to hunt down Jeff on a small river, but when he tries to shoot Jeff, Jimmy hooks him with a fishing line and pulls him in the river, where he drowns.Later, when Jeff again tries to meet with Whit, he finds Kathie has killed him.

He has raised $25,000 in order to bring a brilliant Cambodian student, Samnang, to study in the United States, but finds little else truly memorable about his high school experience. His life suddenly changes when charismatic Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door. Matthew witnesses her undressing from his bedroom window, until she sees him and storms over, knocking on the door and introducing herself to his parents.

When a few of Matthew's athlete classmates attempt to get him away from Danielle and kick him out of the party, he finds the courage to walk right up and kiss her. Matthew's world is suddenly rocked the next day when his friend Eli informs him that Danielle is an adult film actress.On Eli's advice, Matthew takes Danielle to a sleazy motel. Danielle, insulted, realizes that he has discovered her past and abruptly ends the relationship. Matthew later attempts to apologize and reconcile, but Danielle believes that she will never be able to escape her past and decides to return to the adult industry. Matthew tracks Danielle down at an adult film convention in Las Vegas where Kelly (Timothy Olyphant), a porn producer and Danielle's ex, menacingly warns Matthew not to interfere with his business. Matthew ignores him, convincing Danielle both to leave the adult industry and to begin their relationship anew.Next morning, Kelly furiously abducts Matthew from school and assaults him, saying that Danielle's failure to film has cost him $30,000. Kelly offers to let Matthew erase his debt by stealing an award statuette from porn mogul Hugo Posh (James Remar), but once Matthew has entered the house Kelly calls in a burglary report and leaves the premises. Matthew narrowly avoids the police and rushes to a scholarship award dinner. High on ecstasy that Kelly gave him as aspirin, he gives a deeply sentimental speech but loses out on the scholarship.Kelly exacts further revenge by stealing all the money Matthew raised for Samnang. Matthew fears that he will be implicated in the crime and expelled from school. He turns to Danielle for help in recouping his losses. Danielle calls in two friends from her porn star days, and they agree to make a video for Hugo Posh on prom night using Matthew's classmates as actors.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)In the summer of 1956 in Massapequa, Long Island, New York, 10-year-old Ron Kovic plays war in the woods and attends a Fourth of July parade. After watching President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address,[3] it inspires him to enlist in the Marines. Later, Kovic attends an impassioned lecture about the Marine Corps. He decides to enlist and misses his prom because he is unable to secure a date with his love interest, Donna. He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving.Now a Marine sergeant and on patrol during his second Vietnam tour in October 1967, Kovic's unit kills a number of Vietnamese civilians in a village, believing them to be enemy combatants. During the retreat, Kovic accidentally kills one of the new arrivals to his platoon, a younger Marine private first class named Wilson. During a firefight in January 1968, Kovic is critically wounded until a fellow Marine rescues him. Paralyzed from the mid-chest down, he spends several months recovering at the Bronx Veterans Administration hospital where the hospital conditions are poor with rats roaming the floors and the doctors and nurses ignoring patients and abusing drugs and the equipment being too old to be useful. He desperately tries to walk again with the use of crutches and braces, despite repeated warnings from his doctors.In 1969, Kovic returns home, permanently in a wheelchair with his leg intact. Though he tries to maintain his dignity as a Marine, Kovic gradually becomes disillusioned despite being paralyzed and resorts to alcoholism. In Kovic's absence, his younger brother Tommy (Josh Evans) has already become staunchly anti-war, remarking to Kovic what the war had done to him. During an Independence Day parade, Kovic shows signs of post-traumatic stress when firecrackers explode. When he is asked to give a speech, a baby in the crowd starts crying. After being unable to finish the speech and wheeled off stage, he reunites with his old high school friend Timmy Burns, who is also a wounded veteran, and the two spend Kovic's birthday sharing war stories. Later, Kovic goes to visit Donna at her college in Syracuse, New York, where the two reminisce and she asks him to attend a vigil for the victims of the Kent State shootings. He and Donna are separated after she and her fellow students are taken away by the police at her college for demonstrating a protest against the Vietnam War. Ron goes to a bar, almost getting into a fight with a fellow Marine and after a heated argument with his mother, Ron's father decides to send him to Mexico.He arrives in (\"The Village of the Sun\") that seems to be a haven for paralyzed Vietnam veterans. He has his first sexual experience with a prostitute whom he believes he loves, until he sees her with another customer. Hooking up with another wheelchair-bound veteran Charlie, the two travel to what they believe will be a friendlier village. After annoying their taxicab driver, they end up stranded on the side of the road. After arguing with each other, they are picked up by a man with a truck and driven back to the \"Village of the Sun.\" Going back to Long Island, Kovic travels to Georgia to visit Wilson's parents and family. He tells them the true story about their son's death and confesses his guilt.Kovic joins Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) and travels to the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami. He tells a reporter about his negative experiences in Vietnam and the VA hospital conditions, that the Vietnam War is wrong, and that the Vietnamese people are a proud people fighting against the US for their independence, fueling rage from the surrounding Nixon supporters.

It remains \"basically happy\" because police work has been Frank's meaning of life, and he feels unhappy about not being able to legally take on criminals anymore. Additionally, Jane tries to push him into siring a child, but Frank does not have the courage to go through this yet. It comes as a blessing to him when his old friends Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) and Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) come by and ask for his help in an investigation. The Police Squad has caught wind that a well-known bomber named Rocco Dillon (Fred Ward), who is currently incarcerated, has been hired by a terrorist (Papshmir, known from the first movie) to conduct a major terrorist act against the United States. An important contact, Tanya Peters (Anna Nicole Smith), Rocco's girlfriend, proves to be a dead end, so Drebin is asked to join Dillon undercover in prison, befriend him, and then leak details of the plan to his colleagues. However, the first part of the mission \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by pure accident \u00e2\u0080\u0093 proves to be extremely taxing; Jane becomes frustrated both at Frank's sudden unwillingness to engage in his marital duties and the suspicion that he is doing police work again, and storms out of the house.Frank joins Rocco in prison, and after winning his trust, the two stage their breakout together. Rocco even manages to persuade his dominant and highly distrustful mother, Muriel (Kathleen Freeman) to take Frank into their house. However, both are loath to tell Frank too many details right away, which is why he is forced to stay around a little longer. In the meantime, Jane joins her friend Louise (Ellen Greene) on a road trip, but in time she realizes that she really misses Frank. When she calls home and receives no reply, she follows a clue Frank had inadvertently left behind to Tanya, where she is promptly taken hostage by Rocco and his mother. Frank is barely able to save her life for the time being, and eventually Rocco reveals his plan: the bomb is to be set off at this year's Academy Award ceremony, with the bomb hidden in the envelope with the nomination of the Best Picture category and triggered when the card is pulled out. (In one scene Tanya Peters (Anna Nicole Smith) is revealed to be a trans woman, in a shadow.)At the awarding night, Frank and Jane separate from Rocco's team and frantically begin searching for the bomb, with Frank inflicting his usual chaos on stage during the prelude show. However, Frank and Jane are unable to find the bomb before the nomination for Best Picture has begun. When Frank bursts onto the stage and awkwardly tries to prevent the detonation of the bomb, Rocco and his mother realize what is going on and kidnap Jane, but in the process, Frank loosens an electronic sign which takes out Muriel. Desperate, Rocco decides to detonate the bomb to follow his mother, but Frank manages to catapult Rocco and the bomb out of the awarding hall right into Papshmir's private helicopter (which was circling overhead), with the bomb eliminating all hostile parties involved. Frank and Jane reaffirm their love under the applause of the awarding audience and viewers worldwide. Nine months later, Frank and Nordberg rush into the pediatric ward to witness the birth of Frank's child but in their hurry run into the wrong delivery. Seeing that the baby is African-American, Frank assumes Nordberg is responsible and angrily chases him. Just after they leave, Ed comes out of another hospital room with Jane, who is holding the real baby, unbeknownst to Frank.", "output": "Question: what is drebin asked to do?, Answer: Join Dillon undercover in prison, Question: where does frank catapult rocco?, Answer: Into Papshmir's private helicopter, Question: Who does Frank think is the real father of his child?, Answer: Nordberg, Question: What is Frank and Jane's relationship?, Answer: Husband and wife, Question: what does rocco persuade his mother to do?, Answer: Take Frank into their house, Question: Where does Frank go undercover to get information?, Answer: Prison, Question: what happens 9 months later?, Answer: Birth of Frank's child, Question: What profession did Frank retire from?, Answer: Police Squad, Question: Who is the evil terrorist in the film?, Answer: Papshmir, Question: Which award envelope is hiding the bomb?, Answer: the nomination of the Best Picture category", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

When Canon Taillier breaks the news to Jean of his father's marriage, Jean is upset but promises to try to respect the decision.When Jean returns home, he becomes resentful of his stepmother Jeanne whom he sees usurping his mother's place, and his feelings find their outlet in his growing hostility towards Arlette. Finding that his spacious bedroom is now occupied by Arlette and Pierrette and that he now has a smaller room, Jean takes the only portrait of his mother to his new room for comfort. While playing with Pierrette, he refuses to let Arlette join them. When he sees Jeanne take a dress that his mother wore to make dresses for the two girls, he ruins it intentionally.Jean and Arlette now despise each other.

That night, he tricks Arlette into venturing out onto the snow-covered mountain by telling her where her doll fell.

Powell is a self-anointed preacher with a penchant for switchblade knives, a misogynist who is both attracted to and repulsed by women. He travels rural roads, preaching in small towns, and rationalizes his murders by telling himself that he is punishing sinful women and gaining money to preach God's word. The letters \"L-O-V-E\" are tattooed on the fingers of his right hand, and the letters \"H-A-T-E\" on those of his left hand. Powell uses them as symbols in impromptu sermons. In one small town, police arrest Powell for driving a stolen car and he is sentenced to jail.Meanwhile, a local family man named Ben Harper kills two people in a bank robbery. He arrives home and hides the money he has stolen inside his daughter's rag doll. He convinces his two young children, John and Pearl, to keep the hiding place secret. The police arrive and arrest Ben, while John is shocked by the way the police roughly overpower his father.Harper and Powell share a cell where Powell, soon to be released, tries without success to learn the location of the stolen money. Harper lets slip enough information to allow Powell to determine that Harper's children must know where the money is. Harper is executed for his crimes, while Powell is released from jail, and then woos and marries Harper's widow, Willa.Powell charms most of the townsfolk, but John remains distrustful. John does not share the money's hiding place with Powell and must constantly remind his younger and more trusting sister Pearl to maintain the secret. Willa eventually discovers that Powell is searching for the money, though he has earlier denied this to her. Still, the pious Willa believes he married her to show her God's light rather than to gain access to the money. Powell murders her, dumps her body in the river, and covers up her disappearance by claiming she has abandoned him and the children for a life of sin.With this cover story Powell retains the trust and sympathy of the townsfolk. His position in the town becomes even more secure. Willa's drowned body is discovered by Birdie Steptoe, an elderly man who spends his days drinking on his riverboat and is friendly with John. Birdie keeps his discovery a secret out of fear the town will blame him for her death. Nobody else in town is willing to take John's side against Powell.Left to care for John and Pearl, Powell threatens their lives and learns the money is hidden inside the doll. The children flee down the river with the doll and take sanctuary with Rachel Cooper, a tough old woman who looks after stray children. Powell tracks them down, but Rachel sees through him and runs him off her property. Powell returns after dark, as he had threatened, and in the ensuing all-night standoff he is wounded by a shot. The police, by now having discovered Willa's body, arrive to arrest Powell. John breaks down as he witnesses the arrest of Powell as a parallel to the arrest of his real father. John takes the doll and beats it against the handcuffed Powell. As the money spills out, he insists that Powell can have the cash if he wants it.Powell is tried, convicted, and sentenced for his crimes. Several of the townsfolk previously depicted as his staunchest defenders sit in the public gallery drinking and shouting abuse at him. A lynch mob tries to take Powell from the police station but the police retreat with him out the back of the building as the professional executioner promises to see Powell again soon. Finally, John and Pearl have their first Christmas together with Rachel and their new family.", "output": "Question: Where does Ben Harper hide the stolen money?, Answer: Inside a rag doll, Question: Where does Powell dump Willa's body?, Answer: In the river, Question: Who marries Harper's widow?, Answer: Powell, Question: Who discovers Willa's drowned body?, Answer: Birdie Steptoe, Question: Who is caring for John and Pearl at first?, Answer: Powell, Question: Who doesn't trust Powell?, Answer: John, Question: Who shares a cell with Harper?, Answer: Powell, Question: Who is Reverend Harry Powell?, Answer: a serial killer, Question: Who do the children stay with after running from Powell?, Answer: Rachel Cooper, Question: Does John share the location of the money with Powell?, Answer: No, Question: What is the money hidden in?, Answer: Doll, Question: Who watches Ben get arrested?, Answer: John, Question: In one small town why was Powell arrested?, Answer: for stealing a car, Question: Who have their first Christmas together with Rachel?, Answer: John and Pearl, Question: Who retains the trust and sympathy of the townsfolk?, Answer: Powell, Question: Who is tried and convicted?, Answer: Powell, Question: What is Powell attracted to and repulsed by?, Answer: women", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee.The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg.While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \"jellyfish\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be aliens.

In the night, Sandy wakes up and goes looking for Greg, only to discover that he has been killed by the alien, who is still in the room. She flees to the basement and the creature is about to get her when Taylor arrives and saves her. On the way to the shack, he tells her about the creature: it is a tall extraterrestrial (Kevin Peter Hall) who hunts humans for sport to keep as trophies, using the living creatures as living weapons against its prey.They wait at the shack to ambush the hunter with dynamite when Sarge shows up, almost spoiling their plan. He and Taylor fight, and Sandy is about to hit Sarge from behind when the alien arrives and kills Sarge. Taylor then shoots the creature, with little to no effect.

As a result, his mind and spirit are a tangled mass of emotions that he seems to have trouble separating from his own feelings. As he struggles to play Uncle Vanya, he reads an article in The New Yorker regarding \"Soul Storage,\" which in fact is a procedural clinic that physically removes one's soul from his body.While hesitant at first to go through with such a procedure, being unsure how it would affect him, Paul decides to go ahead. On visiting the clinic he discovers that most souls come out as gray matter or clouds. He decides to go ahead, declining the offer to look at his soul as it happens. He is distressed to discover that his soul comes out looking just like a chickpea. He has it stored in the clinic and returns to his life with 5 percent of his soul remaining. However, his life begins to fall apart; he has trouble associating with or making love to his wife Claire. Lacking in emotional intelligence, he says insensitive things, such as telling a friend to just \"pull the plug\" on her comatose mother, and his acting for the Chekhov play lacks believability. Not wanting his soul back just yet, he instead obtains the soul of what he is told is a Russian poet, whose memories entice him to be curious about her and her life as well as obtain a curiosity of his own. This Russian soul allows him to play Uncle Vanya excellently, but the experience overwhelms him and he decides to get his own soul back.Paul's world is turned upside down when Nina, a Russian soul mule who transports people's souls to and from Russia, steals Paul's soul for the wife of her boss at the Russian soul-storage operation, who aspires to be an actress. She receives Paul's soul, believing it to be the soul of Al Pacino. Her acting and happiness improve.

A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land.Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \"Harmonica\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men.Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it.Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction. He tries to buy the farm cheaply by intimidating the other bidders, but Harmonica arrives, holding Cheyenne at gunpoint, and makes a much higher bid based on his reward money for delivering Cheyenne to the authorities. Harmonica rebuffs an offer by Frank to buy the farm from him for one dollar more than he paid at the auction. As Cheyenne is placed on a train bound for the Yuma prison, two members of his gang purchase one-way tickets for the train, intending to help him escape.Frank's men betray and ambush him, having been paid by Morton to turn against him, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094much to Jill's outrage\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harmonica helps Frank kill them, intending to kill Frank himself. Frank returns to Morton, only to find that he and the rest of Frank's men have been killed in a battle with Cheyenne's gang. Frank then goes to Sweetwater to confront Harmonica. On two occasions, Frank has asked Harmonica who he is, but both times Harmonica refused to answer him. Instead, he mysteriously quoted names of men Frank has murdered. This time, Harmonica says he will reveal who he is \"only at the point of dying\". The two men position themselves for a duel, at which point Harmonica's motive for revenge is revealed in a flashback:A younger Frank, already a cruel bandit, is forcing a boy to support on his shoulders his older brother, whose neck is in a noose strung from an arch. As the boy struggles to hold his brother's weight, Frank stuffs a harmonica into the boy's mouth and tells him to play. The brother curses Frank and kicks his brother away, and dies. The boy (Harmonica) collapses onto the ground clutching the harmonica in his mouth.Harmonica draws first and shoots Frank. As he lies dying, Frank again asks who he is, whereupon the harmonica is placed in Frank's mouth. Frank nods weakly in recognition, collapses to the ground clutching the harmonica in his mouth, and dies.

This is the Belasco House, the \"Mount Everest of haunted houses\", originally owned by the notorious \"Roaring Giant\" Emeric Belasco, a six-foot-five perverted millionaire and supposed murderer, who disappeared soon after a massacre at his home. The house is believed to be haunted by numerous spirits, the victims of Belasco's twisted and sadistic desires.Accompanying Barrett are his wife, Ann, as well as two mediums: a mental medium and Spiritualist minister, Florence Tanner, and a physical medium, Ben Fischer, who is the only survivor of an investigation 20 years previously. The rationalist Barrett is rudely sceptical of Tanner's belief in \"surviving personalities\", spirits which haunt the physical world, and he asserts that there is nothing but unfocused electromagnetic energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of this energy.Though not a physical medium, Tanner begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Tanner may be using the house's energy against him. Meanwhile, Fischer remains aloof, with his mind closed to the house's influence, and is only there to collect the generous paycheck.Ann Barrett is subjected to erotic visions late at night, which seem linked to her lackluster sex life. She goes downstairs and, in an apparent trance, disrobes and demands sex from Fischer. He strikes her, snapping her out of the trance, and she returns to herself, horrified and ashamed. A second incident occurs a day or so later; this time, she is awake but uninhibited due to alcohol. Her husband arrives a moment later to witness her advances to Fischer. He is resentful, and spurns Fischer's psychic ability, claiming that \"Mr. Deutsch is wasting one-third of his money!\" Stricken by the accusation, Fischer drops his psychic shields but is immediately attacked.Tanner is convinced that one of the \"surviving personalities\" is Belasco's tormented son, Daniel, and she is determined to prove it at all costs. She finds a human skeleton chained behind a wall. Believing it to be Daniel, Tanner and Fischer bury the body outside the house and Tanner performs a funeral. Nevertheless, Daniel's \"personality\" continues to haunt Tanner; she is scratched violently by a possessed cat. Barrett suspects that Tanner is mutilating herself. In an attempt to put Daniel to rest, Tanner gives herself to the entity sexually, but the entity brutalizes her.Barrett's machine is assembled. Tanner attempts to destroy it, thinking that it will harm the spirits in the house, but Barrett prevents her from doing damage. She enters the chapel, \"the unholy heart\" of the house, in an attempt to warn the spirits, but she is crushed by a falling crucifix. As she dies, she leaves a symbol written in her own blood. Barrett activates his machine, which seems to be effective. Fischer wanders the house afterwards, attempting to sense psychic energy; he declares the place \"completely clear!\" in astonishment. Violent psychic activity soon resumes and Barrett is killed.Fischer decides to confront the house, and Ann accompanies him despite her misgivings. Decyphering Tanner's dying clue, Fischer deduces that Belasco is the sole entity haunting the house, masquerading as many. He taunts Belasco, declaring him a \"son of a whore\", and that he was no \"roaring giant\", but likely a \"funny little dried-up bastard\" who fooled everyone about his alleged height. Even as objects begin to hurl themselves at Fischer, he continues to defy the entity, until all becomes still. A stained glass partition in the chapel shatters, revealing a hidden door.Fischer and Ann discover a lead-lined room, containing Belasco's preserved body seated in a chair. Pulling out a pocketknife, Fischer rips open Belasco's trouser leg, discovering his final secret: a pair of prosthetic legs. Fischer realises Belasco had had his own stunted legs amputated, and used the prosthetics in a grotesque attempt to appear imposing. Belasco had the specially built room lined with lead, presaging the discovery of the electromagnetic nature of life after death.With the room now open, Fischer activates Barrett's machine a second time, and he and Ann leave the house, hoping that Barrett and Tanner will guide Belasco to the afterlife without fear.", "output": "Question: What did the erotic visions seemed linked to?, Answer: her lackluster sex life, Question: When is Ann Barrett subjected to erotic visions?, Answer: late at night, Question: What happens after Fischer drops his psychic shields?, Answer: he is immediately attacked, Question: Does Fischer tickle her or strike her?, Answer: strike her, Question: What kind of visions is Ann Barrett subjected to?, Answer: erotic visions, Question: Who scratches Tanner violently?, Answer: A possessed cat., Question: What does Tanner find behind a wall?, Answer: A chained skeleton., Question: How was the house?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What does Fischer confront?, Answer: the house, Question: What is Barrett attacked by?, Answer: Physical forces, Question: Who leaves the house?, Answer: Fischer and Ann, Question: What is the room line with?, Answer: Lead, Question: what physicist lionel do?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What was Belasco's final secret?, Answer: Prosethic legs, Question: What inhibits Ann during the second incident?, Answer: Alcohol, Question: What was Tanner crushed by?, Answer: a falling crucifix, Question: What does Barrett say the supernatural activity in the house is?, Answer: Unfocused electromagnetic energy, Question: Who does Ann Barrett demand sex from?, Answer: Fischer, Question: What does Tanner attempt to destroy?, Answer: Barrett's machine, Question: What does Fischer do, to snap Ann from her trance?, Answer: Strikes her, Question: Who does Barrett think used the house's forces to attack him?, Answer: Tanner, Question: Who does Ann demand sex from?, Answer: Fischer, Question: What does the shattered glass reveal?, Answer: a hidden door, Question: Who is the only survivor of an investigation from 20 years ago?, Answer: Ben Fischer", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono.During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney).As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish.When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \"Roy\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell. When this incident is over, Aaron's personality re-emerges and appears to have no recollection of the personality switch. Molly Arrington (Frances McDormand), the psychiatrist examining Aaron, is convinced that he suffers from multiple personality disorder caused by years of abuse at the hands of his father. Vail does not want to hear this, because he knows that he cannot enter an insanity plea during an ongoing trial.Vail sets up a confrontation in court by dropping hints about the Archbishop's pedophilia, as well as Stampler's multiple personalities. He also has the sex tape delivered to Venable, knowing she will realize who sent it and\u00e2\u0080\u0094since she is under intense pressure from both Shaughnessy and her boss Bud Yancy (Terry O'Quinn) to deliver a guilty verdict\u00e2\u0080\u0094will use it as proof of motive.Vail puts Stampler on the witness stand and gently questions him about the abuse he suffered at the Archbishop's hands. After Venable questions him harshly during cross-examination, Stampler turns into \"Roy\" in open court and attacks her, threatening to snap her neck if anyone comes near him. He is subdued by courthouse marshals and rushed back to his holding cell. The judge (Alfre Woodard) dismisses the jury in favor of a bench trial and then finds Stampler not guilty by reason of insanity, remanding him to a maximum security mental hospital. Venable is fired for losing the case and allowing the Archbishop's crimes, which both the Catholic Church and the city council had been trying to hide for the past ten years, to come to public light.Vail visits Stampler in his cell to tell him of the dismissal. Stampler says he recalls nothing of what happened in the courtroom, having again \"lost time.\" Just as Vail is leaving, Stampler asks him to \"tell Miss Venable I hope her neck is okay,\" which he could not have been able to remember if he had \"lost time.\" When Vail confronts him, Stampler reveals that he had faked multiple personality disorder. No longer stuttering, he brags about having murdered Archbishop Rushman, as well as Linda.

He tells her what he thinks of her, that she lives a boring life she doesn't want, mistreated by her husband. He finds her, touches, and teases her face. She holds his hand, pulls him down and they kiss. He draws his weapon as they engage in foreplay. She tells him to have sex with her, and as he is distracted she ignites the road flare and blinds him, takes his weapon, and kills him.Della returns home. Her husband Kenneth complains she was out late and is tracking mud throughout the house, but Della ignores him. She goes upstairs to check on her children who are both sleeping.

The film can be subdivided into a number of sequences documenting arrivals, parades, preparations and speeches. Only one scenethe review of the German cavalryactually involved the German military. Characteristic of all the sequences are beautifully composed shots of Nazi flags and symbols, and of faces of enraptured people. Except during the speeches, there is martial music playing by a military band.[1] An airplane is flying through beautiful clouds, then over the city of Nuremberg, and lands at the airport. Nazi party bigwigs descend, finally Adolf Hitler, and there is a welcoming ceremony.[2] Adolf Hitler enters the city, standing in an open four door Mercedes Benz in a motorcade. Adoring crowds wave and give the Nazi salute, including children, women, uniformed soldiers. A woman hands him a bouquet of flowers while holding up a small child in her other arm. Flags with swastikas are flying or hanging on every street.[3] At a rally in a large indoor venue, the party faithful members hear speeches by a dozen party bigwigs. Only a couple of sound bytes from each are shown, ending with a brief speech by Hitler.[4] Night falls on the city of Nuremberg. There are parades through the old streets by small groups carrying torches. Patriotic songs are sung.[5] Dawn over the city. Aerial views of the quiet streets.[6] At an enormous campground of tents, young adult men are getting up, washing in communal basins. Breakfast is being prepared in enormous vats. They eat and sing and play good natured games, with lots of smiles all around.[7] At the enormous stadium built by the Nazis in Nuremberg, the crowds march in and sit and wait for a speech by Hitler.[8] There is a youth rally at another enormous venue, with another speech by Hitler.[9] Military parades follow. In fields outside the city, motorized and cavalry troups display their equipment in marches and advances. Then various military groups each in a different uniform march through the old part of the city, past the Cathedral. In a square next to the Cathedral Hitler reviews the marching groups.[10] Speech by Hitler to military groups.[11] Night falls again, there are fireworks and parades by torch bearing groups.[12] In another motorcade, Hitler is hailed by the populace. Many observe from windows opening onto the motorcade route. Others hail him after having climbed onto any high place, even up lamp posts.[13] In the same venue of the first speeches, Hitler gives a speech closing the proceedings. This speech, just like all the others documented, have no programs or explanations but are designed to create enthusiasm for a new Germany, united, that can do extraordinary things, that can solve problems and build for a better future, where the ordinary worker is treated with dignity, and all are motivated by patriotic love for the German nation.", "output": "Question: What political group is focused on?, Answer: Nazis, Question: How long is the gathering?, Answer: 3 Days, Question: Where does Hitler review the marching groups?, Answer: Square next to the Cathedral, Question: What car is Hitler in during the motorcade?, Answer: Mercedes Benz, Question: What German city did the gathering take place in?, Answer: Nuremberg, Question: What city does this take place in?, Answer: Nuremburg, Question: What symbol was on the flags?, Answer: swastikas, Question: What year did the Nazi gathering take place?, Answer: 1934, Question: Who's speech closes the proceedings?, Answer: Hitler, Question: What brand of car does Hitler ride in in the motorcade?, Answer: Mercedes Benz", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Dejected and disappointed at their direction in life and wanting more, Gary convinces the uptight Wyatt that they need a boost of popularity in order to get their crushes, Hilly (Judie Aronson) and Deb (Suzanne Snyder), away from Ian and Max. Alone for the weekend with Wyatt's parents gone, Gary is inspired by the 1931 classic Frankenstein to create a virtual girl using Wyatt's computer; infusing her with everything they can conceive to make the perfect dream woman. After hooking electrodes to a doll and hacking into a government computer system for more power, a power surge creates Lisa (Kelly Le Brock), a beautiful and intelligent woman with seemingly endless powers. Promptly, she conjures up a Cadillac convertible to take the boys out to a bar, using her powers to manipulate people into believing Gary and Wyatt are of age. The boys come up with the name Lisa based upon a failed romantic experience of Gary's.They return home drunk and happen upon Chet (Bill Paxton), Wyatt's mean older brother, who extorts money from him to buy his silence. Lisa agrees to keep herself hidden from him, but realizes that Gary and Wyatt, while extremely sweet are very uptight and need to unwind. After a humiliating experience at the mall where Max and Ian pour an ICEE beverage on Gary and Wyatt in front of a crowd of people, Lisa tells them about a party at Wyatt's house, of which Wyatt had no prior knowledge, before driving off in a Porsche 928 she conjured for Gary. Despite Wyatt's protests, Lisa insists that the party happen anyway in order to loosen the boys up. She goes to meet Gary's parents, Al and Lucy, who, to Gary's embarrassment, are shocked and dismayed at the things she says and her frank manner. After she pulls a gun on them (later revealed to Gary to be a water pistol), she alters their memories so that Lucy forgets about the conflict, and Al forgets that they've had a son altogether. Back at the Donnelly house, the party has spun out of control while Gary and Wyatt take refuge in the bathroom where they resolve to have a good time, despite having embarrassed themselves in front of Deb and Hilly. Meanwhile, Wyatt's grandparents arrive and confront Lisa about the party, but she freezes them and hides them in a cupboard. Upstairs in Wyatt's bedroom, Ian and Max convince Gary and Wyatt to recreate the events that created Lisa, but Lisa chides them over their misuse of the magic to impress their tormentors. She also mentions that they forgot to connect the doll; thus, with the bare but live electrodes lying on top of a magazine page showing a Pershing II medium-range ballistic missile, a real missile appears through the house. Lisa resolves that the boys need a challenge to boost their confidence and has a gang of mutant bikers invade the party, causing chaos and sending the boys running.The bikers take Deb and Hilly hostage, and Wyatt and Gary decide they need to save them. They confront the bikers with a new boost of confidence (and Lisa's water pistol) to force them to back down. After they leave peacefully, Gary accidentally fires the gun, which is now real, and their bravery makes Deb and Hilly fall in love with them. The next morning, Chet uncovers the disarray in which the house is\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 the missile protruding through the kitchen and floor joists and carpet of the bedroom, the kitchen being turned entirely blue, and his catatonic grandparents in the cupboard\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 before confronting Wyatt and Gary. Lisa tells the boys to escort the girls home while she talks to Chet alone. Gary narrowly escapes being pulled over by the police in a conjured Ferrari, while Wyatt proclaims his love for Hilly before being sprayed by her parent's lawn sprinklers, and both girls reciprocate their feelings to the boys. Returning home, they discover Chet, now transformed into a giant, talking turd,who apologizes to Wyatt for his behavior. Lisa assures them that Chet will return to normal, and realizing that her work is done and that they don't need her anymore, she kisses both Gary and Wyatt before dematerializing and vanishing. As she is leaving all of the disarray is magically transformed back to normal, the missile disappears, the home is restored to its original fastidious state and Chet returns to normal just as Wyatt's parents return home, unaware anything odd has happened at all.Sometime later at their high school, a gym class of sweaty, pimply adolescent boys waiting for gym-class to begin is met by a beautifully fit coach in spandex. It is revealed to be Lisa who tells the class to \"Drop and give me twenty\", causing all the boys in the class to faint and collapse.

During World War II he designed an armored car for the military and made money building gun turrets for aircraft in a small shop next to his home in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Tucker is supported by his large, extended family, including wife Vera (Joan Allen) and eldest son Preston Jr (Christian Slater).As the war winds down, Tucker has a dream of finally building the \"car of the future.\" The \"Tucker Torpedo\" will feature revolutionary safety designs including disc brakes, seat belts, a pop out windshield, and head lights which swivel when you turn. Tucker hires young designer Alex Tremulis (Elias Koteas) to help with the design and enlists New York financier Abe Karatz (Martin Landau), to arrange financial support. Raising the money through a stock issue, Tucker and Karatz acquire the enormous Dodge Chicago Plant to begin manufacturing. Abe hires Robert Bennington (Dean Goodman) to run the new Tucker Corporation on a day-to-day basis.Launching \"the car of tomorrow\" in a spectacular way, the Tucker Corporation is met with enthusiasm from shareholders and the general public. However, the Tucker company board of directors, unsure of his ability to overcome the technical and financial obstacles ahead, send Tucker off on a publicity campaign, and attempt to take complete control of the company. While Tucker travels the country, Bennington and directors change the design of Tucker's car to a more conventional design, eliminating the safety and engineering advances Tucker was advertising. At the same time, Tucker faces animosity from the Big Three and the authorities led by Michigan Senator Homer S. Ferguson (Lloyd Bridges).Tucker returns from his publicity tour and confronts Bennington, who curtly informs him that he no longer has any power in the company to make decisions, and the engine originally planned for the car is not viable. Tucker then receives a call from Howard Hughes (Dean Stockwell), who sends a private plane to bring Tucker to his aircraft manufacturing site. Hughes advises Tucker to purchase Air Cooled Motors, which can supply both the steel Tucker needs, as well as a small, powerful helicopter engine that might replace Tucker's original \"589\" power plant.Faced with being unable to change Bennington's design, Tucker modifies the new engine and installs it in a test Tucker in the secrecy of his backyard tool and die shop. This prototype proves successful in both durability and crash testing. However, Tucker is confronted with allegations of stock fraud. Ferguson's investigation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), causes Karatz, once convicted of bank fraud, to resign, fearful that his criminal record will prejudice the hearings. Yellow journalism starts ruining Tucker's public image even though the ultimate courtroom battle is resolved when he parades his entire production run of 50 Tucker Torpedoes, proving that he has reached production status.After giving a speech to the jurors on how capitalism in the United States is harmed by efforts of large corporations against small entrepreneurs like himself, Tucker is acquitted on all charges. Nevertheless, his company falls into bankruptcy and Preston Tucker dies of lung cancer seven years later, never able to realize his dream of producing a state-of-the-art automobile.The film ends with all 50 Tucker Sedans being driven down the streets of downtown Chicago, admired by everyone as they pass.", "output": "Question: What Senator was blamed for the demise of the Tucker Motor Company?, Answer: Homer S Furgeson, Question: How many Tucker cars were produced?, Answer: 50, Question: The Tucker factory was planned to be located in what city?, Answer: Chicago", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

People believe that you can hear voices of the dead in the white noise of a detuned radio and even see faces from the white noise on the television set. Michael Keaton stars in this thriller as Jonathan Rivers, a man who had just lost his wife in a freak accident. Raymond Price (Ian McNeice) meets with Jonathan and tells him that his wife Anna has contacted him from the other side. Jonathan doesn't believe him until he hears Anna's voice on his radio. Jonathan wants to talk to his wife, and he gets all the equipment. There is only one thing that Jonathan doesn't know, there are also bad people on the other side. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)KrystelClaire's outlineJonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton), a highly-stressed professional notices that a strange man is watching him from outside his home and his office. That man tells him that his wife, renown writer Anna Rivers (Chandra West) is dead and at peace, because she has talked to him from the other side. Jonathan Rivers dismisses him violently, but that night two police officers arrive: Anna has been found dead, the cause was not a robbery gone awry because she had her mobile phone and personal items on her.Some time later, Jonathan has not adjusted himself to be a widower, although he takes shelter in his job. One day, Jonathan is with one of the investors (L. Harvey Gold) who has contracted him. They are both going down in a lift when they get stuck and the lights are out. At that moment, Jonathan's mobile phone rings, and it says \"Anna's phone\". Jonathan gets so surprised that he doesn't pick it up. The lift soon starts working again and he goes on business as usual. However, back home, he checks Anna's mobile phone, still in the plastic bag the police had given it to him in. It has run out of battery. At that very same moment, Jonathan's phone rings again, and again it's from Anna's mobile phone. He picks it up: white noise is heard. Suddenly, somebody hangs up at the other side of the line. That night, female whispers are heard. Also, a message gets recorded in Jonathan's line phone, but he was able to hear it once, as the answering machine will say that there are no messages left after he has heard it once.Jonathan decides to visit Raymond Price (Ian McNeice) at his home. Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger) is there, still with tears on her cheeks. Sarah leaves them alone. Ray tells Jonathan that he is not a medium or a magician. He just records images amidst the white noise and shows him the message of a female voice calling out \"Jonathan, Jonathan\" over and over again amidst white noise. Sarah offers a cup of coffee to Jonathan and she tells him that she has become addicted to the recordings. Sarah is satisfied, because they have just interpreted that her ex-fianc\u00e9 is happy in the other realm.Jonathan starts tuning in the car radio, at home, always looking for the white noise. One day, while driving, he hears a female voice saying whispering something. Because of that distraction, he almost has an accident while driving. Back at Raymond's home, Jon is left alone hearing Anna and some more voices. Suddenly, angry sounds and images seem to invade the room, but Raymond deletes those in front of Jonathan. Raymond says that not all the voices are nice, that Jonathan shouldn't get nervous and that they are closer to getting an image of Anna. Jonathan goes back home, but Raymonds tells him to see him again fast. When Jonathan arrives, Raymond's home door is open, so he enters. Everything is dark, some figures appear on the tv's white noise, and Raymond is dead - maybe because of fright?. Jonathan calls the police.After the funeral, Sarah helps Jonathan to find Anna's original recordings. Alongside some fun messages, they found insults like \"pig... rot\". Mike (Nicholas Elia) is Jonathan's only son. He wonders why his father has bought so many tv's all of a sudden, and Jonathan tells him that it's better so that each one can see each fovourite tv programme. Jonathan doesn't pay much attention to Mike, as he's always too busy with the recordings. Jonathan visits a blind psychic, who says that Jonathan's doing a very dangerous thing because some of them don't like how he interferes with everything, and that she keeps on hearing \"Willow Avenue\". Even though the psychic tells tells him that Anna was pregnant, he doesn't believe her. The psychic tells Jonathan that he's misinterpreting everything. Next time in front of the tv, he watches many different faces, some of them menacing.Jonathan visits Susie Tomlinson (Amber Rothwell), whose mother died when she was born. Apparently, her grandmother has tried to contact her mother, and the former promised to tell her whether she has been able to talk to Susie's mother after her death. Susie says that her grandmother died two days ago, but Jonathan has been receiving messages from her for a week. Mike wonders what his father is doing, but he never gives a clear answer or pays much attention to him. Mike tells his father to be careful.Next time, Jonathan watches Anna tell him to come look for her. When he gets near to the screen, Anna is terrified and screaming. The shadows of three men (Bill Tarling, Chuck Walkinshaw and Colin Chapin) seem to have terrified Anna. A male voice also whispers \"Willow Avenue\". Jonathan goes there in a wet dark night. Once there, there is a short circuit in a high-voltage cables and pole. When approaching the site of a car accident, Jonathan notices three black shadoes flyting away. Closer, he notices a bloodied woman (Miranda Frigon) trapped within the car, shouting for him to save her baby. The mother dies but the baby is rescued by Jonathan. Carol Black's husband Frank (Aaron Douglas) refuses to listen to Jonathan, who realises that Anna is showing him the future of people who are going to die. Jonathan is sure that he's shown only the cases which he can help in.The shadows appear again amidst white noise. They realise that they have Mary Freeman (Suzanne Ristic), a kidnapped woman on Raymond's tapes. Anna tries to tell them where Mary is, but they can't understand her well. Sarah also appears on the images. That night, Jonathan can't sleep well, and he leaves the door open as he hears Sarah mutter in her sleep. When Jonathan goes to watch, he watches Sarah jumping backwards from the balcony of her home with dazed open eyes. Sarah is still alive, at hospital, although she's in a critical state. Detective Smits (Mike Dopud) wants to question Jonathan later on. Sarah wakes up to say that \"it hurts, it hurts\".When Jonathan returns home, everything is a mess, but his equipment is still working. He is shown a place before the three strange presences appear. Smits appears after Jonathan has left and gets puzzled over the mess. He distinguishes the terrified face of Mary in Jonathan's monitor. Meanwhile, Jonathan drives like a maniac to reach pier 16, following the images seen. He phones Smits to tell him of the place, but he doesn't seem to understand. At the derelict place, Jon arrives to see many screens and monitors on. A man is lurking in the shadows behind him. Anna's image advises him to leave now. Immediately, the shadows of the three men appear on the turned-on screens.Jonathan sees what looks like the torture tools of a psychopath, who's waiting for him while Mary is tied down. The three presences are present. The psycho is the worker who got Jonathan and the contractor from the lift. He says that the three presences had asked him to bring Anna to them as well. Sarah is turning and tossing at hospital feeling Jonathan's angst. When Smits and other police officers arrive, Jonathan has fallen down three or four storeys and is dead. Mike and Sarah go to the funeral.The radio of the car starts going to the white noise, and we can hear Jonathan's voice saying \"I'm sorry\", but Jane (Sarah Strange) - who is going to take care of Mike from then on- turns it off. Mike smiles.Sarah, in a wheelchair, if left alone at the cemetery. The breeze blows, it's a sunny day... but then the shadows seem to threaten her.Jonathan appears with Anne amidst white noise.

She is also plagued by infatuation with a popular and attractive senior, Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling). At school she fares no better when she finds out that a completed \"sex quiz,\" which she tried to surreptitiously slip to her friend Randy (Liane Curtis), never reached her friend Randy and, unbeknownst to either of them, was picked up by Jake. Sam panics because the quiz contains sensitive information, such as she is a virgin and is saving herself for Jake.She has a whole new set of problems when she arrives home to discover all four of her grandparents are staying at the Baker home during the wedding. One set of grandparents has brought along a bizarre foreign exchange student, Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe). The grandparents force Sam to take him along to her school's senior dance that night and, to Sam's amazement, it takes \"The Donger\" only five minutes to find an unlikely girlfriend \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the tall, large-breasted jock, Marlene (Deborah Pollack), nicknamed \"Lumberjack.\" They are found slow dancing in the gym.A subplot involves a geeky freshman (Anthony Michael Hall) who tries to win a bet with his friends by continually (and unsuccessfully) trying to bed his love interest, Sam. The character is referred to on several occasions in the film as either \"Ted\" or \"Farmer Ted,\" but is credited simply as \"the Geek.\" On the way home on the school bus, Sam blows him off by saying, \"Go to hell.\"In the school auto shop during the dance, Sam and Ted begin talking and Sam confesses her love for Jake. Upon hearing this, Ted tells her that Jake had been asking about her at the dance, and they agree that Sam should just go and talk to him. As she's leaving, Ted reveals the wager to Sam, who agrees to loan him her panties to help him win.Later (after a $1 admission peepshow of Sam's panties, which Sam finds out about the next day), Ted and his equally unwelcome geeky friends, Cliff (Darren Harris) and Bryce (John Cusack), go to the senior dance after-party, hosted at Jake's house. When they knock on the door, Long Duk Dong, who has come to the party with Marlene, greets them. Ted and his gang get in but they make a big mistake by knocking over the jocks' beer can pyramid. Ted and Bryce leave it up to Cliff to deal with the jocks.Meanwhile, upstairs in Jake's bedroom, Jake takes the opportunity to look through the yearbook and finds Sam's photo. He jots down her phone-number on a scrap of paper and calls her, only to be disappointed when her grandparents pick up the phone.Jake's entire house is completely trashed. At night's end, Jake finds Ted trapped under a table and they begin to talk. Jake inquires further about Sam, and Ted explains the situation. Jake makes a deal with Ted: If Ted lets Jake keep Sam's panties, Jake will allow Ted to drive home his drunk popular girlfriend, Caroline Mulford (Haviland Morris), in Jake's father's Rolls Royce. Jake later uses the excuse of finding them together to break up with Caroline (who had surprisingly fallen for Ted and doesn't mind the break-up very much). Ted's friends filmed Ted and Caroline making out. Afterward, Jake drives to the church just in time to meet an incredulous Sam after her sister's wedding.The film concludes with Sam and Jake sharing a kiss over a birthday cake with 16 candles.", "output": "Question: What does Sam loan Ted so he could win a wager?, Answer: her panties, Question: For what event have all four grandparents come to witness?, Answer: Wedding, Question: Who picked up the phone when Jake called Samantha?, Answer: her grandparents, Question: who plays the geeky freshman?, Answer: Anthony Michael Hall, Question: Who does Sam admit to love?, Answer: Jake, Question: Jake inquiries about whom?, Answer: Sam, Question: Who is trapped under the table?, Answer: Ted, Question: What did Ted's friend film?, Answer: Ted and Caroline making out, Question: Where is the senior dance after-party?, Answer: Jake's house, Question: With whom had Samantha developed an infatuation with?, Answer: Jake Ryan, Question: what's one nickname for the geeky freshman?, Answer: the Geek, Question: How old is Samantha?, Answer: 16 years, Question: Who wrote/directed Sixteen Candles?, Answer: John Hughes, Question: Who is Ginny's younger sister?, Answer: Samantha, Question: 'Lumberjack' is the nickname for which unlikely student that garnered Long Duk Dong's attention at the dance?, Answer: Marlene, Question: What do Ted and his gang knock over?, Answer: Beer can pyramid", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

A team of Allied prisoners of war (POWs), coached and led by English Captain John Colby (Michael Caine), a professional footballer for West Ham United before the war, agree to play an exhibition match against a German team, only to find themselves involved in a German propaganda stunt.Colby is the captain and essentially the manager of the team and thus chooses his squad of players. Another POW, US Army Capt. Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone), on enlisted TDY to the Canadian Army, is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team as the team's trainer, as Hatch needs to be with the team to facilitate his upcoming escape attempt.Colby's superior officers repeatedly try to convince Colby to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt, but Colby consistently refuses, fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning his unrelated escape attempt, and Colby's superiors agree to help him, if he in return agrees to journey to Paris, make contact with the French Resistance, and try to convince them to help the football team escape.Hatch succeeds in escaping the prison camp, travelling to Paris, and finding the Resistance; at first, the Resistance decides that the plan to help the football team escape is too risky, but once they realise the game will be at the Colombes Stadium they plan the escape using a tunnel from the Paris sewer system to the showers in the players' changing room. They convince Hatch to let himself be recaptured, so he can pass information along back to the leading British officers at the prison camp.Hatch is indeed recaptured, but upon his recapture, he is put in solitary confinement. Because he is in solitary confinement, the prisoners do not know whether the intended escape has actually been planned with the underground, so Colby tells the Germans that he needs Hatch on the team because Hatch is the backup goalkeeper and the starting goalkeeper has broken his arm. Colby actually has to break the existing goalkeeper's arm because the Germans want proof of his injury before they will agree to let Hatch onto the team.In the end, the POWs can leave the German camp only to play the match; they are to be imprisoned again following the match. The resistance's tunnellers break through to the showers in the dressing room at halftime, in an escape Hatch leads. But the rest of the team (led by Russell Osman saying \"but we can win this\") want to persuade him to carry on with the game, despite being behind 4-1 at halftime.Despite the match officials being heavily biased towards the Germans, and the German team causing several deliberate injuries to the Allied players, a draw is achieved after great performances from Luis Fernandez (portrayed by Pel\u00c3\u00a9), Carlos Rey (portrayed by Osvaldo Ardiles) and Terry Brady (portrayed by Bobby Moore). Hatch plays goalkeeper, and makes excellent saves including one last save from a penalty kick as time expires to deny the Germans the win, drawing the game 4\u00e2\u0080\u00934. An ally goal had been blatantly disallowed earlier in the match, so, the POW team should have won, 5-4.The POWs do manage to escape at the end of the game following the original plan, amid the confusion caused by the crowd storming the field (shouting \"victoire\") after Hatch preserved the draw.", "output": "Question: Who plays the role of Capt.

Una ni\u00f1a mata a una adulta cort\u00e1ndole el cuello con un cuchillo. La sangre se ve roja y fuerte.Resulta que es un cuento que le est\u00e1n contando a una ni\u00f1a, a quien le dicen que la ni\u00f1a era una bruja en realidad. Flavia Goribar (Elsa Mar\u00eda) es la nueva alumna en el colegio, aunque ya est\u00e1 avanzado, y ni siquiera tiene uniforme. La profesora le dice que se siente al lado de Ver\u00f3nica (Ana Patricia Rojo) por el momento. Ver\u00f3nica le dice a Flavia que su nombre es de ara\u00f1a, ya que ella tiene una ara\u00f1a en casa que se llama as\u00ed.La abuelita (Marcela P\u00e1ez) manda a Ver\u00f3nica a ir a ba\u00f1arse. La criada se encarga de Ver\u00f3nica, le da la cena y le lee libros de brujas. La madre de Ver\u00f3nica muri\u00f3 en un accidente de coche, y la ni\u00f1a casi no se acuerda de ella. Flavia tambi\u00e9n se despide para irse a dormir de su madre (Lilia Arag\u00f3n) y su padre (Sergio Bustamante). Esta ni\u00f1a no reza, ya que su madre que s\u00f3lo rezan las ni\u00f1as que tienen miedo. Nana (Carmela Stein) le cuenta a Ver\u00f3nica que una vez oy\u00f3 a un fantasma, y que tambi\u00e9n vio una vez a uno. La ni\u00f1a quiere saber c\u00f3mo se hace un pacto con el diablo.En el colegio, la se\u00f1orita Ellis (Roc\u00edo Lazcano) va a coger una caja que Ver\u00f3nica le pidi\u00f3. La ni\u00f1a se entretiene haciendo muecas. La profesora de Ver\u00f3nica tiene que irse unos meses para atender a un familiar enfermo, y Ver\u00f3nica lo oye. En clase, las ni\u00f1as tienen que copiar el mapa de Francia. Ver\u00f3nica parece adivinar qu\u00e9 va a pasar, y dice a Flavia que es un b\u00faho. Ver\u00f3nica le dice que el b\u00faho est\u00e1 disecado. Nana manda a las ni\u00f1as a jugar al jard\u00edn. Flavia no la quiere creer, pero Ver\u00f3nica le dice que que ella supiera lo que iba a pasar con Miss Ellis es parte de lo que el b\u00faho - que s\u00f3lo habla de noche - le dijo. Ver\u00f3nica le dice a Flavia que ella es una bruja, y le manda guardar el secreto. Esa noche, Flavia le pregunta a su padre si existen las brujas, y \u00e9l le dice que no. Su padre le dice que todo es superstici\u00f3n.Flavia tiene que estudiar piano, aunque no le guste. Va a casa de la profesora, Madame Rickard (Blanca Lidia Mu\u00f1oz), que protesta porque siempre llega tarde. Madame enhebra un ovillo de lana mientras Flavia toca una serenata. La profesora le promete galletas si toca bien la canci\u00f3n.Otro d\u00eda, Flavia y Ver\u00f3nica hacen un castillo de arena en el jard\u00edn. Flavia dice que seguro que Ver\u00f3nica hab\u00eda o\u00eddo el chisme en alguna parte, porque su padre le dice que las brujas no existen. Ver\u00f3nica insiste en que ella es una bruja vieja y horrible. Los padres de Ver\u00f3nica est\u00e1n muertos, y la ni\u00f1a vive con su abuela. Ver\u00f3nica le pregunta si realmente no le dar\u00eda miedo que ella se convirtiese en bruja. Ver\u00f3nica se esconde y Flavia ve a la abuela de Ver\u00f3nica. Flavia chilla y sale corriendo. Nana (Araceli de Le\u00f3n) ri\u00f1e a Ver\u00f3nica, que sabe de sobra que no puede jugar dentro de casa. Adem\u00e1s, la abuela no quiere que nadie la vea y Nana obliga a Ver\u00f3nica a pedir perd\u00f3n a la abuelita.Esa noche, Flavia tiene pesadillas. La rama de un \u00e1rbol la asusta; sale corriendo y se encuentra un p\u00e1jaro que viene del pasillo. Se abraza a su madre, que tiene manos de monstruo con garras afiladas: es una bruja (Leonor Llaus\u00e1s). Flavia se despierta sudando, y su madre la consuela. La madre le dice que todo fue una pesadilla. Ver\u00f3nica amenaza a Flavia por si ella dice algo. Flavia pide a su amiga que haga un encantamiento para que se acaben las clases de piano. Ver\u00f3nica monta un akelarre con sangre de ambas y velas negras.Dos ni\u00f1as de la clase se r\u00eden de las pretensiones de Ver\u00f3nica de ser bruja. Ver\u00f3nica le presta su caja de colores con una serpiente dentro. La directora, Miss Arag\u00f3n (Mar\u00eda Santander), le recuerda a Ver\u00f3nica de que ya estaba advertida de que pod\u00edan expulsarla si volv\u00eda a portarse mal. Ver\u00f3nica lo niega todo y le echa la culpa a Flavia, que lo acepta. Flavia se queda en una habitaci\u00f3n hasta que sus padres vayan a recogerla.Su abuela le da libros a Ver\u00f3nica que eran de su madre. Flavia toca mientras Madame Rickard prepara una taza de t\u00e9. Madame Rickard est\u00e1 en el suelo, muerta. La madre sab\u00eda que eso le pod\u00eda pasar, porque Madame Rickard ya hab\u00eda tenido dos infartos, fumaba como un carretero y no se cuidaba nada. Los padres piensan que la ni\u00f1a no aceptar\u00e1 a otra profesora porque quer\u00eda much\u00edsimo a Madame Rickard. En el funeral, es un d\u00eda fr\u00edo, lluvioso. Alguien abre el ataud para ver la cara de la profesora, y Flavia se desmaya. Su perro Hippy est\u00e1 en su cama, y Ver\u00f3nica visita a la enferma. La madre sale con Hippy. Flavia quer\u00eda no volver a ver a Madame Rickard, pero no quer\u00eda que se muriera. Ver\u00f3nica insiste en el secreto: el demonio se le aparecer\u00e1 si Flavia dice algo. Ver\u00f3nica siente envidia de tantos juguetes que sus padres le regalan a Flavia. Ver\u00f3nica quiere llevarse a Betty, la mu\u00f1eca favorita de Flavia; cuando Flavia no se la regala, Ver\u00f3nica dice que ela es capaz de entrar de noche por la ventana y robar la mu\u00f1eca.Es medianoche. El reloj despierta a Flavia. Flavia ve el fantasma de Ver\u00f3nica con la mu\u00f1eca, y la mu\u00f1eca ya no est\u00e1 en su caja, sino que est\u00e1 alguien que abre los ojos. Flavia despierta y la mu\u00f1eca est\u00e1 en su sitio. Flavia llora. Una ni\u00f1a le da a Flavia la pluma que se hab\u00eda dejado olvidada.Nana dice que vio a una momia. Ver\u00f3nica dice que Flavia le regal\u00f3 la pluma, que parece de oro. Ver\u00f3nica quiere que Flavia se convierta en su esclava. Ver\u00f3nica lleva a Flavia a ver momias.Nana le dice que las hadas no se llevan bien con las brujas, que las matan. Ver\u00f3nica se pone a comer fruta para no tener que esperar por la comida que Nana est\u00e1 haciendo. Nana le dice que las brujas hacen veneno para las hadas en el caldero.Ver\u00f3nica amenaza a Flavia con que ella quiere ir al rancho a ver el estanque con patos y los caballos. La madrastra de Flavia empieza a preocuparse por la insana amistad entre las dos ni\u00f1as. Al final, Ver\u00f3nica se va de vacaciones al rancho. Ver\u00f3nica siente envidia de la riqueza del padre de Flavia. Flavia ense\u00f1a el pajar a Ver\u00f3nica. Ver\u00f3nica ve el cementerio del pueblo y quiere ir a verlo.Ver\u00f3nica y Flavia buscan a To\u00f1o (Ernesto Schwartz). Ver\u00f3nica busca un caldero, que lleva al pajar, para hacer un veneno que mate a las hadas. Esconden el caldero debajo de la paja en el alpendre de arriba del pajar al que muchas veces va Flavia a esconderse cuando no quiere ver a nadie. Ver\u00f3nica dice que tienen que buscar patas de ara\u00f1a, lagartijas, ceniza... hervirlo todo y con el olor de ese potingue matar a las hadas. A una iglesia abandonada van a buscar lagartijas. Otro d\u00eda, se ensucian buscando un sapo, y la madrastra de Flavia les ri\u00f1e porque se han destrozado los zapatos y huelen mal.Para buscar una serpiente, al final Ver\u00f3nica empuja a que Flavia robe una serpiente muerte que hay en la choza del capataz To\u00f1o, que tiene disecada en la pared un trozo de piel de serpiente.Adem\u00e1s, Ver\u00f3nica insiste en ir al cementerio de noche con Flavia, pra demostrarle al demonio que no le tienen miedo. Cogen un candil, y para all\u00e1 se van las dos en plena noche. To\u00f1o pilla a las dos ni\u00f1as en el cementerio. El padre les ri\u00f1e; Flavia le dice que quer\u00edan tierra para matar a las hadas; Ver\u00f3nica dice que s\u00f3lo era un juego. El padre las castiga a las dos, y Ver\u00f3nica promete vengarse.Ver\u00f3nica est\u00e1 columpi\u00e1ndose sola. Flavia intenta reconciliarse con ella, pero Ver\u00f3nica sigue enfadad\u00edsima. La madrastra de Flavia le dice que Hippy est\u00e1 cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s travieso: se hab\u00eda subido al coche y el padre lo rescat\u00f3.Es el \u00faltimo d\u00eda de vacaciones y van a hacer el veneno para las hadas. A cambio de ver c\u00f3mo se hace la poci\u00f3n, Ver\u00f3nica exige que Flavia le regale a Hippy. Flavia lo hace, llorando. Ver\u00f3nica juega ahora con Hippy, igual que antes era Flavia quien lo hac\u00eda.Es de noche, y van a hacer el conjuro. Como no tienen un gato negro, Ver\u00f3nica se lleva a Hippy, que intenta rebelarse y ladra. En el pajar, las ni\u00f1as encienden velas y preparan un quinqu\u00e9 para hacer el caldo. Mientras Ver\u00f3nica trabaja en el caldero, Flavia, desde la entrada en el piso de abajo del pajar, realmente ve que la sombra de Ver\u00f3nica es la de una bruja monstruosa que se r\u00ede malignamente.Flavia coge una vela encendida y prende fuego a la paja seca. Por si acaso, tambi\u00e9n retira la escalera de mano, \u00fanico punto de entrada y salida al piso de arriba. Coge a Hippy y cierra la puerta del pajar con el cerrojo. El fuego est\u00e1 ya muy extendido cuando Ver\u00f3nica nota algo - la ni\u00f1a se asusta y empieza a suplicarle a Flavia que vuelva a ayudarle. El humo empieza a hacerla tosar. Flavia permanece afuera sujetando a Hippy, sin decir ni hacer nada. Ver\u00f3nica golpea una ventana, pero s\u00f3lo consigue cortarse y ahcerse sangre en las mu\u00f1ecas.Ver\u00f3nica llora y llora, pero Flavia permance impasible; m\u00e1s bien sonr\u00ede un poquito abrazada a Hippy. Todo el pajar est\u00e1 ya en llamas - a la luz del incendio, Flavia est\u00e1 tranquila y sonr\u00ede.---- Escrito por KrystelClaire", "output": "Question: Who does Veronica befriend ?, Answer: Flavia, Question: Who does Veronica live with?, Answer: invalid grandmother and her nanny, Question: What type of family does Flavia come from ?, Answer: a wealthy family, Question: What does Veronica demand from Flavia ?, Answer: surrender her beloved pet dog, Question: What does Veronica plan to make for the fairies ?, Answer: to make a poison", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Accompanied by his assistant's assistant, Lutz (Gustaf Hammarsten), he travels to the United States to become \"the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler\".Br\u00fcno unsuccessfully attempts an acting career as an extra on NBC's Medium. He then interviews Paula Abdul, using Mexican chairpeople in place of furniture, then produces a celebrity interview pilot, showing him dancing erotically, criticizing Jamie-Lynn Spears' fetus with reality TV star Brittny Gastineau, unsuccessfully stalking and attempting to \"interview\" actor Harrison Ford, and closing with a close-up of his penis being swung around before his peehole screams then zooming into it. A focus group audience who review the pilot hate it, calling it \"worse than cancer\". Other advice suggests creating a sex tape, so Br\u00fcno interviews Ron Paul (unwittingly \"played\" by himself) whom Br\u00fcno mistakes for drag queen RuPaul. While waiting in a hotel room for a staged technical problem to be fixed, Br\u00fcno hits on Paul, who leaves angrily and calls him \"queer as blazes\".Br\u00fcno consults a spiritualist (Gary Williams) to contact the deceased Rob Pilatus of Milli Vanilli for advice, miming various sex acts on the invisible \"Pilatus\". He consults charity PR consultants Nicole and Suzanne DeFosset to select a world problem to maximize his fame, choosing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He flies to Jerusalem to interview former Mossad agent Yossi Alpher and Palestinian politician Ghassan Khatib and confuses hummus and Hamas. In an interview with Israeli and Palestinian professors he sings his own \"Dove of Peace\" while forcing the two to caress each other's hands. He also meets with Ayman Abu Aita, subtitled as \"terrorist group leader, Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades\" in a location described as a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon (actually a restaurant near Bethlehem), where he hopes to be kidnapped.[4][5] Br\u00fcno insults Abu Aita's hair then says that \"King Osama\" looks like a dirty wizard or a homeless Santa Claus. Abu Aita's translator orders Br\u00fcno to leave. He stops off in Nairobi to pick up a few things, including a child, saying he is \"black gold\".Br\u00fcno interviews parents of child models, asking if their children would be ready to lose a lot of weight, undergo liposuction, be near \"antiquated heavy machinery\" or \"amateur science\", or be dressed in Nazi uniforms. On a talk show hosted by Richard Bey, he shows the African American audience a baby named O.J., whom he acquired in Africa by \"swapping him\" for a U2 Product Red iPod. He shows photographs of the boy covered with bees, on a crucifix and in a jacuzzi next to adults in a 69 position. The audience is appalled and social services take the baby from Br\u00fcno, driving him to depression, later found at a diner gorging on high-carb junk food. Lutz carries him back to a hotel room. After a night of sex, they awake to find themselves trapped in a bondage mechanism, unable to find the key. They call a hotel engineer for help and are asked to leave. After accosting a group of anti-gay protesters from the Westboro Baptist Church while still in bondage gear and boarding a bus, Br\u00fcno and Lutz remove their equipment at Madison County Office of Alternative Sentencing and Release in Huntsville, AL [6] after being arrested. Lutz says he loves Br\u00fcno but Br\u00fcno tells him he does not love him, having been influenced by \"carb goggles\". Lutz leaves Br\u00fcno.After realizing the biggest names in Hollywood are straight (citing Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey and John Travolta), Br\u00fcno consults two Christian gay converters to help him become heterosexual. He attempts activities, such as joining the National Guard, going hunting in Alabama, learning karate and attending a swingers party at which he is whipped by a dominatrix (Michelle McLaren). These attempts end miserably due to Bruno's failure to keep his gay traits hidden, but he vows to become straight.Eight months later, a now-heterosexual Br\u00fcno, under the alias \"Straight Dave\", hosts a cage-fight match in Arkansas, \"Straight Dave's Man Slammin' Maxout\".

He follows Peniston (Esposito) into the facility. The head scientist Dr. Bishop (Reineke) shows them the projects he is working on, including a shark and dolphin hybrid with the ability to adapt to any environment, as well as a human and shark hybrid (the creature). It breaks free from its tank and kills Dr. Bishop. Richland orders Peniston to kill it, but Peniston instead traps the Creature in a containment unit and dumps it in the sea.25 years later...Dr. Chase (Nelson), a marine biologist, and his assistant, Tall Man (Williams), find a pregnant female Great White Shark trapped in Ben Mediera's (Alyward) nets. Dr. Chase sets it free. Meanwhile, a local fisherman, Puckett (Burke), retrieves the containment unit and accidentally releases the creature. Mediera is later eaten by the creature. Dr. Chase & Tall Man meet Dr. Macy (Cattrall), her sea lion named Robin, and Dr. Chase's son, Max (Carey), at the airport. As Dr. Chase & Dr. Macy prepare to out on the ocean, Max goes into town. He meets the native kids including Elizabeth (Echikunwoke), the chief's daughter. The local boys tell him he'll have to take the test of bravery and jump from a tall cliff.Mediera's body is found and police Chief Gibson asks Dr. Chase to inspect the body. Chase says even though there is a great white out there it is not the culprit and tells the chief not to let people go after the innocent shark. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy leave and prepare to go out and find the real culprit. Tall Man arrives, escorted by his girlfriend, Tauna (Michele). Peniston, who has gone crazy and is called 'Werewolf' by the locals, sees the empty containment unit after Puckett brings it ashore. He realizes Mediera was not killed by a shark. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy are unable to find the Creature and return to Dr. Chase's headquarters (formerly the research facility where the creature was born). Dr. Macy reveals Dr. Chase studies why sharks do not get cancer, which his best friend died from.Meanwhile the kids take turns jumping of the cliff, unaware the creature is lurking right below them. Max and another boy named Kimo jump in. The creature mauls Kimo to death, but Max escapes. When Kimo's body is found, the chief is furious and, no longer listening to Dr. Chase, orders all the fisherman to hunt for the great white. The islanders, including Puckett, accuse Chase and Macy of performing witchcraft on the shark. Dr.Chase, Dr. Macy, Max and Tall Man search for the Creature again; this time with success. The creature attacks their boat, but they escape. By this time, Puckett has killed the great white and the islanders celebrate, believing the danger is past. Dr. Chase tells the chief that they are not safe and that he has seen the Creature. However, the chief refuses to believe him. They do research at Dr. Chase's headquarters, and are soon put into contact with Richland. Richland tells Dr. Chase not to do anything until he arrives. Dr. Chase argues that more people could die if they do not take action but Richland does not care. Richland and a troop of NAVY SEALs board a helicopter and set off for the island. Dr. Chase ignores Richland's warning and goes back out into his boat. Peniston uses a horn to attract the creature, which is attracted to noise. The creature attacks him, but Dr. Chase and friends save him. They bring him back to their headquarters.The next day Dr. Chase discovers claw marks on his boat (proof of his theory of the Great White's innocence). Later, Peniston shows them a secret tunnel leading to the actual research facility. Meanwhile, Richland and the SEALs approach the island in their helicopter. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy go down the tunnel and discover it to be half flooded, most likely connected to the ocean. They also discover equipment and notes. They find some of Puckett's traps and wonder how they got there. By the time they realize who brought them, it is too late: the creature ambushes them. They run and the creature gives pursuit, but is only able to go so far until it can't catch up because its arms and legs are short and weak out of water. It stops and evolves its arms and legs until they are like that of a human. The creature resumes chase. The doctor and her friends manage to escape and reseal the tunnel blocking the creature. They leave the research facility by boat. The creature attacks them when they reach the dock. It is about to kill Max, but then lets him live.Dr. Macy goes to the town doctor and says that she has claw wounds. Dr. Chase discusses the encounter with Chief Gibson, but he still refuses to believe. They decide to send Max back to the States. Elizabeth stops him and says that she can't find her cousin. Elizabeth claims the only place she could be is at the old rum factory (which is now used as a club and place for teenagers to go). They then leave to find it. Puckett goes diving and is killed by the creature. Dr. Chase, Dr. Macy, and Peniston return to headquarters only to be ambushed by Richland and his thugs. He sends a few of his cronies to explore the tunnels. Meanwhile, Max & Elizabeth find the old rum factory out in the swamp. They enter, but don't find her cousin, only Tauna. They head outside to look in the swamp when suddenly a man's head floats to the surface. Max recognizes it as Puckett's. They run away, but the creature jumps out of a tree and chases them.Dr. Chase examines the stuff in the tunnel but Richland destroys it and threatens Chase. The kids make it to Tauna's house and hide and contact Dr. Chase. Before he can make it back, the creature attacks the house. When he arrives, he finds the house in ruins and believes the children are dead, but they come out of their hiding places. Chief Gibons soon arrives and Elizabeth tells him that the creature exists. He finally accepts the beast's existence. The Chief and Richland lead a hunt for the creature in the swamp. Dr. Chase goes with them and exposes Richland as one of the people present at the original event. He says how Richland's cover-up put people at risk. Richland threatens to kill him, but the Chief stops him. The creature attacks and kills Richland's men. The Chief falls into the water. But instead of saving him, Richland just watches hoping the creature will attack the Chief so he can kill it and finally settle his score. Dr. Chase rescues the Chief. The creature obliterates the bridge where Richland is standing. He falls into the water where the creature eats him. Dr. Chase and the Chief escape and make it back to town the next day.There, the chief is reunited with Elizabeth and finally understands and accepts Dr. Chase as a good man. Dr. Chase, Tall Man, Max, and Dr. Macy return to headquarters where Peniston is waiting. Dr. Macy realizes he was there. She angrily asks him why he did not kill the creature. Peniston replies that it was because they used his blood to help create it and that the creature is a part of him. They use Robin with a camera attached to her back to locate the creature. It locates the beast's lair, but before they can retrieve her, the creature attacks and the camera goes blank. Tall Man & Peniston enter the tunnel shortly after. Tall Man shoots at the creature but Peniston interferes. The creature injures Tall Man.Dr. Chase arrives and helps Tall Man escape, but are pursued by the creature. The creature quickly gains the upper hand and almost kills Chase. Max uses Peniston's sound device to destract the creature. It attacks him, but he uses a zipline to escape. Peniston takes the sound device and lures the creature into the pressure chamber. Dr. Chase locks them in and activates it, building greater and greater pressure. The creature kills Peniston. Chase allows the pressure to build up very high then smashes the window causing all the air to come out. This causes explosive decompression and the creature explodes, finally killing it. Later, the survivors walk into the sun set ready to board the boat, presumably to go back to town and never return to the island.", "output": "Question: Who was sent to a government facility?, Answer: Richland., Question: What is the name of Dr. Macy's sea lion?, Answer: Robin, Question: Who is the head scientist?, Answer: Dr. Bishop, Question: What kills Kimo?, Answer: The creature., Question: Who is Dr. Chase's assistant?, Answer: Tall Man, Question: What is the creature?, Answer: A human and shark hybrid, Question: Where was Richland sent?, Answer: A government facility on a remote island, Question: Who is the the head scientist?, Answer: Dr. Bishop, Question: What is Peniston called by the locals?, Answer: Werewolf, Question: What kills Peniston?, Answer: The creature.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

He gets a pilot to take him to the island where they live. The island is led by Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), an elderly woman who is treated like a goddess. The economy of the island relies on the production of local honey, which Malus learns has been down recently from Sister Honey (Leelee Sobieski) another nun who seems to run the honey prodution.Malus asks the villagers about Rowan, but they give him evasive answers. He later sees two men carrying a large bag that appears to be dripping blood, then he finds a fresh, unmarked grave in the churchyard. The grave turns out to only contain a burned doll, but Malus finds Rowan's sweater in the church yard.At the village school, teacher Sister Rose (Molly Parker) tries to prevent Malus from seeing the class register. When he sees that Rowan's name has been crossed out, Rose tells him that she is to be burned to death. It turns out that all the people on the island are pagan worshipers under the control of the nuns, and that Rowan is to be offered as a sacrifice.On the day of the ritual, Malus frantically searches the village for Rowan. He attacks Sister Beech, who has a bear costume for the ritual. Malus steals her costume and joins the parade led by Sister Summersisle, mingling as one of the island's residents.The parade ends at the site of the festival. Rowan is tied to a large tree, about to be burned alive. Malus rescues Rowan and they run away through the woods, but Rowan leads him back to Sister Summersisle.

Whitacre secretly gathers hundreds of hours of video and audio over several years to present to the FBI.[3][5][6] He assists in gathering evidence by clandestinely taping the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activity in business meetings at various locations around the globe such as Tokyo, Paris, Mexico City, and Hong Kong, eventually collecting enough evidence of collaboration and conspiracy to warrant a raid of ADM.Whitacre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good deed dovetails with his own major infractions, while his internal, secret struggle with bipolar disorder seems to take over his exploits.[3][7] The bulk of the film focuses on Whitacre's meltdown resulting from the pressures of wearing a wire and organizing surveillance for the FBI for three years, instigated by Whitacre's reaction, in increasingly manic overlays, to various trivial magazine articles he reads. In a stunning turn of events immediately following the covert portion of the case, headlines around the world report Whitacre had embezzled $9 million from his own company during the same period of time he was secretly working with the FBI and taping his co-workers, while simultaneously aiming to be elected as ADM CEO following the arrest and conviction of the remaining upper management members.[3] In the ensuing chaos, Whitacre appears to shift his trust and randomly destabilize his relationships with Special Agents Shepard and Herndon and numerous attorneys in the process.Authorities at ADM begin investigating the forged papertrail Whitacre had built to cover his own deeds. After being confronted with evidence of his fraud, Whitacre's defensive claims begin to spiral out of control, including an accusation of assault and battery against Agent Shepard and the FBI, which had made a substantial move to distance their case from Whitacre entirely. Because of this major infraction and Whitacre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bizarre behavior, he is sentenced to a prison term three times as long as that meted out to the white-collar criminals he helped to catch.[3] In the epilogue, Agent Herndon visits Whitacre in prison as he videotapes a futile appeal to seek a presidential pardon.

A tapir runs frantically through the forest before it springs a trip wire trap and is impaled on a swinging branch full of spikes. Young Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) puts the tapir out of its misery and eagerly divides its internal organs between his fellow hunters; Curl Nose (Amilcar Ram\u00edrez), Smoke Frog (Israel Contreras), and Cocoa Leaf (Israel R\u00edos). Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) receives the tapir's testicles as the brunt of a joke since he and his wife have yet to have any children. Jaguar Paw's father, Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead) offers some remedial help, giving Blunted some red leaves that he instructs him to use the next time he and his wife try.They are soon interrupted by a band of refugees passing through the forest, looking downtrodden. One of them, a fisherman (Hiram Soto), addresses Jaguar Paw and explains that their village was attacked and that they are seeking a new beginning. They exchange food before the group moves on, though Jaguar Paw is keen to know more about what happened. His father silences him and they return to their village. Just before they get back, Flint Sky explains to his son that the refugees were infected with fear and that it should not be brought into the village to fester.Jaguar Paw goes to his hut and admires his small son, Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio B\u00e1ez), before greeting his very pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hern\u00e1ndez). Blunted returns to his wife, Sky Flower (Iazua Larios), whose mother (Mar\u00eda Isabel D\u00edaz) impatiently tells him to hurry and give her grandchildren. Moments after entering their hut, Blunted runs out screaming and holding his privates before seating himself in a water trough. Flint Sky falls to the ground laughing, as the leaves he gave Blunted were meant to cause a burning sensation when rubbed. Blunted yells at him but starts laughing with everyone else. That night, an old storyteller (Espiridion Acosta Cache) tells how man once received gifts from the forest until the forest had nothing left to give. The villagers begin to play music and dance but Jaguar Paw's mind is distracted until Seven brings him back.The following morning, Jaguar Paw wakes early from a dream and notices fire torches quickly approaching the village. Warriors appear, igniting huts and apprehending the villagers. Jaguar Paw takes his wife and son and puts them in a deep cistern to hide. He ties a rope to a nearby rock so that they can climb out again before running back to the village to help, killing a raider along the way. However, the village is soon overrun. Blunted is held down while Sky Flower is forced into a hut where she is presumably raped and killed. Jaguar Paw attempts to free his father but is knocked down by a raider. Middle Eye (Gerardo Taracena), a raider nearly killed by Jaguar Paw, nicknames him 'Almost'. Flint Sky tells his son not to be afraid as Middle Eye props him up and slits his throat. All the surviving captives are tied up and led away, attached to each other on long poles while the children of the village are left with none but the dead for company. As the Holcane hunting party leads the captives into the forest, one of them, Snake Ink (Rodolfo Palacios), notices Jaguar Paw looking towards the cistern as they pass. Snake Ink investigates but does not notice Seven and Turtles Run. He is, however, suspicious of the rope dangling into the hole and cuts it.The fierce-looking leader of the Holcanes, Zero Wolf (Raoul Max Trujillo), reunites with his son Cut Rock (Ricardo Diaz Mendoza) who has suffered a bruising blow to the head, swelling his right eye shut. Zero Wolf cuts lines into his brow to release the pressure of blood, allowing his son to see again. The party meets up with a second raiding group which has caught the band of refugees seen the day before. Jaguar Paw recognizes the fisherman as the two groups are led further into the forest, followed by the children of the two clans. As they cross a raging river, the children are halted by the water. The eldest girl cries out that the children are hers now and she will take care of them. That night as they camp, Zero Wolf gives his son a large dagger which he says has killed many men. It is a symbol of Cut Rock's manhood, proven by the successful raid. Blunted laments and promises to take as many captors with him to Hell if he does not find his Sky Flower there.The next day, while treading a narrow path on a cliff, Cocoa Leaf, severely injured in the village raid, looses his footing and dangles over the edge. Jaguar Paw and the others manage to pull him back onto the path while Middle Eye watches with interest and goads them to regain their footing. He then cuts Cocoa Leaf free of his binds and shoves him over the cliffside. Zero Wolf berates him for losing one of their captives though Middle Eye asserts he was only dead weight. Still, Middle Eye dares not argue further and assures not to repeat his actions before walking beside Jaguar Paw, taunting him and again calling him 'Almost'.As they near civilization, the party crosses through a deforested area and failed maize crops where villagers lay dead, decimated by a plague. A small girl, sick and with sores on her face and hands, approaches the party but, when Snake Ink forcefully pushes her away, suddenly looks towards Jaguar Paw with a blank expression. She then looks at Snake Ink and prophesies their doom, warning of a man who brings blackness of night and a jaguar, is reborn of mud and earth, and who will bring those that will cancel out the sky and 'scratch you out'. She says that this man is among them now. The party moves on as she continues to call to them.They enter a city where workers toil in limestone quarries, covered white by the excess and spreading quick lime over buildings. A worker coughs blood and an old man approaches the captives, drooling and begging for help. He is kicked away by a Holcane and told to die with dignity. The women captives are separated from the men and are sold as slaves. Blunted watches as his mother-in-law is auctioned but rejected due to her age. She is freed to wander and she follows Blunted as far as she can go, touching his arm assuredly before closing her eyes against a pillar, helpless.The men are led through a tunnel where they see pictures on the walls depicting human sacrifices. Women paint their bodies blue as they are led to the top of a step pyramid. The heads of victims are tossed down the steps and collected in baskets at the bottom. Jaguar watches as the first captive (Jos\u00e9 Su\u00e1rez) is sacrificed, his heart ripped out and his head severed. The same fate befalls Curl Nose before Jaguar Paw is brought to the sacrificial pedestal. Seemingly accepting his fate, he waits until the high priest (Fernando Hernandez) stops due to a solar eclipse. The priest announces to the clamoring crowd that their god is pleased and begs for the sun to come back. However, the priest and the Mayan leaders are well aware that the eclipse will eventually pass; they use the celestial events to wield power over the public and their enemies. He then instructs Zero Wolf to get rid of the other captives.Jaguar Paw and the others are taken to an old ball court where they are instructed to run the length in pairs towards the forest at the end with a cynical promise of freedom should they make it. Cut Rock runs ahead to the end of the court as a 'finisher' and it becomes clear that the captives are to be used as target practice. Blunted and Smoke Frog are the first to run, but Blunted is speared in the lower back and Smoke Frog is hit with a large stone before being finished by Cut Rock. Next, Jaguar Paw and the fisherman are told to flee. Jaguar Paw's necklace is ripped off by Middle Eye and thrown into the dirt; a dark omen, before he runs. Though they evade most of the projectiles, the fisherman is shot through the head by Snake Ink's arrow and Jaguar Paw is impaled through his side, falling near Blunted. Before Cut Rock can finish him, Blunted lunges and grabs Cut Rock by the leg, buying Jaguar Paw some time. Cut Rock kills Blunted with a single blow to the head but Jaguar Paw breaks off the arrow head in his own body and stabs Cut Rock in the neck. Cut Rock stumbles as Jaguar Paw stands, removes the arrow shaft from his side, and runs into the forest.Zero Wolf runs to his son and coaxes him into eternal sleep. As his son dies in his arms, Zero Wolf takes back his dagger and puts his son's necklace into his belt before running after Jaguar Paw, bent on revenge. The other holcanes follow him. Jaguar Paw runs through a corn crop and falls into a mass open grave filled with the remains of thousands of sacrificial victims. He runs across the decaying bodies into the jungle, where he climbs a tree and hides, blood still dripping from his wound. The holcanes run past beneath him. When they are gone, he turns to see a black jaguar cub growling at him. He hears a louder roar behind him and turns to see the threatening mother jaguar. Meanwhile, the holcanes stop, realizing they have lost Jaguar Paw's trail. One of them notices blood on Middle Eye's shoulder and they backtrack, keeping their eyes to the trees. They soon see Jaguar Paw running through the forest and Speaking Wind (Marco Antonio Argueta) pursues him. As their paths merge in a clearing, Speaking Wind is attacked by the jaguar that was chasing Jaguar Paw. He is viciously mauled to death before the others arrive and kill the jaguar.Drunkards Four (Bernardo Ruiz) dislikes the bad omen associated with killing the jaguar while Snake Ink remembers the strange child's prophecy and remind him it was foretold. Zero Wolf hushes them all, eager to find and kill Jaguar Paw. The chase lasts through the night and into morning. At one point, Drunkards Four approaches a tree where blue paint which Jaguar Paw rubbed onto the tree, but he is bitten in the neck by an asp. Hanging Moss (Ariel Galvan) advises him to blood let for a quicker death. As the holcanes eventually catch up to Jaguar Paw, he is cornered and forced to leap over the edge of a high waterfall. He survives and stands on the riverbank, calling out to the holcanes that this is his forest and his descendants will continue to hunt in it. Impatient, Zero Wolf stabs Snake Ink when he suggests climbing down rather than jumping. Buzzard Hook (Ammel Rodrigo Mendoza) is the first to jump, but dies when he hits his head on a submerged rock. The others are luckier and continue their pursuit.As he flees, Jaguar Paw lands in a muddy sinkhole, but manages to climb out. After he does so, he pauses and decides that he is not afraid and will no longer run. As the holcanes approach, Jaguar Paw, covered in black mud, confronts them and tosses a live wasps' hive at them, instigating the wasps to attack. Jaguar Paw runs towards a stream where he finds a poison arrow frog and collects its venom on a few large thorns. He runs in a circle and hides in the reeds, waiting for the holcanes as thunder rolls overhead.Meanwhile, Seven attempts to escape the cistern by tossing a stalactite to the surface with the rope attached to it. She manages to climb halfway, but the rock dislodges, causing her to fall. Though she is barely hurt, her water breaks from the trauma.As the holcanes pass Jaguar Paw's hiding place, he takes a large leaf and rolls it into a blowgun. He fires his darts at Hanging Moss, already weakened by the wasp stings. As Hanging Moss falls to the ground, his cries attract Middle Eye, who runs back. Middle Eye comes face to face with Jaguar Paw and they run at each other, each eying the bludgeon that Hanging Moss dropped. Middle Eye swings his own as they approach each other and Jaguar Paw barely manages to duck, suffering a mild blow to the head. As he slides under Middle Eye's attack, Jaguar Paw picks up Hanging Moss' bludgeon and rises to strike Middle Eye in the temple. Middle Eye calls him Almost one last time as Jaguar Paw kills him with a blow under the chin. It suddenly begins to rain and Jaguar Paw races to the cistern, knowing that it will soon fill with water. Zero Wolf and the remaining holcanes, Monkey Jaw (Carlos Ramos) and Ten Peccary (Richard Can), see Middle Eye's body and Jaguar Paw racing into the forest. Enraged, Zero Wolf outruns the other two in his pursuit. Jaguar Paw gets to the cistern to find it filling with water and Seven in labor, screaming for him to hurry. An arrow narrowly misses Jaguar Paw and he runs into the jungle as Zero Wolf closes in. Monkey Jaw and Ten Peccary pause by the cistern to see Seven and Turtles Run at the bottom before resuming the chase.Jaguar Paw stops at a specific spot in the forest that he recognizes and turns to face Zero Wolf who shoots an arrow into his shoulder. Though wounded, Jaguar Paw stands, waits, and watches as Zero Wolf charges at him with his dagger drawn. Zero Wolf fails to notice a trip wire and sets off the tapir trap, becoming impaled on its sharp spikes. He dies as Monkey Jaw and Ten Peccary arrive. They chase Jaguar Paw to the beach where he collapses from exhaustion. When they catch up with him, they stop, staring at the sea where a small fleet of Spanish ships is anchored. Soldiers and missionaries are rowing to shore in small boats. Mesmerized, Monkey Jaw and Ten Peccary approach the shoreline while Jaguar Paw races back to the cistern. He finds that Seven has just given birth and pulls his family out of the cistern.Later, when the rain stops, Jaguar Paw carries his newborn son, followed by Seven and Turtles Run. They look back towards the Spanish ships and Seven asks if they should go to them. Jaguar Paw says that they should, instead, go to the forest and seek a new beginning.", "output": "Question: Who gives birth to Jaguar Paw's son?, Answer: Seven, Question: Who decides not to risk approaching the conquistadors?, Answer: Jaguar Paw, Question: Who plays cocoa Leaf?, Answer: Jos Surez, Question: What are the Europeans holding up as they come ashore?, Answer: Large cross, Question: What does the pit cave also serve as?, Answer: Water reservoir,, Question: Who is left behind by the raiders to fend for themselves?, Answer: the villagers, Question: What does the group leader ask for permission to do?, Answer: To pass, Question: Why are the captives and Jaguar Paw spared from sacrifice?, Answer: to be taken away and disposed of, Question: Whose family is stuck in a pit cave?, Answer: Blunted, Question: Who kills Zero Wolf's son?, Answer: Jaguar Paw, Question: What is done with the female captives?, Answer: are sold as slaves, Question: Where do Jaguar Paw and Flint Sky encounter the refugees?, Answer: Mesoamerican rainforest, Question: Who does the little girl prophesy?, Answer: The jaguar, Question: What are the captives offered if they do not get killed during target practice?, Answer: freedom, Question: What is the name of Jaguar Paw's son?, Answer: Turtles Run", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

All of Dorothy's friends become trapped in the situations they were in when she first met them, meaning they all must visit the Wizard as they did in the pilot for the TV series. Dorothy receives a letter from the Scarecrow, called Socrates in the special, as in the series, telling her that everyone is happy with the gifts the Wizard gave them, and that they miss her very much. She goes to find her magic Silver Shoes and is instantly taken back to Oz again by another Kansas twister, this time not by house, but an apple tree. Once she arrives there she is greeted by the Munchkins in Munchkinville. Glinda arrives to tell her that the previously melted Wicked Witch of the West has become reconstituted and is wreaking havoc again, having taken Socrates' diploma and burned it up, destroyed the heart of the Tin Woodman, called Rusty, by turning herself into a Tin Woman, and dropping him into a pond where he rusted over again. She has also stolen the medal that belonged to the Cowardly Lion, called Dandy, and turned it into a daisy, and is planning to get Dorothy's silver shoes again.Dorothy sets off to find her friends, without knowing the Wicked Witch is watching them in her Crystal Ball. She finds and oils Rusty who has rusted after the Witch tricked him. They find Socrates in a corn field on a pole scaring crows again and get him down. They find Dandy crying, and after some unexpectedly cruel bullying from Socrates and Rusty, they cheer him up. After the four friends are reunited, they arrive at the Emerald City, only to be tricked by the Witch, who has captured the Wizard and taken over as the ruler of Oz. The Wizard, who in this continuity is not an Omaha huckster but an Ozite born and bred and the elected ruler of Oz, tells them to destroy her again and he will give them what they want. She arrives back at her castle just before Dorothy and her friends, but before they arrive she sends flying alligators to kill them. Socrates' quick thinking saves them as they hide under his straw (a method employed in more than one of the Oz books). Rusty saves them from a lightning bolt by sacrificing himself, which kills him, despite his being made of tin. Dorothy asks Glinda if she will help and a glowing ball brings him back to life. They arrive and are trapped by the Witch. She grabs Dorothy and tries to take her silver slippers. The gang (including the Wizard himself) try to get her back from the Witch, who gives her and Dandy the slippers. Dorothy, who is being held upside-down from the window, tells Dandy that he will turn to stone if he takes them. The Witch takes them only to be turned into stone, crumble, and fall apart. The gang returns to the Emerald City, only to find out that the Wizard is, after all, a humbug, unable as he always was to return Dorothy home. Glinda appears to tell Dorothy the reason that her friends didn't turn to stone was because they had brains, a heart, and courage. She also explains that the Witch was cruel and heartless, brainless enough to think evil could conquer good and cowardly in that she used slaves and suppressed others. Dorothy wishes to go back, and instantly a Kansas twister whisks her and Toto back home to Aunt Em and Uncle Henry again.", "output": "Question: What does Dorothy hand over to Princess Ozma ?, Answer: the ruby slippers, Question: What did the scarecrow turn into?, Answer: Green ornament, Question: In what month does Dorothy return from Oz ?, Answer: six months, Question: Who does Dorothy see peering at her through her bedroom window?, Answer: Billina and Ozma, Question: Where does the enraged Nome King trap Mombi in?, Answer: a cage, Question: What is Dorothy asked to be ?, Answer: to be Queen of Oz, Question: What's Gumps body made of?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What is the name of Dorothy's Chicken?, Answer: coop, Question: What are the citizens of Emerald City turned into?, Answer: turned to stone, Question: In what year does Dorothy return home ?, Answer: 1899, Question: What does Dorothy uses to materialize Tik-Tok?, Answer: ORNAMENT, Question: Whose hospital was struck by lightning and burned down?, Answer: Doctor, Question: Who does Dorothy locates as a last guess? she locates the, Answer: Tick-Tock, Question: Who was King Scarcrow captured by?, Answer: by the Nome King, Question: Who was brough to life via Mombi's Powder of life?, Answer: Jack Pumpkinhead", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Despite Micky's reservations, his mother and brother agree so that they can all get the purse and Micky is defeated. Micky retreats from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming, a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender.After several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, concerned it will turn out the same. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions he received an offer to be paid to train in Las Vegas, but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, impersonating a police officer to steal the client's money. This is foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky tries to stop the police from beating his brother and a police officer brutally breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released, but Dicky is sent to jail. Micky washes his hands of Dicky.On the night of the HBO documentary's airing, Dicky's family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see it is called Crack in America how crack addiction ruined Dicky's career and life. Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed, but then implements his brother's advice and triumphs; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed.Upon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he's no longer allowed per Micky's agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlene's apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to London for the title fight. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title.

TheCountess's tomb is said to lie near a small village somewhere in northernFrance, so the girls load up their car and go in search of the place.Short on gas, daylight, and directions, however, they accept an invitationto stay at the rustic (meaning 'no lights, no phone, no motorcar')countryhouse of writer Waldemar Daninsky. Over a dinner of cold cuts andwine, Waldemar reveals that he's writing a book about the history ofgothic churches and monuments, but he falls silent when Elvira mentionsher search for Wandessa.The girls retire for the night, but Elvira is awakened from her sleepwhen Waldemar's sister Elizabeth [Yelena Samarina] steals into the room, feels her up,attempts to strangle her, and warns her to leave before the night of thefull moon.

She does not quite fit with the bank's corporate image, despite being a good employee and popular with her co-workers. However, she is often chastised by her no-nonsense boss James Page (Peter Michael Goetz).Set against the backdrop of the pre-Glasnost Cold War, Terry is contacted over her AC computer desktop by an unseen man calling himself \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" who turns out to be a British Intelligence agent in Eastern Europe that is being pursued by the KGB. After being given a riddle for his password, Terry determines the password to be B-flat, after the key in which \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" is supposedly written (as the actual song by The Rolling Stones is recorded in the key of B-flat). Jack sends her to the British Consulate to deliver the message \"Dog's barking, can't fly without umbrella\" to Department C. Despite feeling ludicrous, Terry delivers the message to the head consul Jeremy Talbot (John Wood) who is apparently puzzled and sends Terry away, telling her there is no Department C. Jack then asks her to enter his apartment in New York to retrieve a frying pan, on which are Jack's CIA contacts to acquire a passport.Shortly after her visit to the British Consulate, Terry begins to be monitored. Peter Caen (Stephen Collins), a CIA agent working under the alias Marty Phillips, arrives at First National Bank as a new co-worker of Terry in order to spy on her.One evening, after Jack tells Terry to retrieve the frying pan from his apartment, a computer technician (James Belushi) shows up to repair her terminal, but when Terry calls Sperry Corporation to confirm his identity, the technician vanishes. After Terry aquires the frying pan from Jack's apartment, the computer tech appears again as a taxi driver, who tries abduct her, but Terry bashes him on the head with the frying pan and escapes.Another day later, Terry is finally contacted by one of Jack's contacts, Mark Van Meter (Jeroen Krabb\u00e9), who meets her at the docks. After being stunned to realize Terry is a banker and has no relationship at all with the intelligence community, Van Meter notices they are being watched and pushes Terry off the docks and into the East River to save her life, but is shot and killed himself by unseen assasins. The police dismiss Terry's claim of the murder and Peter bails her out of jail.Unsure who to trust, Terry contacts Jack on the computer again who then tells her how to break into the British Consulate central computer. Conning her way in under the guise of an entertainer, she manages to enter the mainframe, but Talbot deactivates the computer link before Jack receives a contact. Going through one of Jack's romantic contacts, Lady Sarah Billings (Sara Botsford), Terry is rebuffed and then captured by the KGB, who lock her in a phone booth and drag her around the city. After escaping when the booth is knocked over, Terry is injected with truth serum by the computer tech (now posing as a police officer), but escapes after trapping his arm in a car window and rolling the car into traffic.Terry again contacts Sarah and makes an impassioned plea for her help. Sarah tells Terry she would rather let Jack be killed than risk losing face. A disgusted Terry chastises Sarah for her indifference to Jack's plight and walks out. She then stumbles into work and after embarrassing Mr. Page by yanking off his fake hairpiece in front of the entire office, passes out.Terry awakes at home and is dropped in on by Sarah, who has had a change of heart and gives her a contact, which Jack can use to escape. After passing the contact to Jack, she is again captured by the KGB and learns that the contact is a KGB mole who turns out to be Talbot himself. After nearly being tortured with a power sander, Terry escapes and is caught by police. After realizing the police are arresting her rather than protecting her, Terry escapes. She rushes to the bank and is again ambushed by the KGB and Talbot. After struggling with the KGB and biting Talbot's groin, she confirms to Jack that the contact will kill him.

Nothing has been stolen, but the furniture is stacked in the center of the room, a collection of porcelain figures is in the toilet, and the stereo is in the freezer. A note is left, stating: \"Your days of plenty are numbered.\" It is signed The Edukators.Jule Julia Jentsch is a young activist. She goes around telling people about the working conditions of sweatshops. She returns to her apartment only to be given an eviction notice. Jan Daniel Br\u00fchl is a young man. He is riding the trolley when he overhears an elderly homeless man who is being ridiculed. He hands the man his ticket and gets off. Jule is dating Peter Stipe Erceg, Jans roommate. Jule is suspicious of Jan and finds him strange, voicing her concerns after a scene where he causes a racket in another room while Jule and Peter are having sex. Peter assures her that Jan is a good guy.Peter offers to take Jule with him on a trip to Barcelona. Though she does not have the money, Peter offers to pay her expenses, and so she initially agrees.Jan and Peter go out on what they claim is their job, putting up posters. On the way they discuss the importance of the difference between what they do and petty theft. Jan argues that stealing things just betrays their cause, while Peter is more laid-back and laments that they could have sold an expensive Rolex watch for good money after Jan throws it out of their van's window. Afterwards, we see Jule working in a high-class restaurant where she is treated like a servant; she keys one of the expensive customers' cars in frustration after being treated like dirt by them.The next morning Jule receives a call stating she clear out of her apartment immediately and clean it up including paint the walls. This means that she cannot go on holiday with Peter; he offers to stay, but Jule doesn't want him to waste his opportunity, so he recruits Jan to help. Jule and Jan paint side-by-side in awkward silence. Eventually, Jule turns some music on and they bond over their common interest in the same musician. Jule tells Jan of her financial trouble due to an automobile accident she was in last year with an executive driving a Mercedes. Now she must repay the man the cost to buy his new Mercedes - she is nearly 100,000 euros in debt. Jan sees this as unjust and volunteers to help Jule handle the problem.Jan invites her over for dinner and they talk about fear and using it as a drug to do things you never thought possible. Jules goes home and Jan stakes out a house and almost gets caught by the police. The next day Jan helps Jule hang wallpaper. Angry at the injustices they have suffered, Julia decides to forfeit the rental deposit by letting out some pent-up frustration; they end up wrapping Jule in wallpaper and painting \"Every heart is a revolutionary cell\" onto the wall in red. Jan takes several photos of Jule standing in front of the defaced wall.That night at work, Jule is caught smoking in the kitchen with the bartender. He is fired and Jule tries cover up for him and is fired as well. Jan and Jule stand on a rooftop discussing the current state of revolution and how it has entered popular culture. To help with Jules pent-up aggression, Jan shares with her what he and Peter do at night. She recognizes the area and begs Jan to drive a few blocks down the street. They come upon a house and Jule jumps out to verify she is correct. It is the house of the man who owns the Mercedes she hit. She persuades Jan to break in, Edukator-style and he relents only if the alarm company that Peter used to work for guards the house. Lucky for Jule it is. They break in and begin to move around furniture. Eventually, at Jule's request, they decide to throw the couch into the pool. As they carry it, Jules takes off her coat. When the throw the couch into the pool, Jan falls in. He pulls Jule in and she discovers he has the pictures from the wallpaper day in his jacket. They kiss in the pool.Jan goes to the bathroom to process what has happened and Jule goes to get some alcohol, throwing several expensive bottles onto the ground before finding something she likes. While Jule is standing on the terrace, floodlights turn on and Jule runs inside. Her and Jan gather their items and get away before the police show up. The next morning Peter comes home. Jule comes over and tells Jan she lost her phone. Jan tells her not to mention this to Peter, then runs to the car to look for it without result. He concludes she must indeed have left it at the house.That night Jan, Peter, and Jule go out partying. On the way home, Jule goes her separate way and Jan says he is going to go for a walk while Peter goes to bed. Jan and Jule return to the house looking for the phone and wiping fingerprints. Just as Jule finds her phone the owner, Hardenberg Burghart Klau\u00dfner, comes home. He comes in and recognizes Jule as the girl from the accident. They scuffle and Jan comes out and hits Hardenberg on the head. He is knocked unconscious. Jan and Jule freak out: Jan has Jule call Peter to help them out. They tie up Hardenberg. The three discuss a plan.Meanwhile Hardenberg has grabbed a phone and is calling the police. Left without any other options, they grab Hardenberg and throw him in their car and drive away before the police show up. They arrive on a dirt road in the woods, where they walk to a cabin belonging to Jule's uncle. The following morning they continue their discussion on what to do. Peter goes to the local village to stock up on supplies. Hardenberg asks them their motives for kidnapping him. He and Jan go back on forth arguing about capitalism. Peter storms off and the relationship between Jan and Jule is growing.That night at dinner, Hardenberg shares how he was once a revolutionary like them. Hardenberg warns them he must call the housekeeper so that she will not go in the house and find the mess. They decide to drive him into town but Peter will hold a gun to him in case he decides to run off. (In private, Peter reveals to Jan that it is a broken gas pistol, unable to do any harm.) Jan volunteers to be the one to take him along with the gun. That night Peter finds the picture of Jule in Jan's jacket.The next day, they all drive into the village to use the pay phone. Jan takes Hardenberg to the phone. He tells his housekeeper not to come and when a tourist approaches the duo, Hardenberg lies and calls Jan his son, who feels isolated without using the phone. Jan, Jule, and Peter are surprised by Hardenberg's cooperation.Back at the cabin, Hardenberg and Jan talk about how he changed from a revolutionary in the 1970's to a businessman today. Peter begins to notice the growing relationship between Jan and Jule. At dinner that night, Hardenberg mentions their free love and how he used to live that way. Peter seems confused. The next morning Jan and Jule go out to buy some more supplies. Along the way they stop and succumb to their feelings for each other. While they are gone, Hardenberg appears to have escaped, but Peter eventually finds him a short distance away from the Cabin, staring off into the distance. Hardenberg explains how he's tired of his rich yet empty lifestyle and has considered giving it all up and moving to the countryside. He also tells Peter of Jan and Jule's relationship. Upon their return, Peter confronts them and leaves in a rage after he and Jan fight; he drives away, leaving behind only the broken gun for Jan. He goes out on a night of drinking, only to return the next morning.They decide that it was wrong to kidnap Hardenberg, as they did it only to save themselves and not for any lofty ideals. Thus they agree to take Hardenberg home. Peter and Jan make up as well. The trio drives Hardenberg back to his home. There, he releases Jule of her debt to him and promises not to call the police. Jan is ready to give up the Edukators life, but Peter persuades him not to.Hardenberg eventually changes his mind and calls the police. A special police commando shows up at Jan and Peter's apartment blasting down the doors; the audience is led to believe that Jan, Jule, and Peter are there, but they are not. All they find is a note on the wall reading, People Never Change. Instead Jan, Jule, and Peter are living in free love in Barcelona.", "output": "Question: With whom does Hardenberg struggles with ?, Answer: Hardenberg walks in the door and struggles with Jule when he recognises her, Question: Who opens the door to a hotel maid?, Answer: Hardenberg, Question: Where did the police find a note: \"Manche Menschen andern sich nie\"?, Answer: In the phone booth, Question: Whom does the cabin belong to?, Answer: Hardenberg, Question: Where is Hardenberg?, Answer: affluent Berlin suburb of Zehlendorf, Question: Why did Peter and Jan fall out?, Answer: Peter and Jan temporarily fall out over Jan's developing romance with Jule, Question: Who gives letter to Jule?, Answer: Jan, Question: Who convinces Jan to break into Hardenberg's home?, Answer: Jules, Question: who was a radical during the 1960s?, Answer: Jan, Jule, and Hardenberg, Question: What do Jan and Jule conceal?, Answer: their activities the night before", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Although already in her forties, she still lives in an apartment with her domineering mother. Her father is a long-standing resident in a psychiatric asylum.The audience is gradually shown truths about Erika's private life. Behind her assured fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, she is a woman whose sexual repression is manifested in a long list of paraphilia, including (but by no means limited to) voyeurism and sadomasochistic fetishes such as sexual self-mutilation.When Erika meets Walter Klemmer, a charming 17-year-old engineering student from a middle class background, a mutual obsession develops. Even though she initially attempts to prevent consistent contact and even tries to undermine his application to the conservatory, he eventually becomes her pupil. Like her, he appreciates and is a gifted interpreter of Schumann and Schubert.Erika destroys the musical prospects of an insecure but talented girl, Anna Schober, driven by her jealousy of the girl's contact with Walter\u00e2\u0080\u0094and also, perhaps, by her fears that Anna's life will mirror her own. She does so by hiding shards of glass inside one of Anna's coat pockets, damaging her right hand and ruining her aspirations to play at the forthcoming jubilee concert. Erika then pretends to be sympathetic when Anna's mother asks for advice on her daughter's recuperation. (The sub-plot of the pupil and her mother, mirroring the main relationship in the film, is absent in Jelinek's novel.) In a moment of dramatic irony, the girl's mother rhetorically asks Erika who could do something so evil.Walter pursues Erika into a lavatory immediately after she has secretly ruined her pupil's hand. Walter passionately kisses Erika even though she is rebuffing him. Erika finally responds to his passion, but insists on repeatedly controlling, humiliating and frustrating Walter.Walter is increasingly insistent in his desire to start a sexual relationship with Erika, but Erika is only willing if he will satisfy her masochistic fantasies, which repulse him. The film climaxes, however, when he attacks her in her apartment in the fashion she let him know she desired, beating and then raping her, outside her mother's bedroom door. He then leaves.The next day, Erika takes a kitchen knife to the concert where she is scheduled to fill in for the injured Anna. She delays going to the stage because she is desperate to see Walter, but Walter enters cheerful and laughing with his family. Moments before the concert is due to start, Erika stabs herself superficially in the shoulder and exits the concert hall into the street.", "output": "Question: What does Erika hide in Anna's pockets?, Answer: shards of glass, Question: Which of Anna's hands are damaged?, Answer: right hand, Question: Who is Walter hesitant to start a sexual relationship with?, Answer: Erika, Question: Whose hand was damaged in the movie?, Answer: Anna's., Question: who does walter pursue into the lavatory?, Answer: erika, Question: What did Anna cut her hand on?, Answer: Shards of glass., Question: Who is an insecure but talented girl?, Answer: Anna Schobar, Question: Who is Erika desperate to see?, Answer: Walter, Question: Who is jealous of Anna?, Answer: Erika, Question: What does Erika take with her to the concert?, Answer: A kitchen knife, Question: What is Walter Klemmer a gifted interpreter of?, Answer: Schumann and Schubert, Question: Who does Erika live with?, Answer: her mother, Question: What kind of fantasies does Erika have?, Answer: Masochistic, Question: Who is unable to play at the jubilee concert?, Answer: Anna, Question: What happens when Erika meets Walter Klemmer?, Answer: a mutual obsession develops, Question: Which hand was damaged?, Answer: The right hand., Question: Who asks Erika for advice on Anna's recuperation?, Answer: Anna's mother, Question: What is the audience gradually shown truths about?, Answer: Erika's private life", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Having fully embraced his unholy lineage and run his company for seven years, Damien now attempts to reshape his destiny by halting the Second Coming of Christ. However, Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi), a priest from the Subiaco monastery where Father Spiletto spent his final days and observed Damien from afar since his adopted father's death, acquires the Seven Daggers of Megiddo that were dug out of the ruins of the Thorn Museum in Chicago. Joined by six other priests, DeCarlo plans to kill Damien while finding the Christ Child. Meanwhile, Damien becomes romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow). Learning of his assassins and taking out all but DeCarlo over time, he proceeds to mold Reynolds's young son Peter (Barnaby Holm) into a disciple by playing on the boy's desire for a father figure.After the alignment of stars in the Cassiopeia constellation on March 24, 1982, generating what is described as a second Star of Bethlehem, Damien realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming and orders his followers to kill all boys born in England on the morning of March 24, 1982 to prevent the Christ Child's return to power. A week after a string of thirty one infant deaths, Reynolds encounters DeCarlo as he reveals Damien's true identity to her while giving her evidence of the murders. The next day, Damien rapes and sodomises Reynolds. The following morning Reynolds discovers Damien's birthmark. Damien tells Peter to follow DeCarlo, resulting in Damien learning that his advisor, Harvey Dean, had concealed the date of his son's birth when Peter reports DeCarlo visiting Dean's wife Barbara and revealing her husband's role in the infant murders. Dean refuses to kill his son and makes preparations to flee the country, only to return home and be killed by his wife, Barbara, who has fallen under Damien's control and murdered their child.DeCarlo later visits Reynolds and reveals that Peter is now under Damien's influence and that the real Christ Child is now beyond Damien's reach. Agreeing to help DeCarlo, Reynolds tricks Damien with the promise to bring him to the church ruins where the Christ Child is in exchange for Peter. The plan backfires when Damien spots DeCarlo first and uses Peter as a human shield against the dagger. As Peter dies in his mother's arms, Damien throttles Father DeCarlo before calling out for Christ to appear before him and \"face him\". This leaves Damien open to be stabbed in the back by Reynolds using DeCarlo's Megiddo dagger. As Damien staggers through the courtyard and collapses, a vision of Christ appears in the archway above him. Damien scolds Christ for thinking he has won, and then dies. DeCarlo reappears carrying Peter's body and hands him to a praying Kate before they leave the ruins.Revelation chapter 21, verse 4, is seen, indicating that when Christ returns to earth, peace will reign for all who faithfully awaited the Lord's return.", "output": "Question: Who killed Dean?, Answer: His wife, Barbara killed Dean., Question: Who plays the role of Father DeCarlo?, Answer: Rossano Brazzi, Question: Who did Damien rape?, Answer: Reynolds., Question: Who does DeCarlo visit?, Answer: Reynolds, Question: How many infant deaths occurred?, Answer: Thirty one, Question: What does Father DeCarlo acquire?, Answer: The Seven Daggers of Megiddo, Question: What event was occurring that triggered Damien to order all boys be killed?, Answer: The second coming, Question: Barnaby Holm plays which character?, Answer: Peter, Question: What date did Damien instruct his followers to kill all boys born in England?, Answer: March 24, 1982, Question: who is the CEO of international conglomerate?, Answer: Damien Thorn, Question: Who does Reynolds trick?, Answer: Damien, Question: What does Reynolds discover on Damien?, Answer: His birthmark, Question: What will reign for all those who faithfully awaited the Lord's return?, Answer: Peace, Question: Why did Barbara kill her husband?, Answer: Barbara killed Dean because she was under the influence of Damien., Question: What date were all the boys of England ordered to be killed?, Answer: March 24,1982, Question: Where does Peter die?, Answer: Mother's arms, Question: What does Damien Thorn want to do?, Answer: Halt the Second Coming of Christ, Question: Who plays the US ambassador to Great Britain?, Answer: Robert Arden, Question: How old is CEO Damien Thorn?, Answer: 32 years, Question: How old is is Damin Thorn?, Answer: thirty two years, Question: what is the name of Kate Reynolds son?, Answer: Peter", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

They become friends as they undergo their respective treatments. Carter is a gifted amateur historian and family man who had wanted to become a history professor, but in his youth had been \"broke, black, and with a baby on the way\" and thus never rose above his job at the McCreath body shop. Edward is a four-times-divorced healthcare tycoon and cultured loner who enjoys nothing more than tormenting his personal valet/servant, Matthew (Hayes), whom he calls Thomas. He makes Matthew serve Carter as well as him and orders his employee and doctor (Morrow) to familiarize himself with Carter's health.Carter begins writing a \"bucket list,\" or things to do before he \"kicks the bucket.\" After hearing he has less than a year, Carter wads it up and tosses it on the floor. Edward finds it the next morning. He urges Carter to do everything on the list (suggesting he add things like skydiving) and offers to finance the trip. Carter agrees, despite the protests of his wife, Virginia (Todd).The pair begins an around-the-world vacation, embarking on race car driving, skydiving, climbing the Pyramids, and going on a lion safari in Africa. They discuss a rare coffee and its unusual taste. They also confide about faith and family, revealing that Carter has long been feeling less in love with his wife and that Edward is deeply hurt by his estrangement with his only daughter, who disowned him after he sent some people to \"take care of\" her abusive husband (hinting at physical assault, but ruling out murder).In Hong Kong, Edward hires a prostitute (Rowena King) for Carter, who has never had sex with any woman but his wife. Carter declines and asks to return home, and reciprocates by trying to reunite Edward with his daughter. Edward angrily storms off. Carter returns home to his wife, children, and grandchildren.The family reunion is short-lived. In the preparation for a romantic interlude, Carter suffers a seizure and is rushed to the hospital. The cancer has spread to his brain. Edward, who is now in remission, visits him and they share a few moments, where Carter reveals to great amusement the disgusting origin of the \"world's most rare coffee\" (Kopi Luwak), over which Edward obsesses and Carter has refused to drink. Carter crosses off \"laugh till I cry\" from his bucket list and insists Edward finish the list without him. Carter goes into surgery but the procedure is unsuccessful. He dies on the operating table.Edward delivers a eulogy at the funeral, explaining that he and Carter had been complete strangers, but the last three months of Carter's life were the best three months of his (Edward's). He crosses off \"help a complete stranger for a common good\" from the list. We see Edward finally attempt to reconcile with his daughter. She not only accepts him back into her life but also introduces him to the granddaughter he never knew. After greeting the little girl with a kiss on the cheek, Edward crosses \"kiss the most beautiful girl in the world\" off the list.In the epilogue, it is revealed that Edward lived until the age of 81, and his ashes are brought to the top of the Himalayas. It turns out to be Matthew who does this, and as he places Edward's ashes alongside a can containing Carter's, he crosses off the last item on the Bucket List (\"witness something truly majestic\") and places it beside them.

To get Chudnofsky's attention, Britt uses Daily Sentinel as a vehicle to publish articles about the \"high-profile criminal\" the Green Hornet.Britt hires Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz), who has a degree in journalism and a minor in criminology, as his assistant and researcher, and uses her unwitting advice to raise the Green Hornet's profile. Britt and Kato blow up several of Chudnofsky's meth labs, leaving calling cards so Chudnofsky can contact them. Throughout all this, the Daily Sentinel's managing editor Mike Axford (Edward James Olmos) fears this single-minded coverage will endanger Britt's life, and District Attorney Frank Scanlon (David Harbour) frets over public perception that he cannot stop the Green Hornet.Britt asks Lenore out, but she rebuffs him and instead invites Kato to dinner, making Britt jealous. Kato learns from her that mobsters often offer a peace summit to rivals in order to get close enough to kill them; Britt then tells Kato that Chudnofsky has offered them such a meeting. Kato tries dissuading him, but Britt, feeling overshadowed, follows his instincts. This nearly proves fatal when Chudnofsky tries to kill them.Barely escaping to the mansion, Britt and Kato argue and fight, and Britt fires both Kato and Lenore, who he believes are in a relationship. Kato receives an email from Chudnofsky on the Hornet's calling-card email address, offering $1 million and half of Los Angeles to the \"Hornet\" if he kills Britt or keeps him alive, and he is deciding to dub himself \"Bloodnosfky\". Meanwhile, Britt discovers Scanlon is corrupt, learning that he tried to bribe James into downplaying the city's level of crime in order to help his career.Scanlon invites Britt to meet in a restaurant, where he reveals he murdered Britt's father with a drug injection similar to an allergic reaction of a bee sting. Kato arrives, and instead of killing Britt attacks Chudnofsky's men and Scanlon, allowing him and Britt, who Chudnofsky deduces is the real Green Hornet, to escape. At the Daily Sentinel, Britt intends to upload a recording of Scanlon's confession onto the Web\u00e2\u0080\u0094and belatedly discovers he did not manage to record it. Chudnofsky and his men, who followed the duo there, engage them in a fierce firefight. Kato ultimately stabs Chudnofsky in the eyes with wood in self-defense and Britt shoots him to death with Chudnofsky's gun. A SWAT team appears and fires at the Green Hornet and Kato, who use the remains of their nearly demolished Black Beauty to run Scanlon out the 10th-floor window, killing him. The Green Hornet and Kato flee to Lenore's house, where she learns their secret identities and that she has been the accidental mastermind behind the Green Hornet's plots. Despite being furious, she helps them hide from the police and tends to Britt's shoulder gunshot wound.The next morning, Britt promotes Axford to editor-in-chief and stages being shot in the shoulder by Kato, further establishing the Green Hornet as a threat and allowing Britt to get treated by professionals in a hospital. Later, the two weld James' stolen head back onto his memorial statue. Now with Lenore to aid them, Britt and Kato vow to continue protecting the law by breaking it.", "output": "Question: Who does Britt fire after escaping the mansion?, Answer: Kato and Lenore, Question: What do mobsters often offer to rivals in order to get close enough to kill them?, Answer: A peace summit, Question: How much did Chudnofsky offer to the \"Hornet\" if he kills Britt or keeps him alive?, Answer: $1 million and half of Los Angeles, Question: Who does Lenore rebuff Britt for?, Answer: Kato, Question: How dod Scanlon kill Britt's father?, Answer: drug injection, Question: What did Britt reveal?, Answer: Scanlon's confession, Question: Where did Scanlon and Britt meet?, Answer: Restaurant", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

However, her father Sir Walter Elliot (Anthony Head) and family friend Lady Russell (Alice Krige) had persuaded Anne to break off the engagement and give up the man she loved because of his lack of fortune and connections.As the story opens, however, the Elliot family is in financial difficulties due to the lavish spending of Sir Walter and his eldest daughter Elizabeth (Julia Davis). To save expense, the Elliot family residence, Kellynch Hall in Somersetshire, has to be let out. Suitable tenants are soon found in Admiral Croft (Peter Wight) and his wife (Marion Bailey). Mrs. Croft is the sister of Frederick Wentworth, who has risen to the rank of Captain and become rich while serving in the Royal Navy.Sir Walter and Elizabeth Elliot depart for their new residence in Bath. Anne stays behind to visit her hypochondriac sister Mary Musgrove (Amanda Hale) who is married to Charles Musgrove (Sam Hazeldine), and living in the nearby estate Uppercross. Anne soon meets Wentworth again when he comes to visit his sister. Staying with the Musgroves, Anne meets Wentworth several times and has to witness what she perceives to be his attentions towards Charles Musgrove's two young and lively unmarried sisters, especially Louisa (Jennifer Higham). Anne is convinced that he will never forgive her, let alone love her again.Eventually Anne goes to Bath, and becomes subject to the attentions of Mr. Elliot (Tobias Menzies), a distant cousin who will inherit her father's wealth and title. Mr. Elliot proposes to Anne, who, though still very much in love with Wentworth, does not immediately decline Mr. Elliot's offer. Admiral Croft, having heard a rumour of Mr. Elliot's proposal to Anne, sends Wentworth to ask Anne if she and her new husband require them to quit Kellynch Hall. Anne informs Wentworth that Admiral Croft has been very much misinformed, but in the medley of new arrivals, Wentworth leaves and Anne runs to find him. On her way, her good friend Harriet (Maisie Dimbleby) reliably informs her that Mr. Elliot is currently also courting Mrs. Clay (Mary Stockley), whom it seemed Anne's father might marry. Harriet tells Anne that Mr. Elliot desires the baronetcy above all else, and although his admiration for Anne appears genuine, once married to Anne he plans to establish Mrs. Clay as his mistress. This would prevent Mrs. Clay's marriage to Anne's father, thereby preventing the potential birth of a male heir to Sir Walter which would cut off Mr. Elliot's inheritance rights. Wentworth declares his undying love for Anne and proposes to her in a letter.After some frenzied running, Anne runs into Wentworth in the street while he is talking to Charles Musgrove. There, she accepts Wentworth's proposal and, when he asks her whether she is sure, she says she has never been more determined in her life. The movie skips to Anne and Wentworth in a carriage, Anne blindfolded. Once her blindfold is removed, Anne finds herself standing in front of Kellynch Hall, Wentworth's wedding present to her.

What he finds is a murder without an identifiable motive, and, shortly thereafter, two men on death row for the murders who couldn't be more different. He befriends Perry, one of the two, and is befuddled to find an erudite, sensitive man, and Capote struggles to understand how such a man could be guilty of such crimes. Still, there is little doubt of Perry's guilt, for Dick, Perry's far less cultivated accomplice,has spoken of the murders in Capote's presence, though not admitting the murders were premeditated, and Perry makes no attempt to deny his participation.Capote is so troubled and fascinated by the murders that he resolves to write a book about the incident. The problem is that the quality of his book will suffer unless he can learn what really happened on the night the crimes took place, as he would be unable to answer the very question that compelled him to devote so much time and effort to studying the murders.Capote grows closer and closer to Perry, and their growing relationship and Capote's obsession with the successful completion of his project appear to motivate his attempt to intervene in the case and delay Perry's execution. In his prison visits to see Perry, he must delude him into believing that he is trying to get him a new trial and a fresh chance at acquittal. In truth, Capote's actions are self-serving, but the result is that he and Perry grow closer, and, eventually, Perry relates what really happened the night of the murders. An armed robbery went wrong, and the murders had been committed in the rage of the moment by Perry, who had been goaded by his accomplice, Dick, to kill all possible witnesses to their crime. Now in possession of the truth, Capote withdraws from the scene, perhaps understanding that the executions will now provide the final chapter of his book.Not long after, Perry and Dick are executed, but Capote has already succeeded in understanding the Holcomb murders, and is ready to write a novel that will be celebrated as a masterpiece.", "output": "Question: Who does Truman Capote write for?, Answer: The New Yorker Magazine, Question: What magazine is Truman Capote a reporter for?, Answer: The New Yorker, Question: Where does the murder of an entire family take place?, Answer: Holcomb Kansas, Question: Who was Perry's accomplice?, Answer: Dick, Question: Who comitted the murders?, Answer: Perry, Question: What happens to Dick and Perry?, Answer: They are executed., Question: What is the name of the other convicted murderer?, Answer: Dick, Question: What is the name of the man Truman becomes friends with?, Answer: Perry, Question: What man on death row does Capote befriend?, Answer: Perry, Question: Where is Perry located?, Answer: Death row in prison.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

He counsels his 8 year old son, Jonah (Ross Malinger), that its hard to understand why she had to die, warning his son that if a person starts asking that question, they just go crazy.Sam decides he and Jonah should move to Seattle, Washington to make a fresh start. Sixteen months later Sam is still disconsolate and Jonah is worried. So, on Christmas Eve, Jonah calls Dr. Marcia Fieldstone, a clinical psychologist who hosts a national radio talk show, and he requests a new wife for his father. Dr. Fieldstone persuades Jonah to put Sam on the phone. Sam is upset, but he talks to Dr. Fieldstone about how hes been taking it a day at a time and that hes not sure he could ever love another woman. He admits that it would be best if Jonah had a mother figure. When Dr. Fieldstone learns that Sam has trouble sleeping, she decides to refer to him as Sleepless in Seattle.Thousands of women around the country, touched by the sad story of Sleepless in Seattle, send him letters (Jonah secretly provides Dr. Fieldstone with the address). Annie Reed, a journalist from Baltimore, Maryland, engaged to a nice but allergy-prone man named Walter (Bill Pullman), also hears the show with Dr. Fieldstone. Annie has been having doubts about her future with Walter and she begins to wonder about a possible connection between her and Sam. She actually drafts a letter to Sam, but decides not to send it. Her friend and co-worker, Becky (Rosie ODonnell) secretly sends it to Sam.Jonah, who has been working his way through the flood of mail, finds Annie's missive and thinks the fact that shes a fan of Brooks Robinson of the Baltimore Orioles is a \"sign.\" The movie includes a number of such signs or omens. Jonah tries to convince his father to go to New York City to meet Annie at the top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day (as her letter suggested), but Sam says no, its too far away.Sam has resisted dating anyone, but after he comes home from work one afternoon to find Jonah sitting very close and listening to records with a precocious young girl named Jessica (Gaby Hoffmann), he feels an urgent need to try and find a mother-type for Jonah. Sam thinks it's probably best to associate with women whom he already knows, so he calls an acquaintance from work, Victoria (Barbara Garrick), and arranges a date.Jonah immediately dislikes Victoria her, because he didnt select her (he wants Sam to meet Annie) and she has a cackling, hyena-like laugh. On the advice of Jessica, Jonah mails a letter to Annie, pretending to be Sam and agreeing to meet her at the top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day. Annie decides to do a news story on Sleepless in Seattle, and she tells Walter that she needs to travel to Chicago to do an interview for the story. She then flies out to Seattle.Coincidentally, Sam and Jonah are at the airport in Seattle, dropping Victoria off for a flight, and Annie arrives at the same gate. Sam sees her and is immediately attracted, however she quickly disappears into the crowd.Annie rents a car and drives to Sams house. Sam and Jonah had returned from the airport and are just taking a small boat out for a ride. Annie is able to follow them in her car, as they stay close to land. She watches Sam and Jonah playing on the beach together, but she doesnt try to approach them. She talks to Becky about it that night and decides that the next day, she will go up and talk to Sam. The next day, she gets out of her car and starts across the street, but stops short when she sees Sam and Jonah hugging Sams sister, who came to visit. A truck driver blasts his horn at Annie, as shes standing in traffic. Sam looks up, sees her, and approaches her. They exchange hellos. Rather than wait for traffic to clear and go on across the street, Annie decides she is being silly about the whole thing, that Sam obviously has a girlfriend, and she goes back to New York and Walter.Jessica decides that Jonah should go to New York by himself to meet Annie, since Sam wont go. She then calls and makes the flight reservation. Jonah manages to get to New York and takes a taxi to the Empire State Building, telling the driver that he's going to meet his new mother. Once Sam finds out from Jessica where Jonah went, he rushes off in pursuit. He doesnt catch up to Jonah until he gets to the observation deck of the Empire State Building, where Jonah has been patiently waiting for Annie to appear.Meanwhile, Annie is at dinner with Walter at a high rise across the way. Shes explaining the entire Sleepless in Seattle story to Walter. Walther doesnt want to be someone that Annie settles for in life, so he agrees to take back the ring he had given her. Annie then hurries on over to the Empire State Building just in case Sams letter was legitimate.Jonah and Sam get on the down elevator just as Annie is exiting the elevator shes on. They miss each other. However, Annie discovers Jonah's backpack with Howard, his teddy bear, inside.

Such, you must admit, is often the case, as will be seen in this Biograph film story. In a barroom on the Mexican border, Pedro is engaged in a game of poker with several cow-punchers. One of the party seems to be attended with remarkable luck. Pedro becomes suspicious and at last detects him cheating. A quarrel ensues, which results in Pedro laying out the crook, cold and stiff. The sheriff now takes a hand in the squabble and Pedro dives through the window, taking glass and sash with him, followed by a fusillade of 44s, several of which take effect in his body. Staggering into his home, where he is met by his wife, Juanita, and his mother, weak from the loss of blood, he recounts as best he can what has occurred. They hide him in the loft above, and none too soon, for the sheriff enters and searches the place. He is just about to leave when he is attracted by the dropping of blood on the bed. Convinced that the fugitive is above, he makes a start for the loft, but is shot by Pedro, who anticipates him. At this moment in rushes the vigilance committee, who, seeing the sheriff stretched out, accuse Juanita of the crime and carry her off to jail. The mother visits her and devises a scheme. Attiring Pedro in her clothes, she sends him to the prison with a basket of provisions. While the guard is examining the contents of the basket, Pedro, still disguised, slips a pistol to Juanita. The guard, satisfied things are all right, opens the jail door. Juanita and Pedro at once pounce upon him, bind, gag and lock him in the cell. Off they go, but have not proceeded far when their flight is discovered and they are pursued by mounted police. They go down over a rugged rocky hill, which they figure impassable for the pursuers.

A rollercoaster style treasure hunt for the legendary Fritton's Gold ensues as they face their most fearsome establishment rivals yet, but the feisty and ever-resourceful girls of St Trinian's are undeterred in their mission to outwit the villainous Sir Peirs Pomfrey and his sidekicks from the women-hating secret society known as AD1.It starts when an unknown man phones St Trinian's, and gets Celia to find a ring in the school library. She's caught by the other school girls and then explains that the man proposed to give her \u00a320,000 for the ring. The girls believe they can get more, and the Head Girl Annabelle Fritton asks for \u00a3100,000. The deal was cancelled for being too high. They talk with the headmistress, Miss Camilla Fritton, and she begins to tell them of Pirate Fritton, her and Annabelle's ancestor. She says he had a treasure hidden somewhere in the world. The ring is half of the answer. There were two rings made, and once fitted together they are the map to the treasure.That night, the unknown caller turns out to be Sir Piers Pomfrey, the descendent of Lord Pomfrey, a man robbed by Pirate Archibald Fritton in 1589. Sir Piers steals the ring from Ms Fritton, and escapes. The girls then search for the second ring. They begin at the library, where one finds a card with riddles on how to get to the second ring. A 19th Century relative of Camilla and Annabelle's - a Reverend Fortnum Fritton - had found the first ring, and knew how to find the second, but made up more clues for others to find it. It is revealed that they need to dig into Fortnum Fritton's own grave, to get another card. Only half the clue is there, the rest rotted away. Annabelle is suddenly possessed by Fortnum Fritton's soul, and is brought back to the school, where the girls ask the 'spirit' for the rest of the riddle. With the complete riddle, the girls work out the clue, and head off to an all-boys school nearby (based on English boarding school, Eton) to find the next clue, whilst undercover as boys themselves. They enter the headmaster's room, where a hung painting hides the other ring.With the second ring in their possession, the St Trinian's girls set off to get the first ring, still in the hands of Sir Piers. They begin by doing research about the seemingly wonderful, faultless Sir Piers, and discover he knows Geoffrey Thwaites (played by Colin Firth). Camilla Fritton tracks down Geoffrey Thwaites, whose career had been ruined (by the events at the end of the previous film), and has become a drunk, and clearly heartborken over Ms Fritton and the loss of his career. He tells her Sir Piers is involved in a secret society called AD1. Thwaites then joins forces with the girls, who first help him get over his drunkenness. When Thwaites is back to his old self, he reveals to Ms Camilla Fritton what AD1 actually is - a woman-hating society, existing only to keep women powerless in the world. Annabelle, Thwaites, the young twins, and also ex St Trinian's student Kelly Jones (head girl from the first film) go under cover to AD1 to retrieve the first ring. The attempt fails, and the girls head back to the school. Meanwhile, Thwaites is undercover at the AD1 meeting (which is held at the notable English day school, City of London), when he is called upon by Sir Piers to give his ideas. Thwaites then rants about women and how bad they are, while wearing a camera and microphone that shows the girls at St Trinian's what he is doing. The speech is a ruse to gain Sir Piers trust, and Thwaites swaps the real ring with a fake one, later presenting it to Ms Camilla Fritton.The rings lead the girls to the Globe Theatre in London. They first create a distraction, knowing they will be followed by AD1 minions - by doing an innocent enough Flash Mob dance at Liverpool St Station. Once escaped they get to the Globe, where they are faced with the actor and actress playing Romeo and Juliet. Romeo duels Thwaites a sword fight and Romeo gets knocked out. Then Ms Fritton knocks out Juliet. Ms Fritton and Thwaites then take up the roles of Romeo and Juliet in an attempt to distract the audience. The girls begin to get close to the treasure while Sir Piers discovers the fake ring and gets to the Globe immediately. They stand in the audience, and because they are a secret organization, must wait until the play is over. But Ms Fritton and Thwaites notice them and begin to stall as long as possible. The girls make it to a secret room and find the treasure. The treasure is Shakespeare's final play: Queen Lear. They find too that Pirate Fritton had 'retired' and decided to become a playwright, and that Shakespeare was Pirate Fritton, but not only that, it was also discovered that Shakespeare/Pirate Fritton was actually a woman. At that moment, Sir Piers enters, takes the Queen Lear script, and says he will destroy it. He always knew about Pirate Fritton being a woman and thought that it should never be known. The girls soon get the payback when they go after Sir Piers, by attacking him pirate-style (complete with cannons) on the Thames, sailing on the Galleon Golden Hind which is located on the south bank to the east of the Globe Theatre.", "output": "Question: Where did Geoffrey realize the ring really was?, Answer: Behind a hung painting., Question: Who is the head girl of St. Trinian's?, Answer: Annabelle Fritton, Question: Who has the idea to sail after Pomfrey?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who was the man on the telephone?, Answer: Sir Piers Pomfrey, Question: Who runs the secret society?, Answer: Sir Peirs Pomfrey and his sidekicks., Question: What was in the chest instead of riches?, Answer: Shakespeare's final play: Queen Lear, Question: Do steals back the evidence from Sir Piers Pomfrey?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What does the man offer Celia for the ring?, Answer: 20,000, Question: Who took the ring?, Answer: Sir Piers, Question: What does Celia find in the library?, Answer: A ring that when paired with a second ring reveals a treasure map, Question: Who does Sir Piers manage to steal the ring from?, Answer: Ms Fritton, Question: What is the secret society known as?, Answer: AD1, Question: What were they attempting to retrieve?, Answer: The first ring., Question: What is the secret that can never be revealed?, Answer: Pirate Fritton was actually a woman, Question: What name did Pirate Fritton write plays under?, Answer: Shakespeare, Question: How do the girls infiltrate the other school?, Answer: go undercover as boys", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The two share concerns over business tensions with Baek Dae-sik (Hwang Jung-min), a son from a rival family, which is when Kang assigns Sun-woo what is perceived to be a simple errand while he is away on a business trip \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to shadow his young mistress, Hee-soo (Shin Min-ah), whom he fears is having an \"affair\" with another man, giving Sun-woo the mandate to kill her (and her paramour) if he manages to discover it. As he performs his duty \u00e2\u0080\u0094 following Hee-soo, and escorting her to a music recital one day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty and innocence as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become more prevalent. When he does come to discover Hee-soo's lover directly in her home, he fiercely beats him and prepares to inform Kang, but his attraction to her causes him to hesitate. He thus spares the two on the condition that they no longer see each other again, earning him Hee-soo's enmity.Meanwhile, Sun-woo continues to be embroiled in personal business with Baek Dae-sik over having beaten up several of his henchmen earlier for overstaying their welcome at the hotel. He is then threatened by one of his enforcers to apologize, but he adamantly refuses, fueled by his frustrations over Hee-soo. As he relaxes in his apartment later one night, he is suddenly kidnapped by Baek's men to be tortured, but before they can do so they receive new orders via phone call and he is abruptly carried off to Kang, who has returned from overseas and has found out about his attempted cover-up of Hee-soo's affair. Kang's men torture him into confessing why he lied until he is left alone to think about his answer. A daring but messy escape follows, after which Sun-woo plans his revenge.Help from one of Sun-woo's loyal men provides him with money and new clothes to go about his plan: he secretly delivers Hee-soo a gift to make amends and sets up a meeting with some local arms dealers, but as they are affiliated with Kang's organization he ends up killing them over a deal to buy a handgun \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this incurs a vendetta with the brother of one of the dealers, who promptly sets out to find Sun-woo. He then goes on to set up a veiled rendezvous with Baek Jr. and kills him after a brief conversation, but he is viciously stabbed in the process. Bleeding, his violent shooting spree leads directly to Kang amidst one of his business meetings, where he vents bitterly over how badly he has been treated despite his seven years of service. Kang does not answer, and instead asks if Sun-woo's actions were directly because of Hee-soo. Sun-woo then shoots him, prompting a shootout with Baek Dae-sik's henchmen, who had quickly picked up his trail.Sun-woo emerges as the only survivor of the battle with the arms dealer's brother finally catching up to him in the same room. Now dying from multiple gunshot wounds, he calls Hee-soo and pauses to reminisce on his only day with her, when he had escorted her to her music recital; in his memory, as he watches her play her cello, he finds himself overwhelmed with emotion and, in a rare moment of contentment, he smiles for the first time in the entire film. As he sheds a tear over this memory, the brother of the arms dealer executes him.The film ends with a continuation of an earlier scene of Sun-woo looking out of a window at the city below him.

Kelvin is about to embark on an interstellar journey to a space station orbiting the remote oceanic planet Solaris. After decades of study, the scientific mission at the space station has barely progressed. The crew is sending confusing messages. Kelvin is dispatched to evaluate the situation aboard the ship and determine whether the venture should continue.Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky), a former space pilot, visits Kelvin. They watch film footage of Berton's own testimony years before of seeing a four-meter-tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris while searching for two lost scientists. However, the cameras of his craft recorded only clouds and the flat ocean surface; Berton's report was dismissed as hallucinations. After failing to convince Kelvin of the reality of his experience, Berton angrily departs, only to contact Kelvin later via videophone from his private car. He explains that he met the child of a scientist lost on that mission, and the child was like a much smaller version of the one he had seen on Solaris.Before departing Earth for Solaris, Kelvin destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire, noting the volume of keepsakes he has accumulated. In Kelvin's last conversation with his father (Nikolai Grinko), they realize that the father will probably not live to see Kelvin return. Although he readily accepted the mission, it is a choice that weighs heavily upon Kelvin's conscience.Upon his arrival at Solaris Station,[10][11] a scientific research station hovering above the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, who finds the disarrayed space station dangerously neglected. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan), had killed himself. The two surviving crewmen are uncooperative and evasive. Kelvin soon glimpses other people aboard the station, not supposed to be there. Upon entering the late Gibarian's room, Kelvin finds a rambling cryptic farewell video message from Gibarian addressed to him.Waking exhausted from a restless sleep, Kelvin finds a woman with him in his quarters despite the barricaded door. To his surprise, it is Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), his late wife who committed suicide some years before. She is unaware of what has happened or how she got there. Terrified by her presence, he lures her into a space capsule and launches the replica of his wife into outer space. In his haste to be rid of her he is scorched by the rocket's blast. Dr. Snaut tends to his burns and explains that the \"visitors\" began appearing after the scientists attracted the attention of Solaris, seemingly a sentient entity.That evening, Hari reappears in his quarters. This time Kelvin calmly accepts her presence and embraces Hari throughout the night. Kelvin later causes her to panic by suddenly leaving the room and shutting the door behind him. She hysterically tears her way through the room's metal door, severely cutting herself. Before he can give first aid, her injuries heal before his eyes. Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) calls for a meeting, and Kelvin introduces Hari as his wife. In their symposium, the scientists begin to understand that Solaris created Hari from Kelvin's memories of his dead wife. The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of \"neutrino systems\" but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of an offscreen device known as \"the annihilator\".Kelvin shows Hari films of himself and his parents when he was a boy and, later, of his wife. While she is asleep, Snaut proposes beaming Kelvin's brainwave patterns at Solaris in hopes that it will understand them and stop the disturbing apparitions as communication. However, Sartorius suggests a radical attack of heavy radiation bombardment. In time, Hari becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence. She learns from Sartorius that the original Hari had committed suicide ten years earlier, and Kelvin is forced to tell her the entire story. Sartorius, Snaut, Kelvin and Hari gather together for a birthday party which turns into a philosophical argument during which Sartorius tells Hari that she is not human, but a mere copy. Distressed, Hari kills herself again by drinking liquid oxygen, only to painfully, spasmodically resurrect a few minutes later. On the surface of Solaris, the ocean is moving even faster.Kelvin goes to sleep only to wake up agitated and running a fever and gives a monologue to Snaut on the subject of suffering and universal love, then falls asleep again. He dreams of his mother as a young woman, caring for him and expressing her worry concerning Kelvin's emotional state. When he awakens, Hari is gone, and Snaut reads him the farewell note she left behind. The note indicates that Hari petitioned the two scientists to destroy her. Snaut tells Kelvin that since they broadcast Kelvin's brainwaves at Solaris, the visitors stopped appearing and islands began forming on the planet's surface. Kelvin debates whether or not to return to Earth or to descend to Solaris in hopes of reconnecting with everything he has loved and lost.Again at the shore of the frozen lake, Kelvin finds himself at his father's house. His dog runs to him, and he happily walks towards it. He realizes something is peculiar, however, when he sees that his father seems oblivious to the fact that it's raining inside the house. Father and son embrace on the front step of the lakeside house which the camera zooms out to reveal is located on an island in the middle of an ocean on the planet Solaris.", "output": "Question: How did Kelvin feel when he woke up?, Answer: He felt agitated and running a fever, Question: Who finds himself at his father's house?, Answer: Kelvin, Question: Who is a former space pilot?, Answer: Henri Berton, Question: who becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence?, Answer: hari, Question: When did the \"visitors\" begin appearing?, Answer: after the scientists attracted the attention of Solaris, Question: Where do they broadcast Kelvins brainwaves?, Answer: Solaris, Question: Whare can one see a four-meter-tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris?, Answer: In a film footage of Berton's own testimony years, Question: How was Hari created?, Answer: From memories of Kelvin's dead wife., Question: What does Kelvin see on the station that shouldn't be there?, Answer: People, Question: How did Kris Kelvin spend his last day on Earth?, Answer: Taking a walk by a lake near his childhood home., Question: What did Hari leave behind?, Answer: A farewell note, Question: What device does Sartorius think may be possible to destroy the visitors with?, Answer: The annihilator, Question: What does Berton explain?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire?, Answer: Kelvin, Question: What are the visitors composed of?, Answer: Neutrino Systems, Question: who is forced to tell her the entire story?, Answer: kelvin, Question: Who runs to Kelvin?, Answer: The dog, Question: Who plays Kelvin's father?, Answer: Nikolai Grinko, Question: who gather together for a birthday party which turns into a philosophical argument?, Answer: Sartorius, Snaut, Kelvin and Hari, Question: Who is Kelvin's friend among the scientists?, Answer: Dr. Gibarian, Question: How did Hari die?, Answer: She committed suicide., Question: To what planet is Kelvbin about to embark?, Answer: Solaris., Question: Who is in Kelvin's quarters when he wakes up?, Answer: Hari, his late wife", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

After six hours of questioning the cop, Officer Gina Santer, and Detective 'Bub' Bailey let him go, but instruct him to turn over any information he obtains on the client that claimed Santer was his wife. Most of the info on file at Strachey Investigations about this mystery client is fake.Meanwhile, at the home of Dorothy 'Dot' Fisher and her partner Edith Strong, Dorothy chases out a vandal after he breaks into their home and spray paints homophobic graffiti on their wall. The next day, Andrew McWhirter, close friend of Fisher and Strongand Timmy Callhan's former boyfriend introduce Donald and Timmy to the lesbian couple after a contentious school board meeting at which Dorothy, a guidance counselor at the school, is placed on paid leave due to objections from a homophobic parent whose gay son Derek has been counseled by Fisher. The two are invited by the middle-aged women and house guest Andrew back to their home in Hollis, but the socialization is interrupted when the returning vandal throws a brick through the window. Strachey chases him back to his car, but the license plate is obscured by mud.The following day, Kenny gives Donald Strachey pictures he obtained of the mysterious \"client\", and his e-mail address, the one piece of info he offered about himself that is at least a marginal lead. With no other pressing cases, Strachey returns to Hollis, investigating motives for the vandalism. Dorothy suspects the homophobic Joey Deems, who attends the school he works at, but his father Carl tells Donald that he believes the motive is more likely a resentful backlash against Fisher's decision not to sell her house to Millipond Realty, who wants to build a large mall along Moon Road, the street the Deems, Dot & Edith, and other residents, who all received offers on their properties, live on.Strachey manages to discover a connection between Millipond and Colter Investigations, a rival P.I. firm. That night, after an abortive attempt by Andrew to seduce Donald, close to the Fisher home, a fire breaks out inside their barn. Upon investigation, Strachey also discovers a body in the barn, which later turns out to be that of Leo Colter, the head of the aforementioned P.I. firm. Strachey sneaks into the Colter offices and purloins some sensitive files. Later, he exchanges the faux client's e-mail address for a copy of the autopsy report on Colter's body, courtesy of Bailey.In Hollis, a distraught Derek visits Dorothy in a desperate plea for help, but his father Jonas arrives, and informs Fisher she can now expect to have her position with the school fully terminated. Donald discusses the results of the autopsy report with Dorothy and warns her that he suspects foul play, and that Dorothy may have to contend with even more than the loss of her job and the barrage of vandalism and arson. Strachey's visit is cut short by a call from Kenny, who has been tailing Santer as part of his field experience requirements. He discovers that Santer has been having coffee with the same mysterious \"client\" that hired Donald to track her under false pretenses. Donald returns to Albany in time to observe both participants in the coffee date going their separate ways. Kenny manages to stick with Santer, but Strachey's attempts to tail the mystery man are derailed by one of his former disgruntled clients. Coming up with a Plan B, Donald joins Kenny at Sturgis Development, which was Santer's destination. She is working undercover, investigating allegations of fraud. She tells him his mystery client's name: Peter Garritty, who is also in the real estate business.Sensing that things aren't adding up, Strachey interrupts a lunch date between Tim and his former flame, outright accusing Andrew of being involved in the shady dealings he's uncovered. A defensive McWhirter denies knowing Garritty, and shoots back that Donald is still pissed for the pass Andrew made earlier. Tim, who was unaware of the incident until now, runs out of his office, but Donald assures him that the attraction and \"action\" the previous night weren't mutual, and that he doesn't even trust McWhirter, let alone like him.Back in Hollis, Strachey presses Dorothy on the lack of records about \"Edith Strong\" before 1972. Later, Strachey talks to \"Edith\" alone; she breaks down and confesses the details of her past to him. Her birth name was Laura Whitaker. As a young woman, she, like Dorothy, was an activist. During an attempt to protest the Vietnam War, a planned bombing of an empty courthouse went terribly wrong, accidentally killing a close friend of Laura's. Furthermore, Edith/Laura knows that Joey Deems has been vandalizing her and Dorothy's home because she asked him to do it. Not too long ago, a man called her and threatened to expose her to the police and Dorothy if she failed to convince her stubborn partner to sell their home. Later, Edith finds out that Dorothy has already known about her past as Laura for some time now, and it changed nothing as far as Dot's feelings for her or their relationship was concerned. Dot suddenly yells for help, letting Strachey know that Andrew has apparently been kidnapped, as per a video clip e-mailed to her showing him being held hostage and ending with a demand for a $500,000 ransom. Strachey, with Santer's assistance, arranges for Sturgis to buy out Dot and Edith's home at the steeply overvalued price of half a million dollars, which would enable the couple to meet the ransom demand.Strachey then breaks into Garritty's office, uncovering a much broader conspiracy that is appearing to link all the players he has met so far in some way, one centered on various parties outmaneuvering each other until the winner is able to cash in on the lucrative deal to sell all the properties along Moon Roada deal worth a total of $40 million but his research is interrupted by Garritty's arrival. Strachey surprises Garritty and persuades him to answer many of his questions, but this is also interrupted by gunshots fired by an unknown assailant. Garritty uses the distraction to evade further interrogation by the P.I.After another session with Carl Deems in which he is more forthcoming about his frustration with Fisher's resistance to the Moon Road real estate deal, blocking his ambition to sell his own property, Donald discovers Carl's clearly closeted son Joey being intimate with his openly gay classmate Derek. Joey confesses to vandalizing Dorothy's house, but truthfully denies being involved with the later fire, let alone Colter's murder.Game time arrives. As the midnight deadline for the ransom money approaches, Santer arrives at Dot and Edith's place with the money in cash, courtesy of Sturgis. Strachey catches Santer off guard, tricking her into admitting (with a nearby Garritty listening) that she plans to cut him out the profitable real estate deal. Garritty emerges from hiding amongst the bushes, objecting to the ad hoc ruse, after which Santer reveals herself as an undercover cop. Strachey then confronts her with his knowledge of her attempt on Garritty's life hours earlier, as well as her murdering of Colter. The P.I. then exposes Andrew's collusion with Garritty as well, having unearthed that the kidnapping was entirely staged, leading McWhirter, who is also hiding nearby, to show himself. The greedy Santer and Garritty, both armed, shoot each other, leaving McWhirter to take the cash. Strachey chases him into the barn and confronts him for hurting Dot and Edith he was the mystery blackmailer.

Strachey gives him a card for The Trevor Project, which Jonas rejected as a recruiting tool for homosexuals when Dot referred Derek to it earlier, but now accepts as a valid source of psychological assistance, leading him and his son to reconcile and likely avoiding the fate Donald warned of.

One story takes place in Mexico where a boy's father has gone to the United States to look for work. The second is of a girl in Morocco whose father went to Spain and hasn't returned. The third is about a boy in Cuba who believes his dad emigrated to the United States. The children share a common longing for their fathers, who they either miss or have never known.Priciliano is an 8 year old boy in Mexico whose father leaves to go to \"the other side\" for work. He takes it pretty hard as he and his dad were close, and his 9th birthday is coming up. Struggling to understand and be able to carry on like normal, as his mom does, he decides that he wants to try and go after him. His drunk uncle tells him about all those who have tried to cross into the US and how some succeeded and some did not. Priciliano decides that he can do it and convinces a friend to go with him. The two boys believe that the land across a small lagoon is \"the other side\" and attempt to cross it in a little boat, which takes on water. Priciliano nearly drowns but is saved by a ghostly woman - the same woman who killed herself in that lake after being held captive according to a fairy tale his dad told him at the beginning of the movie. He then has a heart to heart with his uncle who explains the economic situation a little better, which makes Angel a little more accepting of his father's need to go to the US to work.A young girl in Morocco named Fatima decides she wants to find her father, who had gone to Spain two years earlier. She leaves in the early morning hours while her mother sleeps. She quickly meets a man who tells her he has a friend going to Spain by boat, and that there is sure to be room for her to come along. Excited, she goes with the man. She is kept with a group of about a dozen other girls, mostly teenagers a little older than her. They do travel to Spain where the girls are sold to a women into what appears to be sex slavery. The woman refuses to take Fatima as she is too young, roughly 10, but takes the others and leaves. The woman later comes back for her, fearing that the men may sell her to someone else. Though the woman in clearly involved in trafficking girls, Fatima's youth seems to tug at her conscience. She takes Fatima and helps her find her father who is living with his girlfriend, who does not appear happy about the situation. Fatima's father takes her back to Morocco where she belongs, but the ending does not show the reunion with her mother and whether or not her father stays with them or goes back to Spain.The third story is about a young boy in Cuba named Angel who lives in poverty with his mother and grandfather. His mother is a prostitute and Angel calls her out in front of his grandfather, who he seems to be close with. Angel spends most of his time with his best friend Walter. They discuss going to America to find Angel's dad who he believes lives there now. One day the two boys, around 10 years old, get an inner tube and decide to paddle to Florida to find him. Naively, Walter tells Angel that they have to hurry because he is supposed to get the bread for dinner and doesn't want to be late. Not far into their journey they are flipped over and Walter drowns. Angel returns but says nothing. Walter's family is worried, and though Angel seems scared he still doesn't say anything. They eventually find Walter's body and tell his parents, who are devastated. Angel later tells his mom that they were trying to find his father when Walter drowned, and his mom then tells him that his father doesn't even know he exists. She never told him she was having a baby and only told Angel that his dad was in the US to protect him from the truth.The three vignettes are intertwined throughout the film and are told from the perspective of each child, respectively. This film exposes the powerful effect that immigration and absent parents has on the children and families that have been left behind while they journey to \"the other side.\"", "output": "Question: Why does Fatima run away?, Answer: Find her Father, Question: Who attempt to cross the ocean in a primitive raft to find his father?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What role did Priciliano take?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who is ashamed of his mother?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Why was Fatima not able to work?, Answer: Too young, Question: Who did Fatima see her father with?, Answer: A Woman, Question: Where did his father leave to?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What birthday was he about to celebrate when his father left?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who drowned in the ocean?, Answer: Walter", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

As they are led away to their deaths, the robe of Christ is given to former slave Demetrius (Victor Mature) for safekeeping. Mad emperor Caligula, mistakenly believing that it is the mysterious robe which bestows eternal life, orders his soldiers to find it at all costs. While ransacking the village of Demetrius during the search, a Roman soldier assaults Lucia (Debra Paget), the beautiful love interest of Demetrius. Demetrius rushes to her defense and attacks the centurion. He is sentenced to a gladiator school, where he draws the lustful attention of sensuous Messalina (Susan Hayward), the unsatisfied wife of Caligula's elderly uncle. Demetrius initially refuses to fight out of devotion to his Christian beliefs. But when he spurns the advances of Messalina, she is enraged and wants revenge. He is returned to the arena where he is forced to defend himself against several tigers, killing all of them. He becomes a hero to the crowds. Lucia goes to the gladiator school to see Demetrius, but Messalina allows her to fall into the hands of the gladiators. As one of the gladiators hungrily paws at her, a helpless Demetrius prays for her deliverance. She fights wildly before falling into a catatonic state resembling death. An embittered Demetrius renounces his faith and accepts a post as a centurion.

The year is 1914. Young Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) is watching the scene through a fence. It becomes apparent that horse is about to give birth, and the next shot is of the newly born foal, which then stands up.We next see Albert as he attempts to befriend the young horse as they grow up. Once the horse is fully grown, we see the three men take him into the village to be sold at the horse auction. Albert's father, Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), is immediately taken by the horse and in an act of foolishness bids on and wins the animal, using his rent money to pay. He brings the horse home where Albert starts to bond with and train the horse who he names Joey. The landlord comes for the rent and agrees to wait until the harvest if Joey can plow a rocky field which will then be planted. Albert attempts to put the collar on Joey, but he refuses, so Albert puts the collar over his own neck to show how easy it is, and Joey then takes the collar without any problem. The entire village comes out to watch as Albert tries to get Joey to plow the field and at first it is a complete failure. Then it starts to rain and as the water softens the ground Albert tries once more and this time the plow bits into the ground, creating a furrow as Joey pulls in a straight line. Soon the field is completely plowed, and Ted goes out to plant it.At the same time, the war is looming, and Albert and his mother have a talk about Ted's service in the 1899-1902 Boer war and how he refuses to talk about it. War is declared, and a terrible storm destroys the crop that was planted and with the rent coming due Ted takes Joey down to the village to sell him to the army. Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) buys Joey for his use in the cavalry. Albert arrives in the village too late to stop the sale, but Captain Nicholls says he will return Joey after the war.Captain Nicholls and Joey go off to train, and Joey meets and becomes friends with another horse, Topthorn. Topthorn is Major Stewart's (Benedict Cumberbatch) mount, and they always are the fastest in training drills. However, this time it is Captain Nicholls and Joey who cross the field first in simulated cavalry charge. The cavalry is then transferred to France where they are going to attack a German unit twice their number, but Major Stewart thinks that surprise and the speed of the cavalry will give the British a victory. The charge starts out well, but as the German troops retreat in nearby woods, machine gun nests at the edge of the woods open up and decimate the British calvary. Captain Nicholls is killed, but Joey survives, as do Major Stewart and Topthorn. The major is captured, and uninjured horses are rounded up for use by the German army.Joey and Topthorn are chosen to pull an ambulance, but Topthorn refuses to accept the collar. Joey then comes over and shows Topthorn how to accept the collar and the two horses then pull the ambulance back behind the lines. After arriving at their destination, the horses are cared for by two brothers, Gunther (David Kross) and Michael (Leonard Carow), when the unit is told to move out. Gunther, the older is told to remain with the horse, while Michael, just 14, is told to join the rest of the unit.As the unit marches toward the front lines, Gunther saddles Topthorn and Joey and then rides up alongside the column, grabbing Michael and pulling him onto his horse. They then continue to ride until they come to a windmill, where the settle down to rest until night. Before they wake up and continue their journey, they are caught and executed for desertion.The horses are left behind, and the next morning, a young girl named Emilie (Celine Buckens) finds them, and starts to care for them. She is a sickly child who lives with her grandfather since her parents were killed in the war. Emilie dreams of riding Joey, but her grandfather is afraid she will be injured due to her frailty, and doesn't allow it. Just as Emilie is about to ride Joey the Germans come to the farm and Emilie hides the horses in her bedroom in the attic of the house.After the Germans leave, her grandfather relents and gives Emilie her mothers saddle. Emilie then gets on Joey, and although she is only supposed to ride to the top of a nearby hill, she goes over it to the other side. She and Joey don't return, and Topthorn breaks free from her grandfather and gallops over the hilltop with Emilie's grandfather following. When he reaches the top of the hill he sees the Germans who had been at the farm earlier corralling Joey and Topthorn. Emilie is returned to her Grandfather, who requests that the Germans at least leave Joey with them. However, the officer in charge claims that both Joey and Topthorn are needed for the war effort, and will pull artillery until the war ends, or they die. Both Emilie and her Grandfather can only stand by and watch as Joey and Topthorn are led away.The horses are put into the care of Friedrich (Nicolas Bro) who quickly becomes attached to them. When one of the horses pulling a huge gun collapses, he is shot, and the office in charge calls for Friedrich to bring another horse. He starts to bring Joey, but the officer tells him to bring Topthorn instead, which he does. However, Friedrich pleads that Topthorn is not healthy enough to pull the gun, but he is about to lose when Joey races up the hill to take Topthorn's place. The office allows this and Friedrich takes Topthorn back behind the guns. Joey then struggles along with the other horses to pull the huge gun the rest of the way up the hill, where it is set up and starts firing at the allies' lines while Joey rejoins Topthorn and Friedrich.The scene shifts to the British trenches at The Somme in 1918, and we see Albert and others from his village as they prepare to charge across no mans land to reach the German lines. The charge starts and Albert makes it all the across and is the first to reach the German trenches. He finds no living Germans, only dead ones as he is joined by other British troops. As they investigate the Germans release gas and all goes white.The scene shifts back to Joey, Topthorn and Friedrich as they walk along a wide trench towards the front when Topthorn falters. Friedrich takes them aside, and Topthorn lies down and dies as Joey and Friedrich look on. Suddenly the Germans still marching forward turn and run in the other direction and shortly we see a tank which turns toward Friedrich and Joey. Friedrich runs back the way the other Germans have gone, but Joey is trapped from escaping by the tank. As it comes closer and closer, Joey looks desperately for a way out and finally he gallops straight over the tank and then turns toward the front. We next see him at night as he tries to jump across the German trench, but finally tumbles into it where he gallops through the trenches until he is able to get back to the top. Joey is now in no mans land, and he gallops straight towards the British lines, pulling up barbed wire fencing until he is totally entangled in it.Unable to move, he calms down, and the next morning both the British and Germans are amazed to see Joey in the middle of no mans land. A British soldier puts his handkerchief on his bayonet and slowly goes over the top to attempt to help Joey, A German soldier fires a warning shot at him, but the rest of the German refrain while he makes his way to Joey. When he reaches Joey he realizes that he should have brought wire cutters and gloves as he realizes that there is noting he can do without them. Just then, a German soldier reaches them, and the two of them work together to free Joey. Once he is free the two soldiers both want him, and agree to flip a coin for him. The British soldier wins, and takes Joey back to the British lines, and to the hospital where Albert is, receiving treatment from being blinded by the gas attack. While he is being treated, word spreads about the 'miraculous horse' that was caught in barbed wire in the No Man's Land, and the words reach Albert's ears.The British Soldier who retrieved Joey from the field asks a doctor to treat him, but the doctor refuses and instructs Sergeant Fry (Eddie Marsan) to put the horse down. Just then Albert, hearing the horse, starts calling him with the call he trained Joey to respond to before the war. Everyone stands still, and then as Albert moves towards Joey, everyone clears a path. As they watch, Joey comes towards Albert, and the young man, though his eyes covered, believes he has found his friend again. The Sergeant claims that the horse can't possibly be Albert's, but Albert describes Joey's 'white-socked' marks above each foot, and the white symbol on his forehead. The Sergeant then pockets his gun, and several others help Albert take Joey to a nearby stable.The war ends, but Albert is not allowed to take the horse back to England, despite his protests and those of his comrades. Due to regulations, all horses not owned by officers will be sold at auction. On the day of the auction, Albert is surprised to find that his comrades have collected all the money they have, and give it to him so he can buy Joey back from the army. At the auction, the local butcher shows up,and intends to wins Joey for himself. As the bidding between the two goes up, and it seems like Albert will lose, Emilie's grandfather appears and outbids both by a wide margin. He further states that he will do whatever he must to win Joey, even if it requires him selling his farm. After he wins and takes possession of Joey, Joey breaks free and goes over to Albert who brings him back to the grandfather. Albert and the grandfather talk and Albert learns that Joey is all the grandfather has left to remember Emilie, who has died. However, the grandfather is unable to bring himself take Joey away from Albert and gives him back, as that is what Emilie would have wanted.The final scene is Albert riding Joey home to the family farm where he embraces his mother and then his father, amid the reddish hues of the setting sun.", "output": "Question: Who owns the horse?, Answer: Albert's father because he originally bought the horse, Question: who was Joey's commanding officier?, Answer: Captain Nichols, Question: What does Albert name the horse?, Answer: Joey, Question: Which war did Albert's father fight in?, Answer: Second Boer War, Question: Why were the flag and medals thrown away?, Answer: Shane, Question: In which battle is Albert fighting?, Answer: Second Battle of the Somme, Question: What does the teenage boy named Albert witnessed?, Answer: Joey being sold, Question: Who won the horse in a coin flip?, Answer: British, Question: Who is sent to the front line?, Answer: Michael, Question: Who dies in the movie?, Answer: Topthorn, Question: Why did Emilie's grandfather give back Joey?, Answer: That's what Emilie would have wanted., Question: Who is given money collected from his fellow soldiers?, Answer: Ted because he sells the horse to the army, Question: Who is the bidder?, Answer: The local butcher, Albert, and Emilie's grandfather., Question: Where is Albert From?, Answer: England, Question: Who pleads for the horse?, Answer: Albert pleads for the horse., Question: Who was assigned to take care of Joey and Topthorn?, Answer: Albert, Question: What is the horse's name?, Answer: Joey, Question: How does Albert imitate the call of the owl?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What should be auctioned as per the order?, Answer: All horses not belonging to officers., Question: Who is Albert's best friend?, Answer: Emily, Question: What year did Albert witness the birth of the horse?, Answer: 1914, Question: Who takes care of Joey and Topthorn?, Answer: Nicholls and Major Jamie Stewart, Question: Who Produced the movie?, Answer: Steven Spielberg, Question: What markings did Joey have?, Answer: White socked marks above each foot and white mark on his forehead, Question: Where are they deployed to?, Answer: Flanders with a flying column, Question: What destroys the turnip crop of 1914?, Answer: Heavy downpour, Question: Why can't Albert enlist in the army?, Answer: Too young, Question: Who was killed in the gas attack?, Answer: Andrew, Question: Who does Albert's father outbid at the auction?, Answer: Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), Question: Under whose command is Albert fighting?, Answer: David", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The Time Enforcement Commission (TEC) has been established to police the use of time travel, with Senator Aaron McComb overseeing operations. Police officer Max Walker has been offered a position with the TEC but is unsure whether or not to accept. While at home with his wife Melissa, he is attacked by unknown assailants and witnesses the house explode, killing her.Ten years later, Walker is a veteran of the TEC working under Commissioner Eugene Matuzak, who sends him back to 1929 to prevent his former partner, Lyle Atwood, from using knowledge of the future to financially benefit from the U.S. stock market crash. When confronted, Atwood admits to be working for Senator McComb, who needs the funds for his upcoming presidential campaign. Fearing that McComb will erase him from history, Atwood attempts to jump to his death, but Walker catches him mid-leap and returns to 2004. Refusing to testify, Atwood is sentenced to execution and is returned to 1929 where he resumes falling to his death.Walker is assigned a new partner, TEC rookie Sarah Fielding, and together they are sent back to 1994 to investigate McComb. They witness a meeting between young McComb and business partner Jack Parker, where McComb wishes to withdraw over a disagreement about a new computer chip. They are interrupted by the older McComb, who arrives from 2004 to stop the exchange claiming the chip will become highly profitable. Older McComb specifically tells his younger self not to touch him as the same matter cannot occupy the same space, and then kills Parker. Fielding turns on Walker, revealing that she works for McComb, and after a shootout Fielding is wounded and Walker escapes back to 2004.Walker returns to the TEC to find the future altered. McComb is now sole owner of the computer company and is a presidential front runner while the TEC is being shut down due to budget cuts. Walker appeals to Matuzak, who has no knowledge of the alternate present. Matuzak sends Walker back to the past in a prototype time machine, sacrificing himself in the process.Back in 1994, Walker finds Fielding in the hospital and after interrogation she agrees to testify against McComb, though she is murdered in her room shortly thereafter. While at the hospital, Walker finds a record of a recent visit by his wife Melissa, discovering that she was pregnant. Realizing that she would be killed later that night, he tracks her down and reveals himself to be from the future.That night, the younger Walker returns home and is attacked just as before, with the assailants revealed to be in McComb's employ, but is unknowingly aided by his older self who has been lying in wait. With the assailants defeated, the older McComb steps in and takes Melissa hostage, confronting the older Walker with the bomb. Walker then reveals that he had previously lured the younger McComb to the house, who enters the room. After McComb wounds Melissa, Walker pushes the two McCombs together and, as the same matter cannot occupy the same space, they merge together into a liquefied mass before disappearing from existence. Walker then escapes with Melissa before the bomb explodes and lays her down beside his unconscious younger self before returning to the future.Back in 2004, Walker finds the timeline changed for the better.

Nick's flight attendant girlfriend, Diane (Angela Bassett), encourages this decision, promising to fully commit to their relationship if he does indeed go straight. Nick, however, is lured into taking one final score by his fence Max (Marlon Brando). The job, worth a $4 million pay off to Nick, is to steal a valuable French scepter, which was being smuggled illegally into the United States through Canada but was accidentally discovered and kept at the Montr\u00e9al Customs House.Max introduces Nick to Jack Teller (Edward Norton), an ambitious, albeit foolhardy, thief who has infiltrated the Customs House and gained access to information regarding the security by pretending to be an intellectually disabled janitor named Brian. Nick hires his associate Steven (Jamie Harrold) to hack into the Custom House's security system to obtain the bypass codes, allowing them to temporarily manipulate the alert protocols of the system during the heist. Steven is caught, however, by a systems administrator who extorts Nick for $50,000 for the information. More complications arise when they're forced to move up their time-table after the Customs House becomes aware of the true value of the scepter and adds extra CCTV cameras to monitor it while preparing to return it to its rightful owners.Nick uses a sewer tunnel to enter the Customs House basement as Jack uses the bypass codes to rig the cameras to shut off while Nick sneaks into the storage room. One of the janitors stumbles upon Jack as he is working and realizes that he is not really Brian, but Jack locks him in a closet. Meanwhile Nick fills the enormous in-floor safe containing the scepter with water before inserting and detonating a depth charge to blow off the door. He quickly packs up the scepter in a carrying case to depart, but Jack double crosses him and at gunpoint demands he hand over the scepter. Nick reluctantly gives up the carrying case and seconds later the alarm, rigged by Jack, alerts the entire security team to the heist. Nick darts for the sewer entrance he came in as Jack heads back upstairs, tucking the carrying case inside his janitor jumpsuit and slipping past the incoming police units responding to the burglary. Nick escapes the security guards chasing him through the sewer tunnels.After making it to a bus station to flee the city, Jack calls Nick to gloat but is shocked to discover that Nick has anticipated Jack's actions. He opens the carrying case Nick gave him and discovers it contains a steel rod weighed down with bushings. Brushing off Jack's threats of vengeance, Nick advises Jack to flee as \"every cop in the city\" will now be looking for him. Nick hangs up and boards a boat with the real scepter as a shocked Jack broods over his situation. Later, Max smiles as he watches a news broadcast reporting a massive manhunt being organized to find Jack, the prime suspect, and an unidentified accomplice.

Actuary Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) is sitting in his dull, gray office watching the clock until it hits five. There are packed boxes all around him, implying that this is his last day at work.The clock hits five and Warren solemnly grabs his coat, turns out the lights and leaves.In the next scene, Warren is driving at night in the rain with his wife Helen to a steakhouse where his retirement party is being held. The affair is rather quiet and solemn, with the new guy replacing Warren offering a tribute and telling Warren to feel free to come down to the office any time, mentioning that he may need some help with Warren's old accounts. Warren's best friend and co-worker Ray, who is obviously inebriated, delivers an impassioned speech for his friend. Warren appears touched at the sentiment and excuses himself. He retreats to the other side of the restaurant where the bar is and orders a drink. It's obvious he is not happy to retire.When Warren and Helen return home, their daughter Jeannie calls to wish Warren well. They discuss her upcoming wedding. Before bed, Helen remarks to Warren that she wishes he would try to be more friendly to Jeannie's fianc\u00e9.In the days following Warren's retirement, he is not sure what to do with himself. Helen surprises him with breakfast in their newly purchased Winnebago, saying how much fun they are going to have traveling the country. Warren doesn't appear enthused, but puts on a smile for his wife. A visit back to the office to visit his replacement doesn't go well; the new guy brushes him off, and Warren is taken aback by it. As he leaves the building, he passes a dumpster and discovers all of his old files have been thrown away. When he gets home, however, he tells Helen that the visit went well and that the new guy needed his help.Days pass and Warren spends his time sitting in front of the TV feeling sorry for himself. As he's flipping channels he comes across a commercial for a Third World relief fund where people can \"adopt\" a young African child (trivia: that's Angela Lansbury's voice in the commercial). Warren makes the call.After some more days of loafing and moping around, Warren receives his packet in the mail. He has \"adopted\" a young Tanzanian boy named Ndugu. He is advised in the letter to write to the young boy, so he does. In the letter (done in voiceover, which is very funny), he tells Ndugu about his life, how he's been married for 42 years... and soon the letter spirals into a rant about how he was cast aside by Woodmen, how his wife is starting to annoy him, and how his daughter is about to marry a loser waterbed salesman named Randall. He goes off to mail the letter, and his wife tells him not to dilly-dally.Next we see Warren heading into a Dairy Queen, where he gets some ice cream. He comes home to find Helen unconscious on the floor. She has died.Jeannie and Randall fly in for the funeral; Warren is very happy to see her but is rather stiff toward Randall, who is just emotional over the death. After the funeral Warren's friend Ray is sobbing violently (somewhat important later).Jeannie and Randall stay for a while at Warren's house. Warren asks Jeannie to stay longer, implying that he'd like for her to take care of him, but Jeannie is adamant about getting back to Denver to plan the wedding. Warren is upset that Jeannie still wants to go through with it; he thinks she should postpone because of Helen's death, but Jeannie insists her mother would want her to get married. Jeannie then rails on Warren for buying a cheap casket, saying that Helen deserved more. Eventually Jeannie and Randall leave for Denver, telling Warren they'll see him in a few weeks.Warren writes another letter to Ndugu about Helen's death, taking back all the bad things he said about her previously. This is done in a voiceover as Warren goes through her makeup, putting on her cold cream, and going through her closets. He then opens a shoebox and finds several to letters to \"My darling Helen\" which were not written by him. He looks closely at the signature and realizes who his wife had an affair with. In a rage, he sweeps all of Helen's belongings into boxes and throws them into a local recycling bin. Then he drives to a barber shop. Seconds later, Ray comes out and Warren confronts him with the letters. Ray tries to explain that the affair happened 25-30 years ago, but Warren clumsily punches him anyway and drives off in a rage.Warren decides since there's nothing left at home for him, he will go to Denver early. He loads up the Winnebago and takes off. Within a few hours he calls Jeannie at a gas station pay phone to say he's coming. Jeannie freaks out, and insists he go home until it's time to come for the wedding. Warren is very upset as he hangs up, feeling unneeded. He decides to take a leisurely pace, and in another letter to Ndugu, he tells of his pathetic adventures visiting the site of his childhood home-- which is now a tire store-- and his old fraternity at the University of Kansas, where the current frat brothers do not connect with him. He goes on to visit an arrowhead museum and ruminate about Native Americans, then buys some Hummel figurines like his wife collected.He's finishing the letter to Ndugu in an RV campground just as there's a knock on his door. John Rusk, another Winnebago enthusiast, greets him and invites him over to dinner with him and his wife Vicki. John and Vicki turn out to be two unbearably perky people from Wisconsin; Warren is perplexed by them at first, but later he warms up to them. After dinner, John leaves to get some more beer, while Vicki shows Warren pictures of their family. When they are alone, Vicki makes an observation that Warren is a sad person. Warren admits this and breaks down a little bit. When he tries to kiss Vicki, she shrieks and kicks him out of her camper. Warren goes back to his Winnebago and takes off into the night, passing a confused John on the road.In an deserted spot, Warren sits on top of his Winnebago with lighted candles and the Hummels, talking to Helen and wondering what he did to drive her into an affair. He asks her forgiveness for not being a good enough husband, and sees a shooting star. The next morning he takes off, leaving the candles and figurines on the roof. One by one they slide off the roof as he drives.Warren eventually arrives in Denver at the house of Randall's mother, Roberta (the wonderful Kathy Bates). Roberta's house is full of odd decorations which match her dotty personality. She is very outgoing and Warren seems somewhat frightened of her. Jeannie and Randall arrive, and Warren tries to get Jeannie alone to tell her to call off the wedding, but she is too busy.Dinner is a tense event. Roberta and Randall's father (her ex) Larry (an almost unrecognizable Howard Hesseman) snipe at each other. Randall's brother Duncan acts like a zombie, and Warren is watching everything and wondering why he is there. After dinner he finally gets Jeannie alone and begs her not to marry Randall, saying she deserves better. Jeannie tears into him, saying he was never there for her in the past but now wants to run her life. She says she will marry Randall, and Warren will come to the wedding and deal with it. Warren is very hurt at her behavior.Warren is given Randall's old room, equipped with a waterbed. He looks around to see Randall's honorable mention trophies and participant certificates (to enhance just how average the guy is). Warren wakes up the next morning with his back out of whack from sleeping on the bed. Jeannie thinks he's faking it and is furious. Roberta becomes Warren's nursemaid. Very funny scene follows as Roberta feeds him soup for lunch and goes into detail about Jeannie and Randall's sex life. Warren is very uncomfortable, and Roberta gives him some Percodan to get him through the rehearsal.At the rehearsal, Warren is completely stoned but gets through it and the dinner. Roberta takes him home and puts him in the hot tub. Here Warren is finally relaxed, until Roberta comes out. She disrobes and goes down into the tub with him (she's completely naked, he's wearing swim trunks). Roberta slowly hits on Warren, making him so distraught that he soon leaves to retreat to his Winnebago, where he spends the night.The next day is the wedding, which goes off without a hitch. Warren is restrained throughout the whole ceremony and reception. After Randall's best man gives the speech, he hands the mic over to Warren. Jeannie appears nervous, but Warren goes into a speech, then pauses. He mentions Helen dying and delivers an impassioned speech about how Helen wanted to see Jeannie happy. He then offers a nice tribute to Roberta and Larry, as well as Larry's wife, and even finds something nice to say about Duncan. The crowd applauds and Warren retreats immediately to the men's room to control himself. The reception goes on gaily.Another letter to Ndugu in voiceover as Warren drives home. He writes about the wedding and how Jeannie and Randall are in Orlando on his nickel, and that there's nothing he can do about her life anymore. On his trip home east, Warren stops at a museum and marvels at the courageous journeys pioneers had made going west, prompting him to ponder what he has accomplished in the direction of his life. He is depressed that he hasn't made one bit of difference to anybody, that he hasn't done anything important.He returns home; the house is a mess and there's a huge pile of mail behind the door. Warren quietly collects everything and goes to his den to sift through it. He finds a letter from a nun who works at Ndugu's orphanage, and she explains that Ndugu cannot yet read or write, but he enjoys Warren's letters, and he likes to paint. A picture by Ndugu for Warren in enclosed in the letter, and Warren unfolds it to see two smiling stick figures holding hands (one child and one adult, apparently Warren and Ndugu). Warren breaks down and cries, realizing that he indeed has made a difference in somebody's life.", "output": "Question: Who decided to visit places from the past?, Answer: Warren, Question: What does Schmidt discover in his wife's closet?, Answer: Hidden love letters, Question: Where does Schmidt arrive after feeling full of purpose and energetic renewal?, Answer: in Denver, Question: Where does Jeannie arrive from?, Answer: Denver, Question: What was Helen buried in?, Answer: in a cheap casket, Question: Where does Roberta ask Schmidt to soak, which will help his back?, Answer: in her hot tub will help his back, Question: Who questions what he has accomplished in life?, Answer: Schmidt, Question: What type business is Woodmen of the World?, Answer: a life insurance company, Question: Does Schmidt's successor accept Schmidt's help?, Answer: offer is politely declined, Question: Who does the daughter want to marry?, Answer: Randall, Question: What position did Warren Schmidt hold at Woodmen of the World?, Answer: An actuary, Question: What happened in the winnebago?, Answer: Helen make him brekafast, Question: Who makes a pass at Schmidt, and makes him flee the hot tub?, Answer: a nude Roberta, Question: How did Helen die?, Answer: dies from a blood clot in her brain, Question: What does Schmidt see after forgiving his wife ?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What does Schmidt forgive his departed wife for ?, Answer: for her affair, Question: What is Randall's occupation?, Answer: a waterbed salesman, Question: Who wrote the letter to Schmidt from Tanzania?, Answer: a nun, Question: Does Schmist think his life made a difference to anyone?, Answer: yes, Question: Where is Schmidt before he is on his way home?, Answer: Winnebago, Question: Who composes a letter to Ndugu?, Answer: Schmidt, Question: What did the nun enclose with the letter to Schmidt?, Answer: A crayon drawing by Ndugu, Question: What does Schmidt lament?, Answer: dead", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

She speaks angrily and rapidly, but seems to have a language of her own. Looking at Violet's Bible, Jerry finds a note asking whoever finds it to look after Violet's daughter Nell. Sheriff Todd Peterson shows Jerry a news clipping that Nell was conceived through rape.Jerry seeks the help of Dr. Paula Olsen, a researcher working with autistic children. Paula and her colleague Dr. Alexander \"Al\" Paley are interested in studying a \"wild child\" (feral child), and Al continues calling Nell this even after studying films showing that Nell does not fit the \"wild child\" profile. Paula and Al get a court order to institutionalize Nell for further study. Jerry hires lawyer Don Fontana and prevents it. The judge gives Jerry and Paula three months to interact with Nell and see what her needs are. Paula shows up on a houseboat with electronic equipment to monitor Nell's behavior while Jerry chooses to stay in Nell's cabin and quietly observe.Paula discovers that Nell's seemingly indecipherable language is English, based partly on her mother's aphasic speech after a stroke, and partly on the secret language she shared with her decades deceased identical twin sister. Jerry and Paula begin a grudging friendship.Nell sleeps during the day or works inside her home and is active outdoors only after sunset. She explains to Jerry that her mother told her about the rape and warned her that men were evildoers. As Nell comes to trust Jerry, she sees him as a friend, the \"gah'inja\" her mother promised would come. Jerry later realizes that \"gah'inja\" is Nell's phrase for \"guardian angel.\" Using popcorn as an incentive, Jerry is able to lead Nell outside and into the sun. Nell leads Jerry and Paula to the decayed remains of her identical twin sister, May, who died in a fall while the two were playing in the woods.Mike Ibarra, a reporter, learns of Nell's existence and visits her cabin. Nell is curious of the visitor at first, but when he snaps a photo, the flash frightens Nell. Jerry arrives and throws the reporter out. Paula believes that Nell would be safer in a hospital, while Jerry feels that Nell should be left alone and allowed to live as she pleases. The two decide that Nell should be shown a little of the world, and they make the decision to bring Nell into town.While in town, Nell befriends Mary, Todd's depressed wife, but also encounters some raunchy boys in a pool hall until Jerry gets her out. With increased intrusion by the press, Jerry and Paula take Nell to a hospital for her protection. There, Nell becomes extremely despondent and unresponsive. Jerry removes her from the hospital and hides her in a hotel. Paula joins him, and the two admit that they love each other.At the court hearing the next day, Al, who wants to study Nell in a controlled environment, delivers his opinion that Nell has Asperger syndrome and belongs in an institution.

The couple's taciturn grounds man Peter (Al Cliver) is happy enough looking after the slavering pack of dogs the couple own. But the maid Maria (Carla Cassola) is becoming more and more suspicious of her sinister employers that they are hiding something. Sure enough, she discovers the dead bodies of a money-grabbing nephew (Paolo Bernardi) and his wife (Francesco De Rose) lying preserved in open coffins in the wine cellar. Maria is gorily killed by the elderly Sarah in the greenhouse the next morning while announcing her plans to quit.Meanwhile, three hoodlums, Diana (Karina Huff), Tony (Keith Van Hoven) and Paul (Peter Hintz) are driving through the area and decide to rob the old couple's house after receiving a tip-off from a grocery store owner in a nearby town about the wealth it supposedly contains and the decrepitude of the owners. That evening, Diana cunningly talks her way into the household by pretending that her car has broken down nearby and asks to use the phone. Soon, the phone lines are cut by her male accomplices and they force entry through an open window. Their plans to rob the old couple go badly wrong when Peter intervenes with his shotgun. A bloodbath ensues with Sarah accidentally getting shot, Peter getting killed by Paul, and Victor attacks Tony, forcing Diana to shoot him dead. The young trio are horrified by this turn of events, but decide to bundle the bodies away in a cupboard.At first the dazed criminals fail to notice what effect the mayhem has had on all the clocks in the house. Each clock stops at 8:00 PM, the exact time the couple were killed. When they do notice, they try to leave, but are trapped indoors by the Dobermans let loose to prowl the grounds. Stranger still, the clocks begin to move in reverse, first slowly, then faster. The three decide to relax in the house overnight, and they head off upstairs to smoke some joints. Diana and Tony get a little too drawn into it and start to make out with each other, and soon begin to have sex.Paul, who is left out of the lovemaking, wonders dejectedly downstairs. He discovers the bloodstains on the dining room floor where the killings took place have disappeared, and then he sees the bodies lying back where they'd fallen. Before he can alert the others, Paul is shot by an unseen figure stalking the house. Hearing the gunshot, Diana and Tony quickly dress and rush downstairs and see the old couple reanimate and advance towards them. In the kitchen, Diana is trapped by the old woman who grabs a knife and stabs her through the hand, pinning her to the kitchen table. The old Sarah then retrieves a ring that Diana had stolen from her ring finger. Making a narrow escape, Diana and Tony find a severely wounded Paul in the cellar. Illogical time distortions continue as Diana's hand heals up while Paul's injuries remain. Diana and Tony escape from the cellar through a high window and emerge into the grounds. Paul is too injured to hoist himself up to the window and is axed to death by the vengefully reanimated Peter. As the couple run across the grounds, now in daylight with the clocks in full reverse, Tony is pulled into a shallow grave by the corpse of Maria, the maid. She kills him with a wooden stick though his stomach before heading off to confront the old couple. In the wine cellar, Maria confronts the elderly couple with murdering their nephew and his wife to remove them as their rightful heirs to the estate. Then, the niece and nephew finally revive and the old couple are killed again by their previous victims. Diana staggers away from the house.Suddenly, Diana, Tony, and Paul awaken in their car outside the country house. Apparently all that that happened to them was just a dream brought on with special intensity by the marijuana they've been smoking. Inside the house, the fully alive nephew and niece enjoy being alive again and are having their morning breakfast, with Maria the maid attending to them. The dead bodies of Victor and Sarah are in the wine cellar having been substituted for them.Driving away from the house, Diana, Tony, and Paul remark on the astonishing similarities of their dreams of being at the house and time moving backwards. Suddenly, a dead cat they picked up on the road earlier suddenly revives and attacks them, forcing Tony, who's driving, to crash their car off a cliff and killing them all... again?! Inexplicably, the car's clock and all the wristwatches on the bloodied and dead Diana, Tony, and Paul stop, and begin to roll backwards...Quote from Honor\u00e9 de Balzac: \"If time turned back, our sins would also have to start anew.\"", "output": "Question: How are the criminal trio killed ?, Answer: Their car crashes off a cliff killing them., Question: How is Maria associated with the elderly couple?, Answer: She is the maid., Question: What does Maria find ?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What animal did they pick up on the side of the road?, Answer: A cat., Question: At what time do all the clocks stop?, Answer: 8:00PM, Question: What breed of dog do the elderly couple own?, Answer: Doberman., Question: At what time do the clocks stop ?, Answer: Each clock stops at 8:00 PM, the exact time the couple were killed., Question: Where do Victor and Sarah live ?, Answer: They live in a rambling country house filled with clocks of all shapes and sizes., Question: What object is Tony killed with?, Answer: A wooden stick., Question: What drug induced them to have this dream?, Answer: Marijuana.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The boys want to try to intervene, but their father warns them that it would be useless to act when they are so heavily outnumbered. When the stagecoach driver overpowers one of the robbers and uses him as a human shield, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), the leader of the gang, callously shoots both men dead.Wade and his men stop at the saloon in nearby Bisbee, Arizona, posing as cowhands. Wade stays to seduce the pretty barmaid, Emmy (Felicia Farr). Contrary to his casual violence toward men, Wade shows real tenderness and affection for the lonely woman. He is captured, but his chief henchman Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckel) gets away with the news. The townspeople fear what his men will do, so the town marshal decides to have two volunteers sneak the prisoner to Contention City to catch a train, the 3:10 to Yuma. Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt), the stage-line owner, offers $200 for the dangerous job. Desperate for cash after three years of drought and feeling disappointed in himself for not being able to provide his family with a better life, Dan jumps at the opportunity. The only other man interested is the town drunk, Alex Potter (Henry Jones). When no one else steps forward, the marshal reluctantly accepts them.Wade is placed on a stagecoach, which then stops (in view of some of the gang) for a faked repair; the outlaw is secretly taken off while the stage continues on with an imposter, in the hopes that by the time the outlaws figure out what has happened, it will be too late. Wade is taken to Dan's ranch, where he tries to charm Dan's devoted wife Alice (Leora Dana) while she serves supper to the family and Wade. Dan's sons berate the outlaw, but Alice insists that they show proper hospitality to their \"guest.\" Once again, Wade displays surprisingly genuine appreciation and respect for a hard-working woman.Dan, Alex and Wade leave under cover of darkness, reaching Contention City at daybreak. Butterfield has reserved the bridal suite at the hotel. While they wait for the train, Wade tries several times to bribe Dan into letting him go, reminding Dan that he has a fine wife and family waiting for him. Dan is irritated by Wade's inducements, especially Wade's comments about his wife, but he is greatly tempted by his offers of cash that \"no one will ever know about.\" Confident that his men will rescue him before he's taken to the train, Wade never shows anything but calm bemusement to his captor. His interest in Dan seems to go beyond a simple exchange of freedom for cash. The local sheriff is out of town, so Butterfield hires five men to help escort the prisoner to the train.Things go awry when the slain stagecoach driver's brother, Bob Moons (Sheridan Comerate), barges in unexpectedly, seeking revenge. Dan wrestles his gun away, but in the struggle, it goes off. Charlie Prince hears the gunshot and spots Wade in a window. He rides off to fetch the rest of the gang.The men Butterfield recruited watch as seven outlaws enter the town. Not liking the odds, they retreat, leaving only Dan, Alex and Butterfield. When Alex goes out to reconnoiter, he spots one of Wade's men on a rooftop opposite the hotel. Alex calls out, warning Dan, but is shot in the back by Prince. The gang hangs the wounded Alex from the lobby chandelier, killing him. Butterfield decides that Wade is no longer worth the risk, releasing Dan from his obligation, with pay. Alice arrives and also tries to change her husband's mind, but he is committed: \"The town drunk gave his life because he believed that people should be able to live in decency and peace together. You think I can do less?\"When the clock strikes three, Dan escorts Wade out a back door. Gang members take shots whenever they can without endangering Wade, but despite their best efforts, they cannot stop the pair from reaching the platform, where the train is waiting.Finally, the outlaws emerge to confront Dan as the train starts to leave. Prince shouts for Wade to drop down to allow them a clear shot at Dan. Instead, Wade unexpectedly tells Dan to jump into the passing baggage car. They leap to safety together. The gang pursues the train, but Dan shoots Prince and the rest give up pursuit. Wade confidently claims he has broken out of the Yuma jail before (implying he can do so again), but his true motivation is not clear. Alice sees Dan safe on the train as rain pours down on her, breaking the long drought.", "output": "Question: What kind of a man is Wade?, Answer: He is an outlaw., Question: Who was the leader of the gang?, Answer: Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), Question: Where do Dan and Wade leap to for safety?, Answer: baggage car, Question: How many outlaws enter the town?, Answer: 7., Question: who hears the gunshot?, Answer: Charlie, Question: Where do Wade and his men stop at in Bisbee, Arizona?, Answer: Saloon, Question: What time is it when the train is waiting at platform?, Answer: 3, Question: who is slain stagecoach brother?, Answer: Bob Moons, Question: Who reserved the bridal suite at the hotel?, Answer: Butterfield, Question: Who witnessed a stagecoach holdup?, Answer: rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his young son, Question: Why is Dan irritated?, Answer: Wade's inducements., Question: Where does the gang hang Alex?, Answer: From the lobby chandelier., Question: Who confronts Dan when the train starts to leave?, Answer: outlaws, Question: Does Wade respect Alice?, Answer: Wade displays surprisingly genuine appreciation and respect for a hard-working woman., Question: How much does Mr. Butterfield offer for the dangerous job?, Answer: $200, Question: Is Dan married?, Answer: Yes, he has a devoted wife named Alice., Question: Who shots Alex in the back?, Answer: Prince., Question: Who sees Dan safe on the train?, Answer: Alice, Question: Who is the town drunk?, Answer: Alex Potter, Question: How many men did Butterfield hire to help escort the priosoner?, Answer: Five.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (April 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)The film opens with an animated prologue revealing the origins of leprechauns, stating that they were summoned by a king to protect his gold. After the death of the king the Leprechauns returned to their places of origin, all except one (Warwick Davis) who through the ages slowly became corrupted and obsessed with the gold he still guarded. In the present, Father Jacob (Willie C. Carpenter) finds the leprechaun's gold and intends to build a youth center. Jacob manages to banish Lubdan the Leprechaun, summoning demonic hands which drag him underground, but soon after dies of injuries inflicted by the leprechaun during the fight.One year later, two friends Emily Woodrow (Tangi Miller) and Lisa Duncan (Sherrie Jackson), have their fortune told when the clairvoyant Esmeralda (Donzaleigh Abernathy) who warns them that they will attain great wealth soon, but it must be denied as it will come at a great price and summon a terrible evil. While having a barbecue at the abandoned youth center construction site with Lisa, their stoner friend Jamie Davis (Page Kennedy) and her ex-boyfriend-turned-drug dealer Rory Jackson (Laz Alonso), Emily falls through a hole and discovers the Leprechaun's gold in a tunnel where it was hidden by Father Jacob. Evenly splitting up the gold, the quartet of friends use it to fulfill their fantasies, unaware that by taking the gold they have released Lubdan the Leprechaun, who begins stalking the group (killing a guest by impaling his chest with a bong, taking one of his coins at a party held by Jamie, prompting the police to temporarily arrest him). At the salon where Emily works the Leprechaun sneaks in and, after killing a regular customer, Doria, on the massage table by breaking her neck, attacks Emily, who barely escapes and warns Rory and the recently released Jamie, who rush to get to Lisa's. In her house, Lisa is attacked by the Leprechaun and manages to fight him off for a short while, but is killed when the Leprechaun claws her in the stomach, with her friends finding her body.While Emily and Jamie want to return the gold, Rory does not and takes off with it; shortly after realizing Rory is gone, Emily is attacked and chased outside by the Leprechaun, but is saved when Rory has a change of heart and comes back for her. Searching for Rory, Lubdan stops by his house and kills Rory's profligate girlfriend Chanel (Keesha Sharp) by tearing out her jaw, reclaiming the gold she used to make a tooth while Rory and Emily are stopped and harassed by Officers Thompson (Beau Billingslea) and Whitaker (Chris Murray). After the Leprechaun appears and kills the two officers, Emily and Rory escape and regroup with Jamie, only to be confronted by a machine gun wielding group of Rory's drug-dealing rivals, led by Watson (Shiek Mahmud-Bey) and Cedric (Sticky Fingaz). Planning on killing Rory for infringing on their territory, Watson and his gang are all disposed of by Lubdan, while Emily, Rory and Jamie drive off in Watson's car (which Lubdan latches to the bottom of for a short while) and go looking for help from Esmeralda.Told to use four-leaf clovers against the Leprechaun by Esmeralda, Rory laces the hollow-point bullets of his gun with clovers Jamie finds in the marijuana Rory had earlier sold him. When the Leprechaun arrives, Rory shoots him several times with the clover bullets, only for his gun to jam before he can finish the Leprechaun off. Rory and Emily are given the chance to run with the gold when the Leprechaun is distracted by Jamie, who is quickly wounded with a baseball bat to the leg, and Esmeralda dies in a magical duel with the Leprechaun. Followed to the roof of the building, Rory tries fighting Lubdan and is knocked out, though before the Leprechaun can kill him, Emily taunts him by throwing some of his gold into nearby wet cement and lures him into the ruins of the youth center, where she tosses his gold into a furnace before knocking the Leprechaun in with it.Believing the Leprechaun is dead, Emily returns to Rory, only for Lubdan to renew his attack on them. Knocking Emily off the roof and leaving her barely holding on, Lubdan taunts her, but is shot several times in the middle of his speech by Rory, who had fixed his gun. Shooting the Leprechaun repeatedly, Rory runs out of bullets, but distracts him long enough for Emily to hit Lubdan with the chest of coins, sending him off the rooftop and into the wet cement below, where the Leprechaun sinks and becomes trapped with his gold.The film then cuts back to the animated prologue like the one at the beginning, and Lubdan digs himself out of the ground, leaving on a cliffhanger.", "output": "Question: what does he lace with clovers?, Answer: hollow-point bullets, Question: Who does Jacob manage to banish?, Answer: Lubdan the Leprechaun, Question: Who finds the Leprechaun's gold?, Answer: Emily, Question: Who hid the Leprechaun's gold?, Answer: Father Jacob., Question: Who warns Rory?, Answer: Emily., Question: Who finds the leprechaun's gold?, Answer: Father Jacob, Question: What does Father Jacob intend to build with the gold?, Answer: A youth center, Question: Who does not want to return the gold?, Answer: Rory, Question: What does Jacob summon, to drag Lubdan underground?, Answer: Demonic hands, Question: Who does Rory try fighting?, Answer: Lubdan, Question: The film opens with a prologue revealing the origins of what?, Answer: Leprechauns, Question: who tells rory to use four-leaf clovers?, Answer: esmeralda, Question: How did the Leprechaun kill Doria?, Answer: Breaking her neck., Question: Who gets wrongfully arrested by the police?, Answer: Jamie, Question: The beginning of the movies starts with what type of prologue?, Answer: Animated, Question: Where does Emily toss the Leprechaun's gold?, Answer: A furnace, Question: What is the name of the Leprechaun?, Answer: Lubdan., Question: How does Lubdan kill Chanel?, Answer: Tearing out her jaw, Question: who are given a chance to run with the gold?, Answer: rory and emily, Question: After driving off in Watson's car, who do Emily, Rory, and Jamie seek help from?, Answer: Esmeralda, Question: Why does a machine gun wielding group of Rory's drug-dealing rivals confront the group?, Answer: To kill Rory for infringing on their territory., Question: Whom does Jacob mange to banish?, Answer: Lubdan the Leprechaun, Question: Who does Rory shoot several times?, Answer: Lubdan, Question: What does Rory save Emily from?, Answer: Leprechaun, Question: What friends had their fortune told?, Answer: Emily and Lisa., Question: Who disposes of Watson and his gang?, Answer: Lubdan, Question: What is revealed by the prologue of film?, Answer: The origins of leprechauns, Question: Who fell through the hole?, Answer: Emily., Question: What does Emily hit Lubdan with?, Answer: Chest of coins, Question: What did Rory lace the hollow-point of his gun with to use against the Leprechaun?, Answer: clovers, Question: Who disposed Watson and his gang?, Answer: Lubdan, Question: The leprechauns were summoned by a king to protect what?, Answer: His gold, Question: Who was it that did not want to return the gold to the Leprechaun?, Answer: Rory, Question: who does rory try fighting?, Answer: Lubdan, Question: Who does find the leprechaun's gold and intend to build a youth center?, Answer: Father Jacob, Question: who is rory told to use four-leaf clovers against?, Answer: Leprechaun, Question: who does rory shoot?, Answer: leprechaun, Question: who were the two officers who stopped to harass rory and emily?, Answer: Officers Thompson and Whitaker", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

An American P-38 Lightning fighter plane with smoke trailing from one of its engines sputters and loses altitude above an Italian coastal town. A pair of German officers abruptly interrupt their lunch to catch up with the rapidly descending plane. When the Germans arrive at the crash site, they encounter a burning fuselage surrounded by Italian soldiers. The soldiers explain that the pilot was killed in the crash. Satisfied, the Germans leave. As soon as they are gone, the Italians mock their imperious occupiers and part ranks to reveal a hidden and slightly injured American flyer, Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra).Ryan is taken to an Italian POW camp filled with British and American prisoners. Italian discipline over the camp is lax and the prisoners are filthy and ragged. Constant escape attempts have enraged the Italian commandant and resulted in the withholding of clean clothes, hot water, razors, and food parcels. The ranking British officer has just died while imprisoned in the camp sweat box. Command has fallen to the irascible British Major Fincham (Trevor Howard) of the Ninth Fusiliers. The pragmatic Ryan and the inflexible Major Fincham immediately clash, with Ryan outranking Fincham and able to coutermand his orders.With the Americans only weeks from liberating the camp, Ryan wants all futile escape attempts stopped. He betrays the active escape tunnels to the Italian commandant, Major Battaglia (Adolfo Celi), earning both the enmity of the British prisoners and the scornful nickname \"Von Ryan.\" As a reward for Ryan's cooperation, Battaglia turns the showers back on and issues razors and Red Cross parcels. But he balks at issuing clean clothing, since he is selling the donated clothes on the black market. Ryan orders the men to strip and burn their filthy clothes. As punishment, Ryan is placed in the sweat box while the men receive their clean clothing.Some time later, Ryan's fellow inmates release him from the box with the welcome news that the Allies have landed at Salerno and Italy has surrendered. The Italian guards have fled, but Major Battaglia has been captured. Major Fincham intends to convene a court martial before summarily executing him. Ryan intervenes, countermanding Fincham's orders and directing instead that Battaglia be confined in the sweat box. Fincham is furious and again accuses Ryan of treachery. Battaglia's second-in-command, Captain Oriani (Sergio Fantoni), tells the group that the Germans will soon be coming to recapture them, and he offers to lead the men to safety.The camp's 400 former inmates pour out of the stockade behind Oriani. German troops occupy the main roads, so the men are forced to travel through the woods, stopping for the night in some abandoned ruins. Captain Oriani goes ahead to scout out an escape route. Meanwhile, the Germans reach the empty prison camp and hear furious knocking from inside the sweat box. Battaglia is quickly released, and he informs the Germans of the recent prisoner exodus.The next morning, the escaped fugitives are quietly surrounded by German troops. Those prisoners who try to flee are gunned down, and the rest are marched to a nearby rail siding. The ambulatory prisoners are loaded onto boxcars while the sick and wounded are shot. Aboard the train, the men discover a severely beaten Captain Oriani. The train is apparently headed for a prison camp in Germany. More bitter recriminations are directed toward \"Von Ryan\" for his decision to spare Major Battaglia's life.The train stops in Rome, where the prisoners are offloaded and fed. Back on board the train, Major Fincham continues his steady stream of invective against Ryan. He sarcastically comments that they won't be able to \"tunnel\" their way out this time. The intended insult gives Ryan the idea for a desperate escape plan. Each boxcar is guarded by a German soldier riding on top, armed with a machine pistol. A couple of the floorboards in Ryan's boxcar are prised up so that there is a way to drop to the tracks below. After another brief stop and under the cover of darkness, the prisoners lower themselves one at a time from the slowly rolling train until their heels are dragging over the rail bed below the car. Then they allow themselves to fall flat on their backs as the cars pass over them. At the right moment, each prisoner rolls quickly between the wheels and over the rails, then springs upright to catch up with the nearest car. Once mounted on the ladders between cars, the prisoners are positioned to climb to the roof and crawl up behind each guard, strangling him with a rope. Ryan kills the first guard in this manner, appropriating his helmet and machine pistol. When the train stops again, Ryan orders Fincham to free other prisoners from the locked boxcars and attack the remaining guards. The prisoners are soon in command of the train, but just as they get underway they hear another train approaching from behind. The captured Wehrmacht officer aboard the prisoner train informs Ryan that it is a German troop train on the same schedule as their own and heading for the same destination- Innsbruck, Austria.Now the fleeing men must find a way to redirect their train toward neutral Switzerland, not an easy task when the rail lines and rolling stock are controlled by the Nazis. Many tense situations will have to be overcome as the action moves toward a violent climax high in the Italian Alps.", "output": "Question: When did Nazi occupied Italy?, Answer: August 1943, Question: What is the name of Fincham's unit?, Answer: the Ninth Fusiliers, Question: How do the prisoners escape the train cars?, Answer: drop to the tracks below, Question: Who is taken to an Italian POW camp?, Answer: Colonel Joseph Ryan, Question: What does Fincham want to do with Major Battaglia?, Answer: execute him, Question: Who all are there in the POW camp?, Answer: British and American Prisoners, Question: What are the German guards on the traincar roofs armed with?, Answer: a machine pistol, Question: What looses altitude above an Italian coastal town?, Answer: An American P-38 Lightning fighter plane, Question: How many former inmates escape the stockade?, Answer: 400, Question: Where must the fleeing men redirect the train to escape the Germans?, Answer: neutral Switzerland", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

While on stakeout the Wilson gang, composed of Ace (Gerrit Graham), Flash (Brian Seeman), and Ox (Darwyn Swalve), manages to slip through their fingers. The mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) to apprehend the gang. Lassard assembles a seven-man team consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler), and Lassard's nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy).After distributing flyers as to the information of the Wilson gang and getting nowhere, Nick stumbles upon a paper reporting an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait: however the robbers nab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. Nick then decides to go undercover to get information regarding a possible hideout, but Harris decides to go undercover to get a confession. Despite his fear of heights, Harris goes undercover as a window washer at a tall building and gets a confession of himself on tape after Proctor accidentally knocks him over the balcony.The robberies are committed by a group of three dimwitted criminals who don't seem to be able to do this on their own, and it's revealed they are being guided by a shadow figure known as the \"Mastermind,\" who speaks to the three behind a wall of glass and uses a voice distortion device. He devises a plan to get the cops out of the way.Commandant Lassard and his men are later suspended after jewelry from the gang's last robbery is found in Lassard's office, pending an investigation. The gang decides to clear his name by nabbing the gang and the ringleader. Accessing data files from a computer, Nick deduces that the robberies are occurring along a bus route, thus intentionally lowering property values in that part of the city. They also learn that someone must be leaking information to the bad guys, which is why they are always one step ahead of the police.The police academy force finds and does battle with the Wilson gang, taking down Ace, Flash, and Ox, while Nick chases the leader. A pursuit follows, which leads to Commissioner Hurst's (George Robertson) office. It's revealed that the mayor is the \"Mastermind\" and that Captain Harris has been unwittingly leaking information during his daily meetings with the mayor. Hurst apologizes and reinstates the force, and a plaque is given to honor the officers' bravery the next day.

Lizzie promises this is the last move, but, as Frankie observes, \"she says that every time\". As they are settling into a flat, we learn explicitly that Frankie is deaf.We hear Frankie's voice over as he writes a letter to his father, Petty Officer Davey Morrison, care of his ship the Accra. It's clear Frankie is a frequent letter-writer, with a stamp collection supplied from his correspondent -- which, it turns out is his mother. Frankie's father is clearly not on the scene, and from Nell's reaction to a personal ad seeking Lizzie, it's clear the family is anxious to avoid being found.At a new school (again) Frankie suffers some predictable petty bullying, and some counter-balancing friendship from another classmate, Catriona (Jayd Johnson). Frankie agrees to a bet with the chief pest, Ricky Munroe (Sean Brown), who asserts that Frankie's Da won't show up when the ship arrives.Desperate as the day of the ship's arrival nears, Lizzie embarks on a pick-up outing to the local pub, but quickly leaves, disgusted and distraught. When Lizzie admits her predicament -- to find a total stranger to act as Frankie's Da for one day -- to her friend (and boss) Marie, Marie provides her a name and number. Lizzie meets the man, and when he agrees to the charade she hands him all the letters from Frankie to his Da.Early the day the ship is due, Frankie bolts out of the flat and goes missing for hours. His surrogate Da is at the flat when Frankie returns. He gives Frankie a book that is somewhat skeptically received, until he tells Frankie that chose it based on what he read in Frankie's letters. Frankie's face lights up, and he runs to embrace the man.At the football tryouts, Frankie delightedly claims the spoils of his bet from Ricky Munroe. The stranger and Frankie spend the rest of the day slowly getting acquainted, by the harbor. Frankie and the man ask Lizzie for one more day, which she initially rejects but is talked into.The three spend a great afternoon together, and walking home Lizzie explains the background - that Frankie's Da had hit Frankie as a baby, which caused his deafness. The man and Lizzie show a sense of connection, illustrated by one sweet kiss good-bye.Having finally responded to one of the ads searching for her, Lizzie meets her sister-in-law, and eventually visits her husband Davey in hospital, where he is dying. He wants to see Frankie, but when Lizzie refuses we see the anger and abuse that caused her to leave. She flees the hospital, though returns the next day with a photo and a painting from Frankie.Davey dies, and Lizzie tells Frankie. She goes to stop payment on the PO box where she'd directed all Frankie's letters, and finds one last letter from Frankie... to the stranger, with an acknowledgement that his \"real Da\" has died.

Sebastian is an obsessive idealist who has sworn to his inner self that he will direct a film about one of the worlds most iconic figures, Christopher Columbus (Karra Elejalde). Not for him the hypocritical lies of a genius sailor on a divine mission to win souls for Christ. He is determined to upturn the entire conservative myth of Western Civilization's arrival in the Americas as a force for good. Rather, his story is about what Columbus set in motion; the obsession with gold, the hunt for slaves by Spanish mastiffs, and punitive violence to those Indians who fought back. His story is counterbalanced by the radical priests Bartolome de las Casas (Raul Arevalo) and Antonio Montestinos (Carlos Santos) who were the first to raise their voice in defence of the Indians, and ask the question, Are these men? Sebastian is also obsessed by the first Indian leader to resist - Hatuey (Carlos Aduviri), who was nailed to a cross and crucified as example to those who oppose the Christians. The talented and brilliant actor playing Columbus constantly challenges Sebastian and accuses him of agit prop and cheap manipulation. Costa doesn't give a shit. He cares little about what happened yesterday, never mind 500 years ago. The only thing that matters to him is his professional pride as a producer - that the film is made on time and within budget. Costa has come up with an insane idea, but the only way to get a difficult film made within the limitations of their modest budget. Despite Sebastian's fury, they will shoot in Bolivia, the cheapest and most Indian of Latin American countries.As the shoot progresses in and around the city of Cochabamba, so too does civil and political unrest simmer below the surface as the entire water supply of the city is privatized and sold to a British and American multinational. As Sebastian and Costa struggle with their film the violence in the community in which they shoot increases by the day, until the entire city explodes into the now infamous Bolivian Water War.

As a crew member of the salvage ship USS Hoist, where he is assigned to the galley, he is inspired by the bravery of one of the divers, Master Chief Petty Officer Leslie William \"Billy\" Sunday (De Niro). He is determined to overcome racism and become the first black American Navy diver, even proclaiming that he will become a master diver. He eventually is selected to attend Diving and Salvage School in Bayonne, New Jersey, where he arrives as a boatswain's mate second class. He finds that Master Chief Sunday is the leading chief petty officer and head instructor, who is under orders from the school's eccentric, bigoted commanding officer to ensure that Brashear fails.Brashear struggles to overcome his educational shortcomings, a result of his leaving school in the 7th grade in order to work on his family's failing farm. He receives educational assistance from his future wife, a medical student who works part-time in the Harlem (New York City) Public Library. Brashear proves himself as a diver by rescuing a fellow student whose dive buddy abandons him during a salvage evaluation. Unfortunately, due to the racism of the commanding officer (Hal Holbrook), the student who fled in the face of danger is awarded a medal for Brashear's heroic actions. Likewise, during an underwater assembling task where each student has to assemble a flange underwater using a bag of tools, Brashear's bag is cut open. Brashear nevertheless finishes the assembly and graduates from diving school, earning the quiet and suppressed admiration of Master Chief Sunday and his fellow divers. Master Chief Sunday is later demoted to senior chief by the commanding officer for standing up for Brashear and allowing him to pass.The paths and careers of Brashear and Sunday sharply diverge. Brashear rises quickly through the ranks, even becoming a national hero in the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash (Spain) for recovering a missing atomic bomb and for saving the life of Navy crew. Sunday continually loses his composure around officers who disrespect his accomplishments, until he is finally demoted to chief petty officer and relegated to menial duties. He becomes a brooding alcoholic displeased with his rank, relatively low for someone with so many years of service.The two eventually meet again after Brashear's left leg was so mangled by the atomic bomb incident that he feels that his only chance to return to active duty and a relatively normal life is for it to be amputated and replaced with a prosthesis. Until this time, no Navy man had ever returned to full active duty with a prosthetic limb. Sunday again trains Brashear and aids him in his fight against the US Navy bureaucracy and an antagonistic Navy captain (a former lieutenant and their former Hoist executive officer) in order to return to full active duty and fulfill his dream of becoming a master diver. They succeed in getting Brashear reinstated.In the epilogue, it is noted that two years later Brashear becomes a master diver. It is added that he does not retire from the Navy for another nine years.", "output": "Question: What state did Carl leave when he joined the United States Navy?, Answer: Kentucky, Question: What is Bashear's dream?, Answer: Become a Master Diver, Question: Due to racism, who was awarded the medal?, Answer: The buddy who was diving with him, whom fled., Question: Who continually loses his composure around officers?, Answer: Sunday, Question: Who became a master diver?, Answer: Brashear, Question: Who rises quickly through the ranks?, Answer: Brashear, Question: What body part was injured in Bashears atomic bomb inciden?, Answer: Left leg, Question: Where is Carl's Diving and Salvage School located?, Answer: Bayonne, New Jersey, Question: What branch of the military is Brashear a member of?, Answer: Navy, Question: What happened to Cheif Master Sunday?, Answer: He was demoted for letting Brashear pass., Question: What grade did Brashear leave school?, Answer: In the 7th grade., Question: In what year did Carl leave his life as a sharecropper?, Answer: 1948", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, though one is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that they aren't. As they grow older, the children are shown to all have pale skin, white hair, fierce intellect, and cobalt eyes. However, they also do not appear to possess a conscience or personalities. The children display eerie psychic abilities that can result in violent and deadly consequences whenever they experience pain or provocation.The children soon \"pair off,\" except for one of the boys, David, whose intended partner was the stillborn baby. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. Their leader is Mara, the daughter of a local physician, Dr. Alan Chaffee; her mother, Barbara, commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff, considers her father less important. Because of his childhood loss, David understands what the other children do not: emotion. He and his mother Jill McGowan (the local school teacher) share a brief conversation about this, displaying empathy and remorse. The children eventually move to the local barn as their classroom and for survival.Soon it is revealed that there are other colonies of blackout children in foreign countries, but they were quickly eliminated due to their inhuman nature. The scientific team in Midwich quickly flees the town to escape the chaos. Government scientist, Dr. Susan Verner, dissects herself after being forced to show the children the preserved stillborn baby she secretly kept to perform an autopsy, which is unveiled as an alien. An angry mob gathers to kill the children, but the leader is set on fire and burns to death while the state police sent there are instead hypnotized into shooting each other in a chaotic gun battle.In order to rid the town of the children, Alan devises a plan: to detonate a briefcase of explosives inside the children's classroom. By thinking of a brick wall, he is able to create a mental barrier and keep the presence of the bomb a secret from the children. Jill begs him to spare David because he is not like the others, and Alan agrees. He attempts to do this by asking David to leave the classroom to get his notebook from his car. The children begin to suspect that Alan is hiding something, and they slowly \"destroy\" the wall. Finally, Jill shows up, but the children stop her and attempt to use mind control. David, tired of this, rushes to her defense and knocks Mara over. The children turn on David, but Jill rushes him from the building. As soon as the children discover Alan thinking of the bomb, it detonates, killing everyone inside, along with Alan.Jill and David survive the massacre; she says that they will both move to a place where nobody knows them.

Lateef is 17. He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \"Turks\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide.As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds.From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers.Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard where Afghan families are gathered for a local milk ceremony. He inquires about Soltan, but gets no clues. Among the Afghans in the courtyard stands Rahmat in female clothing. She sees Lateef, stares at him for a while, then leaves the ceremony. Lateef is not aware of her presence. The next day on the road, he finds Soltan, and learns that Rahmat works in the village near the river. Lateef rushes there to find Rahmat in a pitiful state, working with other women carrying heavy stones from the river. He is distressed, and wants to find a way to help her out of that ordeal.He gets all his accumulated wages from Memar, and hands them to Soltan, asking him to pass them on to Najaf. They agree to meet the next day at the shrine after Soltan has given the money to Najaf. The next day at the shrine, instead of Soltan, Najaf shows up to inform Lateef that Soltan has gone to Afghanistan. He tells Lateef that Soltan came to him and offered him some money he'd borrowed from someone. He also tells Lateef he has refused the money, and has advised Soltan to keep it for himself, and use it to leave immediately for Afghanistan where he had a life and death issue in his family. Lateef is now shocked and worried.Lateef becomes even more worried the next day when he overhears a conversation in Najaf's house that Najaf is now faced with family problems in Afghanistan, as his brother has been killed in the war. He also hears Rahmat's real name is BARAN. Lateef goes back to the river to find Baran, who is exhausted, carrying logs out of the river in an atmosphere reminiscent of a war field. Powerless before the hardship she is going through, Lateef returns to the construction site in a state of depression. The next morning, Najaf on his crutches is at the construction site to meet Memar. Lateef overhears Najaf begging Memar without success to lend him some money.Lateef makes a desperate attempt to get money. He sells the only valuable thing he has, his identity card. When he brings the money to Najaf, Lateef learns that thanks to this money, Najaf and his family will return to Afghanistan. Lateef is overwhelmed by this news, and finds refuge in the shrine. There, in a state of anguish and despair, he hears from all around him the same sounds he heard when he first saw Baran. He surrenders to his fate.The next day in a dreamlike atmosphere, while helping Najaf to load a truck with household effects, Lateef, with a serene look, is finally face-to-face with Baran. Through eye contact and physical proximity, they exchange their feelings of love. As Baran covers herself and walks to the truck, her shoe gets stuck in the mud. Lateef gets on his knees, takes her shoe out of the mud, and hands it to Baran so she can wear it and leave. The truck takes Baran away. Left alone in the empty place, Lateef stares at the footstep in the mud left by Baran's shoe, and smiles while the rain covers it.", "output": "Question: Rahmat does not express herself at all how?, Answer: Verbally, Question: How Does Baran get her shoe back?, Answer: Lateef hands it to her., Question: Who must pay a fine?, Answer: Memar, Question: Who's house is lafeet at?, Answer: He is in Najeef house, Question: What happens to Memar?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who is beaten and taken to the police station?, Answer: Lateef, Question: Who decides to locate Soltan to get some news of Rahmat?, Answer: Lateef, Question: Is NAJAF a Turkish worker or an Afghan worker?, Answer: Afghan worker, Question: What is Baran carrying out of the river?, Answer: Baron is carrying out logs from the river, Question: Is RAHMAT an old man?, Answer: no, Question: Who replaces Najaf?, Answer: His son, Rahmat., Question: How do Baran and Lateef exchange their feelings of love?, Answer: Eye conduct and physical proximity, Question: How hold is Lateef?, Answer: 17, Question: Who manages the construction site where Lateef works?, Answer: MEMAR, Question: What happens because NAJAF fell from a building?, Answer: he breaks his leg, Question: Who works in the village near the river?, Answer: Rahmat, Question: Memar has to lay off of all illegal what?, Answer: Afghan workers, Question: Who does Lateef bring the money to?, Answer: Najaf, Question: Is one of the locations Afghanistan?, Answer: Yes., Question: What is Najaf loading on the truck?, Answer: Household effects., Question: How did Najeef's brother die?, Answer: Najeef's brother died in the war in Afghanistan, Question: Is Lateef shocked and worried at the end?, Answer: Yes., Question: What does Lateef discover by spying on Rahmat?, Answer: That Rahmat is a girl., Question: How does Najaf break his leg?, Answer: Falls from a building., Question: Where do the men try to meet up at the next day?, Answer: A shrine., Question: What Happens to Baran's footprint?, Answer: The rain covers it., Question: What relative of Najaf's was killed in war?, Answer: Brother, Question: What does Rahmat do when she comes face to face with them?, Answer: panics and runs away, Question: What takes Baran away?, Answer: The truck., Question: Who frees Baran's shoe from the mud?, Answer: Lateef, Question: What is Rahmat's real name?, Answer: BARAN, Question: Who performs a surprise inspection?, Answer: Labor inspectors, Question: What is rahmats real name?, Answer: Baran, Question: What's handed to Soltan?, Answer: Accumulated wages., Question: What does Baran's shoe get stuck in?, Answer: Mud, Question: Who lives in the village where Lateef goes?, Answer: Afghans, Question: What does Lateef sell?, Answer: his identity card, Question: What does NAJAF fall from?, Answer: a building, Question: Who does Lateef struggle with?, Answer: The inspectors, Question: After NAJAF falls from the building and breaks his leg, is left there or taken to the hospital?, Answer: taken to the hospital, Question: Who helps Najaf load the truck?, Answer: Lateef, Question: What do the women carry from the river?, Answer: heavy stones, Question: Is SOLTAN a Turkish worker or an Afghan worker?, Answer: Afghan worker, Question: Is it true or false that there is no issue with Soltan's family in Afghanistan?, Answer: False., Question: Who is begging for money?, Answer: Najaf is begging for money, Question: What country does Soltan move to?, Answer: Afghanistan., Question: Who is on crutches?, Answer: Najeef is on crutches, Question: What Happens to Baran's shoe?, Answer: It gets Stuck in the mud, Question: Does Lateef refuse money?, Answer: Yes., Question: Did Najaf tell Soltan to keep the money and go to Afghanistan?, Answer: Yes., Question: What does Najaf beg Memar to lend him?, Answer: Money, Question: Who does Lateef meet in the Afghan village?, Answer: cobbler, Question: Whose absence does Lateef can't bear?, Answer: Rahmat's, Question: Did Najaf take the money?, Answer: No., Question: Who stands in famale clothing among the Afghans in the courtyard?, Answer: Rahmat, Question: Why do the villagers gather at the shrine?, Answer: milk ceremony, Question: In which courtyard, near a graveyard does the Afghan families are gathered for a local milk ceremony?, Answer: A shrine, Question: Who runs away?, Answer: Rahmat", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Set at the turn of the 20th century, the stately, sinister mansion is constructed by powerful Seattle oil magnate John Rimbauer (Steven Brand) as a wedding present for his timid, submissive young bride, Ellen (Lisa Brenner). Rimbauer uses much of his wealth to build the mansion in the Tudor neo-Gothic style and situate it on 40 acres (160,000\u00c2\u00a0m2) of woodland. The site has been a Native American burial ground. The house appeared cursed even as it was being constructed: three construction workers are killed on the site, and a construction foreman is murdered by a co-worker.Shortly after her marriage to Rimbauer, Ellen begins keeping a diary in which she confesses her anxieties about her new marriage, expresses her confusion over her emerging sexuality, and contemplates the nightmare that her life is becoming. Ellen soon has two children which helps soothe her painful relationship with her husband. First, a boy named Adam, and then a girl (born with a deformed withered arm) named April. At first impressed by her husband's extravagance, Ellen eventually hates and fears John, especially when learning unsavory facts about his past. Meanwhile, the number of individual hauntings in the mansion increases, possibly including ghosts of the many people close to John who have mysteriously vanished. Ellen interprets the eerie manifestations as a warning that she, too, may some day disappear without a trace.Years after her young daughter April also vanishes inside the estate, Ellen and her maid and confidant Sukeena still continue to live in the house. After John's death, Ellen believes that if she continues to build the house, she will never die. She uses nearly all of her inherited fortune to continually add to the home over the next several decades, enlarging it significantly. Rose Red begins growing by itself, adding new hallways, new corridors, new rooms and new staircases seemingly overnight. But mysterious disappearances continue: Deanna Petrie, a famous actress friend of Ellen's, and Sukeena both disappear over the next few years.

After killing his secretary Fred Stickley, Nygma resigns and seeks retaliation against Bruce for rejecting his invention and begins to send him riddles. A news report reveals how Harvey Dent became Two-Face: when he was prosecuting a mob boss named Sal Maroni, Maroni threw acid on Dent's face, disfiguring half of it. Batman tried to save him, but failed. After the incident, Dent seeks to kill Batman for failing to save him. Bruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is obsessed with Batman, and invites her to come with him to a circus event. After a performance from the circus performers, The Flying Graysons, Two-Face arrives and threatens to blow up the circus unless Batman comes forward and surrenders his life to him. The Flying Graysons attempt to stop Two-Face, but they get killed by as a result. However, Dick Grayson, the youngest member, survives as he climbs to the roof and throws Two-Face's bomb into a river.Bruce invites the orphaned Dick to stay at Wayne Manor. Dick, still troubled by the murder of his family, intends to kill Two-Face and avenge his family. When he discovers that Bruce is Batman, he asks Bruce to help him find Two-Face so that he can kill him, but Bruce refuses. Meanwhile, Nygma becomes a criminal called the Riddler and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two steal capital in order to mass produce Nygma's brainwave device. At Nygma's business party, Nygma discovers Bruce's alter ego using the brainwave device. Two-Face arrives and crashes the party. He nearly kills Batman, but Dick manages to save him. Meanwhile, Chase has fallen in love with Bruce, which surpasses her obsession with Batman, but she soon discovers that they are one and the same. Bruce decides to stop being Batman in order to have a normal life with Chase and to prevent Dick from finding and murdering Two-Face. Dick angrily runs away while Bruce and Chase have dinner together in the manor. The Riddler and Two-Face arrive and attack Wayne Manor. The Riddler destroys the Batcave and kidnaps Chase, while leaving an injured Bruce another riddle.Using the riddles, Bruce and his butler, Alfred, find out the Riddler's secret identity. Dick returns and becomes Batman's sidekick, Robin. Batman and Robin head to Riddler and Two-Face's lair, Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him. Realizing that he does not have it in him to murder, Robin spares him. Two-Face gets the upper hand and captures Robin. Batman arrives at the lair, where Robin and Chase are held as hostages. The Riddler gives Batman a chance to save only one hostage. But instead, Batman destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device, causing the Riddler to suffer a mental breakdown. Batman manages to save Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the flip of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death. The Riddler is taken to Arkham Asylum and imprisoned, but he claims he knows who Batman is. Chase is asked to consult on the case, but Nygma says that he himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase meets Bruce outside and tells him that his secret is safe before leaving.

When the farmhouse where she had been hiding is accidentally destroyed by an American bomber, Rachel manages to escape the area thanks to a local man, Rob, and visits a lawyer named Smaal, who provides her with some of her father's money so that she can flee, helped by a man named Van Gein. Rachel and Rob are reunited with her family and try to flee by boat through the Biesbosch with other Jews from the Nazi-occupied part of the Netherlands to the liberated southern part of the country. However, it turns out to be a trap. They are ambushed on the river by members of the German SS, who kill them and rob the bodies of their cash and other valuables. Rachel alone survives, but she does not manage to escape from occupied territory.Using a non-Jewish alias, Ellis de Vries, Rachel becomes involved with a Dutch resistance group in the Hague, under the leadership of Gerben Kuipers and working closely with a doctor in the Resistance, Hans Akkermans. Smaal is in touch with this Resistance cell. When Kuipers' son and other members of the Resistance are captured, Ellis agrees to help by seducing local SD commander Hauptsturmf\u00c3\u00bchrer Ludwig M\u00c3\u00bcntze, bleaching all of her hair blonde. M\u00c3\u00bcntze invites her to a party at the local SD headquarters, and there, Ellis recognises Obersturmf\u00c3\u00bchrer G\u00c3\u00bcnther Franken, M\u00c3\u00bcntze's brutal deputy, as the SS officer who oversaw the massacre of her refugee party. She obtains a job as a secretary at the SD headquarters while also falling in love with M\u00c3\u00bcntze, who, in contrast to Franken, is not abusive or sadistic. He realises that her hair is bleached and she is a Jew, but does not care. She also becomes friends with her Dutch colleague Ronnie, who collaborates with the Germans, working for them, being sexually available to them (particularly Franken), and accepting stolen gifts from them.Thanks to a hidden microphone which Ellis plants in Franken's office, the Resistance realises that it was Van Gein who betrayed Rachel, her family and the other Jews to the SS in return for a cut of the profits. Against Kuipers' orders, Akkermans and others decide to abduct Van Gein to expose the suspected traitor. The plot goes wrong when Akkermans' chloroform fails to work; Van Gein begins to succumb to it, but suddenly fights back and is killed. Franken responds by planning to kill forty hostages, including most of the plotters, but M\u00c3\u00bcntze, who realises the war is lost and has been negotiating with the Resistance, cancels the order.M\u00c3\u00bcntze confronts Ellis and demands that she tell him her story, which she does. On her evidence he confronts Franken with a superior officer, Obergruppenf\u00c3\u00bchrer K\u00c3\u00a4utner, who orders Franken to open his safe, in a search for the money, gold and jewels stolen from the Jews he had killed. (Murdering Jews was not against SS regulations, but personally stealing their wealth was a capital offense.) However, the safe reveals nothing, and Franken tells K\u00c3\u00a4utner that M\u00c3\u00bcntze has been negotiating with Dutch resistance \"terrorists\" for a truce. M\u00c3\u00bcntze is condemned to death and imprisoned, along with the members of the resistance cell Franken was already planning to shoot as a reprisal for the killing of Van Gein. Ellis agrees to participate in a rescue attempt for the resistance prisoners only on the condition that they free M\u00c3\u00bcntze too and, albeit reluctantly, the others agree. The plan has been betrayed by an unknown insider, and the would-be rescuers find the prisoners' cells to be filled with German troops. Only Akkermans and one other man survive the \"rescue\".Ellis is subsequently arrested by Franken and taken to his office, which she had bugged. Franken has known about her and the bug for some time. Knowing that the resistance is listening in, he stages a confrontation to make the resistance group believe Ellis is the Nazi collaborator, responsible for the failure of the rescue operation. Hearing this, Kuipers and his companions swear to hunt her down and make her pay for her treason. Ronnie, having learned of Ellis's role with the Resistance, helps Ellis and M\u00c3\u00bcntze escape.When the country is liberated by the Allies, Franken attempts to escape by boat, but is killed by Akkermans who takes the loot Franken was trying to escape with. Suspecting Smaal is the traitor, M\u00c3\u00bcntze and Ellis return to confront him. Smaal denies the accusations. He shows them the titular black book in which he had detailed all his dealings with the Jews he had ostensibly helped. However, both Smaal and his wife are murdered before they can leave the building. Not getting a good look at the killer, M\u00c3\u00bcntze chases him into the street, only to be recognized by the triumphant Dutch and arrested by the Canadians. The Dutch also recognize Ellis and arrest her as a \"collaborator\", but not before she grabs the black book.M\u00c3\u00bcntze is brought before the ranking Canadian forces and finds that they have enlisted the assistance of K\u00c3\u00a4utner in keeping order among the defeated German forces. K\u00c3\u00a4utner convinces a Canadian colonel that under military law the defeated German military retains the right to punish its own soldiers. He produces the death warrant he previously issued against M\u00c3\u00bcntze for his negotiations with Ellis's resistance cell. Although initially opposing the idea of murdering a witness, the Canadian colonel finally agrees, and M\u00c3\u00bcntze is immediately executed by a firing squad of German troops.Ellis is imprisoned with other accused collaborators, and humiliated and tortured by the violently anti-Nazi volunteer jailers, but is rescued by Akkermans, now a colonel in the Dutch Army. Akkermans brings her to his medical office, and tells her that he killed Franken when the Nazi tried to escape. He shows her the cash and jewels stolen from Franken's Jewish victims. When informed about M\u00c3\u00bcntze's fate, Ellis goes into shock, and Akkermans administers a tranquilizer which is in fact an overdose of insulin. Ellis, feeling dizzy, sees the bottle of insulin and survives by quickly eating a bar of chocolate. She realizes then that Akkermans was a traitor who had collaborated with Franken and had killed the Smaals. While Akkermans is distracted, waving to a crowd that cheers him, she jumps from his balcony into the crowd below and runs away. He tries to follow her, but is blocked by the very same people cheering him as a hero of the Resistance.Ellis proves her innocence to Canadian military intelligence and to the former Resistance leader Gerben Kuipers by means of Smaal's black book, which lists how many Jews (including Ellis's brother) had been taken to Akkermans for medical help just prior to their murders. Together, Ellis and Kuipers intercept the fleeing Akkermans, who is hiding in a coffin in a hearse with the stolen money, gold and jewels. They quickly kill the driver, and while Kuipers drives the hearse, Ellis screws down the coffin's secret air vents. They drive to Hollands Diep where the SS trap had been sprung, and wait until Akkermans suffocates. Ellis and Kuipers are left wondering what to do with the stolen money and jewels.The scene changes to Israel in 1956, and shows Rachel meeting her husband and their two children, and walking back into Kibbutz Stein, which a sign at the gate announces was funded with the recovered money stolen from Jews killed during the war.

Shortly after his arrival, the Colonel dies of apparent heart failure and leaves his wealth to his two daughters, with Claire receiving all the money and Katherine his estate \"Dark Oaks.\" Katherine, a woman with a taste for the morbid, has been secretly dating Alucard and eventually marries him, shunning her long-time boyfriend Frank Stanley. Frank confronts the couple and tries to shoot Alucard, but the bullets pass through the Count's body and hit Katherine, seemingly killing her.A shocked Frank runs off to Dr. Brewster, who visits Dark Oaks and is welcomed by Alucard and a living Katherine. The couple instruct him that henceforth they will be devoting their days to scientific research and only welcome visitors at night. Frank goes on to the police and confesses to the murder of Katherine. Brewster tries to convince the Sheriff that he saw Katherine alive and that she would be away all day, but the Sheriff insists on searching Dark Oaks. He finds Katherine's dead body and has her transferred to the morgue. Dr. Brewster is shown reading the novel \"Dracula\".Meanwhile, Hungarian Professor Lazlo arrives at Brewster's house.

After he awakens, she tells him she still loves him. She explains that she only married Alucard (who is really Dracula himself) to obtain immortality and wants to share that immortality with Frank. He is initially repulsed by her idea, but then yields to her. After she explains that she has already drunk some of his blood, she advises him on how to destroy Alucard. He breaks out of prison, seeks out Alucard's hiding place and burns his coffin. Without his daytime sanctuary, Alucard is destroyed. Brewster, Lazlo, and the Sheriff arrive at the scene to find Alucard's remains.Meanwhile, Frank stumbles into the playroom where Katherine said she would be.

One night, Denis and Valerie's home is broken into by a borderline psychotic thief named Ricky Barnes (Andy Serkis) who shoots and kills Valerie, coldly saying to Denis: 'I'm going to let you live'. Valerie dies while being transported to the hospital, and the baby narrowly survives childbirth, leaving Denis devastated. Barnes is sentenced to twenty years in Sullom Voe Prison, which is on a remote island in the middle of the North Sea. Denis is not satisfied with the sentence, considering Barnes shows no remorse and openly mocks Denis in court.Three months later, Denis has fallen into a pit of depression, refusing to be a father to his daughter; Amy, who is being raised by his brother and sister-in-law, one day he is out flying his plane, and switches off his engines letting it glide through the air, seemingly committing suicide, leaving his home and his daughter to his brother and sister-in-law.Some time later Denis, alive and well, having faked his death, demolishes a police car with a sledgehammer. He is remanded for seven days (taking advantage of the fact that he is not legally alive) and is instructed by his appointed solicitor not to cause trouble, to avoid going aboard 'The Magic Roundabout'; in which if he continues to cause trouble he will be sent to a higher security prison, Denis intends to cause trouble, hoping it will send him to Sullom Voe.As the months progress Denis, now under the pseudonym John Watt, has been sentenced to two years in a category B prison for many attempted escapes, and is planning another escape, despite his cellmate Ron (Gary Lewis) advising against it. One night at Christmas, Denis has an emotional conversation over a bottle of whiskey with Mick, a guard and friend of Ron's, in which he finally gives into feeling the loss of his family. One day another inmate and friend of Denis, Vin (Vas Blackwood), a junkie whom he met whilst being transported to his first prison, irritates an inmate known as Spaz, who was an accomplice of Barnes in the robbery of Denis's home. Denis, driven by revenge, attempts to kill Spaz, but is stabbed in the stomach, Denis makes his way back to his cell leaving Vin to attack Spaz. Denis returns to fight Spaz, only to find Vin has been murdered, and Spaz warns Denis and Ron that they are next.Ron blackmails Mick, who has smuggled stuff in and out of the prison for him over the years, for the keys to the gates of the prison to assist them in their escape. Mick begrudgingly cooperates, not without mockingly revealing the reason Vin was in prison with him (Denis believed he was arrested for shoplifting, but for actually brutally murdering his mother). Denis and Ron escape and head for the countryside, taking shelter in a caravan belonging to a friend of Ron's. Denis returns to his home to confront his sister-in-law Christine (Jodhi May) is now living in his home raising his daughter on her own, Ron seeing this (believing Denis to be John Watt) asks for answers.Denis reveals his intentions of killing Ricky Barnes to Ron, who tries to convince Denis to stay away, and turns himself in. He is sent to Sullom Voe, where he finds Barnes and threatens him. One day, Denis attempts to finally to get his revenge on Barnes, Ricky causes an explosion in the prison and threatens Denis to help him escape, blackmailing him with the lives of his daughter and Christine who are being held at gunpoint by Barnes's son Joey (Phillip Barantini), who was also involved in the robbery that killed Denis's wife. Barnes, remembering Denis told him he was a pilot, forces him to fly a Medical plane off the island and back England.Back at Denis's home, Ron attempts to speak to Christine but finds Joey holding them hostage. He forces his way into the house, but is killed after a tussle with Joey, allowing Christine a chance to escape with the baby. Barnes, who was on the phone with Joey the whole time on the plane, believes he doesn't need Denis anymore and attempts to shoot him, but Denis disarms him. Denis then turns off the engines and lets the plane glide through the air (taking advantage of his knowledge of planes) and plans to parachute leaving Ricky to die when it crashes, despite Ricky's plea's to let him live and attempting to bribe him with whatever he wants, even admitting that Denis has got him scared, but Denis, who says that Denis died along with his wife that night, leaves with his final words to him being; 'you can't give me what I want'. Ricky desperately tries to start the plane up again, but his efforts are futile and he crashes shortly after Denis parachutes into the ocean. After Denis lands in the ocean, he contemplates what to do next, admitting he had no idea what to expect, or what to do after Killing Ricky Barnes. In the Final line of the film, Denis quotes the saying: 'An eye for an eye, leaves everyone blind'.The film ends with Denis sitting outside his home looking over the newspaper clipping off Barnes's incarceration.", "output": "Question: Who is Perry's new cellmate?, Answer: James Lacey, Question: Why is Perry's daughter near death?, Answer: Drug overdose, Question: Who did Perry offer himself to be killed by ?, Answer: Rizza, Question: What are the two narratives the film runs?, Answer: preparations and escape", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, group of people, or couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanism, the film theory of Andr\u00e9 Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name.Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream.The protagonist's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to accept God's invitation.The protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. The protagonist uncertainly reaches toward the car's handle but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees.

We soon learn how the Germans attacked the unarmed prisoners, killing most of them. Several of the soldiers escape and hide out in a bombed-out house. There's \"Deacon\" (Allred) the ex-missionary who is haunted by something from his past that prevents him from sleeping for days at a time. He's also a crack rifleman. Joining him in escaping are Gould (Polinsky), the medic and a boy from Brooklyn, who seems suspicious of everyone, \"Shirl\" (Bagby) a tough soldier from Louisiana with a lust for killing Germans, and Sgt Gunderson (Holden) from Chicago, who takes command of the group.With the rescue of a British pilot, Winley (Heyborne), the group is complete. The obvious distrust/dislike between Winley and Shirl causes friction, but when the group finds out that Winley holds vital intelligence that will greatly aid the Allies in the ongoing \"Battle of the Bulge\", they agree to get him across 20 miles behind enemy lines to army intelligence.Several close encounters with Germans ensue. Deacon's psychosis continues to escalate as his visions intensify. We find out that in a recent skirmish, Deacon accidentally killed 2 woman and 6 children while trying to take out a sniper. We get to learn more about the lives of the soldiers and in one telling scene, the deep religious feelings of Deacon and contrasted with the agnostic Gould as each of them tells the story of holding a dying soldier.The men stumble upon a remote house occupied by a French woman and her child. They are warmly welcomed by the woman who provides them shelter and food. A massive winter storm slows the group as they hole up at the woman's place. Winley tries to to take off alone and a German patrol soon shows up at the house. The soldiers attack the Germans while the sharp-shooting Deacon misses an escaping German at point blank range twice. The German is caught by Winley and returned to the group. As they argue about whether they should execute the prisoner, Deacon recognizes him as a German he once encountered in his missionary work. He attributes his missing the escaping German to a divine intervention.During the night, Deacon allows the German to escape in exchange for some information about troop movements. The soldiers leave the next morning but Gunderson is shot and killed by a German patrol. A full scale fight ensues and Winley is wounded. Shirl is shot carrying Winley to safety and the two finally make peace just before Shirl dies.The three survivors are approached by a German soldier as they try to revive Winley. It turns out to be the same German that Deacon had let escape the night before. He allows them to escape and they grab an abandoned jeep and head toward the Allied lines. Disguised as German medics with a wounded soldier, they work through their way through the German lines. The Americans, thinking they are German begin shooting at them and the Germans are firing at them from behind as well. Deacon tries to hold off the Germans while Winley escapes with Gould, but is shot and killed in the fire fight. His dying vision is of the family he accidentally killed.Winley and Gould make it to Allied command and the critical information helps stop the German's offensive leading to an Allied victory in the Battle of the Bulge.

He flees Los Angeles to start a new life, traveling across the U.S. in a red Mitsubishi GTO. At each stop along the way he enters drag races, winning large amounts of money, and staying one step ahead of the FBI, who issue a country-wide manhunt against him. The police eventually locate Brian and repossess his car, forcing him to flee on foot. A young woman (Minka Kelly) picks him up hitchhiking, and drops him off at a local car lot, where he buys a 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 with his various winnings. After winning several more races, Brian decides to settle in Miami.While in Miami, he meets Tej Parker (Ludacris), an ex-street racer who runs a top racing garage. Tej's crew includes Jimmy (Jin Auyeung), a well-known car tuner, and Suki (Devon Aoki), another street racer, and lives in a small cot near Tej's garage. After taking his Skyline to the streets of Miami and winning in races organized by Tej, he establishes himself as one of Miami's top drivers, earning the nickname Bullitt (a reference to the well-known 1968 Steve McQueen movie).Plot[edit]After settling in Miami, Brian makes a living by racing for money. Tej organizes a local street race, involving Suki, Orange Julius (Amaury Nolasco) and Slap Jack (Michael Ealy), and calls Brian, who agrees to be the fourth driver for the race. Brian wins, giving a few thousand of his winnings to Tej to show his gratitude. The police arrive on the scene, forcing all the racers to flee.Watched by undercover United States Customs Service Agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes), Brian is caught by U.S. Customs agents after his car is disabled by a grappling hook-like electronic disruption device. Brian is given a deal by his former boss, F.B.I. agent Bilkins, and Custom Agent Markham (James Remar) to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) in exchange for the erasure of his criminal record. Brian agrees but only if he is given permission to choose his partner, refusing to partner with the agent assigned to watch him. Brian heads home to Barstow, California, where he recruits Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), a childhood friend of Brian who had served jail time and is under house arrest, to help him. Pearce agrees, but only for the same deal Brian was offered, and with the help of Monica, Brian and Roman work together to take down Verone. After acquiring confiscated vehicles and being hired by Verone as his drivers, the duo return to a Customs/FBI hideout, where Roman confronts Markham over the latter's interference with the mission. After the situation is cooled down, Brian tells Bilkins and Markham that Verone plans to smuggle the money into his private jet and fly off, but also suspects something wrong with Monica's role in the mission.Later, Brian and Roman race two of Verone's drivers for their cars and begin to devise a personal backup plan if the operation goes awry. The team challenges a pair of muscle car drivers they raced earlier for pink slips. Despite engine and power output handicaps, Brian and Roman manage to win the race and the other two cars. Meanwhile, Roman confronts Brian about his attraction to Monica and the constant threat of Verone's men. However, the two men patch up their differences.After witnessing Verone torture Detective Whitworth (Mark Boone, Jr.) of the Miami Police Department into giving them a window of opportunity to make their getaway, Brian and Roman are warned by Monica that they will be killed once the drop is made. Despite this information, Markham refuses to call off the job, claiming this is their one chance to catch Verone; he threatens Brian and Roman with jail if they refuse to follow through with the plan.On the day of the mission, Brian and Roman begin transporting duffel bags of Verone's money, with two of Verone's men Enrique (Mo Gallini) and Roberto (Roberto Sanchez) riding along to watch Brian and Roman. Before the 15-minute window is set, the detective in charge, Whitworth decides to call in the police to move in for the arrest, resulting in a high-speed chase across the city. The duo lead the police to a warehouse, where a \"scramble\" by dozens of street racers disorient the police. Following the scramble, police manage to pull over the Evo and the Eclipse, only to find out that they were driven by Tej and Suki.As Brian approaches the destination point in a Yenko Camaro, Enrique tells him to make a detour away from the airfield to the Tarpon Point Marina exit. Meanwhile, Roman gets rid of Roberto by using an improvised ejector seat in his (orange) Dodge Challenger powered by nitrous oxide. At the airfield, Customs Agents have Verone's plane and convoy surrounded, only to discover they have been duped into a decoy maneuver while Verone is at a boatyard several miles away. As he knew Monica was an undercover agent, he gave her the wrong information on the destination point and plans to use her as leverage. When Brian arrives at the intended drop-off point, Enrique prepares to kill him when Roman suddenly appears and the both of them dispatch Enrique. Verone makes his escape aboard his private yacht, but Brian and Roman use the Yenko Camaro and drive off a ramp, crashing on top of the yacht. The duo manage to apprehend Verone and save Monica.With their crimes pardoned, Brian and Roman ponder on what to do next other than to settle in Miami when the former mentions starting a garage. Roman asks how they would afford that and Brian reveals that he took some of the money, as Roman also reveals that his pockets aren't empty, having taken money for himself.", "output": "Question: Who does Brian race?, Answer: two of Verone's drivers, Question: What is Brian's result in the race?, Answer: He wins, Question: who is Tej (Ludacris) looking for?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What happens to Brian after the race?, Answer: Roman confronts Brian, Question: Who does Tej call to a race?, Answer: Brian, Question: Who is Brian O'Conner?, Answer: A former LAPD officer", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

College professor Ira Kane (David Duchovny) and his colleague, geology professor Harry Block (Orlando Jones), investigate, taking a sample of strange blue liquid that oozes from it. Ira discovers that it harbors extraterrestrial single-celled nitrogen-based organisms multiplying exponentially, condensing millions of years of evolution within a matter of hours. The next day, they take the science class to survey the meteor site and find it already surrounded by evolved oxygen-converting fungi and alien flatworms. Ira and Harry discover that the cells and organisms reproduce rapidly through mitosis after seeing one of the flatworms they collected in a jar split into another.Soon, the site is sealed off by the Army, who set up a base. Ira and Harry take General Russell Woodman (Ted Levine) and the clumsy Dr. Allison Reed (Julianne Moore) to court for the right to be part of the research of their discovery, but their efforts fail when it's revealed Ira was discharged from the army after creating an anthrax vaccine that led to terribly debilitating side effects, which the soldiers dubbed \"The Kane Madness\". Woodman steals Ira and Harry's research, forcing them to infiltrate the base to get another sample; they find an alien rainforest teeming with life. They are caught by Allison as a mosquito-like alien gets inside Harry's body; they are forced to rectally remove the mosquito, which then dies.Wayne arrives at the college and shows the two the dead body of an amphibian alien which killed a country club owner, much to his delight; they later investigate an animal attack, finding a dead dog-like alien in a woman's home and more dead flatworms. They find a valley behind the home filled with dead flying dinosaur-like aliens; Ira and Harry theorize the aliens are spreading through the caves connected to the main cavern, but can't breathe oxygen. One of the dying creatures spits out a pod containing a newborn, which then hatches into an oxygen-tolerant alien. The alien attacks a mall, where it nearly takes a shoplifter for a meal before Ira, Harry, and Wayne shoot it down.Unfortunately, other alien encounters have made the news; this forces the Governor of Arizona (Dan Aykroyd) to demand answers. Allison explains the aliens will engulf the United States in two months. Woodman attempts to blame Ira, when he, Harry and Wayne arrive. However, the governor demands a solution; Woodman suggests evacuating the area and burn the aliens with napalm. At that moment, primate-like aliens attack them, but are fought off. The shaken governor approves Woodman's plan against protests from Ira and Allison that they don't know how the aliens will react. Allison quits the CDC and leaves the site, procuring Ira's original research and samples for him.At the college, Harry accidentally tosses a match into a petri dish of alien liquid, causing a mass of flesh to rapidly grow from it. Ira realizes heat causes the aliens to evolve, and the meteor crashing to earth activated the alien DNA. Alison attempts to warn Woodman that napalm will only make the aliens stronger, but he ignores her call. Looking at the positions of nitrogen and carbon on the periodic table, Ira theorizes selenium might be poisonous to the aliens, since they are nitrogen-based, as arsenic is poisonous to Earth's carbon life. Much to Ira's surprise, his dumbest students Deke and Danny (Ethan Suplee and Michael Ray Bower) recall selenium sulfide is the active ingredient in Head &amp; Shoulders. This makes Ira award the Donald brothers with an A, much to their excitement. So Wayne procures a firetruck and the team fills it with the shampoo, with help from the Donald Brothers, who tag along with them.Just as the team arrives at the cave and prepare to fire the shampoo, Woodman's napalm strike causes the aliens to merge into an enormous amoeba-like creature, which reabsorbs the aliens in the cave. As it prepares to divide, the team drives under the organism, finds what looks like its rectal hole, and Harry (intending to settle a score for the insect incident) pumps a firehose of shampoo into the beast, causing it to explode. Governor Lewis declares Ira, Harry, Wayne and Allison heroes, making Wayne a fully credentialed firefighter while Ira and Allison skip the festivities for romance in the fire truck. Later, Harry, Ira and Wayne are shown chasing the flying alien from earlier and promoting Head &amp; Shoulders for both hair care and fighting aliens.", "output": "Question: How is a new baby alien produced?, Answer: A dying alien spits out a pod, which hatches into a new alien, Question: Who does Ira and Harry took to court?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Where does Harry accidentally do ?, Answer: He accidentally tosses a match into a petri dish of alien liquid., Question: Who is Wayne Grey?, Answer: He is a fireman trainee., Question: According to Ira and Harry's theories, what are the aliens unable to breathe?, Answer: Oxygen, Question: What grade do the Donald brothers gate ?, Answer: They get an A grade., Question: What has activated the alien DNA ?, Answer: The meteor crashing to earth has activated the alien DNA., Question: Whom did the amphibian alien kill?, Answer: A country club owner, Question: Who directed this movie?, Answer: Ivan Reitman", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

At a table across from her, her new god-sister, Nina Deer (Elisha Cuthbert) and Nina's best friend Michelle (Katy Mixon) are loudly discussing Michelle's desire to have sex with a classmate/friend, Connor (Shawn Ashmore), who walks by. Nina notices Dot watching them and angrily snaps at Dot, who turns away, as Michelle playfully chides Nina for having a loser \"freak\" move into the family. A guidance counselor, Mrs. Feltswatter, asks Dot if she could join her at the table, at which Dot just ups and leaves. She retreats to her favorite hiding spot, a stall in the girl's bathroom, until Nina finds her and angrily pulls her out for the ride home.Back at the expansive, but cold and incompletely decorated, Deer home. Nina's mom and Dot's godmother, Olivia (Edie Falco), is preparing dinner and implores Nina and Michelle to try and accept Dot, who is sitting over at the table in the dining area, into the family. Nina retorts it wasn't her decision to take her in and insults Dot, who is oblivious to the conversation. Olivia reminds Nina that Dot can read lips. We learn that Olivia is an interior designer and Nina's dad and Dot's godfather, Paul (Martin Donovan), is a successful architect.Paul is at a pharmacy picking up prescription painkillers for Olivia when he bumps into Mrs. Feltswatter, the guidance counselor. She expresses concern that Dot is unhappy at school, and Paul informs her that Dot is living with them now and that her father had just died and her mother died ten years ago.Paul arrives home with the painkillers and greets the girls. Nina is finishing up cooking dinner and informs him that Olivia is passed out (sleeping) in the living room. He makes an irritated face and goes to get her. When he leaves, Nina grabs some painkiller pills from the bag and tries to get Dot to take some. She ignores Nina, who calls her an expletive and proceeds to down the painkillers herself.Meanwhile, Paul collects Olivia from the unfinished living room floor and puts her to bed, where he gives her some painkillers. Paul gives her a look while she's downing them and she insists they're for her hip pain. There is obvious tension between the two as she angrily points out that he thinks she's always doped up and doesn't do anything for the family.Back at the dinner table with Dot & Nina, Paul mentions it might be a good idea for them to go to some sign-language courses. Nina blows off the suggestion and says she can't believe Dot is staying, to her Dad's dismay. She then goes out, telling her Dad he should use the time to bond with his \"new daughter\".Next day at school, Dot gets paired up with Connor during a piglet dissection in science class. She ignores him, while she slashes away at the dead pig.In the cafeteria, Michelle is complaining to Nina and another cheerleader friend, Fiona, about the pairing of Connor and Dot as lab partners. The conversation turns to Nina, where she's goaded for still being a 17-year old virgin when she can have any guy she wants. Michelle makes fun of Dot at the other table, as she converses in sign language with one of the lunch ladies who has a deaf daughter.Dot is walking the school halls when she notices a piano in the empty music room. She enters and begins playing some slow Beethoven, while doing a voiceover about how Beethoven discovered he was going deaf and managed to continue to be inspired. Meanwhile Connor is walking by with his friend Brian and some others and notices Dot playing through the door window and begins to find himself attracted to her. He quickly pulls away when his friends want to see what he's looking at.Dot heads to off to the bathroom to hide out but bumps into Nina who's applying makeup there. Dot reluctantly allows Nina to put some lipstick on her, as Nina says she feels bad that they stopped seeing each other after Dot's mom died and if Dot had had some female influence while growing up she \"wouldn't look like a janitor all the time\". She leaves and Dot looks in the mirror to see that Nina had purposely smeared the lipstick all around her mouth like a clown.In her bedroom, unable to sleep, Dot pulls out a box that contains her father's ashes. Through her voiceover we discover that her father was deaf and was recently hit by a truck he couldn't hear and killed. This happened while Dot was with him at a restaurant and he went out to run across the street to a bank. She places some of the ashes on her fingers and then tastes them and places some on her face. She moves to the bathroom to wash it off, as she mentions that she may have been able to save him if she was with him.On the way back to her room, she notices Nina's bedroom door has opened a little and she peeks in and sees Nina and her Dad in bed together, and we hear him sweet talking her. Dot heads back to her bedroom, obviously disturbed, but she keeps it to herself.At the dinner table with Nina, Dot, Paul & Olivia, Nina says she's spending the night at Michelle's. Paul says she can't go since it's a school night. She pleads with her Mom, who questions why she can't go which prompts Paul to snap at her for always contradicting him. Nina then rubs his leg under the table with hers and says she finished all her homework. Her Mom says it's up to Paul, who doesn't answer now, so she gets up and leaves to go out when Michelle calls her cell. Paul gets up and has an argument with Olivia in the kitchen about undermining his authority in raising Nina and storms off. Olivia talks to Dot about her mother, who she was friends with in school, and calls her a \"big, old, lucky slut\" who didn't marry the first guy she went out with, unlike her and Paul.In the living room, Olivia is flipping through a patterns book and Dot hands her a note asking to go to the movies. Olivia says sure, but Paul overhears, and says she's in no condition to drive and he would drive her. In the car, Dot is obviously now uncomfortable being alone with Paul.In the near-empty movie theater Dot takes a spot up in the back row alone. Nina, Michelle, Fiona, Connor and Brian happen to come into the same theater and sit toward the bottom. Connor notices Dot, and asks if they should invite her to sit with them, where it's met with vehement disagreement from the others. Fiona remarks how screwed up it must be to never have heard anything. Nina says Dot was able to hear until around the time her Mom died when she was seven, and how it was probably worse to have lost it than never to have heard in the first place. As the movie begins playing Nina, begins inconspicuously covering her ears to see what it's like to be deaf, but stops when she sees Dot staring down at her.Back at Michelle's, she and Nina are on Michelle's bed watching a scene of two people passionately kissing. Michelle asks Nina how you would know if you were a bad kisser, to which Nina doesn't know the answer to. Michelle suggests the only way would be kiss someone you really trust and ask them how it was. This advance by Michelle goes right by Nina who is engrossed in the movie.Dot still unable to sleep, sees Paul coming down the stairs. She fakes sleeping as Paul enters her room. Thinking she's asleep, he sits on her bed, and as he's stroking her hair, he whispers to her that he's sick and that he thought things might change when she came to live with them. He says, \"I hate it here\" and leaves.Back to Michelle's bedroom, she asks Nina if there was one place you could go where would it be. She replies Australia because it's really far away.Next day at the cafeteria, Dot is alone at her table again. Connor, Brian, Michelle & Nina are at the table across from her. They are discussing plans where Brian's parents are going away and he'll have a small party, with drinks for all. Michelle suggests Nina can sneak out and snag some drugs from her mom, since she's a \"prescriptoholic.\" Nina is not amused and is not sure she can come, but Michelle goads her, as she sees this as a chance to get to sleep with Connor.Dot is alone at home playing some classical piece on the piano in the main room. Unbeknownst to Dot, Nina comes home, hears the music and is quietly listening to it in the doorway. While playing, a piano wire suddenly snaps and Dot curses out loud, startling Nina who quickly ducks around the corner. Dot begins to try to find the damaged piano key by tuning along with her voice to the keys, with Nina all the while listening to this, now knowing that Dot's deafness is not at all as it seems. She sneaks back to the door, slams it as if she just came in and greets Dot, who has now stopped playing, without letting on about what she just witnessed.At the cafeteria the next day, Nina, goes over to Dot's table, who is as usual alone, and pulls a chair right up next to Dot. While Dot is eating her sandwich and staring straight ahead, supposedly ignoring Nina, Nina talks directly and angrily into her ear how much she hated her, the lovehate relationship with her own Dad with all the lurid details of their incestuous encounters and her plans to kill him in the middle of the night with a gun (supplied by Michelle, who will steal it from her Dad) while Mom is drugged out and Dot \"can't hear\". We can see that Dot is disturbed by these confessions, but she keeps her reactions in check. Angry that she couldn't goad a response out of Dot, Nina storms off.Dot is back at the school piano again, when she notices Connor watching her through the door. Connor stops her as she tries to leave and tries to set up a date where they can work on the lab report together. She pulls the already completed report out of her bag, gives it to him and leaves to his dismay.While the Deers are at the dinner table, Connor stops by and surprises Nina who was expecting Michelle. He asks if Dot can come to the library to go over the lab report. Meanwhile Michelle arrives for the secret party with a brown bag and gives it to Nina. Dot notices the bag and is visibly affected. Nina notices and rhetorically asks Dot what she's looking at, at which Dot gets up and leaves with Connor.Dot and Connor are at a diner. He starts off with small talk about the lab report, but eventually begins confessing things about himself and his feelings towards Dot, including asking if she's a virgin like him. She does not respond or acknowledge. Meanwhile Nina and Michelle are up in her room, discussing nipples, when Paul comes up and tells her to send Michelle home because it's a school night. Nina tells her she can't come to the party and Michelle leaves angry.Dot sees an ambulance drive by at the diner and rushes home where she finds the bag Michelle brought over sitting on a chair in the dining room. She opens it and finds it not to contain a gun, but instead porn DVD's. She sneaks over to Nina's room where she discovers Nina and her dad about to have sex. She breaks a statue against the wall to break it up. Nina, taken off guard, comes out and helps her clean it up, while Paul emerges and tells her to be more careful around the house. He goes back to his bedroom where he tries to say something to Olivia, but she is faking being asleep.Nina is back in her bed crying, and she thinks her Dad is coming back in so she says she's tired, but it's Dot, who gets into the bed and puts her arm around Nina to comfort her as she goes to sleep.The next morning Dot is still in Nina's room and Nina is ironing her cheerleader outfit, at which point she infers to Dot that midnight tonight will be the night she kills her dad for sure with the iron, burns the face off a teddy bear for effect and throws it to Dot. She is still unaware that Nina knows she is not deaf, and Nina tells her it's a good thing she's deaf because she could be considered an accomplice.At night, outside the school gymnasium where Connor is playing in a basketball game, Dot dials Child Welfare on a pay phone, but decides to hang up when someone answers. She enters the gymnasium and watches the game where Connor is playing so bad he gets benched. Nina, Michele and Fiona are there as part of the cheerleading squad.After the game, Dot stops Connor and pulls him into the empty and darkened school swimming pool building. Connor is talking to Dot by the pool about going on road trips with her and how quiet it would be, but when she's not looking he's confessing about how many times he masturbates and how he's a sex addict, who sucks at basketball.Meanwhile, back in Paul & Olivia's bedroom, she pops some more pills and mentions to Paul that Connor would be a cute guy for Nina. Paul gets mad and tells her to be careful about pushing her into dating and dressing like a slut. She comes out of the master bathroom and disrobes asking Paul if she's getting fat. Paul emphatically ignores her advances and gets into bed to go to sleep. Olivia calls him mean and says she's sleeping on the floor. Paul tells her to get into bed, but she refuses so he picks her up and throws her onto the bed and he goes downstairs.Back at the pool, Connor and Dot have gotten closer and while she's not looking he is confessing to her how he has kissed lots of girls but has never \"done it\", at which point she sits up, and to Connor's surprise, takes her shirt off, does the same for him, and they begin to kiss.Back at the Deer house Nina comes home alone and encounters her Dad who is eating ice cream in the kitchen. He tells her he has a present for her and gives her an expensive pocketbook after which he makes advances toward her. She stops him, removes her cheerleader dress and tells him she'll be in her bedroom.Back at the school, Connor and Dot are having sex poolside, though she doesn't seem to be enjoying it. When it's over she notices the clock nearing midnight so she rushes back to the house.Back the Deer house, Paul quietly took a candle out of the bedside table and headed back to Nina's room, though we see that Olivia is definitely awake. Nina is ironing her skirt to put it away, while holding off her Dad's advances. She tells him she has a surprise for him and to sit on the bed with his eyes closed. He does so and she walks up to him and is about to ram the hot iron into his face when Dot comes home and slams the front door. Dot listens by the door. Nina chickens out and ends up telling her dad that she's pregnant with his child. He gets upset and asks if she's sure and what's she's going to do about it. Nina gets mad and says she doesn't want a baby with webbed feet running around the house and needs $1000 cash tomorrow to get an abortion. He agrees and leaves.Nina goes to Dot's room, gets into bed with her and confesses that she's wasn't brave enough to do it.At the lunch line in the cafeteria the next day Connor asks Dot to go to the Spring Fling dance with him, via translation from the lunch lady. Dot says no and that she's wrong for him and she needs to be by herself and leaves. Michelle and Nina, who were in the same line witness it and Michelle begins to curse out Dot, when Nina cuts her off and tells her to back off.Back in Dot's room that night, Nina brings her a dress for the dance to try to get her to go and confesses to Dot that she will be taking the $1000 and running off to get started in Connecticut where she can be a stripper and makes lots of money and even become famous like Courtney Love, who was one. She says it was so hard lying about being pregnant that part of her thinks it's true. She puts the lipstick on Dot again, but this time it's perfectly applied and leaves to get ready.In the bathroom, Dot is holding the dress up to herself to see how it looks in the mirror. Nina comes in and Dot begins to wipe off the lipstick and puts down the dress. She's not going. Nina asks Dot to let her in on her secret, but she walks away.Olivia is downstairs in the dark staring at the blank walls. Dot is downstairs playing Moonlight Sonata on the piano. Nina sneaks into her parents bedroom to steal some of her mom's pills and finishes getting ready in the master bedroom. Meanwhile Paul is looking for Nina and notices tampons in her new bag. He grabs the bag and begins badgering Nina in the bedroom about the \"pregnancy\". He then confronts Nina about the tampons where she at first says they belonged to Michelle and she was holding them for her since she had no bag. He doesn't buy it, throws the $1000 at Nina and calls her a whore. He begins slapping Nina around and then begins to force himself on her. Olivia hears all this and is crying downstairs, but does nothing. Dot hears, stops playing and rips out a piano wire. She heads upstairs, comes up behind Paul and strangles him with it, while screaming for him to leave Nina alone. Nina drops to the body screaming at Dot for killing her Daddy. Olivia comes upstairs in a daze and says it's a miracle that Dot can speak.Michelle and Fiona show up to pick up Nina for the dance and Dot tells Nina that they have to bury the backpack (presumably with their bloody clothes in it). Dot goes to the dance with them, but gets intercepted there by Connor who makes her dance with him. Nina takes the backpack and hides in the bathroom stall with it.Meanwhile, we see Olivia sitting in the bedroom, contemplating, with Paul's bloody body at her feet.Dot leaves Connor abruptly on the dance floor and he follows her out. He calls out for her to wait and when she stops with her back to him, he knows now that she can hear and tells her to turn around. Obviously distressed, he berates her for actually hearing his dirty secrets, calls her a psycho and tells her to shove off, as she tries to apologize to him.She continues on to collect Nina from the bathroom and they run out through the woods to a creek where they bury the backpack. Nina asked why Dot pretended to be deaf all this time and she replied she wanted to be closer to her father and farther from everyone else. They head back home walking through the creek.When they arrive back at the house police are everywhere, and they are leading Nina's mom out in handcuffs. They run up to her and Olivia tells Nina that she did a terrible thing in that she killed her father when he started going crazy, breaking things and saying he hated her, so she took a piano wire and strangled him with it. She tells Nina she never wanted him to hurt her and if she could ever forgive her, as they take her away in the police car.Fade to the piano in the house during the day where Nina is tentatively playing on it. Dot comes up and joins her as the camera pulls away from them.Nina used to think she would not even have a funeral....and now, with her Daddy/tormentor dead, she has a chance at life....", "output": "Question: who tries to help Nina avoid Paul's ?, Answer: Paul's advances., Question: Why is Michelle jealous of Dot and Connor's partnership?, Answer: She likes Connor, Question: What happened to Dot's father?, Answer: Killed by a truck he couldn't hear, Question: Who is eating their sandwich like a pig?, Answer: Dot, Question: Who killed Paul?, Answer: Olivia, Question: What does Dot tell Connor that she is able to do?, Answer: to communicate well with Dot, Question: How much does Nina ask Paul?, Answer: $1,000, Question: What was Paul unable to say to Olivia?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What are the two girls doing at the end of the film?, Answer: the two girls play piano together., Question: Who is sent to live with her godparents?, Answer: Dot, Question: How does Paul discover that Nina is not pregnant?, Answer: he discovers tampons in her purse, he realizes that she is lying, Question: Who used to be close friends with Dot?, Answer: NINA, Question: Who does Connor need to improve his grades?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What is Nana's plan?, Answer: planning to kill her father and then running away, Question: What sport does Connor play?, Answer: BASKETBALL, Question: How did the character feel about his room mate when he first moved in?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: who is neither deaf nor mute?, Answer: Dot, Question: Who did Dot find had a relationship with her father?, Answer: Nina", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

But instead they break into the wrong house as Jimmie walks out of the bathroom with a handheld hair dryer in hand, Parnell shoots thinking it's a weapon. Rainwood is shot in the shoulder and knocked unconscious. Realising that they could both be tested for taking drugs and charged they decide to cover up their mistake. They plant drugs in the house and place a firearm in the hand of Rainwood's unconscious body and they frame him as a drug dealer. Jimmie is pegged as a user having a prior record of marijuana possession while in college and his only defense is his word against two decorated cops. He claims the two cops framed him but no evidence proves the men are corrupt. He gets a 6-year prison sentence. Internal Affairs detective, John Fitzgerald (Badja Djola) takes a mild personal interest in the situation although he can not do anything since everything is hearsay.Jimmie is initially na\u00c3\u00afve about prison life; early in his term he sees his cellmate stabbed with a screwdriver and set on fire and then has a personal run in with the Black Guerrilla Family run by Jingles who took his commissary purchases. After the gang assaults him and threatens him with sexual assault, and does not report them, he comes to the realization that he has to take the recommendation of fellow inmates Butcher (Dennis Burkley) and Virgil Cane (F. Murray Abraham) to \"take care of his problem.\"Jimmie gets a plexiglas shank, stabs Jingles to death, and spends three months in a windowless, subterranean solitary confinement although it's never proven he did the job. When he is released to the general population he is received as a minor hero for ridding the prison of Jingles. On the outside, Kate is causing trouble by bringing the situation to the attention of whoever will listen and is threatened by Parnell and Scalise. Her visit to Fitzgerald went nowhere so she told him the detectives insulted him racially which although a lie was reinforced when Fitzgerald angrily told them to stay away from Kate and coincidentally use the words that Kate said they had used.Before being paroled after three years served, Virgil suggests getting even with the detectives but he instead sets out to regain his life on the outside until paid a visit by the detectives who indicate that Jimmie's future depends on whether or not he does what Parnell and Scalise say.Parnell and Scalise are set up to arrest the dealers of some \"competition\" that are in reality protected dealers of Joseph Donatelli (J.J. Johnston). Of course, the detectives do not turn over all the drugs and are robbed by masked culprits who unknown to them are Jimmie and Malcolm (M.C. Gainey) another inmate that later call in to the detectives to return the drugs for a cash payout where Malcolm is wired for sound recording by Fitzgerald. There is a glitch and Jimmie has to declare himself and a gun fight ensues, Malcolm is shot and killed by Parnell, Scalise dies after crashing his car trying to escape and Parnell is about to die at the hands of Jimmie by Parnell's own switchblade. Kate begs Jimmie not to kill Parnell saving him so that he can be convicted.The movie ends with both Parnell and Jimmie returning to a life they both deserve. Parnell is put into general prison population (a creative liberty, as convicted ex-cops are always kept in protective custody or are housed in out of state Federal prisons[citation needed]). On entry to the prison inmate main room, Virgil calls attention to Parnel by yelling, \"hey, officer\" for all the other inmates to see and hear. Parnell looks up to the balcony where Virgil is standing, his face frozen in a mask of fear and hears Virgil say, \"Ain't life a motherfucker?\", repeating the line said when he and Jimmie met last and Jimmie went on parole. Jimmie is seen suited up working again for the airline thus finally getting his life back.", "output": "Question: How does things end for Jimmie and Parnell?, Answer: return to a life they both deserve., Question: What drug did Parnell take too much of?, Answer: Cocaine., Question: Who threatens Kate?, Answer: Parnell and Scalise, Question: What are the detectives' names?, Answer: Parnell and Scalise, Question: What does Jimmie use to stab Jinlges to death?, Answer: plexiglass shank, Question: Who are the detectives robbed by?, Answer: masked culprits, Question: Is Jimmie a criminal?, Answer: Yes, Question: What group does Jimmie have a personal run in with?, Answer: Black Guerrilla Family, Question: What does Parnell think is a weapon?, Answer: A hair dryer., Question: Who shot Malcolm?, Answer: Parnell, Question: Why does Kate beg Jimmie not to kill Parnell?, Answer: A conviction, Question: What is Jimmie's cellmate stabbed with?, Answer: screwdriver, Question: What does Mike and Danny specialize in?, Answer: drug busts, Question: How many years did Jimmie serve?, Answer: 3, Question: Who was yelling?, Answer: Virgil, Question: What is James \"Jimmie\" Rainwood's profession?, Answer: Engineer, Question: How many detectives visit Jimmie?, Answer: 2, Question: Who was put into general prison population ?, Answer: Parnell, Question: Does Jimmie take Virgil's suggestion?, Answer: No, Question: Who tells Parnell and Scalise to stay away from Kate?, Answer: Fitzgerald, Question: What department does John Fitzgerald work in?, Answer: Internal Affairs., Question: Was Jimmie paroled?, Answer: Yes", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The police reveal that an obscene letter was found in Gruneman's office, addressed to a prostitute in New York City named Bree Daniels (Fonda), who had received several similar letters from him. After six months of fruitless police work, Peter Cable (Cioffi), an executive at Gruneman's company, hires family friend and detective John Klute (Sutherland) to investigate Gruneman's disappearance.Klute rents an apartment in the basement of Daniels' building, taps her phone, and follows her as she turns tricks. Daniels appears to be liberated by the freedom of freelancing as a call girl, but in a series of visits to her psychiatrist (Vivian Nathan), she reveals the emptiness of her life and that she wants to quit. Klute asks Daniels to answer some of his questions, but she refuses. He approaches her again, revealing that he has been watching her. She does not recall Gruneman. She reveals that she was beaten by one of her johns two years earlier, but after seeing a photo of Gruneman, she says she cannot say for sure.Daniels takes Klute to meet her former pimp, Frank Ligourin (Scheider), who reveals that one of his prostitutes, Jane McKenna, passed the abusive client on to Bree and another prostitute named Arlyn Page (Dorothy Tristan). McKenna committed suicide and Page became a drug addict and disappeared. Klute and Daniels develop a romance, though she tells her psychiatrist that she fears these feelings and wishes she could go back to \"just feeling numb.\" She admits to Klute a deep paranoia that she is being watched.They find Page, who tells them the customer was not Gruneman but an older man. Page's body then turns up in the Kill Van Kull. Klute deduces a connection between the two \"suicides\" of the prostitutes, surmising that the client probably also killed Gruneman and may kill Daniels next. He revisits Gruneman's contacts to find connections with the case. By typographic comparison, the supposed obscene letters of Gruneman are traced to Cable, with whom Klute has been meeting to report on his investigation.Klute asks Cable for an additional $500 to buy the \"black book\" of the first prostitute who apparently committed suicide, telling Cable he is certain the book will reveal the identity of the abusive client. Cable corners Bree and reveals that he sent her the letters, explaining that Gruneman had interrupted him when he was attacking a prostitute. Certain that Gruneman would use the incident as leverage against him within the company, Cable attempted to frame Gruneman by planting the letter in his office. He confesses to the killings. After playing an audiotape he made as he murdered Page, he attacks Daniels. Klute rushes in, and Cable jumps or is thrown out a window to his death (the film uses ambiguous editing).Daniels moves out of her apartment with Klute's help, though her voiceover with her psychiatrist reveals her fear of domestic life and a likelihood that the doctor will \"see me next week.\"", "output": "Question: Who murdered Tom?, Answer: Peter Cable, Question: Where does Bree live?, Answer: New York City, Question: Who does Bree work for?, Answer: Frank Ligourin, Question: Who wants to be a model/actress?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Whose name did Cable use?, Answer: Tom Gruneman, Question: Who wants to kill Bree Daniels?, Answer: Peter Cable, Question: Who does Daniels cooperate with?, Answer: Cable, Question: Who had recorded the sexual encounters and murders?, Answer: Peter Cable, Question: Who hires John Klute to go to New York ?, Answer: Peter Cable, Question: Who mistreated Bree Daniels?, Answer: Peter Cable, Question: Who does Daniels fall in love with?, Answer: Klute, Question: Who is a prostitute in New York City ?, Answer: Bree Daniels, Question: who is aspires to be a model/actress?, Answer: Bree Daniels, Question: Where is Tom Gruneman house?, Answer: Pennyslvania, Question: Who is arrested for prostitution?, Answer: <No Answer>", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Hazmat Elimination Company, an asbestos removal company run by Gordon Fleming (played by Peter Mullan) and his associate Phil (played by David Carusoe), are the first to start on the renovation of the building. The film opens with a lightly humoured tour through the asylum led by Bill Griggs (a cameo by Paul Guilfoyle) as Gordon and Phil get their first glimpse of the aforementioned mad house. Distracted by ghastly rooms and one hallway in particular, Gordon hears a voice call out to him but is snapped back to reality by partner Phil. After the heebie-jeebies have been established cut to a scene of Gordon sitting alone in his truck as he fawns over pictures of his newborn and watches her and his wife as they play out front of their home. This scene is cut short by terrible screams and a haunting feeling that perhaps all is not well in the Fleming household.Now cue Gordon's employees: Hank (played by Josh Lucas), Gordon's nephew Jeff (Brandon Sexton III), and Mike (Stephen Gevedon) a former lawschool student who's father was the district attorney who indirectly led to the closing of Kirkbride through a patient's lawsuit in 1984.As the film glides along with horror stories of old, employee banter, and Gordon's increasingly distant behaviour, Mike finds some old recorded sessions (labeled 1-9) in an office while checking a generator and Hank stumbles upon coins from the 1800's in another part of the building. Mike begins stealing time away from the job to sneak downstairs and listen to the recorded sessions which are centered around patient #444 Mary Hobbes, a patient with multiple personalities. As the week continues Gordon becomes more irritable, Mike continues deeper into the sessions and Hank heads back late at night, for the silver dollar payload, and mysteriously disappears.After Hank's disappearance the rest of the crew becomes more and more edgy as the week continues. Gordon's history with his distant wife comes to light, Phil's anger and impatience with Gordon becomes a factor and all the while Mike gets closer and closer to the end of the sessions with Mary Hobbes. You begin to see the number 444 show more often in the film on rooms and tombstones, and Gordon reveals to Phil that he hit his wife by accident that night after their tour of the asylum. Phil goes to Mike with this news recommending that Gordon could use some time off, all the while unbeknownst to them Gordon listens from around the corner. Just then Hank is found wandering the halls by Jeff.As Jeff runs to tell the others Hank disappears again and the manhunt is on. With flaring tension between Phil and Gordon, Mike and Jeff swimming in a sea of apprehensive paranoia and the manhunt for the missing Hank, the story reaches its climax with a shot of each character alone against the unseen villian. The film is tied together as a replacement employee for Hank arrives for work and searches the seemingly abandoned Hospital for Gordon and the others. Come to the room where Hank lies on the floor still breathing, Phil telling Gordon to wake up , and the arrival of the new employee. It is revealed through flashbacks that Gordon has now killed each one of his employees, nephew, wife and child. The stress of life had caught up with Gordon and after killing the man who had just arrived and realized his deadly misgivings; the film ends with Gordon apologizing to his dead wife on a broken phone and the voice who has been calling to him throughout the film is revealed as Simon, Mary Hobbes' third personality.

Reese wants to become a higher level agent with more responsibilities. As the result of a shortage of agents in France, he is assigned as a partner to secret agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta).Reese's first test is to have Wax released from airport detention by the French Customs when Wax does not want to surrender the cans of his favorite energy drink. Despite the apparent triviality of an energy drink that Wax could probably purchase in Paris, Wax continues to verbally abuse French Customs until Reese places a Diplomatic Mail sticker on Wax's luggage containing the energy drink, which makes them immune from customs and quarantine requirements.Once in the car, Wax apologizes for his behavior while opening the tins and revealing the concealed pieces of his personal SIG Sauer P226 X-Five Lightweight, which he refers to as \"Mrs. Jones\".

Meanwhile, Severus Snape arrives at Malfoy Manor to tell Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and the rest of his council that he's been appointed the new Headmaster of Hogwarts. He also tells them that the Order of the Phoenix will be moving Harry Potter from Privet Drive to a safe house. Voldemort uses Lucius Malfoy's (Jason Isaacs) wand to avoid using twin wands in a dueling battle.After Harry's 'family' The Dursleys flee their home, the Order of the Phoenix arrive to meet Harry along with six others: Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hermione, Fred (James Phelps) and George Weasley (Oliver Phelps), Fleur Delacour (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) and Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden). They all take Polyjuice Potion to become Harry's doppelganger's.Harry and the six copies leave Privet Drive accompanied by a protector whilst the real Harry flies alongside Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) on his flying motorbike. They are intercepted almost immediately by Death Eaters and the pairs scatter. Voldemort arrives but Harry manages to defeat his borrowed wand and the group arrive safely at the Burrow. All but Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), who was killed by Voldemort and Mundungus, who disapparated when he saw Voldemort arrive. George has a bad head wound from a curse Snape conjured during the battle. Ron convinces Harry to remain at the Burrow until after Bill (Domhnall Gleeson) and Fleur's wedding before going to find more horcruxes. Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy), arrives at the Burrow and distributes the items from Dumbledore's last will and testament to Ron, Hermione and Harry. Ron receives the Deluminator, Harry gets the missing sword of Gryffindor and the first Snitch he ever caught and Hermione gets a personal copy of \"The Tales of Beetle the Bard\". During the wedding, Harry sees Xenophilius Lovegood (Rhys Ifans) and notices a strange symbol on his necklace. Harry speaks to Elphius Doge (David Ryall), one of Dumbledore's oldest friends and Ron's Aunt Muriel (Matyelok Gibbs) and learns that Dumbledore used to live in Harry's hometown, Godric's Hollow. A Patronus message sent by Kingsley Shacklebolt (George Harris) appears and warns that the Ministry has fallen, Scrimgeour is dead and that 'they are coming'. Death Eaters appear and trash the ceremony, leading Ron, Harry and Hermione to apparate to London.Taking refuge in a cafe, they discuss their immediate plans but before they can leave two Death Eaters arrive and begin dueling. The trio win the battle and disapparate to Grimmauld Place where they discover that Regulus Arcturus Black (Sirius's younger brother) is the R.A.B in the false locket found at the end of Half-Blood Prince. Kreacher reveals that the real locket was in the house but Mundungus stole it when he looted Grimmauld Place. Harry sends Kreacher to get Mundungus who in turn explains that Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) took it from him in return for not revoking his peddler's licence. The trio decide to break into the Ministry, now under the eyes of Death Eaters to retrieve the locket.Harry, Ron and Hermione capture three Ministry workers and impersonate them to enter the secret Ministry offices but are quickly split up. Hermione ends up in a courtroom with Umbridge to witness a false trial, Ron is in Head of Magical Law Enforcement (Death Eater Yaxley's) office and Harry is free to wander the corridors since he unwittingly copied a Death Eater Runcorn. Harry eventually finds his way to Umbridge's office but doesn't find the locket so he makes his way to the courtroom alongside Ron. They reunite with Hermione and stun Umbridge to take the locket and attempt to leave the Ministry. However, their Polyjuice Potion begins to wear off and during the battle to Floo away, Yaxley catches them as they reach Grimmauld Place.Since they cannot safely stay at Grimmauld Place now Yaxley is a secret-keeper, Hermione apparates them to a forest. Ron gets splinched in the process, meaning the group can't apparate until he has recovered. They attempt to destroy the locket but their magic proves useless on it so they take turns wearing it despite its negative effects on their morale. While wearing it, Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing Gregorovitch (Rade Serbedzija) the wand-maker and going off in search of a mysterious wizard said to have robbed his shop many years ago.As they apparate around the countryside to camp in secluded areas, Ron becomes increasingly suspicious that Harry and Hermione are becoming more than friends. While wearing the locket, Ron overhears Hermione discover that if they can find the sword of Gryffindor, they can destroy all of the Horcruxes. This realisation that they must find another thing in a location they don't know, coupled with his rising suspicion and resentment, drives Ron to leave the group and return home. Harry and Hermione are forced to teleport away, leaving Ron no way to return even if he wanted to. Hermione takes his exit badly so Harry dances to a radio with her to try and cheer her up but the romantic situation is too much for Hermione, making her revert back to sadness. Harry decides to visit Godric's Hollow, both because it would be the first time since Voldemort attacked him and because he wishes to meet Bethilda Bagshot (Hazel Douglas), a magical historian who claimed to 'know the Dumbledores better than anyone'. They find the church graveyard and Hermione notices that a grave bearing the name 'Ignotus Peverell' has the same symbol on it as the one on Mr. Lovegood's necklace and in the book left for her by Dumbledore. Harry finds his parents' gravestones and an old woman approaches them as they pay their respects. Harry guesses that she is Bethilda and they follow her home. Harry sees a picture of the teenager from Gregorovitch's memory as Bethilda leads him to the attic of the house. Hermione wanders around downstairs. She finds signs of a bloody attack whilst the woman in front of Harry decomposes before his eyes into Voldemort's snake, Nagini. After a fight, Harry and Hermione escape with the only casualty being Harry's wand. Hermione says that the teen from the memory was Gellert Grindelwald.In the forest where they spend the night, Harry sees a Patronus doe watching over them and follows it to a frozen pond. He discovers the sword of Gryffindor at the bottom and as he swims down to get it, the locket goes crazy and attempts to drown him. Ron appears and saves him with Harry convincing Ron to destroy the locket with the sword. Harry opens it using Parseltongue. As it opens, a ghostly black cloud erupts from it whilst it shows Ron horrific images including spiders. A ghostly Harry tells Ron that Mrs. Weasley wanted him as a son whilst a ghostly Hermione mocks him, asking him why she'd choose him over the Chosen One before they begin kissing. Ron angrily attacks the locket, destroying it with the sword before he returns to the tent with Harry. Hermione is furious at Ron for leaving and returning as if nothing happened but the trio decide to visit Mr. Lovegood to find out about the mysterious symbol.At the Lovegood house, Mr. Lovegood teaches them about the Deathly Hallows - an invincible Elder Wand, a Resurrecting Stone and the invisibility cloak - and tells them the story of the three Peverell brothers who owned them all. When the group attempts to leave, Mr Lovegood reveals that Death Eaters have taken his daughter, Luna (Evanna Lynch) and that he must keep them there before they give her back. They escape the ensuing attack but apparate to a previous camping ground where a group of Snatchers are waiting to capture them and take them to the Ministry. Hermione uses a Stinging Hex on Harry's face to disfigure it but the Snatchers see the scar under the swelling. Instead, they take the trio to Malfoy Manor to collect the reward for Harry's capture.Since the Malfoys and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) can't be sure the disfigured wizard is Harry, despite the fact he's travelling with Ron and Hermione, they refrain from summoning Voldemort until the swelling has gone down. However, Bellatrix sees the sword and believes it to be in her vault at Gringott's Bank. She imprisons Harry and Ron in a cellar where they find Luna, Ollivander (John Hurt), and a goblin. Bellatrix meanwhile brutally tortures Hermione to try to find out how they stole the sword. Wormtail takes the goblin upstairs to be interrogated, and Harry summons Dobby (Toby Jones), who frees Luna and Ollivander before breaking Harry and Ron out. They go to rescue Hermione and the goblin, but despite winning the duels with Dobby's help - Harry manages to win Draco's wand and picks up Bellatrix' wand - Bellatrix throws a knife that stabs and kills Dobby as they disapparate. Harry gives Dobby a proper burial on the beach where they appear.The movie ends with Voldemort opening Dumbledore's tomb and taking the Elder Wand.", "output": "Question: Who prepares for a journey to find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes?, Answer: The trio, Harry, Hermione, and Ron., Question: Who is the Minister of Magic?, Answer: Rufus Scrimgeour, Question: Where does Bellatrix imprison Harry and Ron?, Answer: In the Malfoy Manor cellar., Question: Who killed Dobby?, Answer: Bellatrix., Question: Who did Harry disarm in a duel?, Answer: Draco Malfoy, Question: Who took Lucius Malfoy's wand?, Answer: Harry Potter.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Dr. Arnold's evaluation will determine Karla's eligibility for parole. During the session, Dr. Arnold shows Karla a photo album of herself and her husband Paul Bernardo (Misha Collins) in happier times, and Karla has a memory of how they first met. However, when Dr. Arnold introduces the subject of Karla's sister Tammy, Karla becomes uncooperative. Over the following weeks, Dr. Arnold probes Karla about her knowledge of Paul's secret life as a serial rapist, and it is revealed that shortly before their marriage Paul began to rape women. Paul convinced Karla to help him rape her sister on camera. At first Karla disagrees, but eventually steals Halcion from the veterinary clinic where she works. Tammy gets drunk at a Christmas party and becomes unresponsive after the two drug her. Tammy is raped, and ends up getting sick while drugged, choking on her own vomit. Karla calls 911 and the two hide the assault evidence so her death would appear accidental. Afterwards, Paul beats Karla for \"ruining his movie\". Karla learns never to ruin Paul's \"movies\".Karla tells Dr. Arnold that Paul became obsessed with Tammy and kept watching the video after her death, even showing it to friends. Paul also threatened to reveal Karla's role in her sister's murder if he should get into any more trouble, but Karla finally leaves him anyway.Paul is open with Karla about his crimes, yet Karla does not object to them, even when Paul begins to bring his victims home. Although disturbed at that part of Paul's life, Karla learns to accept it, knowing that she too will be killed if she does not. At Paul's request, Karla hesitantly participates in these assaults. Paul kidnaps a young girl, Tina McCarthy, and forces her to undress on camera. Karla witnesses this, but is too afraid to tell anyone. Tina is held for 3 days, and is raped repeatedly while Karla is forced to videotape it all. During one such assault, Paul strangles Tina after she sees his face. Karla tries to convince him not to kill her, but he insists, telling her that Tina can identify them both. He cuts the body into pieces and seals them in cement blocks, which he then dumps into a lake. On the day of Paul and Karla's wedding, the girl's body is discovered, and identified by dental records. Paul stops raping and abducting for a time, but his anxiety and pent-up frustration cause him to become violent toward Karla. Paul's friends see the change in his personality and break off from him. Meanwhile Karla, suffering from the abuse and desperate to reclaim his affections, helps Paul abduct and rape another young girl, \"Kaitlyn Ross\" (based on Kristen French). Kaitlyn is brutally raped by Paul. Karla watches the assault and begins to cry. Paul beats Karla and tells her that she is ruining his movie again. After Paul leaves, Karla is put in charge of Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn tells Karla that she is a victim too, and that this is not her fault. When asked why she stays, Karla simply says, \"You don't understand\". Karla explains to Dr. Arnold that she wanted to free Kaitlyn, but was afraid Paul would kill her if she did.Kaitlyn's disappearance immediately attracts a storm of media and police attention, so Paul kills Kaitlyn to be rid of her. As part of the investigation, the police arrive at Paul's house. Paul is very cooperative so the police leave satisfied, but, afterwards, he beats Karla mercilessly. Karla takes refuge with friends before reporting the assault. Paul is then booked under domestic violence but is released after only one night in jail.Back at the Regional Psychiatric Centre, Dr. Arnold asks Karla about her relationship with her younger sister (Tammy Homolka) and her jealousy towards Tammy because of Paul's attraction to her. Karla confesses that Paul wanted to take Tammy's virginity and that he wanted Karla to \"give\" Tammy to him. Karla agrees to help him rape her sister.Shortly thereafter the DNA samples Paul provided as part of the Scarborough rape investigation are matched to the evidence found on one of the murder victims. Both he and Karla are subsequently arrested. During the trial, Paul testifies that Karla killed Kaitlyn Ross with a mallet. Karla denies all the killings. Paul is convicted on two counts of murder without any possibility of parole. Karla is given a sentence of twelve years in exchange for a guilty plea for manslaughter.The film ends with a note explaining that Karla's parole was denied, as the psychologist found her artificial, manipulative and without remorse.", "output": "Question: Who is convicted on two counts of murder without any possibility of parole?, Answer: Paul, Question: Who does Paul begin to bring home?, Answer: Victims, Question: Who is Karla's sister she is jealous of?, Answer: Tammy, Question: How many nights does Paul spend in jail?, Answer: One, Question: Who killed Kaitlyn?, Answer: Paul, Question: What is the event Karla and Paul are having when Tina's body is discovered?, Answer: Wedding, Question: Who does Karla tell she wanted to free Kaitlyn but was afraid?, Answer: Dr. Arnold, Question: Whos parole was denied?, Answer: Karla's, Question: Who are arrested?, Answer: Paul and Karla, Question: Who does Paul become violent toward?, Answer: Karla, Question: How long is Tina held?, Answer: 3 days., Question: Who did Karla tell about Tammy's tape?, Answer: Dr. Arnold, Question: What does Paul strangle Tina after she sees?, Answer: His face., Question: Karla and Paul agree to do what to Tammy?, Answer: Rape her", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Frank immortalizes these two events in a pair of crayon drawings that he hangs on his wall for inspiration. Sarah, a recovering addict, leaves Frank for Jacques, a charismatic strip club owner who gets her hooked on drugs. Frank sinks into depression, where he has a vision in which he is touched by the finger of God and meets the Holy Avenger, a superhero from a public-access television show, who tells Frank that God has chosen him for a very special purpose. Frank believes that God has chosen him to become a superhero and goes to a local comic book store for inspiration. His claim that he is designing a new superhero is met with enthusiastic appreciation from the store clerk, Libby. Frank creates a superhero costume and assumes the identity of \"The Crimson Bolt.\"Armed with a pipe wrench, he begins to fight crime by delivering savage beatings to various rulebreakers, ranging from drug dealers and child molesters to a man who cuts in line at the movies. The Crimson Bolt soon becomes a media sensation. Initially, the media view him as a violent psychopath, but he begins to gain public appreciation after the criminal backgrounds of many of his victims come to light. Frank later attempts to rescue Sarah, but Jacques' thugs recognize him under the costume and shoot him in the leg as he flees.A wounded Frank goes to Libby for help. Libby cajoles Frank into letting her become the Crimson Bolt's \"kid sidekick,\" christening herself \"Boltie\" and designing a costume. She proves to be even more unhinged than Frank, using her superhero guise to nearly kill a man who possibly vandalized her friend's car. Frank decides to let her go, but changes his mind when Libby rescues him from some of Jacques' thugs at a gas station. Libby soon becomes enamored with Frank, but her advances are turned down as Frank insists that he is still married. Arguing that it is different when they are in their superhero identities, Libby rapes Frank while the two are in costume. Frank runs to the bathroom and vomits, where he encounters a vision of Sarah in the toilet. He decides that it is time to rescue her from Jacques.Armed with guns, pipe bombs, and bulletproof vests, Frank and Libby sneak into Jacques' ranch, killing the first few guards they encounter. However, they are both shot. Frank is struck in the chest, his bulletproof vest sparing him, but Libby is shot in the head and killed.

As David enjoys the bachelor lifestyle, he is introduced to Sofia Serrano (Pen\u00c3\u00a9lope Cruz) by his best friend, author Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) at a party. David and Sofia spend a night together talking and fall in love. When David's former lover, Julianna \"Julie\" Gianni (Cameron Diaz), hears of Sofia, she attempts to kill herself and David in a car crash. Julie dies but David survives, his face grotesquely disfigured,[4] leading him to wear a mask to hide the injuries. With no hope to use plastic surgery to repair the damage, David cannot come to grips with the idea of wearing the mask for the rest of his life. On a night out with Sofia and Brian, David gets hopelessly drunk and Sofia and Brian leave David to wallow in the street outside.David is awakened the next day in the street by Sofia, who apologises for deserting him the night before, and takes him home. The two continue to see each other, and David has his face surgically repaired despite being told it was impossible before. Though his life seems perfectly content, David finds oddities, such as brief visions of his distorted face, and a man (Noah Taylor) at a bar that tells him David can control the world and everyone in it, if he wanted to. One day, when he goes to Sofia's apartment, he finds Julie there instead; all of the previous mementos of Sofia now show Julie's face. Angry and confused, David suffocates Julie, and is later arrested and placed in a mental institution, finding his face has reverted to its previously disfigured state.David completes telling his story to Curtis, who proceeds to then visit David further for more sessions to try to help him recuperate. During one interview Curtis tells David the staff reported him calling out \"Ellie\" in a bad dream and asks who she is. David later sees a nearby TV advertisement for \"Life Extension\", a company that specializes in cryonic suspension, and realises he'd actually called out \"L\",\"E\". Under Curtis' and a police officer's guard, David is taken to the Life Extension offices, where the salesclerk Rebecca (Tilda Swinton) explains they freeze people just after the point of death, until a cure for their ailment is available in the future, keeping their brain active by placing them in a lucid dream state. David becomes anxious and breaks free of Curtis, realizing he is in his own lucid dream that has gone wrong, and calls for tech support.David finds himself in the empty lobby of the offices, and the man whom he saw earlier at the bar appears, claiming to be David's tech support from Life Extension, which is now known as the Oasis Project. They ride up in an elevator to the top of an impossibly tall building, the height triggering David's severe acrophobia. The man explains that David has been in cryonic sleep for 150 years. David had opted for Life Extension's services after struggling with his breakup with Sofia and his disfigurement, and after securing the publishing company to its associates, proceeded to kill himself with a drug overdose; Life Extension preserved his body and, as David directed, put him into his lucid dream starting from the drunken night when Sofia left him, under the \"vanilla sky\" from a Monet painting. However, during his sleep, the dream went horribly wrong and attempted to incorporate elements from his subconscious, such as substituting Julie for Sofia and creating a father-figure in Curtis. As they arrive at the top of the building, the man offers David a choice: either to be reinserted into the corrected lucid dream, or return to the real world by taking a literal leap of faith off the roof that will wake him from his sleep. David decides to wake up, ignoring the vision of Curtis that his subconscious has brought to life to talk him out of it. David envisions Sofia and Brian to say his goodbyes. Conquering his final fear, David jumps off the building, his life flashing before his eyes, and whites out immediately before hitting the ground. A female voice commands him to \"open your eyes\" (a recurring theme in the movie), and the film ends with David opening his eyes.Alternate ending version[edit]The 2015 Blu-ray release offers the option to watch the film with an alternate ending. This alternate ending expands greatly upon the details at the end of the film. While it all leads to the same conclusion, there are additional scenes, alternate takes, and alternate dialogue.After Rebecca describes the lucid dream, David rushes out of the room but does not immediately dash towards the elevator. He meets McCabe in the restroom who tries to convince him that this is all a hoax and a con and that his case is going to trial. David tells him that he's only in his imagination. Much like in the theatrical cut, the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" plays, but this version makes it clear that David hears the music and that he chose it; meanwhile McCabe tries to convince him there is no music.At this point, David dashes out of the restroom for the elevator the way he does in the theatrical cut, but the scene in the lobby is expanded \u00e2\u0080\u0093 David shoots the police officer who is firing at him and is then surrounded by a SWAT Team whom McCabe tries to talk down, but the SWAT Team fires at both of them. They black out and wake up in the emptied lobby where McCabe continues to applaud what he believes is a performance while David gets into the elevator with Ventura and tells him what happened at the end of his real life.Once they reach the roof, McCabe re-enters again and his pleas to David not to believe Ventura become more and more desperate until he collapses onto the ground in despair. David's interaction with Sofia is extended as he tells her he loves her but can't settle for a dream. He then jumps off the building and screams that he wants to wake up as images from his life flash before his eyes. He wakes up in bed and a voice tells him \"Open your eyes.

Inspector Clouseau is reassigned from his task as a parking officer by Chief Inspector Dreyfus to join the Dream Team in Japan, site of the Tornado's recent heist. At the airport, as soon as he steps over the border and leaves France, news breaks that the Pink Panther Diamond has been stolen, prompting Clouseau, who had up to that point been wary of leaving, to say, \"I told you\". Clouseau travels back to the scene of the crime and joins the other members of the Dream Team: Inspector Pepperidge, from Great Britain; Vincenzo, from Italy; Kenji, an electronics specialist from Japan; and Sonia, a researcher and criminology expert from India. They go to Rome to investigate a black market fence, Alonso Avellaneda, who deals with The Tornado. Assuming he is The Tornado, the Dream Team question him while Clouseau snoops around. Avellaneda vindicates himself by demonstrating that he lacks a bullet-wound to the right shoulder that the Tornado suffered over a decade ago. After they leave, he meets with the real Tornado.That night, Clouseau and his partner, Ponton, spy on Avellaneda, using a wire they planted on him, as he takes a date out for dinner. The mission is compromised when they find Vincenzo and Clouseau's girlfriend, Nicole, together at the restaurant. Having been banned for burning down the restaurant three months earlier, Clouseau disguises himself as a dancer and switches the wire to Nicole's table. In the process, he ends up burning down the restaurant again. At the same time, The Tornado steals the Pope's ring, an act which turns public opinion against the Dream Team. When Clouseau's acts of foolishness aggravate the situation, he is voted off the team; only Sonia sympathizes with him. Shortly afterward, Clouseau is called to an office where they see the Tornado has killed himself and left a suicide note that claims he destroyed the Pink Panther \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regarding it as being so beautiful that he could not bring anyone other than himself to own it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and left the other treasures to be recovered. Examining a key they found in the Pope's Chambers, they match the DNA of the victim with DNA of the Tornado acquired when he was shot, and thus believe themselves to have solved the case. However, Clouseau is unconvinced and believes the Tornado was not the thief.For their victory, a celebration is thrown in the Dream Team's honor. Clouseau, who was not invited, tells Dreyfus the real thief is still at large, but is ignored. Dreyfus relays to the group that Clouseau told him Sonia was the thief, and the group, treating the idea as a joke, work out a plausible explanation for how she could have done it; as the Tornado's ex-lover, she would have in-depth knowledge of his methods, and has set up a situation to draw all attention to the thefts of the other artifacts while leaving her free to sell the Pink Panther. As Sonia leaves, Nicole asks her to take everything out of her purse. Sonia pulls out a gun, and after initially threatening to shoot Nicole, she shoots Clouseau, but the bullet hits the medal of honor. After a chase, Sonia threatens to destroy the Pink Panther, and Clouseau goads her to do so. Clouseau reveals he exchanged the real gem with a fake, which the Tornado, an expert, would have known; therefore, his suicide note was forged, and he was murdered. He reveals that he had given Sonia's car a ticket two days before the Pink Panther was stolen, contradicting her alibi of having been delayed to the crime scene because of her flight. Dreyfus tries to claim credit for having appointed Clouseau to his parking job, but Clouseau, remembering Dreyfus told him to deny this to anyone who asked, rebukes the claim. Clouseau later marries Nicole with Inspector Dreyfus performing the ceremony.The film ends with the wedding in complete chaos, with Clouseau and Nicole escaping as the animated Pink Panther watches; he then goes to close the doors and winks at the camera.", "output": "Question: Who is Clouseau's partner?, Answer: Ponton, Question: Dreyfus tries to take credit for appointing Clouseau to what job?, Answer: A parking attendent., Question: What does Sonya pull out of her purse after being told to empty it?, Answer: A gun., Question: From what task Inspector Clouseau is reassigned?, Answer: Parking officer, Question: When trying to shoot Clouseau, what does the bullet hit instead?, Answer: A medal of honor., Question: What does France assembles a Dream Team of to solve the case?, Answer: Amateur Detectives, Question: What does the master thief, Tornado steals from around the world?, Answer: Expensive artifacts, Question: Who performed Clouseau and Nicole's wedding ceremony?, Answer: Inspector Dreyfus, Question: What was Sonia's alibi for being late to the crime scene?, Answer: Her flight, Question: Who was not invited to the Dream Team celebration?, Answer: Clouseau, Question: Why was Clouseau banned from the restaurant?, Answer: for burning it down, Question: Who escapes in the wedding scene with Nicole?, Answer: Clouseau, Question: What item does Tornado steal from The Pope?, Answer: Ring", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

According to him the root cause of the problem is Virumaandi (Kamal Haasan) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the happy go lucky rogue. His support to Kothala Thevar in his clash against Nallama Naicker (Napoleon) brings about a bonding between the two. Annalakshmi (Abhirami), the niece of Thevar falls for Virumaandi.

A clash between Virumaandi and Thevar takes places in which 24 innocent people are killed.Now it's Virumaandi's turn to tell his version of the story. He was in Singapore with a manual job. He took the blame for his cousin's fault and was sent home. His only relative was his grand mother, who did natural farming without artificial fertilisers and deep bore wells. Kothala Thevar had a silent eye on the fertile land owned by Virumaandi, as it had the only underground water availability. He treats Virumandi as his nephew. Virumandi falls in love with Annalakshmi at the Jallikattu. That night his grandmother passes away and 2 days later an attempt is made on his life. Annalakshmi finds him and admits him in the hospital to save his life. Gradually she falls in love with him. She taught him to apologize and that forgiveness is a virtue. A clash at the Panchayata infuriates Annalakshmi and she asks Virumaandi to apologize to the elders whom he insulted. He goes to apologize at night but Thevar and his men, thinking he has gone to take revenge, come in groups and hack down innocents to death. Thevar uses his clout to get out of the murder charge but Virumaandi who was involved in the bloodbath is disturbed because he had to lie to save Thevar and his kin. As part of the penance he wills his land for the villagers. Annalakshmi asks him to marry her and leave the village. He marries her at the village temple and goes away in the night with the girl and stays with his aunt whose son he helped. Thevar's men come when virumandi was away and abduct Annalakshmi and forcibly get her married to Thevar's nephew. This is to ensure that Annalakshmi's property does not go to Virumaandi. Annalakshmi commits suicide. Virumaandi takes revenge by hacking Thevar's 4 men to death . Thevar escapes. Nallama Naicker gives refuge to Virumaandi and sends him off to Chennai. Thevar and his men ask Nallama Naicker to hand over Virumaandi. A battle ensues in which Nallama Naicker is killed. The case goes to court. Virumaandi turns up in court. He finds all evidence is framed against him. He is convicted of having raped Annalakshmi and killing her and later on killing 26 men of Thevar who inquired into the rape.Angela Kathamuthu's cameraman discreetly shoots the deputy jailor conspiring with wardens and convicts to bump off the chief jailor (Nassar).

Outside, Det. Jim McLeod (Kirk Douglas) is sharing a romantic moment with his wife Mary (Eleanor Parker), and they discuss the children they are planning to have. McLeod returns to the precinct to process a young embezzler named Arthur Kindred (William Reynolds).McLeod then encounters Endicott Sims (Warner Anderson), lawyer of \"Dutchman\" Karl Schneider (George Macready), a New Jersey doctor who has had his license revoked and is now wanted on murder charges. Sims informs Lieutenant Monaghan (Horace McMahon) that Schneider wants to turn himself in to avoid the wrath of McLeod, who has apparently been conducting an ongoing hate campaign against the doctor, who is known to perform abortions. McLeod professes his hatred of Schneider, and in fact all criminals, lamenting that the law merely \"coddles them.\"Two burglars, Charley Gennini (Joseph Wiseman) and Lewis Abbott (Michael Strong), are brought in next. With the help of his partner Lou Brody (William Bendix), McLeod interrogates the men and manages to turn Abbott against Gennini. Further investigation proves that Gennini essentially makes a living out of thievery. When his record comes in, it turns out that he has done far worse than stealing.When Schneider arrives with Sims, McLeod taunts him, then explains that the doctor's assistant, Miss Hatch (Gladys George), has implicated Schneider and will pick him out of a line-up. To McLeod's disgust, Schneider has bribed Hatch with a fur stole, and she fails to identify him. McLeod explodes and calls Hatch a liar before dismissing her. He admits to reporter Joe Feinson (Luis Van Rooten) that his hatred for his father and \"his criminal mind\" (who drove his wife to a lunatic asylum) is what fuels his crusade against evil-doers.McLeod starts to take Schneider to Bellevue Hospital where a young victim of Schneider's work is being treated. However, on the way he is told that she has died and without her identification, there is no case against Schneider. As they head back to the precinct, Schneider threatens McLeod with information he claims to have on the detective, taunting him that he has a lot of pull in high places. McLeod responds by slapping and punching Schneider, who collapses. As an ambulance is called, Schneider mentions the name \"Giacoppetti\" and a woman to Lt. Monaghan, which presumably has something to do with McLeod. When Sims comes by to protest his client's treatment, he inadvertently reveals\u00e2\u0080\u0094only in the presence of Monaghan\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the woman is Mary McLeod.Arthur's boss, Albert R. Pritchett (James Maloney), comes to the precinct to file charges against Arthur. A family friend, Susan (Cathy O'Donnell), arrives and gives Pritchett $120 she scraped together, hoping no charges are filed against Arthur. McLeod tries to dissuade Susan, but she pleads with Pritchett, swearing that the funds will be repaid the next day. Arthur stole the money to pay for a dinner date with an old flame, Susan's beautiful sister, in a vain attempt to rekindle her interest in him. Brody sympathizes with Arthur because the young man had served in the U.S. Navy during the war, and was about the same age as Brody's son, who died on the USS\u00c2\u00a0Juneau in 1942. Brody talks Pritchett into accepting Susan's money but McLeod, who is angered by Brody's interference, essentially bullies Pritchett into filing charges, stating that a first offender always becomes a repeat offender (using Gennini as an example), and no mercy should be shown.Mary McLeod is asked to come to the station by Lt. Monaghan, who in the privacy of his office inquires about her relationship with Giacoppetti, a racketeer, or Schneider. She denies knowing them, but when Giacoppetti walks in and greets her, she bursts into tears. Giacoppetti, pressured by Monaghan, admits that Mary had gotten pregnant while they dated and gone to Dr. Schneider for an abortion. Mary confesses to her husband and asks his forgiveness. McLeod brutally responds that he'd rather die than find out his wife is \"a tramp,\" and asks if her infertility was caused by Schneider's abortion. Stunned and severely hurt by Jim's reaction, Mary leaves in tears.Susan professes her love for Arthur. The shoplifter is permitted to leave. McLeod, meantime, urged by Brody and Feinson to forgive his wife, tries to curb his anger. Mary returns to the station to say goodbye to McLeod and he pleads with her to stay. Mary relents, but after a snide comment made by Sims about Mary's love life, McLeod falls back on his anger and asks how many men there were before he met her, admitting he cannot wash away the \"dirty pictures\" in his mind. Calling him cruel and vengeful, she leaves McLeod for good, not wanting to be \"driven to a lunatic asylum.\"Gennini, taking advantage of the commotion started when a victim runs into the station yelling she's been robbed, grabs a gun from a policeman's holster and shoots McLeod when he deliberately advances on him. McLeod, in his dying words, asks for his wife's forgiveness and has Brody tear up the charges against Arthur Kindred. McLeod then begins an Act of Contrition, which Brody finishes after McLeod dies. A distressed Brody then releases Arthur while admonishing him \"not to make a monkey out of me.\" Arthur and Susan leave as Monaghan calls for a priest and Joe calls his newspaper to inform them of McLeod's death.", "output": "Question: Who is angered by Brody's interference?, Answer: McLeod, Question: Where is McLeod taking Schneider in the beginning?, Answer: McLeod is taking Schneider to the hospital, Question: What can McLeod not wash from his mind?, Answer: Dirty pictures, Question: Who does Brody release?, Answer: Arthur, Question: Who releases Arthur?, Answer: Brody., Question: How much money is Arthur given not to press charges?, Answer: $120, Question: Is McLeod married?, Answer: Yes., Question: Who made a snide comment about Mary's love life?, Answer: Sims, Question: which station was Mary McLeod asked to come to?, Answer: Lt.

Upset at these turn of events, the cat's eyes fall on a bottle of plant fertilizer called 'Jumbo-Gro.' The cat then gives some to the canary, and it grows to an enormous size.

To impress his sceptical son Prateek (Armaan Verma), and upon the request of his wife Sonia (Kareena Kapoor), Shekhar uses his son's idea that the antagonist should be more powerful than the protagonist. His colleague, computer programmer Jenny (Shahana Goswami), uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One (Shah Rukh Khan) (Technically Good One and in Hindi Jeevan, which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically Random Access Version One and in Hindi Ravan, a mythical demon)[4] is made faceless. Another colleague, Akashi (Tom Wu), implements the characters' movements. The game, named Ra.One, contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a special device \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the H.A.R.T (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.When Ra.One undergoes final tests, Akashi notices unusual glitches but chooses to ignore them. When the game is officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID Lucifer and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Akashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a wireless technology (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the mainframe to malfunction. Akashi informs Shekhar, who partially understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Meanwhile, Ra.One murders Akashi and assumes his appearance; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes it look like a car accident.Sonia, devastated after Shekhar's death, tells Prateek that the family will return to India after Shekhar's funeral. A suspicious Prateek notices digital patterns on the fateful road and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He convinces Jenny of the same when they see the destroyed game laboratory, and the latter tries to bring G.One into the real world. Meanwhile, Ra.One, having taken the form of Akashi, kills Akashi's mother viciously at his family home and chases the family on their way to the airport, but G.One enters the real world and causes a gas explosion which temporarily destroys Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T. and accompanies the family to Mumbai after Sonia realises that she needs him.Subsequently, Ra.One returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model (Arjun Rampal), and tracks down G.One to Prateek's birthday party. Hypnotising Sonia, he assumes her form to kidnap Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in a malfunctioning local train. The train crashes into the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus, but G.One saves Sonia in time. To save Prateek, he returns to the virtual world and fights Ra.One; both reach the third level, the former left with little power. G.One tricks Ra.One into shooting him without his H.A.R.T. attached, leaving Ra.One helpless; furious, the latter creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to identify the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote Shekhar: \"If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you\". The duo realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him, absorbs Ra.One's remains and disappears.Six months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where the former manages to restore G.One to the real world.", "output": "Question: How is the game created by Shekhar?, Answer: He adopts an idea of his son's and collaborates with his colleagues., Question: Is Shakhar's son satisfied with the game?, Answer: After the game's official launch, yes., Question: Who faces criticism from Shekhar's son?, Answer: Prateek, Shekhar's son, is skeptical of his father's ability.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Prayers for him reach Heaven, where Clarence Odbody, Angel 2nd Class, is assigned to save George in order to earn his angel wings. To prepare Clarence, his superior Joseph shows flashbacks of George's life.In 1919, 12-year-old George saves his younger brother Harry, who falls through the ice on a frozen pond, from drowning: this heroic act results in George losing his hearing in one ear. One day while working after school at the local drug store, he catches a deadly mistake made by his boss Mr. Gower, who had gotten himself drunk after news of the death of his son in the flu epidemic and accidentally poisoned a prescription.On Harry's graduation night in 1928, George (James Stewart) discusses his dreams of travel and building things with Mary Hatch (Donna Reed), who has had a crush on him from an early age. After the sudden death of his father, George postpones his plans in order to sort out the affairs of the family business, Bailey Brothers' Building and Loan, a longtime adversary to Henry F. Potter, a greedy banker who is the richest man in town. Potter wishes to dissolve the Building and Loan, which has been preventing him from controlling the entire town. George convinces the board of directors to vote against Potter, which they will do under the condition that George succeed his father, running the business along with his absent-minded uncle William \"Billy\" (Thomas Mitchell). He gives his college money to Harry, under the agreement that George will attend college after Harry graduates, whereupon Harry will assume the presidency of the Bailey Building &amp; Loan.When Harry graduates, he brings home a wife, whose father has offered Harry a job. Although Harry vows to decline the offer for the sake of their earlier agreement, George cannot deny him such a great opportunity and keeps running the Building and Loan. George and Mary get married and plan a dream honeymoon, having saved up enough money, but on the way out of town witness a run on the bank and use the money to lend financial support until the bank reopens.George builds Bailey Park, which offers houses affordable to lower-middle income families who would otherwise have to live in Potter's overpriced apartments. Mary and George welcome the Martinis, a family of Italian immigrants who just bought of one the houses, and have a traditional blessing ceremony. Potter, frustrated at losing control of the housing market, attempts to lure George into becoming his assistant with a huge salary and the prospect of business trips to Europe, appealing to his yearning to travel. George is tempted, but rejects the offer.During World War II, George is ineligible for service because of his bad ear, and instead leads a recycling campaign to collect metal and rubber for the war effort. Harry, however, becomes a Navy flier and is awarded the Medal of Honor, having intercepted a kamikaze that would have bombed an amphibious transport. On Christmas Eve morning 1945, the town prepares a hero's welcome for Harry. Uncle Billy goes to Potter's bank to deposit $8,000 for the Building and Loan. After bragging to Potter about Harry, Potter angrily grabs the newspaper from Billy along with the $8,000. Realizing the potential scandal would lead to the Building and Loan's downfall, Potter secretly hides the money.When Uncle Billy cannot find the money, he and George frantically search for it. When the bank examiner arrives to review their records, Uncle Billy panics. George berates his uncle for endangering the Building and Loan, goes home and takes out his frustration on his family. He apologizes to his frightened wife and children, then leaves.George with his guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers)Desperate, George appeals to Potter for a loan. When George claims a life insurance policy as collateral, Potter mockingly says George is worth \"more dead than alive\". George gets drunk at a local bar, and gets in a fight with the husband of one of his children's teachers (on whom George had unleashed a phone tirade earlier). Mr. Martini, the owner of the bar, ejects George's attacker, but cannot catch up to George, who has driven away and crashes his car into a big tree. He staggers to a nearby bridge to commit suicide. Unbeknownst to him, Clarence has been watching him from the shadows.Before he can jump, Clarence jumps in the river and pretends to be drowning. George rescues him, but does not believe Clarence's claim to be George's guardian angel. When George wishes he had never been born, Clarence grants his unintentional wish, creating an alternate universe in which George never existed: Bedford Falls is now named Pottersville and is filled with cocktail bars, casinos, and gentlemen's clubs; Mr. Gower has recently been released from prison for manslaughter, having put the poison in the pills because George was not there to catch his mistake; The Building and Loan is defunct, as George never took over after Mr. Bailey's passing. George's friends Ernie, a cab driver, Bert, a policeman, and Nick, a bartender, exist in this reality, but are darker individuals than the good friends he knew, suggesting George was a positive force in their lives.George runs to see his own mother, who does not recognize him. She reveals that Uncle Billy was institutionalized after the collapse of the Building and Loan. In the cemetery where Bailey Park would have been, George discovers the grave of his brother. Clarence says the soldiers on the transport all died, as Harry was never there to save them, as George had never saved Harry from drowning. Clarence then explains how George single-handedly prevented this dire fate. He, and he alone, kept Potter in check, preventing the town from descending into squalor and vice. Mary never married, and became the local librarian. When George claims he is her husband, she considers him a stalker and screams for the police, causing George to flee and Bert to give chase.George runs back to the bridge and begs for his life back. His prayer is answered, as Bert catches up to him, but only to say he was glad he found George as everyone was worried about him. George runs through the town joyously, wishing everyone he sees a merry Christmas, and is fine with his forthcoming arrest when he comes home. Mary and Uncle Billy arrive, having rallied the townspeople, who donate more than enough to cover the deficit and for Potter's warrant to be torn up. Harry arrives and toasts George, calling him \"the richest man in town.\" A bell on the Christmas tree rings, and his daughter recalls the story that it means an angel has just earned his wings.

Thompson then flashes back to a series of exploits involving the author and his attorney.In 1968, Lazlo is fighting to stop a group of San Francisco youngsters from receiving harsh prison sentences for possession of marijuana. He convinces Thompson to write an article about it for Blast Magazine. Thompson's editor, Marty Lewis, reminds Thompson that he has 19 hours to deadline. The judge hands out stiff sentences to everyone, and the last client is a young man who was caught with a pound of marijuana and receives a five-year sentence. Lazlo reacts by attacking the prosecuting attorney and is then jailed for contempt of court.The magazine story about the trial is a sensation, but Thompson does not hear from Lazlo until four years later, when Thompson is on assignment covering Super Bowl VI in Los Angeles.[2] Lazlo appears at Thompson's hotel and convinces him to abandon the Super Bowl story and join his band of freedom fighters, which involves smuggling weapons to an unnamed Latin American country. Thompson goes along with Lazlo and the revolutionaries to a remote airstrip where a small airplane is to be loaded with weapons, but when a police helicopter finds them, Lazlo and his henchmen escape on the plane while Thompson refuses to follow.Thompson's fame and fortune continues. He is a hit on the college lecture circuit and covers the 1972 presidential election campaign. After being thrown off the journalist plane by The Candidate's press secretary, Thompson takes the crew plane and gives straight-laced journalist Harris from the Post a strong hallucinogenic drug and steals his clothes and press credentials.

The film starts with a tongue-in-cheek flashback with Fairbanks as D'Artagnan (with broad winks at the audience), fighting and defeating a tavern-full of swordsmen just to return a mysterious lady's handkerchief. Through a lap-dissolve, d'Artagnan becomes the modern Kansan Ned Thacker, who was born during a tornado and whose mother read him swashbuckling novels while in the womb. After several episodes where Ned gets into trouble trying to defend women (and a cute cameo by Zasu Pitts), we meet Marjorie Daw, whose mother wants her to marry the rich sleazeball Forrest Vandeteer. They run into trouble on a cross-country automobile trip, and are rescued by Fairbanks when he converts his Ford into a railcar to cross a desert washout. At the El Tovar hotel, we meet the villainous Navajo Chin-de-dah, who lives in a secret cliff-house deep in the Grand Canyon, who leads Forrest and Marjorie to his lair with \"forced marriage\" on his mind. With the assistance of one of Chin-de-dah's henchmen, Ned Thacker descends the cliffs on a rope and effects a rescue. While the villain is a very unfortunate Indian stereotype, the footage of the Grand Canyon and Canyon de Chelly is spectacular, and taken in the spirit it was intended, this is a fun, somewhat carelessly constructed romp, and a good example of why Douglas Fairbanks was so popular. In the surviving material shown at the Buster Keaton Festival, some confusion is caused when Forrest Vandeteer's name changes to Forrest Barris part way through, probably because of a difference in the source material.", "output": "Question: Who made a cameo?, Answer: Zasu Pitts, Question: Who helps Ned Thacker?, Answer: Chin-de-dah's henchmen, Question: What did Forrest name changed to?, Answer: Forrest Barris, Question: Where does Navajo Chin-de-dah live?, Answer: Lives in a secret cliff-house deep in the Grand Canyon, Question: Who is known as a rich sleazeball?, Answer: Forrest Vandeteer, Question: When will the DVD be available?, Answer: 2008", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

This is a buddy movie between two friends Chris and Caz who run a pirate radio station from a tower block in Dalston, East London. The film starts with a murder of their friend TJ while cruising for sex in the local park at night and, while Caz is cut up by the death of his friend, Chris seems to want to push forward towards a professional career in commercial radio. They both want to promote soul music while the prevailing popular music is punk.Chris meets Tracy at the recording studio and persuades her to get his audition tape heard but he is not ready to sell out his identity to get a job in the mainstream. Caz meets a punk Billibud who talks about communism and the Socialist Workers Party, while wearing (admittedly nicked) Vivienne Westwood designer T-shirts. The murder and the different paths they seem to be taking causes tension between the buddies Chris and Caz.Chris discovers that he has a tape recorded of the murder but fails to hand it in as evidence. He is then pulled in by the police as a suspect because he was in possession of TJ's cassette radio. He tries to call Caz but Caz is busy with his new boyfriend and trying to get a bigger aerial for their pirate radio station. He calls Tracy and she helps him to get a solicitor. He tells her about the tape and she advises him to hand it in as evidence, but again, he puts this off.Chris and Caz have their showdown on the roof of the tower block and Chris nearly falls off the roof. He then meets Tracy and she persuades him to send the tape to the police, but not before he has made a copy. They then make love on a rooftop.On the day of the Silver Jubilee celebrations Caz and Billibud go to the street fair, where Billibud is attacked by the local skinheads. Caz and Billibud return home and make love. That evening Chris goes to the radio station but Caz is not there and the studio has been vandalised. He starts broadcasting 'Funk the Jubilee' but it is not the same without his partner Caz. He then is attacked by TJ's murderer who turns out to be someone he and Caz had thought of as a friend. He escapes but can't find Caz.The grand reckoning is at an open air disco in the park where TJ was murdered. Caz and Billibud are MC's and Chris is trying to get to them to warn them that there is going to be trouble from TJ's murderer. A Molotov cocktail is thrown onto the stage and while Caz and Billibud try to save the vinyl records, Chris puts on the tape of TJ's murder, which brings him out and onto the stage where he falls to his death in the inferno of his own creation.There is a bitter-sweet background of the racial and sexual tensions of the British 1970's, with skinheads hassling Chris and Caz, local white's making snide remarks about how things have changed since they were young and blacks who are unable to decide if they hate whites, mixed-race people or 'batty boys' most. Yet, to balance this, the youth in the clubs are enjoying the music, drinking, dancing and bonking inter-racially and without strong prejudices about gay men kissing in clubs.The final scene with the main characters cleaning the records, the reconciliation of the two DJ buddies and the one-by-one each of the friends joining into dance together is very life-affirming.", "output": "Question: Who was murdered at an open air disco?, Answer: TJ, Question: Who is hassled by skinheads?, Answer: Chris and Caz, Question: Who talks about communism and the socialist worker party?, Answer: Billibud, Question: What does Tracy help Chris to acquire for his legal trouble?, Answer: solicitor, Question: What type of music do Chaz and Chris both want to promote?, Answer: Soul music, Question: What does Chris broadcast?, Answer: Funk the Jubilee, Question: What does Chris possess that is evidence of the murder?, Answer: tape recorded, Question: Where is Billibud attacked by the local skinheads?, Answer: Street fair, Question: What is the background for the plot of the movie?, Answer: Silver Jubilee, Question: When does the sorry take place?, Answer: 1970s", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

He is at work with Alice, but when Julie asks him he lies and says he is alone. Julie responds that he pisses her off. Later that night, Isma\u00c3\u00abl runs into Julie on his way home. They discuss Julie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frustrations about their relationship and eventually, already in their apartment, become reconciled. Shortly afterwards Alice arrives; they all get into bed together, read a different book each and fight about each one's place in bed.The next day Julie and Isma\u00c3\u00abl have breakfast with Julie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family; Julie gets frustrated and leaves for the kitchen, followed by her older sister, Jeanne. Julie tells Jeanne and later her mother about Alice and the threesome. In the night, after Isma\u00c3\u00abl, Julie and Alice leave a bar where they were eating, Julie starts complaining about Isma\u00c3\u00abl's relationship with Alice; Isma\u00c3\u00abl responds that so is she and that she is the only one he loves, Alice tells them that she is only there to bring them together. They go to a concert where Alice befriends a guy named Gwendal. Julie starts feeling bad, so she and Isma\u00c3\u00abl decide to leave. Julie goes out of the building while Isma\u00c3\u00abl gets their stuff; when he comes outside he finds Julie unconscious on the floor while a woman performs CPR on her. The police arrive and question Isma\u00c3\u00abl while paramedics attend to Julie. One of the paramedics talks to a police officer who then goes back to the car in which Isma\u00c3\u00abl is sitting and over the radio reports Julie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.Going to work, Isma\u00c3\u00abl runs into Jeanne on her way to the apartment to pick some of Julie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothes up, after an argument about why she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell him first, Isma\u00c3\u00abl gives her his keys. At work he tells about this Alice who doesn't like it; they argue then comfort each other. Since Jeanne is staying in Isma\u00c3\u00abl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment he doesn't want to spend the night there and Alice takes him to Gwendal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment.Isma\u00c3\u00abl spends the entire night awake; in the morning he meets Erwann, Gwendal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger brother, who before leaving for school offers him his room so he can sleep in his bed. When Erwann returns and wakes Isma\u00c3\u00abl up he borrows some clean clothes from Erwann and leaves for work. When he returns from it he is secretly followed then met by Erwann who asks him if he can go home with him; Isma\u00c3\u00abl rejects this. He gets to his apartment to find Jeanne still there, which annoys him and he goes to Erwann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment to spend the night there again.At a lunch with Julie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family next day Isma\u00c3\u00abl rejects an offer to her life insurance money from her father. At night he takes Maude, a waitress from the bar he used to go to with Julie and Alice, for a one-night stand to his apartment.They wake up at noon to realize that Jeanne is present: Isma\u00c3\u00abl leaves and Jeanne is disappointed when she finds out the girl is not Alice. Isma\u00c3\u00abl goes to work to find Erwann waiting for him; he tells Erwann that he is flattered by his attention but neither interested nor in need of him. Alice, having broken up with Gwendal, thinks Erwan had been sent there to pick up their apartment keys; she gives them to Isma\u00c3\u00abl to pass them on to Erwann. Leaving work Isma\u00c3\u00abl finds Erwann waiting for him again; he gives him the keys then takes them back and they both go to Isma\u00c3\u00abl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment. Meanwhile, Alice receives a phone call from Julie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother; the two of them meet at a restaurant, where Julie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother asks her to take care of Isma\u00c3\u00abl. Jasmine, Julie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other sister, comes to tell her mother that her father is upset that she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t at home so late at night, so she leaves, leaving Alice and Jasmine talking alone for a while.In Isma\u00c3\u00abl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment he and Erwann make love; in the morning Jeanne finds them in bed together and leaves again. Isma\u00c3\u00abl follows her; Jeanne says that now she understands why he and Julie were in a threesome with Alice and why he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to have kids; they argue until Isma\u00c3\u00abl leaves. Erwann goes to look for Isma\u00c3\u00abl in his office, but not finding him talks to Alice, who asks him when he is leaving whether he and Isma\u00c3\u00abl are together, to which he replies that he hopes so. Isma\u00c3\u00abl is in the meantime in the cemetery visiting Julie's grave; the following song is sung as if by Julie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ghost, asking Isma\u00c3\u00abl why it had taken him so long to visit her. After leaving the cemetery Isma\u00c3\u00abl walks despondently through the city and gets drunk; Alice comes across him and takes him to Erwann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment.

His wife, Katie (Sandy Duncan) gets a recipe for applesauce wrong and gives it to her husband to take to work for lunch, hoping it will help cut down on the budget. In a humorous chain reaction, the duck Albert is testing steals the applesauce after Albert has thrown it away in the trash, and then wanders into a radiation lab and becomes irradiated. Albert is ordered to get rid of the duck, so he figures he can give it to his son, Jimmy (Lee Montgomery) who has been wanting a pet, only to discover it now lays golden eggs.In a Pavlovian manner, the duck, named \"Charlie\" (despite being female), lays an egg when prompted by the barking of a dog. At first, the only ones who know of Charlie's golden yolks are Albert, Katie, Jimmy and Albert's friend, Fred, but as they sell the yolks of gold, they gain the attention of a suspicious neighbor, a government bureaucrat named Mr. Hooper (Joe Flynn), who starts spying on them (with typical Disney slapstick results such as falling off a tree branch when) his wife gets angry, and ultimately convinces his boss, Rutledge (James Gregory), to get the duck after worldwide phone calls spread the rumor and Rutledge gets a phone call from President Richard Nixon to \"get that duck!\". Albert is overcome by greed and no longer cares for his son, which saddens Jimmy. The FBI soon arrives at the house and orders them to turn over the duck. Jimmy, watching from upstairs, climbs out the window with Charlie, and then rides off with a couple of teenage boys and their hot rod as the FBI try to capture the duck to prevent it from laying gold.In the film's climax, Jimmy is suspended on a ladder between two parking garages, and Albert attempts to convince his son to grab his hand before the ladder falls. Jimmy tells his dad to \"go away\", believing he only wants to save Charlie, but when the ladder begins to break, he grows fearful and grabs his father's hand. They then leave the parking garage, but Albert is promptly arrested by the FBI. The film ends with the family in court, and the judge breaks an egg into a glass after Mr. Hooper barks at the duck to prompt the laying of the egg, which surprisingly turns out to be an ordinary egg yolk, as a result of Mr. Hooper barking at it in the wrong tone. The judge dismisses the charges on account of no proof of a duck laying golden eggs, and Albert tells the family the golden duck was nice while it lasted, but at least they can keep the duck for their pet, now realizing that his family is more important than wealth. The judge then advises Jimmy, \"One word of caution, son.

After days afloat, Kearney, a sailor who has been sent with them, tries to kill the boy because of his excessive crying. Sarah angrily beats Kearney to death with a harpoon and dumps his body overboard. The trio arrives at and is stranded on a beautiful tropical island in the South Pacific. Sarah tries to raise them to be civilized, but soon gives up, as the orphaned boy Richard was born and raised by young lovers on this same island, and he influences the widow's daughter Lilli. They grow up, and Sarah educates them from the Bible, as well as from her own knowledge, including the facts of life. She cautiously demands the children never to go to the forbidden side of the island.When Richard and Lilli are about eight, Sarah dies from pneumonia, leaving them to fend for themselves. Sarah is buried on a scenic promontory overlooking the tidal reef area. Together, the children survive solely on their resourcefulness, and the bounty of their remote paradise. Years later, both Richard and Lilli grow into strong and beautiful teenagers. They live in a house on the beach and spend their days together fishing, swimming, and exploring the island. Both their bodies mature and develop, and they are physically attracted to each other. Richard lets Lilli win the child's game Easter egg hunt and dives to find Lilli an adult's pearl as her reward. His penchant for racing a lagoon shark sparks a domestic quarrel; Lilli thinks he is foolhardy, but the liveliness makes Richard feel virile.Lilli awakens in the morning with her first menstrual period, just as Sarah described the threshold of womanhood. Richard awakens in the morning with an erection, and suffers a nasty mood swing, which he cannot explain. They then get into an argument regarding privacy and their late mother's rules. One night, Richard goes off to the forbidden side of the island, and discovers that a group of natives from another island use the shrine of an impressive, Kon-Tiki-like idol to sacrifice conquered enemies every full moon. Richard camouflages himself with mud and hides in the muck; meanwhile, Lilli worries about his disappearance. Richard escapes unscathed, though he is seen by a lone native. Ultimately, after making up for their fight, Richard and Lilli discover natural love and passion, which deepens their emotional bond. They fall in love, and exchange formal wedding vows and rings in the middle of the jungle. They consummate their new-found feelings for each other for the next several months.Soon after, a ship arrives at the island, carrying unruly sailors, a proud captain, and his beautiful but spoiled daughter, Sylvia Hilliard. The party is welcomed by the young couple, and they ask to be taken back to civilization, after many years in isolation. Sylvia tries to steal Richard from Lilli and seduce him, but as tempted as he is by her strange ways, he realizes that Lilli is his heart and soul, upsetting Sylvia. Richard angrily leaves Sylvia behind in the middle of the fish pond, in plain view of the landing party. Meanwhile, a sailor ogles Lilli in her bath and drags her back to the house. He tries to rape her and steal her pearl, before Richard comes to her rescue. The sailor opens fire on Richard who flees. Richard lures the sailor to his death in the jaws of the shark in the tidal reef area. Upon returning, he apologizes to Lilli for hurting her and she reveals that she is pregnant. She tells him that if he wants to leave, then she won't stop him, but that she wants to raise their child away from civilization, and from guns. They decide to stay and raise their child on the island, as they feel their blissful life would not compare to civilization.

Neff knows she means murder and wants no part of it.Phyllis pursues Neff to his own home, and persuades him that the two of them, together, should kill her husband. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and comes up with a plan in which Phyllis's husband will die an unlikely death, in this case being thrown from a train. Pacific All-Risk will therefore be required, by the \"double indemnity\" clause in the insurance policy, to pay the widow twice the normal amount.Keyes, a tenacious investigator, does not suspect foul play at first, but eventually concludes that the Dietrichson woman and an unknown accomplice must be behind the husband's death. He has no reason to be suspicious of Neff, someone he has worked with for quite some time and admires.Neff is not only worried about Keyes. The victim's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather), comes to him convinced that her stepmother, Phyllis is behind her father's death because her mother also died under suspicious circumstances when she was her nurse. Neff begins to care about what might happen to Lola, both of whose parents have been murdered. It is for this reason Phyllis wants her killed because she had suspected her of murdering her parents in the first place.Then he learns Phyllis is seeing Lola's boyfriend, Nino, behind his back. Trying to save himself and no longer caring about the money, Neff believes the only way out is to make the police think Phyllis and Lola's boyfriend did the murder, which is what Keyes now believes anyway. However, when Neff and Phyllis meet, she tells him she has been seeing Lola's boyfriend only to provoke him into killing the suspicious Lola in a jealous rage. Neff, now wholly disgusted, is about to kill Phyllis when she shoots him first. Neff is badly wounded but still standing and walks towards her, telling her to shoot again. Phyllis does not shoot and he takes the gun from her. She says she never loved him or anyone else and had been using him all along, \"until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot.\" Neff coldly says he does not believe this new ploy. Phyllis hugs him tightly but then pulls away and looks up at him, startled that he has not responded. Neff says \"Goodbye, baby,\" then shoots and kills her. Before leaving, he convinces Nino to not go inside because Phyllis was responsibile for trying to break up him and Lola. Neff convinces him that she still loves him and she's waiting for him to call her. Nino reluctantly agrees to call Lola and takes his quarter.Neff drives to his office where he dictates his full confession to Keyes, who arrives and hears enough of the confession to understand everything. Neff tells Keyes he is going to Mexico rather than face a death sentence but collapses to the floor before he can reach the elevator.[edit] Alternate endingWilder shot an alternate ending to the film (to appease censors), featuring Neff paying for his crime by going to the gas chamber.

He wears a white badge on his shirt that says \"happy birthday\" in Chinese characters.The first scene opens on a butterfly perched on a somewhat puzzling structure; the boy, inside, is singing. When he comes out, the camera pulls back to show that the puzzling structure is the wreck of a plane that crashed into a building.Manuk makes his way through the village to a railroad track, where he puts his ear to the rail to listen for a train. Evidently he hears one coming; he lays a bolt taken from the plane on the rail, where the train flattens it. The train is hauling tanks.The boy picks up the flattened bolt and finds that it's been magnetized. He continues to a spot that overlooks the tracks. Seeing war planes in the distance, he pretends to shoot at them, exchanges a few urgent words with an imagined fellow soldier -- \"Dad\" -- and throws a rock grenade that hits a postman on a bicycle.Arriving home at last, Manuk opens a package he finds on the porch. He pulls out a worn wallet containing a picture of himself and a young man, a set of dog tags, and a boot. There's no sign that the boy understands what it means that these objects have been sent home. He puts on the dog tags and engages in more soldier-play.Indoors, the boy plays with toys -- mostly war-themed -- that he seems to have made himself. Sprawled on the floor, he falls asleep.

Riggs is a former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier who lost his wife in a car accident two years prior and has turned suicidal, and has been taking his anger out on suspects, leading to his superiors requesting his transfer. Murtaugh and Riggs quickly find themselves at odds with each other.Murtaugh is contacted by Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), an old Vietnam War buddy turned banker, but before they can meet, Murtaugh learns that Hunsaker's daughter, Amanda, apparently committed suicide by jumping to her death from her apartment balcony. Autopsy reports show Amanda to have been poisoned with drain cleaner, making the case a possible homicide. Hunsaker tells Murtaugh that he was worried about his daughter's involvement in drugs, prostitution, and hardcore pornography and was trying to get Murtaugh to help her escape that lifestyle.Murtaugh and Riggs go to see Amanda's pimp, but find a drug lab on the premises, leading to a shootout. Riggs kills the pimp and saves Murtaugh's life, who starts to gain respect for his new partner. Though the case seems closed, Riggs is worried that the only witness to Amanda's apparent suicide was Dixie, another prostitute who was working well outside her normal streets. They go to see her at her home but it explodes as they approach it. Riggs finds parts of a mercury switch from bomb debris, indicating a professional had set the bomb; children that had been nearby witnessed a man approach the house with a Special Forces tattoo similar to Riggs', and Murtaugh suspects Hunsaker knows more than he has let on.The two approach Hunsaker before Amanda's funeral, where he reveals that he had previously been part of \"Shadow Company,\" a heroin-smuggling operation run by former special forces operators from the Vietnam War, masterminded by retired General Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) and his enigmatic right-hand man, Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey). Hunsaker had been laundering the money but wanted to get out, and when McAllister found out he contacted Murtaugh, he had Amanda killed. As they talk, Joshua arrives in a helicopter and kills Hunsaker. Shadow Company attempts to kill Riggs in a drive-by shooting, but he is saved by a bullet-proof vest. Murtaugh and Riggs fake his death to gain the upper hand.Shadow Company later kidnaps Murtaugh's daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) and demand Murtaugh turn himself over to them for her return. Murtaugh and Riggs plan an ambush at the exchange at El Mirage Lake with Riggs providing sniper support, but Riggs is caught by McAllister and all three are taken to an unknown location. Murtaugh and Riggs are tortured for information, but Riggs manages to overpower his captors, frees Murtaugh and Rianne, and escape to find themselves at a busy nightclub used as a front for Shadow Company. Their cover blown, McAllister and Joshua attempt to flee separately. Joshua manages to get away, but McAllister ends up crashing his car on Hollywood Boulevard and is killed when a box of hand grenades in the car detonates. Murtaugh and Riggs race to Murtaugh's home, knowing Joshua will be after his family. They arrive in time to stop him, and Riggs overpowers him in a fist fight on the front lawn. As officers arrive to take Joshua away, he breaks his bonds and grabs for a gun, but both Murtaugh and Riggs quickly pull their guns and shoot him dead.After visiting his wife's grave, Riggs spends Christmas with the Murtaughs, having become close friends with Murtaugh and bonding with the rest of the family.
