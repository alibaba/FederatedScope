In my defense my phone didn\u2019t last as long thus battery life is very subjective to the loudness and if Bluetooth is use. I mostly connected the device via Bluetooth. Features: The main features that this speaker has are the micro sd card slot, and microphone built in. I used the speaker for offline use by transmitting music via bluetooth.

We bought this because the range on our handheld monitor just wasn't far enough to reach the backyard and the battery life was short so we had to bring the plug everywhere. We figured we'd get a camera we could monitor from our phones. This has AMAZING picture quality and I can clearly zoom in and see the baby breathing. However, you can't just leave the sound on all the time so you'd know if baby was crying at night and hear them. You have to physically open the app, make sure the sound is on and then you'd know if they're crying. That's a HUGE flaw for me... I'd prefer it continually run in the background so you can hear sound (don't need the picture all the time, just the sound)... I suppose you could possibly leave your phone on all night long and leave it on for sound but I'm sure that's not good for your phone...", "output": "2", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 428.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon.

Also able to go up to 2 weeks without recharging the batteries. The top of my unit got wet because of rain. The horn button seems fairly water-tight, but the top of the main unit's housing is another story. After 14 hours of drying-out there is still condensation inside the clear plastic covering of the solar panel. Also, horn electronics have shorted -- horn goes off randomly when plugged in or just produces an anemic chirp. There is also water leaking from the horn jack receptacle which entered through the solar panel cover. Leaving the unit in the sun all day doesn't recharge batteries, so I'm thinking the solar feature is more of a gimmick than anything useful. As a guesstimate, using the light with full-beam about 1 to 1.5 hours a week (with very liberal use of the horn whenever riding) requires the unit to be charged once every 2 weeks. A red light flashes when batteries are running low. Charging takes about 6 - 8 hours. As another nitpick, it's really annoying to cycle through 4 light modes just to turn the unit off. Depending on your riding style, the horn button clasp may be prone to slip when you press it. The horn clasp is a rubber band-like and not a bolt. Since most horn-light combos are like this, I wouldn't deduct points for this. Just something to be aware of. Overall it's a good light, but it's not rainproof or waterproof. And the solar panel feature is possibly a sales gimmick.

It heats up quickly (there are three heat settings), and has an auto-off after two hours. I also like the longer cord length, since there's not always an outlet handy when I need to use it.
