Thousands of immigrants took the oath of citizenship, realizing their dreams of becoming Americans. And one adorable baby, Fiona the hippopotamus, became a story of survival as she overcame the odds and tumbled into the world\u2019s heart. The stories provided some lighthearted moments amid a series of deadly mass shootings, terrorist attacks, hurricanes, wildfires, sexual harassment scandals and other tragic news in 2017. Here\u2019s a look at a few of the moving, unifying and just plain fun moments of 2017: YAY, SCIENCE! It seems nothing brought Americans together more than the first total solar eclipse to move across the U.S. in a century. For one moment in the middle of an August day, millions of people stopped what they were doing and gazed upward in wonder as the moon slipped over the sun \u2014 leaving a path of total darkness that stretched from Oregon to South Carolina. Some eclipse watchers sang, some danced and some were moved to tears. Kids thought it was pure magic, and people traveled to remote sections of the country to get the best glimpse. A study by the University of Michigan, requested by NASA, estimated that 215 million American adults \u2014 or 88 percent of the country\u2019s adult population \u2014 viewed the eclipse either directly or electronically. That\u2019s 104 million more than the 2017 Super Bowl. \u201cPeople were really just about nature, about this phenomenon that was happening,\u201d said Mamta Patel Nagaraja, who works on public engagement for NASA. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what color, creed, race, economic ladder you were on, people just went out and enjoyed it. \u201cIt transcended all the other things,\u201d she said. ___ #TEAMFIONA This little one wasn\u2019t expected to make it. Fiona, a Nile hippopotamus, was just 29 pounds (13 kilograms) when she was born prematurely in January. After early health scares, she\u2019s now thriving at more than 600 pounds (272 kilograms). This sassy girl has become a symbol of survival \u2014 and the star attraction at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. Fiona has captivated the masses and the Team Fiona craze isn\u2019t slowing down. She stars in her own internet video series. Tens of millions have gone online to watch her take a bottle, splash in the pool or learn to run. T-shirts bear her image. She\u2019s the subject of children\u2019s books. An ice cream flavor and local brew are named in her honor. She gets so many cards and letters that she has her own mail bin. Grown men will lean over the pool in their suits and ties to get close to her, said zoo director Thane Maynard. \u201cIt\u2019s Fiona\u2019s world, and we\u2019re just living in it,\u201d Maynard said. In her early, most vulnerable days, Fiona received letters and pictures from kids who were preemies themselves, urging her to stay strong. After nurses at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center helped care for the hippo, the zoo sent Fiona-themed onesies to the preemies there. \u201cWe are working with Fiona and her story to spread a number of messages \u2014 one is a message of not giving up,\u201d Maynard said. __ INSPIRING GENEROSITY Out of cash and out of gas on an interstate exit ramp in Philadelphia, Kate McClure found help from an unlikely source: a homeless man who told her to stay put, then used his last $20 to buy her gas. Johnny Bobbitt Jr.\u2019s selflessness was not lost on McClure. She set up a GoFundMe page for the military veteran and former paramedic, and raised more than $400,000. Now Bobbitt has enough money to buy a home and his dream truck \u2014 a 1999 Ford Ranger. An attorney and financial adviser helped create a plan that will allow him to collect a small monthly salary and have some money for retirement. Bobbitt has said he\u2019s overwhelmed. He told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d he plans to pay the generosity forward by donating some of the money to organizations that will help others. \u201cEverybody out there is facing some kind of struggle, so if I can touch their life, the way mine was touched, (it\u2019d be) an amazing feeling,\u201d he told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d ___ \u201cYES!\u201d OVER ROAST CHICKEN From a simple proposal over roast chicken to plans for a royal wedding, news that Prince Harry is engaged to American actress Meghan Markle has many cheering. The story drew people in for many reasons. For one, it\u2019s fun. The happiness exuded by the couple as they announced their engagement was contagious, while details of their courtship read like a fairy tale. Harry, an army veteran who had a one-time bad-boy image but is now devoted to wounded veterans and charitable causes, met Markle on a blind date. The prince later said that\u2019s when he realized he needed to up his game to win her heart. They grew closer while camping in Botswana, and now there is talk of starting a family. But for some black women the engagement offered more than entertainment. It gave them a Cinderella story they could picture themselves in. Markle, who is divorced, is bi-racial and will be the first woman of color in modern history to join the British royal family. \u201cWe all have this fantasy of being swept off our feet by the prince. It\u2019s validation that, of course, we can be princesses,\u201d Essence Magazine Editor-in-Chief Vanessa K. DeLuca said at the time. ___ PROUD AMERICANS Manny Macias came to America when he was just 3 months old. Three decades later, he became a citizen of the only place he\u2019s called home. \u201cThe U.S. has always been home for me,\u201d said Macias. \u201cNow it\u2019s official.\u201d The federal government says more than 600,000 people became naturalized U.S. citizens in the first nine months of 2017. The ceremonies can be huge moments for those involved. Many times they are family affairs, complete with proud smiles or tears of joy as the newest Americans realize dreams that were years in the making. Many dress in their best and pose for photos while clutching American flags. Macias, 31, said he\u2019s now glad to be able to vote, have more stability and live without fear of being deported. \u201cIt was important to me to get the documentation saying I was a citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cI did get a little emotional, because finally for me, the journey was done.\u201d ___ Follow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti.

California Governor Gavin Newsom placed the state Office of Emergency Services (OES) on its highest alert and requested federal assistance. He told a news conference in Ridgecrest on Saturday that he had just got off a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, seeking a presidential emergency declaration. \u201cI have full confidence that the president will be forthcoming, in immediate terms, with the formal declaration,\u201d  Newsom said, flanked by first responders. There were several minor to moderate injuries, OES Director Mark Ghilarducci told reporters. \u201cNo reports of any fatalities, so I think we\u2019re very lucky there,\u201d he said. There were reports of building fires, mostly as a result of gas leaks or gas-line breaks, Ghilarducci said. State officials said all roads damaged by the quakes had been repaired and reopened. Violent shaking also caused water-main breaks and knocked out power and communications to parts of Ridgecrest, home to about 27,000 people some 125 miles (200 km) northeast of Los Angeles. Officials warned there was sure to be a significant number of aftershocks, including possible powerful ones, and advised residents to ensure they had necessary supplies. \u201cI\u2019ve said this ad nauseam: be prepared for the worst,\u201d said Newsom, who on Saturday met victims in the hospital and visited a hardware store where the earthquake hurled products from shelves and left ceiling tiles scattered across the aisles. Standing outside her damaged home in Ridgecrest, life-long  resident Sierra Wood said it was heartbreaking and scary. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen anything like this,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean - they say that it\u2019s happened and you\u2019ve heard about it. But once you\u2019re in it, it\u2019s completely different, it\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s terrifying.\u201d  Her husband, Keith Wood, said the aftershocks were grueling. \u201cIt\u2019s like when, when do we get a break from it?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen is enough enough? Mother Nature has had her way. Give us a break now, OK?\u201d  The sprawling U.S. Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake just northwest of Ridgecrest was evacuated of all non-essential personnel following the quake. The facility, which at more than 1.1 million acres (445,000 hectares) is larger than the state of Rhode Island, reported no injuries. Authorities were assessing any damage to buildings or other infrastructure, according to a post on the base\u2019s Facebook page. Friday\u2019s earthquake was widely felt across Southern California, including greater Los Angeles, where shaking in some areas lasted about 40 seconds. Low-level rumbling extended as far north as the San Francisco Bay area and beyond to Reno, Nevada, and as far east as Phoenix, Arizona. Seismologists said the initial quake on Thursday, and scores of smaller ones that followed it, proved to be foreshocks to Friday\u2019s larger temblor, which now ranks as Southern California\u2019s most powerful since a 7.1 quake that struck near a U.S. Marine Corps base in the Mojave Desert in 1999. The U.S. Geological Survey said Friday\u2019s quake was immediately followed by at least 16 aftershocks of magnitude 4 or greater and warned of a 50 percent chance of another magnitude 6 quake in the coming days. Geologists put the chance of another magnitude 7 tremor at 10 percent over the next week. There were hundreds of aftershocks of 2.5 magnitude or greater in the area surrounding the epicenter, according to USGS data. Victor Abdullatif was helping clean up broken bottles and other debris inside his father\u2019s liquor store, the Eastridge Market, which sustained damage to its ceiling, and found the periodic aftershocks unnerving. \u201cThey\u2019re still scary because you almost don\u2019t know, \u2018Is this going to be a full earthquake?\u2019 You have to kind of have faith that it\u2019s just an aftershock,\u201d he told Reuters. The last major destructive quake to hit Southern California was the 6.7 magnitude Northridge quake in 1994, which struck a densely populated area of Los Angeles. It killed 57 people and caused billions of dollars in property damage. The comparatively limited damage from Friday\u2019s quake, which packed greater force than the Northridge event, was a function of its location in a remote, less developed area. Its ground motion, however, startled seismically jaded Southern Californians over a wide region. Pools in Los Angeles sloshed wildly, and TV cameras at Dodger Stadium were shaking as they filmed the night Major League Baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres. A television anchorwoman ducked out of sight during a local newscast as shouts of \u201cget under a desk\u201d were heard in the background.

But given the tests\u2019 uncertain utility, as well as the obvious economic motivation of the test marketers, more information on costs would have been very useful. Information on insurance coverage should also have been included. The article does not quantify the benefits of treatment with and without genetic testing. Since at least one of the tests mentioned has been approved by the FDA, and the FDA may get a larger role in the pre-market vetting of these tests, some data should be available. All of the reporting in the article on benefits is based on anecdotes and clinicians\u2019 summaries of their knowledge. While none of the genetic tests is harmful, the article states the tests\u2019 limitations: some are costly, their results sometimes of unknown accuracy and difficult to apply to treatment. A clearer statement about the potential harms\u2013including unnecessary treatment and even mortality\u2013of a treatment decision made on faulty results would have been very useful. Since the OncotypDX test is used to help identify people who may reasonably forego chemotherapy, the issue is whether skipping a treatment that may have benefit in order to avoid side effects will produce good outcomes. The article does not report on the amount and quality of evidence about safety and efficacy of the tests. This is the story\u2019s most serious shortcoming. The article does not exaggerate the dangers of cancer although it does make some pretty big claims about what genetic medicine can and might do \u2013 claims that are still unsubstantiated. The article quotes a variety of sources: two clinicians who use the tests, two physician skeptics, a government regulator, and two patients whose treatment has been determined partly by genetic tests. The article is focused largely on treatment options facing cancer patients, and the role genetic testing can play in those treatments. It is clear from several examples that using genetic information as part of treatment planning is an option but not fully dependable or universally useful. The article makes clear that some of the genetic tests for cancer are on the market, some are in limited use,\u00a0 and others are under development. The article does not make any explicit claims of novelty, but it does indicate, correctly, that this is a fast-developing field of medical science that is creating new insights and products regularly.

Ohio lawmakers, who already have passed a late-term abortion ban and other anti-abortion measures this year, have just begun hearings on Senate Bill 201, which is designed to defund Planned Parenthood and other family planning centers. The day before the first Senate hearing on SB 201, Ohio Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, promoted the proposed law as a key component of its agenda. \"\"Ohio\u2019s Planned Parenthood operations received millions of taxpayer dollars via federal grants in 2010 and 2011,\"\" a Dec. 5 news release from Ohio Right to Life said. Ohio Right to Life went on to say that Planned Parenthood has performed more abortions annually as its federal funding has increased. It lauds the bill as one that will direct funding away from abortion providers and calls the hearings on the bill a step toward making 2012 a \"\"groundbreaking year for Ohio's pro-life movement.\"\" PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine Ohio Right to Life\u2019s claim about public funding of Planned Parenthood, in light of its underlying contention that the funding of the agency supports abortion. We asked Michael Gonidakis, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, for specifics on the taxpayer money Planned Parenthood has received. Gonidakis said state agencies disbursed the federal grants, authorizing more than $1.6 million in 2010 to Planned Parenthood locations in Ohio and more than $1.7 million this year. He also provided a memo the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission prepared detailing state agencies\u2019 disbursement of federal grants to Planned Parenthood branches in Ohio. LSC compiled the information for Rep. Kristina Roegner, a Republican from Hudson who is a primary sponsor on companion legislation introduced in the House to defund Planned Parenthood. Roegner\u2019s office confirmed the memo\u2019s authenticity. Tara Broderick, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio, said the organization does receive federal grant money. But none of that money pays for abortions, she said. \"\"A huge myth,\"\" Broderick said. \"\"Absolutely I can say taxpayer money is not used for abortion services,\"\" she said. Planned Parenthood must sign an agreement affirming it will not use taxpayer money to provide, promote or refer abortion services, said a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health, which distributes the bulk of federal grant money that Planned Parenthood receives. Additionally, an audit is performed to account for the organization\u2019s use of government dollars, Broderick said. According to Planned Parenthood, the vast majority of its clients receive health care services such as Pap tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. Less than 4 percent of Ohio Planned Parenthood clients received an abortion, the organization stated. Nationally, Planned Parenthood performed 332,278 abortion procedures in 2009, the most recent year data was available. Those procedures made up 3 percent of the organization\u2019s services, according to a Planned Parenthood fact sheet that was last updated in October. Gonidakis, of Ohio Right to Life, acknowledged that the federal Hyde Amendment and state law prohibits tax dollars for paying for abortions. \"\"However, the significant public dollars Planned Parenthood does receive keeps them afloat and pays for pretty much their entire operations,\"\" he said in an e-mail. Not true, said Broderick, of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio. She said the federal dollars make up 16 percent of the branch\u2019s budget. So where does that leave us? Ohio Right to Life is correct to say that Planned Parenthood locations in Ohio have received millions in federal grants. But the connection between Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funding and its abortion services is not as direct as Ohio Right to Life\u2019s news release implies. Federal law bars Planned Parenthood from using taxpayer money for abortions, and the agency must certify to the state that it does not do so. The money that would be redirected by S.B. 201 is used to provide other health services. Ohio Right to Life\u2019s claim about funding for Planned Parenthood is accurate. That the money cannot be used for abortions and that abortion procedures make up a small percentage of Planned Parenthood services are additional pieces of information that provide the full picture.\" Claim: Ohio\u2019s Planned Parenthood operations received millions of taxpayer dollars via federal grants in 2010 and 2011.", "output": "Ohio Right to Life says millions of federal aid went to the state's Planned Parenthood affiliates", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

The day before the plan was officially unveiled, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., took aim at the way the GOP plan was described by media outlets that had gotten early, leaked versions of it. In a press release from the Democratic National Committee, Vice Chair Wasserman Schultz said the GOP plan, \"\"would allow health insurance companies to continue engaging in unfair and discriminatory practices like denying coverage to people because of a pre-existing medical condition.\"\" Requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions has been a popular element of the Democratic plan. Now that we've seen the full 219-page GOP alternative plan, it shows Wasserman Schultz is correct that it does not prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage to people due to pre-existing medical conditions. But to listen to her, one might get the impression the Republicans have completely ignored the issue of pre-existing conditions. And they haven't. They have a different idea that they think will get at the problem. More than 10 pages of the GOP bill spell out a plan to help people with pre-existing conditions by allowing universal access to expanded and improved state-run high-risk pools. They accept patients who have health conditions that might prompt private insurance companies to reject them. Already, 34 states have high-risk insurance pools. \"\"We want to encourage all states to have these,\"\" said House Republican Leader John Boehner. \"\"And we put more money into these high-risk pools so that we can bring down the cost of health insurance. And at the end of the day, what we're doing with our proposal is lowering health care insurance premiums \u2014 lowering cost and expanding access.\"\" The Republican plan calls for $25 billion in funding through 2019 to subsidize state high risk pool and reinsurance programs. In an MSNBC interview on Nov. 4, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said the cost of bolstering state funds and insurance programs to cover people with pre-existing conditions would be offset by savings from medical malpractice reforms that he said would \"\"rein in some of these runaway massive lawsuits that drive defensive medicine and drive up the cost of premiums.\"\" Democrats counter that high-risk insurance pools have done little to solve the problems faced by people with pre-existing medical conditions. Premiums in those pools are usually far more expensive than in your average health insurance plan, and therefore remain out of reach for many moderate to low-income people with pre-existing conditions. The Republican plan tries to address that by requiring that the pool \"\"must limit the pool premiums to no more than 150 percent of the average premium for applicable standard risk rates in that state.\"\" In other words, it might cost people with pre-existing conditions 50 percent more than average premiums paid by healthy people. But a study shows that might make the price too high. A February 2005 study by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund found that in states with high-risk pools, the rates were typically 25 percent to 50 percent higher than average rates. People with lower incomes just couldn't afford to buy into the state pools. As a result, they found, high-risk pool subsidies tended to go to a small number of relatively high-income people, those who could afford premiums well above market rates. The GOP plan for dealing with the issue of people with pre-existing conditions \"\"is essentially the same as now, and now is not working,\"\" said Jonathan Beeton, a spokesman for Wasserman Schultz. Wasserman Schultz was correct when she said the GOP plan does not prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. We found nothing in the 219-page Republican plan that would do that. Insurance companies have argued that they can only absorb the cost of taking people with pre-existing conditions if they could offset that expense by expanding their customer base through mandates that everyone buy insurance. And the Republican plan doesn't do that. Still, we think Wasserman Schultz's comments imply that Republicans have simply ignored the issue of pre-existing conditions altogether. They have not. They have taken a different tack from\u00a0 the Democrats. And Democrats may not agree that dealing with the issue through state-run high-risk pools is an adequate plan, but it  is  a plan. And so we rule Wasserman Schultz's comment .\" Claim: \"The GOP health care plan \"\"would allow health insurance companies to continue engaging in unfair and discriminatory practices like denying coverage to people because of a pre-existing medical condition.\"", "output": "Wasserman Schultz says GOP alternative health care plan allows insurers to continue denying coverage for pre-existing conditions", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

U.S. deaths from the novel coronavirus have topped 25,400, doubling in one week, according to a Reuters tally, as officials debate how to reopen the economy without reigniting the outbreak. Despite the outbreak, Americans are still finding ways to have fun. In many small towns across the country, local police and fire departments are staging parades in front of children\u2019s\u2019 homes on their birthdays, complete with flashing lights and sirens. Friends and families are using Zoom video conferencing to throw virtual parties, featuring renditions of \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d a song that has become a coronavirus anthem. (Health experts say a thorough hand-washing takes 20 seconds, about the time it takes to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d twice.) In San Diego, California, when a former U.S. Marine couldn\u2019t go anywhere for her 104th birthday, her friends brought the party to her front lawn. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s amazing,\u201d Ruth Gallivan gasped, as honking cars festooned with birthday decorations drove by at a safe distance. Anxiety around birthdays is spiking for children struggling with the concept of social distancing, Anthony Field, founder of the Wiggles, a popular Australian musical act, told Reuters in an email. \u201cParents have told us their child is worried that if no one can come to their party, \u2018Does it mean (I) still turn 4?\u2019\u201d said Field, better known as the Blue Wiggle. In a new \u201cSocial Distancing\u201d song, with more than 540,000 views since it went online March 29, the Wiggles assure fans that a video party counts as a genuine celebration, Field said. In New Jersey, Reuben\u2019s mother invited more than 20 neighbors to post drawings of Star Wars heroes and villains in their front windows, where her son could see them during a social-distancing walk on Tuesday, his fifth birthday. Neighbors young and old agreed to dress up in futuristic costumes and join Reuben, wearing a new Storm Trooper outfit, as he danced on his front lawn. Adults would make sure everyone stayed at least the recommended six feet apart from one another. Later, his friends were set to join him in a Zoom party that would feature a children\u2019s musician strumming \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d  and enjoy party goodie bags with toys that Reuben ordered from a local store and custom Star Wars cookies ordered from a local bakery. Reuben\u2019s mother, wearing a face bandana and disposable gloves, planned to drop them off at his friends\u2019 front doors, wiping down each one with disinfectant. Reuben said he had another present for all the party-goers, who are presumably as tired of being separated from friends as he was. His special treat? \u201cTo look at me,\u201d he said.

Now the village is home to at least a dozen furnaces burning a steady stream of tires to make low-quality oil in a process known as pyrolysis. Global trade in waste tires has almost doubled in the past five years, mainly to developing countries like India and Malaysia, according to customs data provided to the United Nations. Britain is currently the largest exporter, followed by Italy and the United States. India is by far the biggest buyer, accounting for 32% of global imports last year, up from 7% five years ago, the U.N. data shows. Many of the tires are sent to recycling operations that comply with emissions and waste disposal regulations. But there is also a vast trade to backyard pyrolysis operations that do not, according to local authorities. In May, Reuters revealed that a mass poisoning in southern Malaysia had links to companies engaged in pyrolysis. Using unpublished customs data and interviews with dozens of industry sources, Reuters documented a growing international trade in waste tires that pollute the communities that host them, according to local authorities and health experts. For many developed countries, shipping tires abroad is cheaper than recycling them domestically. That helped drive international trade in rubber waste to nearly 2 million tonnes in 2018, equivalent to 200 million tyres, from 1.1 million tonnes in 2013. The trade has also been fed by ravenous fuel demand for industrial furnaces in countries like India, the emergence of inexpensive Chinese pyrolysis equipment, and weak regulations worldwide. FACTBOX on the tyre trade:  Tires are not defined as hazardous under the Basel Convention, which governs trade in dangerous waste, meaning there are few restrictions on trading them internationally unless specified by the importing country. In most countries, including China and the United States, the majority of scrap tires are handled domestically and dumped in landfills, recycled or used as fuel in factories producing products like cement and paper. (GRAPHIC: Recycling and reuse of tires - here)  Pyrolysis supporters say the process can be a relatively clean way of disposing of tires and turning them into useful fuel. However, controlling emissions and processing waste residue from the burning of a product that is made up a wide range of chemicals, and synthetic and natural rubber is expensive and difficult to make profitable on a mass scale. State-of-the-art plants can cost tens of millions of dollars, whereas basic Chinese-made pyrolysis equipment is available from online retailers for as little as $30,000. An Indian government audit found that as of July 2019 there were 637 licensed pyrolysis plants countrywide, of which 270 were not complying with environmental standards and 116 had been shut down. The audit said most operators used rudimentary equipment that exposed workers to fine carbon particles and led to dust, oil and air pollution leaking into the plant and surroundings. Industry sources say several hundred more unlicensed pyrolysis businesses are operating across India. Pyrolysis plants have mushroomed in the southern Malaysian state of Johor over the last decade, industry sources said, where they supply fuel for ships. At one plant visited by Reuters near the Johor town of Kulai, Bangladeshi immigrants covered in carbon dust shovelled tires imported from Australia and Singapore into a Chinese-made furnace. They lived onsite in a hut next to the kilns. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know where old tyres go,\u201d said the owner, who gave his name only as Sam. \u201cBut if my factory doesn\u2019t exist, where will the tires go?\u201d He said he had a license to operate. Reuters could not verify this. The environmental impact of pyrolysis in places like India and Malaysia is making some exporting countries take notice. Australia, a major exporter of tyres to Southeast Asia and India, said in August it would ban waste exports, including tires, although it did not give a timeline. Australia was \u201caware of allegations of unsustainable processing of waste tires in some importing countries\u201d and did not want \u201cto be part of such practices\u201d, said a spokesman for Trevor Evans, the official who oversees waste reduction. Burning tyres without adequate emissions controls can release numerous toxic chemicals and gases into the environment, as well as particulates, said Lalit Dandona, head of the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative, a group of research bodies mapping health issues across India. (GRAPHIC: What's in a tire? - here)  He said the short-term effects for those exposed to smoke from burning tires included skin irritation and lung infections and that prolonged exposure could result in heart attacks and lung cancer. Other government bodies worldwide, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have made similar conclusions. In a 1997 report, the EPA said emissions from burning tires included dioxins, sulphur oxides and a range of metals including mercury and arsenic. Many of the tires that end up in Indian villages like Nabipur start their lives in Britain. Indian waste tire imports from Britain alone in 2018 amounted to 263,000 tonnes - 13% of the total volume of tires traded worldwide - compared with 48,000 tonnes in 2013. (GRAPHIC: Where India imports its waste tires - here)  Most European countries require tyre manufacturers and suppliers to organize tire collection and treatment, meaning there are more home-grown recycling operations. There are no such requirements in Britain, however, which means that small firms can easily obtain licenses to collect waste tires and sell them abroad. Britain\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said it fully implements the rules of the Basel Convention but needs to do more about waste tires. DEFRA said it planned to make producers more responsible for old tires, as well as increase monitoring of shipments. (GRAPHIC: Top tire waste importing countries - here)  Once in India, the tires are dispersed between recyclers who shred them for use in road-building or sports fields, firms that burn them as cheap fuel to make cement or bricks, and legal and illegal pyrolysis plants, importers and exporters said. India\u2019s Automotive Tyre Manufacturers\u2019 Association estimates that most imported waste tyres end up in pyrolysis plants, according to the group\u2019s deputy director, Vinay Vijayvargia. Faced with a growing backlash from environmental groups and residents living near pyrolysis plants, India is considering banning all but the most sophisticated operations. The country\u2019s environmental court is expected to rule on the proposed ban in January. Six years ago, there were no pyrolysis plants in Nabipur, 70 miles south of New Delhi. Now there are 10, with most operating at night to avoid scrutiny, residents said. Reuters visited three small plants in the village. At one, tires embossed with \u2018Made in Germany\u2019 and \u2018Made in U.S.A.\u2019 lay strewn on the floor and thick sludge seeped from pipes protruding from incineration drums. Most tires used for vehicles in India are made domestically. Workers wore no safety equipment, and their skin and clothes were covered in black soot. The owner, Pankaj, said a trader sells him tires imported from abroad. Villagers said they have suffered from breathing difficulties and eye and throat infections since the plants began expanding, and farmers had found black dust in their soil. Reuters could not independently verify the claims. It was also not possible to verify if the operations were licensed. \u201cUsed tires are not available locally, so they import from abroad,\u201d said Shiva Choudhary, a businessman who leases out construction equipment in Nabipur. \u201cThey clean their own country and dump their garbage on us.\u201d Claim:  A Muslim group has asked for pork-free food to be offered by food banks in Minnesota.

Amid the barrage of criticism over the rollout of Obamacare, groups known as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are quietly going about the business of testing the potential for healthcare reform. The efforts, born of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, are part of the biggest experiment yet to fix the costly and error-plagued U.S. healthcare system. The new models of care, which encourage providers to form networks to coordinate care and cut costs, involve close monitoring of the sickest patients to address budding health problems before they cause a costly trip to the emergency room or an extended hospital stay. Providers that succeed in keeping patients healthy and cutting costs are rewarded with a portion of the savings. In Peoria, a city of 116,000 that is often seen as the archetypal middle American community, two hospital systems - OSF Healthcare and UnityPoint Health - are taking on the challenge. Progress so far is largely anecdotal, but early data showing declines in readmissions and emergency room visits offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential for reform. Still, there are no guarantees that the savings will exceed the costs. OSF is in its second year of participating in the federal Pioneer Accountable Care Organization, a pilot program involving 32 hospital systems across the country that aims to improve quality while cutting costs in the government\u2019s Medicare insurance program for the elderly. The program rewards doctors and medical centers that show gains on 33 measures of quality, including routine cancer and depression screenings, while still managing to cut overall costs. In its first year, 13 hospitals reported savings. OSF was not one of them, but it came close. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has not allowed providers to disclose their full first-year results, but Tara Canty, chief operations officer of OSF\u2019s Accountable Care Organization, said the hospital system saw a 30 percent drop in emergency room admissions and a 20 percent drop in inpatient stays among Medicare participants. Canty sees the first two years as a learning process but says she will be \u201cupset personally\u201d if OSF is not achieving savings by year three. Dr. Keith Knepp, chief information officer at UnityPoint Health-Methodist, says reforms are needed, but he sometimes finds it hard to stay optimistic. \u201cWill there be reimbursement to reward the improved quality, or will we spend more money to take in less?\u201d  Success may depend on controlling costs among high-use patients like Wright. She is among the 5 percent of OSF patients who consumes more than 50 percent of the care delivered by the system. Wright spends most of her days in her tidy home in Mackinaw, outside Peoria, tooling around in a motorized wheelchair. Her legs swell up, making her prone to blood clots. Two years ago in November, she had a major complication from her blood thinner drug, Coumadin. \u201cMy brain started bleeding. They had to drill holes in my head,\u201d Wright recalls of the ordeal, which kept her in the hospital for nearly a month. \u201cI nearly died twice.\u201d  Wright was among the first of OSF\u2019s Pioneer patients to be assigned a care manager, a nurse charged with keeping her healthy and out of the hospital. \u201cThe theory here is if you focus on the people with chronic disease who are your highest utilizers of care \u2026 and make a better outcome for those patients, you are able to invest that savings into some of the care for the larger population of patients,\u201d said Michelle Conger, OSF\u2019s chief strategy officer. Like most providers across the country, Peoria\u2019s hospitals have been hit by federal budget cuts and burdened by an outdated reimbursement system focused on how many services they perform rather that quality. OSF, a system of eight acute-care hospitals with $6 billion in annual patient revenue, needs to cut $200 million over the next five years in response to reimbursement cuts from Medicare and other payers. It has adopted the ACO model to help it get there. An actuarial firm is combing through claims data for the 34,000 Medicare patients in OSF\u2019s ACO to help identify patients like Wright, whose high-risk conditions are likely to require more emergency room visits or admissions. The system assigned 35 care managers to work with these patients and come up with ways to prevent more acute health crises. Sometimes that means simply helping patients keep track of their medications or arranging transportation to a pharmacy, said Priscilla Romans, a nurse who works in OSF\u2019s call center. It also means routine checks on high-risk patients. During a call last month, a heart failure patient complained of shortness of breath and a headache. Romans asked whether she could put her shoes on that day. She was only able to get one on, a sign of fluid buildup, and she couldn\u2019t wear her rings. Romans had the woman take her blood pressure, which was too high, and reported the findings to her doctor. The physician doubled the patient\u2019s dose of Lasix to cut the swelling in her hands and feet, and started her on a blood pressure medication. When Romans called the next day, a Friday, the woman felt much better. Romans believes the time she spent on the phone with this patient helped avert a much more costly ER visit. Often, the issues driving health costs are social. In one case, OSF discovered that a patient who kept getting readmitted to the hospital for emphysema had not been taking her medication. \u201cShe was squirreling away her money to fix her roof,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Hippler, OSF\u2019s senior vice president for clinical excellence. The Catholic hospital system tapped into a charity program and made the repairs. UnityPoint Health-Methodist, Peoria\u2019s second-biggest provider, has been taking part in Medicare\u2019s Shared Savings ACO, a transitional program in which hospitals assume less risk than in the Pioneer ACO but have fewer potential rewards. The hospital has cared for about 10,000 Medicare ACO patients since July 2012. In November, UnityPoint acquired the 220-bed Procter Hospital, Peoria\u2019s third-largest provider, giving it access to new addiction recovery services and skilled nursing care. The Procter deal follows Methodist\u2019s decision in 2011 to join Iowa-based UnityPoint Health, the 13th-largest non-profit health system in the United States with annual revenue of $2.7 billion. The moves are part of a national consolidation trend among hospitals trying to fill out their menu of services and bring costs under centralized control. \u201cThere is a need for size and scale in the new environment,\u201d said Terry Waters, vice president for strategy and development at UnityPoint Health. \u201cYou have to be able to diversify your financial risk over a larger patient population.\u201d  According to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, an estimated 14 percent of the U.S. population is covered by some form of accountable care organization, including 4 million Medicare beneficiaries. OSF could not say whether it has saved money on Wright\u2019s care in the two years since she has been in care management because the system does not release financial information about individual patients. But Canty said the system \u201chas seen significant and sustained declines in the cost of care for patients in care management.\u201d  As for Wright, she appreciates the quick access she now has to her doctors, but she still needs a lot of care. In May, a hip implant had become infected and had to be replaced. While recovering, Wright developed a bothersome cough that turned out to be pulmonary fibrosis, a dangerous scarring of the lungs. \u201cBetween May 21 and July 19, I had been released and admitted five times. Five times! It was dreadful.\u201d  Romans, who has helped coordinate some of Wright\u2019s care, said her job is to try to keep patients out of the hospital, but that\u2019s not always possible. \u201cHere we are trying to be financially prudent with our dollars, but the patient needed the care.\u201d  Now, the goal is to stretch out the period between visits. Wright went from July to September with only one hospitalization. \u201cIt was quick. She went back home, and she hasn\u2019t been back to the hospital since,\u201d Romans said.

The rejection of the foreign technology comes at a time when over half of coal-fired plants in India are already set to miss a phased deadline starting Dec. 2019 to cut emissions of lung diseases-causing sulphur oxides. State-run NTPC, which generates a quarter of India\u2019s electricity, held talks with foreign firms including General Electric Co, Norway-based Yara International and Japan-based Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems over the potential purchase of filters that lower emissions of smog-causing nitrogen oxide. However, none of the pilot tests it conducted met key emissions parameters, NTPC said in a presentation submitted last month to the Central Pollution Control Board. \u201cThe pilot tests concluded that both selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technologies currently available are not suitable for installation at power plants in India,\u201d it said in the presentation reviewed by Reuters, referring to technologies used to cut emissions of nitrogen oxides. Thermal power companies produce three-quarters of the country\u2019s electricity and account for some 80% of India\u2019s industrial emissions of sulphur oxides that cause lung diseases and smog-creating nitrogen oxides. NTPC had presented cost estimates in 2016 for the installation of the technology to cut nitrogen oxides throughout its network of power plants. According to Reuters calculations based on those estimates, the cost would total $2.4 billion, although industry consultants said recently that those costs could now be 25% lower. The utility wants a dilution in nitrogen oxide emissions standards and claimed in last month\u2019s presentation that the lowered standards can be achieved with minor retrofits, without the need to install new equipment. The pollution board held a stakeholder meeting on Nov. 7, an audio recording of which was reviewed by Reuters. In the meeting, GE and Yara representatives rejected NTPC\u2019s views, saying their technologies were proven worldwide, according to the recording and two sources present at the meeting. NTPC did not attend the meeting. NTPC, and the Indian units of GE and Yara did not respond to detailed Reuters questionnaires seeking comment. Mitsubishi Hitachi did not immediately respond to a request for comment made on its website. NTPC said in the earlier presentation to the pollution board that high ash content in Indian coal posed challenges to installing SCR technology and that SNCR did not meet key parameters. The foreign companies responded, saying pilot tests were run in a constrained environment and that commercial use of the equipment, which requires some changes to the plant, would cut emissions to the required levels. \u201cThe conditions for the (pilot) test was that we can\u2019t touch special parts at all, we can\u2019t touch furnace tubes. NTPC did not allow us,\u201d Senthilvel Rangasamy, a GE representative, said in the meeting. Premchand Talreja, the managing director of the Indian unit of Yara, said the pilot tests achieved the desired results. \u201cThere should not be doubt on the technology itself,\u201d Talreja said in the meeting. Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and previously a member of a European Union technical working group on emissions by coal-fired utilities, said India has failed to curtail emissions due to \u201cdelay and misinformation tactics by the power industry\u201d. \u201cThe power industry managed to build a myth that Indian coal is so special that technologies proven on a wide range of coal types elsewhere need to be tested and validated again in India before the standards can be implemented,\u201d Myllyvirta told Reuters.

We also appreciated how the story detailed a few risks of popular alternative approaches to quitting smoking, including medications and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). We were pleasantly surprised to see a paragraph dedicated to covering the weaknesses of this study, namely that study participants were well-educated and white, and how future research could make up for this and other shortcomings.

But it could delay solving the mystery of how a strain of bovine TB similar to cases associated with cattle south of the U.S. border surfaced in cows near the northern border. \u201cWe are the workforce right now in the field, and we have limited staff,\u201d State Veterinarian Susan Keller said Wednesday of the North Dakota Agriculture Department\u2019s Animal Health Division, which has only a handful of workers. She said federal officials wanted to help but couldn\u2019t because of the shutdown tied to a dispute over funding a southern border wall. President Donald Trump and congressional leaders on Friday struck a short-term deal to reopen the government for three weeks, ending a record, 35-day partial shutdown. Two cows from the Sargent County herd tested positive for bovine TB at slaughter plants in South Dakota and Minnesota, and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa confirmed the diagnosis late last year. The herd was then tested, and five more cows were confirmed to have the infectious disease that can be passed between cattle and people. The source is still unknown. The ranchers have not bought any cattle from Mexico, have no ties to the country and have no workers from south of the border, according to Keller. \u201cIt\u2019s a very slow-growing organism. It could have been there (in the herd) for quite a while. We don\u2019t know when it was introduced or where it came from,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a strain that has been here (U.S.) for a while but it\u2019s mutated.\u201d Bovine TB is a public health concern worldwide, though the risk to people in developed countries is low given advances in prevention and control measures such as testing, culling of diseased animals and pasteurizing of milk, according to the National Institutes of Health. North Dakota is not alone in recently identifying a new strain of bovine TB \u2014 officials in Canada are investigating cattle infections in the province of British Columbia that involve a strain not previously documented in that country, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. \u201cYou can have mutations of TB, similar to influenza,\u201d Keller said, stressing that a new strain is not comparable to a new disease \u2014 it doesn\u2019t change measures in place to guard against bovine TB. The new case is still a concern to ranchers, according to Julie Ellingson, executive vice president of the North Dakota Stockmen\u2019s Association. \u201cThe livestock industry is concerned about any and all cases of TB, no matter what the strain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have worked hard to maintain a healthy herd in our state, and identifying and addressing the situation as quickly as possible is our highest priority.\u201d Responses to such animal disease cases are a cooperative effort of state and federal agencies, particularly the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and its Veterinary Services and Wildlife Services components. North Dakota\u2019s Animal Health Division has received only limited help so far from those agencies and in particular is waiting on information that will help determine whether the entire herd of about 100 animals is slaughtered or whether the owners can continue managing the rest of the herd with ongoing testing. Officials also are working to determine where all of the animals in the herd originated, and to ensure that none ended up in other herds over the past five years. Keller said the likelihood of that is remote given that the ranchers raise cattle for beef, not to provide seed stock to other ranchers. It wasn\u2019t clear how many APHIS officials have been available to work on the case. Agency spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole, who was herself furloughed but on call, said only that the agency \u201cis assisting with diagnostic testing\u201d and would provide further help \u201conce the lapse in appropriations is over.\u201d The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, which represents more than 175,000 cattle ranchers and feeders around the country, did not directly comment on the federal shutdown\u2019s impact on the North Dakota investigation. Chief Veterinarian Kathy Simmons in a statement to The Associated Press expressed confidence that Keller and other North Dakota officials working in conjunction with federal officials \u201ccan manage a successful disease response.\u201d Keller said the investigation could stretch out for several months, but she hopes to be able to say definitively by early summer that officials have taken all necessary actions to ensure no spread of the disease. \u201cNeighbors, people in the community, neighboring states, they want to know \u2014 do you have things tied up?\u201d she said. ___ Follow Blake Nicholson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/NicholsonBlake Claim: Federal shutdown affected probe into unique bovine TB case.", "output": "The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history affected an investigation into a strain of bovine tuberculosis in a North Dakota beef cattle herd, say state officials who have so far have shouldered most of the probe into the strain similar to cases in Mexican cattle and not previously seen in the U.S.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

The report also says that while Montana\u2019s overall overdose death rate has remained relatively stable, the number of deaths attributed to opioids has been declining. Gov. Steve Bullock said Montana is ahead of the game because it recognized the opioid addiction issue early and acted. Since 2008, the state has implemented a prescription drug registry, prescription drug drop-off locations and increased access to substance abuse treatment, in part through Medicaid expansion. In 2017, the Legislature passed a law allowing anyone to get naloxone _ which reverses the effects of an opioid overdose _ without a prescription. Emergency room physician Bill Gallea said the naloxone law has played a critical role in saving lives. While opioids given in proper amounts can alleviate pain, taken in higher doses or in combination with other medications, opioids can suppress and even stop your breathing, Gallea said. \u201cIn our battle to prevent death from overdose, our goal is to have naloxone in every fire truck, every squad car, every clinic and school and to be carried by everyone who is prescribed a high dose of opioids, or is perhaps addicted, and carried by anyone who might encounter a friend or family member who is at risk for an overdose,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not yet achieved our goal of universal distribution of naloxone to all the appropriate individuals, but we are making progress,\u201d Gallea said, noting that in the first nine months of this year, naloxone has been used over 500 times by first responders. Another key to reducing opioid abuse is making more medication-assisted treatment available, said Cindy Stergar, CEO of the Montana Primary Care Association. The association has been providing training to primary care providers so they are qualified to prescribe medication that can help ease the withdrawal symptoms of reducing or ending opioid use. Two years ago, Montana had about two dozen such providers. Now there\u2019s 150, she said. Over 600 people are receiving medication-assisted treatment through community health centers and urban Indian Health Service centers, Stergar said. The number is double that across the state. Prescriptions for buprenorphine saw a major increase in 2017, the report said, indicating more people are receiving medication-assisted treatment. Montana\u2019s Substance Use Disorder Task Force has updated its knowyourdosemt.org website with information on identifying and treating opioid use disorder, better ways to manage patients with chronic pain, federal prescribing guidelines and how to taper patients to lower opioid doses. The task force hopes the education will \u201chelp find a balance between people who we can help through opiates and those who might be harmed,\u201d said Mark Mentel, a task force member and president of the Montana Medical Association. People picking up prescriptions for opioid pain medication such as hydrocodone or oxycodone have to provide identification under a new law that took effect Tuesday.

Indeed, peaches were among the first tree fruits to be domesticated as early human societies embraced horticulture, the study indicates. \u201cThere is a long history of peach cultivation in China,\u201d said one of the researchers, Yunfei Zheng of the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Relics and Archaeology in Hangzhou, China, noting that China still leads the world in peach production. The researchers compared peach pits, also called stones, from six Chinese locations, covering a period of roughly 5,000 years. An analysis of pit size from each location showed that peaches were growing steadily larger as time passed in the Yangtze valley, illustrating that people there had been domesticating this fruit. It took perhaps 3,000 years before the domesticated peaches came to look like peaches grown now. Peach pits, almost indistinguishable from today\u2019s, date back about 4,300 to 5,300 years, the researchers said. Gary Crawford, a University of Toronto\u00a0Mississauga anthropology professor who took part in the study published in the journal PLOS ONE, said there were many reasons why the peach tree was a good candidate for domestication. It is relatively quick maturing - producing fruit in just two to three years - as well as being responsive to breeding for size and sweetness, among other qualities. \u201cIt\u2019s also tasty and produces a lot of fruit. They are rich in vitamins A and C and have a lot of energy - calories - per fruit,\u201d Crawford added. \u201cThe flavor is amazing. I like eating them raw mostly, but peach pies and peach crumble are right up there.\u201d   Radiocarbon dating of the pits showed peaches split from their wild ancestors as long as 7,500 years ago. Peaches went from being small with very little flesh to a robust fruit like we see today. Crawford said the wild ancestor of the peach apparently is extinct. \u201cIn China, the peach is a symbol of long life and has a significant role to play in Chinese culture,\u201d said Crawford, adding that conventional wisdom had been that the peach originated somewhere else in China. It was a capable Chinese culture called the Kuahuqiao that seems to have begun peach domestication. Rice domestication was already under way in the area. \u201cThey were settled in small towns, had a broad spectrum of foods and other resources, had dugout canoes and were burning areas of the landscape for managing the local ecosystems,\u201d Crawford said. They also raised pigs, kept domesticated dogs, stored large amounts of acorns, used wooden tools and made high-quality wheel-turned pottery, Crawford said.

At the same time,  local authorities are offering coupons to residents in hopes they will spend money to revive an economy ravaged by the outbreak. On Friday, China is expected to report that its economy shrank by 6.5% in the first quarter, in what would be the first contraction since at least 1992, when it first started issuing quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) data. New imported cases dropped to 34 on Wednesday from 36 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said, down for the third straight day, amid stringent border checks, reduced international flights, and a ban on entry by foreigners. But the number of locally transmitted cases rose to 12 from 10 a day earlier, with Beijing seeing three new local cases, the first since March 23. The other new local cases on Wednesday were in the provinces of Heilongjiang and Guangdong, both of which have been battling an influx of infected travellers, mostly Chinese nationals returning from abroad. Overall, mainland China reported 46 new confirmed cases on Wednesday, the same as a day earlier, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 82,341. On Thursday, state television reported that President Xi Jinping had approved the withdrawal of 4,000 army medical personnel who had been sent to the central province of Hubei, where the outbreak originated, in another milestone as the province and its capital city Wuhan return towards normal.

Wisconsin plays host to about 112 million tourists in a year, according to the WorldAtlas website, and 2019 was \"\"a record setting year, and the largest year for Wisconsin in at least a decade\"\" said Wisconsin Secretary of Tourism-designee Sara Meaney. However, the loss of revenue in 2020 is massive, she said. In a May 24, 2020, appearance on the WISN-TV (Channel 12) show \"\"UpFront,\"\" she said, \"\"Unemployment in our state in general is at about a quarter of our population. It\u2019s actually over 50% of travel and tourism-related jobs that are now facing unemployment.\"\" Meaney went on to say that just in the weeks since the pandemic hit, the state has lost more than a billion dollars in tourism dollars. \"\"Since the week ending March 14, Wisconsin actually saw a drop in tourism spending compared to last year of $1.7 billion,\"\" she said. Wisconsin\u2019s tourism industry should come back a bit this summer. Some northern resorts have opened and state campgrounds reopened June 10, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. But that tourism recovery could be an uphill climb if Meaney is correct that year-over-year weekly travel spending in the state has dropped $1.7 billion since March. Let\u2019s take a look. Craig Trost, Wisconsin Department of Tourism communications director, pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the U.S. Travel Association, which commissioned a study by Tourism Economics, the firm the department uses for its economic impact data. The U.S. Travel Association is a national, non-profit organization representing the travel industry, with various sectors \u2014 including transportation, lodging, retail, recreation, leisure and entertainment and food service, meetings and trade shows. Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, explained that the analysis is based on a combination of factors: daily hotel data (nights and revenue) from STR, a research company that tracks the hospitality industry; flight data (seats and passengers) from Airline Data Inc. and the Transportation Security Administration; and drive travel data (outside 50 mile radius) from Arrivalist based on mobile device data. Trost said the week ending March 14 was significant because that is when COVID-19 began significantly impacting tourism spending. \"\"Since the beginning of March, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over $176 billion in losses for the U.S. travel economy,\"\" the report states. According to the report, Wisconsin\u2019s\u00a0 year-over-year net change in weekly travel spending from the week ending March 28 to the week ending May 16 was down about $200 million each week. When going back earlier in March, the report notes losses for the week ending March 14 at $17 million and the week ending March 21 of $50 million. That brings the total to $1.775 billion. Romy Snyder, CEO/President of the Wisconsin Dells Visitor and Convention Bureau, said it will take time to correctly analyze and know the  financial impact of COVID-19 on Wisconsin Dells. \"\"We do know the loss of visitors has been detrimental to the local tourism economy,\"\" Snyder said in an email. \"\"According to 2019 numbers, the spring and summer seasons account for 66% of direct visitor spending in Wisconsin Dells.\"\" Snyder said area businesses are ready to welcome visitors. \"\"Wisconsin Dells\u2019 businesses are working to accommodate current visitors to the area in a safe manner by increasing sanitation procedures and limiting capacities and hours of operation,\"\" Snyder said. \"\"We know Wisconsin Dells has strong brand awareness in the Midwest, which will help our area when people are ready to travel and are looking for an accessible vacation destination with a diversity of activities.\"\" Jon Jarosh of Destination Door County said area businesses have been getting ready and opening up. \"\"Everybody has a little different protocol in terms of what they\u2019re going to allow at their particular business,\"\" Jarosh said on the same \"\"UpFront\"\" program where Meaney appeared via remote. \"\"We\u2019re asking our visitors and residents that are out and about to just respect the individual businesses and what they are asking for. But by and large most businesses are going to be asking that their customers do wear a face covering of some sort and also just practice social distancing guidelines.\"\" A major Dells attraction, Noah\u2019s Ark water park, set its opening date for June 20, the first day of summer. The water park plans a number of precautions in line with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those precautions include social distancing and limiting capacity not only in the park itself but also on specific attractions and in buildings. The park is requiring guests to RSVP for the day they want to visit, and visitors must buy tickets in advance online. Walk-up tickets will not be sold. Meaney said the state\u2019s tourism losses have topped $1.7 billion since March. Data from weekly studies commissioned by the U.S. Travel Association, an organization with over 1,100 members nationwide, found that beginning the week ending March 14, when the COVID-19 crisis first began to significantly impact tourism spending, Wisconsin was down $17 million compared to a year earlier. The drop in year-over-year travel spending in the state mounted weekly, with the latest available report reporting a drop of $214 million for the week ending May 16.

Legislation to restrict abortion rights has been introduced this year in 16 states, four of whose governors have signed bills banning abortion if an embryonic heartbeat can be detected. The Alabama bill goes further, banning abortions at any time. Those performing abortions would be committing a felony, punishable by 10 to 99 years in prison, although a woman who receives an abortion would not be held criminally liable. The Republican-controlled Alabama Senate also defeated a Democratic amendment that would have allowed legal abortions for women and girls impregnated by rape and incest. Anti-abortion advocates know any laws they pass are certain to be challenged, and courts this year have blocked a restrictive Kentucky law and another in Iowa passed last year. But supporters of the Alabama ban said the right to life of the unborn child transcends other rights, an idea they would like tested.

Defining \u201cadverse events\u201d would also have been good, since it\u2019s not clear whether they mean momentary pain or a debilitating flare-up of long-term pain. According to the study, the pain\u2013for both MBSR and CBT groups\u2013was \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and no \u201cserious\u201d adverse events were reported. Those things are worth mentioning. (It\u2019s also worth finding out what \u201cmostly\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d mean.) The story describes the study in detail, explicitly stating the study size and the absolute percentages in each arm that had benefit. It also acknowledged the study was randomized. We\u2019ll count this as sufficient for Satisfactory, keeping in mind the following: As explained in the summary above, the story doesn\u2019t make clear MBSR and CBT were used in addition to conventional medical treatment, rather than instead of medical treatment. The story didn\u2019t mention that the study excluded participants with what the study authors term \u201ca specific diagnosis (eg, spinal stenosis).\u201d In other words, the study did not address treatments for back pain caused by issues like a herniated disc or rheumatoid arthritis. Many readers have these conditions, and should be informed that\u00a0these study results may not be applicable to their situation. Lastly, we would have welcomed a discussion of the high rates of success within the\u00a0control group. Forty-four percent in that group experienced a gain in functionality, for example. That seems pretty good! What do the researchers have to say about that? No disease mongering here. However, we did want to point out that the story \u201cfear mongers\u201d in a sense, by stating back pain is \u201cone reason why more and more people are addicted to painkillers.\u201d The story insinuates that these other treatment methods\u2013especially meditation\u2013could help with that. And maybe they could. But the study itself says \u201cNo overall differences in treatment effects were observed for\u2026self-reported use of medications for back pain.\u201d So why the mention\u00a0of painkiller addiction? Conflicts of interest don\u2019t appear to be an issue here, and the story includes\u00a0statements from\u00a0an accompanying editorial in JAMA, which was written by experts unaffiliated with the research. This squeaks by as Satisfactory, though it should be noted that most of this material was available via news releases (see below). The story is effectively all about comparing alternatives, though\u2013again\u2013it should have made clear that MBSR and CBT were used in conjunction with conventional medical treatment, and it left out discussion of other well-known non-medication treatment methods, such as exercise. It\u2019s not clear from the story whether MBSR is widely available, is available in mainly metropolitan areas, or is a relatively new field that is still uncommon. The story does quote from a separate editorial in JAMA that says health care systems \u201cshould provide access to affordable mind-body therapies,\u201d\u00a0implying that it\u2019s not widely available. Is this the case, or can it be easily accessed? Given the constraints of a brief news story, the piece does a nice job of articulating the differences between MBSR and CBT. It would\u00a0have been even more helpful for the story to mention previous studies on the impact of MBSR and CBT on low back pain, to help us understand how novel this new study is. There is little in the story that is not found in the two news releases issued on this study. (Those releases can be found here and here.)

The story does a good job of quantifying\u00a0the benefits and risks seen in the study. However, there were three things we wanted to call special attention to: \u00a0 Lower back pain is an extremely common problem around the world. For example, a 2012 paper reported that lower back pain was responsible for more than three percent of all emergency room visits in the United States. An earlier paper found that health care expenditures in the U.S. directly attributable to back pain came to around $26 billion.

They had talked about the Appalachian Trail in their first conversation and, when it came time to plan a honeymoon, they decided to make the hike. \u201cThis was going to be an epic adventure,\u201d Eagle told The Associated Press. The couple spent a year researching, training and saving before setting off on the 2,190-mile (3,525-kilometer) journey seven days after their wedding. They knew about the new coronavirus spreading across the globe but considered themselves lucky to be trading Brooklyn for a tent on the trail, especially as New York fell under restrictions to prevent to the virus\u2019s spread. \u201cWe always figured that being out on the trail and seeing a dozen people a day was a fine position to be in,\u201d Hall said. As the pandemic grows, hikers face the difficult decision to postpone their dreams or ignore warnings and forge ahead. Like virtually every other entity in the U.S., the Appalachian Trail Conservancy began issuing COVID-19 safety guidance in March. But social distancing and hand-washing suggestions soon shifted to urging all hikers to leave the trail immediately. Shelters and privies were shut down, and volunteer programs were halted. On Wednesday, the conservancy and 29 other trail-maintaining clubs asked federal officials to close the trail until the end of the month. Though more than 3,000 \u201cthru-hikers\u201d set out to traverse the length of the trail each year, only about 25% successfully make the hike from Georgia to Maine, which typically takes about six months. Eagle and Hall never considered any scenario but finishing. They picked up speed as they moved into the Great Smoky Mountains along the Tennessee-North Carolina border. They woke to sunrise on Clingmans Dome \u2014 the trail\u2019s highest point \u2014 a view that seemed to sum up exactly what they\u2019d hoped for from their newlywed adventure. At the same time, families across the U.S. braced for lockdowns as COVID-19 spread through cities and towns claiming more lives. Days would pass before Eagle and Hall had enough cellphone service to see just how dire the crisis had become. Fellow thru-hiker Kimberly Selvage was 30 minutes from Hot Springs, North Carolina, when she called a local hostel to confirm her reservation. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Ma\u2019am, I think you\u2019ve been in the woods too long; the whole world is shutting down,\u2019\u201d she said. That wasn\u2019t exactly the type of solitude Selvage had in mind when she quit her job, rented out her house in Las Vegas and started her hike on Feb. 26. Selvage, 51, said she thrives by herself and set out to hike the trail alone, so when whispers of closures and restrictions started to spread, she wasn\u2019t too concerned and pressed on. With her two kids in college and her parents gone, the Appalachian Trail was home for the time being, and it\u2019s where she believed she was safest. Leaving it would mean a cross-country drive exposing her to far more people than she encounters while hiking, she said. But as more trails closed and communities issued shelter-in-place orders, Selvage decided to throw in the towel for the time being after hiking 470 miles (755 kilometers). \u201cThe closures and general virus fear was changing the vibe of my hike,\u201d said Selvage, who started the hike, in part, to experience the culture of trail towns. \u201cI chose to pause to get the full experience when it was less controversial.\u201d Selvage rented an SUV and drove back home to Las Vegas. She slept in the back of the car. Now, she\u2019s renting out a room in a friend\u2019s house until the all-clear is given to hike again. \u201cI still think I was safer on the trail,\u201d Selvage said. For Eagle and Hall, deciding to stay or go was brutal. The couple debated day after day as they hiked over rocks and waterfalls. They hadn\u2019t yet come to terms with their choice when they loaded their backpacks into the trunk of a rental car in Tennessee. \u201cEven right now, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d Eagle said through tears. Their decision came down to the small chance that they might catch and spread the virus, something Eagle said she couldn\u2019t live with. Most people with COVID-19 experience mild to moderate symptoms, but for others it can cause more severe illness or death. For now, they\u2019ll stay with her parents in Louisiana, which has more than 12,000 confirmed cases. \u201cIs that better? That\u2019s hard to say,\u201d she said. They\u2019ll try to stay in shape while they wait for the all-clear. Hall joked about looking into a treadmill sale he saw online. But as the timeline becomes grimmer with each passing day, he thinks they might be saying goodbye to the AT for good. His wife disagrees and sees them starting again in a few months. Until then, she\u2019s trying to keep her disappointment in perspective. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to focus in on the fact that we are in such a better position than most of the world,\u201d she said. ___ Follow Sarah Blake Morgan at www.twitter.com/StorytellerSBM ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.

Chris Christie may be more popular than ever, but the Republican isn\u2019t taking any chances with seeking re-election in a majority Democrat state. Witness a new TV ad released Monday by his re-election campaign, Christie for Governor. The ad starts off with pictures of Christie\u2019s Democratic challenger, state Sen. Barbara Buono, as a narrator introduces her as former Gov. Jon Corzine\u2019s budget chair. Buono chaired the Senate\u2019s Budget and Appropriations Committee for two years during Corzine\u2019s tenure. \"\"Buono voted 154 times to raise our taxes -- like the sales tax, the income tax, health care taxes, even small business taxes,\"\" the narrator states as text in the commercial states she voted to raise taxes and fees. This ad is a variation on a theme mentioned previously by Christie, and it\u2019s also right on target. First, some background about tax increases. During his State of the State address earlier this year Christie noted that New Jersey saw more than 100 increases in taxes and fees in the eight years before he became governor, which is similar to the new TV ad about Buono, the Democratic challenger in the November gubernatorial race. In addition, state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. (R-Westfield) made a similar claim in an Oct. 7, 2011 news release when he tied 115 votes for tax increases to jobs leaving New Jersey. For both previous fact-checks, Republicans provided us with a list that included tax and fee hikes as well as tax policy changes that occurred between fiscal years 2003 and 2010. Now let\u2019s review the 154 increases. The Christie for Governor camp provided us with a list of the 154 increases they claim Buono supported both in the Senate and when she served in the Assembly. We reviewed each vote and found that the list given us mirrors the previous Republican-provided lists, plus additional votes. Although Democrats sponsored most of the bills in question, a few had Republican support. Democrats held legislative majorities in the eight years before Christie became governor. His predecessors during that time were Jim McGreevey, Richard Codey and Corzine. Among the increases were raising the sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent and applying the tax to services such as tanning and limousine rides; increases in the cigarette tax; and allowing towns to impose parking taxes and surcharges. Also, the state twice increased the gross income tax on New Jerseyans with six-figure incomes: in 2004 for those with income exceeding $500,000 and again in 2009 for those incomes above $400,000. In addition to tax increases were hikes in dozens of fees, such as a new $1.50 fee on the sale of new vehicle tires; imposing fees on certain realty transfers; on hotel/motel occupancies; increases in the minimum casino hotel parking charge; and raising the fee to file for divorce. Overall, the lists provided by Republicans showed that there were dozens of increases in taxes or fees or other tax policy changes that could result in individuals or businesses paying higher taxes. We calculated the votes and confirmed that Buono did vote 154 times in favor of higher taxes and fees. After we shared the list with Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner, we received a list back pointing out cuts that Christie has made to various tax credit rebates and programs; legislation the governor signed resulting in assessments on ambulatory care facilities and insurers; and other legislation signed by Christie allowing government authorities to charge fees. \"\"Barbara Buono has spent her life in public service fighting for New Jersey's middle class and working people,\"\" Turner said in an e-mail. \"\"Throughout her career she has pushed to make large corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share and reduce the tax burden on New Jersey's working families. And she has consistently voted to hold lawbreakers accountable\u2014if Governor Christie believes it was wrong to stiffen penalties for deadbeat dads, impose tougher fines on tax cheats and force polluters to help pay for damaging our environment and threatening public health, he should say so.\"\" Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts declined comment. Our ruling A Christie for Governor TV ad claims, \"\"Buono voted 154 times to raise our taxes -- like the sales tax, the income tax, health care taxes, even small business taxes.\"\" Although a narrator only mentions tax increases, scrolling text in the ad also mentions fee increases. And in this case, the ad is accurate: Buono did vote on 154 bills that would increase fees and taxes on things ranging from the purchase of new vehicle tires to those New Jerseyans earning six-figure incomes exceeding $400,000.

Joe Biden is why we\u2019re working longer hours for lower wages. from SandersForPresidentThat thread had a long title: \u201cJoe Biden passed the bill that made student loans ineligible for financial relief. Joe Biden is the reason so many of us don\u2019t have families yet. Joe Biden is why we can\u2019t afford houses. Joe Biden is why we\u2019re working longer hours for lower wages.\u201dBy contrast, in the ten-second video, Sanders said:Joe Biden voted for a bankruptcy bill, on behalf of the credit card companies, and that bill has done a lot of harm to working families all over this country \u2026 I voted against it.A difference in wording between the title and the clip was important \u2014 the original poster stated Biden \u201cpassed the bill,\u201d while Sanders stated that Biden had \u201cvoted for a bankruptcy bill.\u201d Here, we are examining whether Biden voted for a bankruptcy bill with the described features, as Biden himself was not empowered to \u201cpass\u201d a bill \u2014 presumably the submitter was echoing Sanders\u2019 claims in the clip.The snippet originated from a longer interview with Sanders conducted by MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on March 4 2020. Although MSNBC curated short clips from the interview, none was specifically labeled as having to do with Sanders\u2019 claim about Biden and the bankruptcy bill. (We were unable to find a transcript. )In the clip we transcribed above, Sanders didn\u2019t mention a specific bill. However, it wasn\u2019t difficult to narrow down specific legislation due to the prominence of student debt as an issue in the 2020 primary.In December 2019,\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0published\u00a0an article with a headline (\u201cHow Biden helped create the student debt problem he now promises to fix\u201d) making claims similar to those made by Sanders in the brief video shared to Reddit. With a subheading claiming that the \u201cformer vice-president and 2020 presidential hopeful backed a 2005 bill that stripped students of bankruptcy protections and left millions in financial stress,\u201d it reported in part:In [February 2020] Joe Biden will lay \u201cJoe\u2019s vision for America\u201d at the feet of Iowa\u2019s caucus-goers in the hope that the first voters in the Democratic presidential race will put him on the road to the White House.Among his promises is that he will fix the student loan crisis saddling 45 million Americans with crippling debt now totalling a staggering $1.5tn \u2026 [Biden\u2019s] pledge is one of the most striking policies on offer from Democratic candidates in the 2020 race, given how the problem Biden now proposes to resolve came about in the first place. Private student loans were largely stripped of bankruptcy protections in 2005 in a congressional move that had the devastating impact of tripling such debt over a decade and locking in millions of Americans to years of grueling repayments.The Republican-led bill tightened the bankruptcy code, unleashing a huge giveaway to lenders at the expense of indebted student borrowers. At the time it faced vociferous opposition from 25 Democrats in the US Senate.But it passed anyway, with 18 Democratic senators breaking ranks and casting their vote in favor of the bill. Of those 18, one politician stood out as an especially enthusiastic champion of the credit companies who, as it happens, had given him hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions \u2013 Joe Biden.The Guardian quoted\u00a0University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill law professor\u00a0Melissa Jacoby on Biden\u2019s role in the bill\u2019s passage:Biden was one of the most powerful people who could have said no, who could have changed this. Instead he used his leadership role to limit the ability of other Democrats who had concerns and who wanted the bill softened[. ]In January 2020, TheIntercept.com covered the origins and progression of student loan debt in the United States, up to and including its prevalence in Democratic primary debates and platforms.\u2026 as a senator from Delaware, Biden was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the disastrous 2005 bankruptcy bill that made it nearly impossible for borrowers to reduce their student loan debt. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act raised the bar for families to pursue Chapter 7 bankruptcy protections. It overwhelmingly passed in the Senate at the end of the Clinton administration, over the objections of [Elizabeth] Warren, then a bankruptcy expert who had tangled for years with Biden over the issue. She lobbied first lady Hillary Clinton, who herself persuaded Bill Clinton to veto it.Biden came back to the legislation under the Bush administration; it passed the Senate in 2005 on a 74-25 vote, with most Democratic lawmakers, including then-Sen. Barack Obama, voting against it. ([Hillary] Clinton, by then a senator from New York, voted for it.) George W. Bush signed it into law, and private student loan debt skyrocketed in the wake of its passage. The total amount of private student loan debt more than doubled between 2005 and 2011, growing from $55.9 billion to $140.2 billion, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.In February 2020, RealClearPolitics examined Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign stance on student debt, and contrasted it with his support in the early 2000s for more restrictions on student borrowers:Biden\u2019s student-loan plan represents a radical departure from positions he held during bankruptcy-law negotiations in the early 2000s. Then a senator from Delaware, he forcefully backed measures that made it much harder for private student-loan borrowers filing for bankruptcy to shed that debt. Representing many of the big financial institutions based in his home state, Biden was such a reliable advocate for the financial services industry that he was often referred to as \u201cthe senator from MBNA,\u201d the credit-card company that regularly doled out contributions to his campaigns.In promoting a 2005 bankruptcy reform measure, Biden argued that too many people were skipping out of their debts too easily and sticking other borrowers with the bill while interest rates rose as a result\u2026\u00a0A bankruptcy court judge also testifying [the same day as Biden] took issue with Biden\u2019s stance, arguing that government-backed student loans aren\u2019t dischargeable \u2013 something that has remained the case since then, as well.\u201cYou would never be able to [discharge government-backed student loans like] that,\u201d Judge Randall Newsome said.\u201cLike heck you can\u2019t,\u201d Biden countered. \u201c\u2026You are full of malarkey, judge.\u201dNewsome was just one of the many opponents of the bill whom Biden sparred with at the time. Elizabeth Warren, then a Harvard law professor, opposed the bankruptcy bill so aggressively that she says it inspired her to run for the Senate.\u201cI got in that fight because [families] just didn\u2019t have anyone, and Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies,\u201d Warren said at an April rally in Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of public record.\u201dAs Newsome noted, discharging government-backed student loans is, and has always been, nearly impossible. However, the 2005 bill was described as involving private student loan debt, not debt held by the federal government.In January 2020,\u00a0 the\u00a0American Prospect reported\u00a0that Biden had voted several times against \u201csoftening\u201d the effects of that bill (abbreviated as BAPCPA) on myriad demographics hardest hit by its provisions:Biden also consistently voted against efforts to soften BAPCPA\u2019s blow on vulnerable populations. He voted against three amendments to ease bankruptcy requirements for consumers whose financial troubles stem from medical expenses. He voted against an amendment that would have helped seniors keep their homes. He voted against exempting servicemembers and widows of servicemembers killed in action from the law\u2019s eligibility restrictions. He voted against an amendment to exempt women whose financial troubles stemmed from deadbeat husbands\u2019 failure to pay child support or alimony. And Biden even voted against an amendment that would have ensured that children of debtors could still be given birthday and Christmas presents. Biden also voted against allowing debtors to pay their union dues during bankruptcy, potentially imperiling their employment and ability to achieve financial rehabilitation.In excerpts above, the bill Biden was often accused of supporting was referenced by its name \u2014\u00a0the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. Text of the bill was available on Congress.gov, and Section 220 of the bill declared\u00a0both private and federal student debt exempt from being discharged in bankruptcy. A summary of all of the bill\u2019s points can be viewed here.In the clip, Sanders made two claims about voting on the bill, stating that Biden voted for it, and that he \u2014 Sanders \u2014 had voted against it. According to Senate.gov, Biden voted in favor of the bill in the Senate on March 10 2005. Per GovTrack.us, Sanders (then in the House of Representatives) did vote against the same bill on April 14 2005.On Reddit, a post to r/SandersForPresident misstated Sanders\u2019 statement on the 2005 bankruptcy bill making it virtually impossible to discharge private student debt. Sanders said that Biden \u201cvoted for a bankruptcy bill, on behalf of the credit card companies, and that bill has done a lot of harm to working families all over this country \u2026 I voted against it.\u201d Sanders was correct \u2014 Biden was among the few Democrats voting in favor of that 2005 bill in the Senate, and when it came around to the House the following month, Sanders voted against it.

Chief among the concerns raised by doctors working in the Louisiana city is the death rate, which is twice that of New York and over four times that of Seattle, based on Thursday\u2019s publicly reported data. New Orleans residents suffer from obesity, diabetes and hypertension at rates higher than the national average, conditions that doctors and public health officials say can make patients more vulnerable to COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. Some 97% of those killed by COVID-19 in Louisiana had a pre-existing condition, according to the state health department. Diabetes was seen in 40% of the deaths, obesity in 25%, chronic kidney disease in 23% and cardiac problems in 21%. Orleans Parish, which encompasses the city, reported 125 confirmed coronavirus deaths as of Thursday, the equivalent of 32 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people. That rate for New York City was at 15.9 on Thursday. New Orleans could be a harbinger for the potential toll the pandemic could take in other parts of the South and Midwest that also have high rates of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. A host of other factors could contribute to New Orleans\u2019 high death rate from COVID-19, ranging from access to healthcare and hospital quality, to the prevalence of other conditions, including lung disease, health officials say. But they also note that it is clear that obesity-related conditions are playing a role in the deaths. That could be a warning sign for the United States at large, where chronic obesity is more common than in other developed countries, they said. Hospitals are reporting cases across the generations -mothers and daughters, fathers and sons - being intubated and cared for in the same intensive care units, said Tracey Moffatt, the chief nursing officer at Ochsner Health, the largest healthcare provider in Louisiana. The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease in New Orleans and Louisiana plays into that, she said. Those family members often suffered from the same medical conditions before becoming sick, leaving them similarly vulnerable to the coronavirus despite their age gaps. \u201cWe had a case where a mom was already in the ICU and the daughter, who was obese, came in,\u201d she said. \u201cThe daughter asked staff to wheel her by her mom\u2019s room so she could say goodbye before she herself was intubated. We knew the mother was going to pass away.\u201d  Both patients suffered from obesity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week released for the first time a report showing that 78% of COVID-19 patients in ICUs in the United States had an underlying health condition, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease. The CDC report was based on a sample of under 6% of reported coronavirus infections, but doctors in Louisiana said it was consistent with what they are seeing, and it is in line with what other countries like Italy and China have faced. Those percentages, said Dr. Joseph Kanter, an emergency department doctor and the top public health official in New Orleans, are likely similar in cities across the United States. \u201cWhat we worry about here is that we have more people in our communities with those conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re more vulnerable than other communities, and the number of deaths we\u2019ve seen illustrates that.\u201d   The New Orleans metropolitan statistical area ranks among the worst in the United States for the percentage of residents with diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, a Reuters analysis of CDC data shows.

Kouame claimed they give him a jolt of energy other drinks can\u2019t match \u2014 just what he needs to face a long day of hectic traffic, run-ins with police and testy fare negotiations. \u201cIt inspires me. It gives me a bit of courage to confront the challenges of life,\u201d he said. From now on, however, Ivory Coast\u2019s government wants Kouame to get his courage elsewhere. Last month, officials announced a ban on alcohol sachets, citing their health risks and the need to combat alcoholism, especially among youth. The measure is one of more than a half-dozen bans or partial bans on alcohol sachets in effect in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Health Organization. Other countries with bans include Zambia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo and South Sudan, said Jean-Marie Vianny Maurice Yameogo, the WHO\u2019s Ivory Coast representative. Tracking the sales of alcohol sachets, many containing spirits distilled from palm wine, is difficult because they are often produced outside regulated markets. The sachets are typically mass-produced in West Africa, with colorful packaging. The drink \u201cAmour Profond,\u201d or \u201cDeep Love,\u201d shows a man standing behind a bare-shouldered woman, whispering into her ear. The sachets are not necessarily more potent than other drinks available. Palm wine-based traditional drinks such as koutoukou, which are similarly cheap, can have alcohol by volume rates of more than 50 percent. But sachets are more likely to contain toxic chemicals such as methanol, or wood alcohol, Yameogo said. And the packaging often boasts of health and other benefits that Yameogo said have no basis in science. Some are said to provide cures for maladies such as hemorrhoids, while others are reputed to function as appetite-suppressants or aphrodisiacs. Moreover, the small sachets are easy to hide, making them especially tempting for schoolchildren, according to the Ivorian government and the WHO. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s accessible to everyone. You can buy a sachet, put it in your pocket and just walk around like that,\u201d said Patrick Gbodou, president of School Anti-Drug, an Ivorian organization that campaigns against drinking and drug use by students. The official drinking age in Ivory Coast is 21, but it is rarely enforced, and teenage drinking is common. Vendors are worried they will take a huge hit if the ban on sachets is enforced, as many drinkers go for sachets and nothing else. \u201cThe government needs to have pity on us,\u201d said Adjo Abega, the owner of a bar in Abidjan\u2019s Port-Bouet district. Drinkers generally acknowledge the health risks posed by alcohol sachets, but some criticized the government for cracking down on their favorite vice while permitting other health hazards such as cigarettes. Desire N\u2019Guessan, an unemployed 26-year-old, began drinking sachets when he was a teenager. He said he relies on them to ward off illness and for motivation to keep looking for work. \u201cWhen you are not able to overcome your timidity, it can be difficult to operate in your neighborhood,\u201d N\u2019Guessan said. If the government makes good on the ban, he warned, Ivorian children could turn to drugs. He also predicted marches and protests. But Kouame, the taxi driver, was less worried. In the absence of alcohol sachets, he said he would switch up his morning routine by drinking glasses of palm wine instead, adding: \u201cMan can adapt to anything.\u201d Claim: Ivory Coast is latest to crack down on alcohol sachets.", "output": "Each morning at dawn, taxi driver Rene Kouame stops by his neighborhood bar in Abidjan for a potent pick-me-up: two plastic sachets of \u201cChe Guevara,\u201d a drink of spiced rum and a host of chemicals that costs 100 CFA francs, or about 15 U.S. cents.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

He traced it to the continuous dose of nicotine and then realized it was precisely that steady release that made patches inadequate for him. Without the sharp nicotine highs he got from smoking, he found there was no relaxation or stress relief. Armed with a background in Oriental medicine, knowledge of mechanics and an interest in electronics, Hon set out to make something that would mimic smoking - without the deadly smoke. His drive was galvanized further when his father, also a smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer shortly afterwards. He died in 2004. \u201cI believed that if I could use vapor to simulate cigarette smoke, this could help me,\u201d Hon told Reuters on Tuesday. Thirteen years on from those nightmares, the 59-year-old stopped off in London after participating in a global summit in Warsaw on nicotine as the father of the most disruptive technology the industry has seen. He is also now employed by one of its biggest players, Imperial Tobacco Group, following Imperial\u2019s 2013 purchase of Hon\u2019s business. Imperial, the world\u2019s fourth-largest tobacco company, will become a major e-cigarette player in the United States following its purchase of the Blu brand in a deal expected to close this week. E-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into vapor, have ignited a global market for \u201cvaping\u201d products that could top $7 billion this year. In the absence of definitive studies about the long-term health effects of vaping, they are the subject of great debate. Tobacco giants including Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco are also racing to enter the market as governments race to control it. \u2018CLOUD-CHASERS\u2019  Authorities in Wales on Tuesday proposed a new public health law that would ban e-cigarettes in enclosed spaces like offices and restaurants following similar moves in Ireland and elsewhere. Some regulators fear e-cigarettes could lead non-smokers to vape or even smoke, while proponents say bans discourage smokers from switching. \u201cE-cigarettes are a consumer-driven revolution,\u201d Hon said, noting the array of products now on the market that address the needs of various groups, from people wanting to cut back or quit smoking to a new band of recreational \u201ccloud-chasers\u201d who use nicotine-free vapor to blow the biggest and densest clouds. \u201cWhen automotive manufacturers first started out, they were not thinking about a sport to be called Formula One. You always have groups of people who are looking for excitement,\u201d Hon said of the cloud-chasing phenomenon. Although most e-cigarettes are manufactured in China, the market there is very small and tobacco smoking remains high. China is by far the world\u2019s biggest tobacco market, and is a virtual monopoly dominated by state-owned firm China National Tobacco. Some estimates peg revenue from tobacco sales as making up as much as 10 percent of the government\u2019s coffers. Yet Hon could soon see more people in his home city of Beijing vaping, due to this month\u2019s implementation of strict rules on smoking in public places. Anyone who violates a ban on smoking in restaurants, hotels, schools, hospitals and in certain outdoor public places must pay a 200 yuan ($32.25) fine. That is 20 times the current, albeit rarely enforced, penalty. Hon said second and third-tier cities in China could follow Beijing\u2019s lead as governments seek to improve public health. \u201cI understand the market is slowly changing,\u201d said Hon, who now only smokes when his job requires him to compare the flavors of various tobaccos and vapes. \u201cWhat could happen to the Chinese market could be similar to what\u2019s happening here.\u201d Claim: E-cigs a 'consumer-driven' revolution born from a bad dream.", "output": "Before Hon Lik invented the e-cigarette, a device now shaking up the Big Tobacco industry, he was a pharmacist in China struggling to quit a two-to-three pack a day smoking habit.", "category": "Explanation 487.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

It also provides addiction services including inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation, and treatment services for those who get Suboxone, a prescription medication used to treat opioid addictions. If it closes, the letter said that would mean finding services for 2,500 inpatients annually as well as filling new gaps for Suboxone treatment services, residential programs for children and meeting other critical health needs. On Sunday, Vermont Human Services Secretary Michael Smith said he had rejected a request for an additional $2 million in funding from the retreat. That request would be added to a financial package valued at an estimated $16 million for new beds and a recent rate increase valued at an estimated $3.5 million per year. Smith said he rejected the request in part because he believes it would constitute a taxpayer bailout of financial miscalculations by Brattleboro Retreat\u2019s management. But Josephson said the state wasn\u2019t paying it enough to care for the patients the state wants cared for. On Friday, Josephson sent a letter Friday to Smith and Gov.

It was singled out in LME proposals to embed responsible sourcing principles into metal brands deliverable against its contracts, which include copper and zinc. Most of the world\u2019s supply comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, often from artisanal mines where several organizations have cited human rights abuses. The LME plan outlined last October involves suspending cobalt brands trading at a significant discount to its contract on the grounds that they may be seen as tainted. Now, objections by NGOs to a consultation on its plans could leave the exchange at risk of legal challenges from banned cobalt producers, metal industry sources say. The LME will publish its proposals this quarter. \u201cThe LME received 39 responses to its recent discussion paper on responsible sourcing,\u201d the exchange said. \u201cThe LME\u2019s role is now to identify a path forwards which balances the diverse views of its stakeholders (including civil society organizations), while achieving the LME\u2019s stated aim of helping the broader metals industry embrace key principles of responsible sourcing and environmental stewardship.\u201d  The letter from the NGOs said the LME should not immediately ban cobalt brands and that it should work with firms that produce them to ensure responsible sourcing. \u201cIt is short-sighted and irresponsible of the LME to single out cobalt and tin as higher risk metals above others, or to single out (artisanal) material as implicitly higher risk,\u201d the letter signed by 14 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) said. All companies involved with the exchange should implement responsible sourcing practices in line with the OECD Guidance, the letter dated Dec. 3 said. The OECD Guidance says companies should report in detail about their supply chains and advises on ways in which they can uncover and address human rights and corruption issues. \u201cHeightened supply chain due diligence on cobalt, as with all other LME metals, must be triggered by assessment of all supply chain risks, including corruption risks,\u201d the NGO letter said. Sources say the business of an exchange is to facilitate trade between buyers and sellers. \u201cThe NGOs don\u2019t understand the difference between end consumers and the LME. The LME is a market of last resort, you can\u2019t choose which metal to take or reject,\u201d a metal trading source said. \u201cConsumers can choose where they source their cobalt from, people buying on the LME can\u2019t, that\u2019s why there is such a deep discount between LME cobalt prices and (Fastmarkets MB)\u201d  Cobalt prices published by Fastmarkets MB at around $44,000 a tonne are $12,000 a tonne higher than those for the LME\u2019s contract, which was launched in 2010. However, the NGOs say singling out low-priced cobalt typically produced by artisanal miners ignores other \u201cserious red flags\u201d such as corruption by large-scale miners of all metals. \u201cIs the LME trying to create a reputational green wash that allows it to say its members source responsibly because they tick some boxes,\u201d said Sophie Pickles, who leads Global Witness\u2019 work on conflict mineral. The director of \u201cmines to market\u201d at NGO Pact, Karen Hayes, said the LME\u2019s plan lacked detail on implementation. \u201cWe are more than willing to work with the LME or any companies seeking to comply with the LME\u2019s responsible sourcing standards,\u201d she said.
