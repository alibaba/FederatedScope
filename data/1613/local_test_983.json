Some of the recipes can be modified to fit the point values if one uses reduced-fat or fat-free products, but the recipe for 1 pound of bacon used in the \"Delicious Chicken BBQ Ranch\" recipe definitely does not meet the WW Freestyle program.

However this is one of my favorite purchases. Everything works perfectly for several months thus far. The video of the guy easily breaking into the safe is a bit misleading; however there is an access \"key slot\" under the Stanley plate. If you're that worried about someone breaking in I suggest a bigger safe and a change of location haha. I added two motion sensor lights to the inside which really makes a huge difference. The door had a little play in it when closed, a thin foam tape fixed that. I also read a review about finger print issues; if you dont reset the safe before entering prints then any print will work, says so in the manual. Do a proper setup and it works great. If your worried about speed of access I suggest logging your middle finger as well, you can then hit the key and read your print in one motion thia is also much more comfortable. Another thing is log your finger in several positions for easy access. Somehow I was able to disable the open door alarm which I was happy about. I intend to mount this inside a large gun safe so the fact that it is not fireproof is less of an issue to me otherwise that would be the only downside. Highly recommend this safe. \n Polarity: negative", "output": "False", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 431.json"}]
