The lake had frozen over, and I was absentmindedly throwing stones into it to make that weird sound that lakes make when you throw stones on them when frozen. A guy pulls up in his van, rolls down his window, and the following conversation happens:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim: \\[...\\] throwing stones in the lake?\n\nMe: Uhh what?\n\nHim: What the fuck do you think you're doing? They're expensive fish in there.\n\nMe: I'm sorry... I didn't think it would be...\n\nHim: You didn't think?? You're a grown man! Look at that fucking mess!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I didn't get to respond, as he drove on to turn his van around -- I'm glad I didn't, because what had occurred to me was \"They're just stones on an ice lake, it's not like I'm vandalising\". I think if I had said it, it would have only escalated the situation.\n\nA woman, who was walking with her family close by, asked me what he said \"He seems to have a problem with me throwing stones in the lake!\" I responded. At this point, I noticed that he was turning back and I didn't want to give him any more of a reason to be pissed off at me, so I pulled myself and my wife out of the way in anticipation of where he was going to be driving. We were now out of the direction of where his van could go and he stopped his van again and for the second time said something I could only catch the end of:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim: \\[...\\] run you over!\n\nWoman: What? You'll run me over?\n\nHim: No, I said \\_he\\_ should get out the way because I \\_don't\\_ want to run him over. Don't get fucking mouthy with me!\n\nWoman's husband: What did he just say to you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, the woman's husband appeared to be following the van and wanted some kind of conflict. My wife and I just left that area and walked off somewhere else; I didn't want to anything to do with that. It's not in my nature to want conflict over anything, not least of all over stones on a lake.\n\nSo here's the thing, the guy was confrontational and seemed to really want a fight with just about anyone. That said, him being confrontational by nature doesn't automatically make him an asshole, and certainly doesn't prevent me from being an asshole. I looked it up and found that apparently breaking ice with stones on a lake can indeed harm fish, so whether or not the guy handled it in the right way, he was right to call me out in doing something wrong. Not that I knew it would harm fish at the time. But the impression I had was that I was vandalising the lake with stones -- now admittedly they were large stones... like rocks... bigger than an apple I guess, but it has never occurred to me before that stones on a lake could be considered any kind of vandalism.\n\nI feel like the fish being \"expensive\", and the \"mess\" I made aren't really an issue. If I knew I was harming fish I wouldn't have done it. So I guess in addition to AITA, I guess my question is: Is it vandalism to throw stones, or even large rocks onto an ice lake?", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

First time post to AITA, and I'm a tad frustrated with a friend.\n\nThe whole story was we agreed to go to the gym on Wednesday several days before. I had to pick them up. They have a car. It's supposedly not working well. My other friend is already at the gym, and takes the bus to get there himself. I make a texting group called \"gym peeps\" and post in it around 2 PM. I'm at work until 5 PM. Other friend texts them once I'm off since the first friend hasn't responded and I'm driving. (I try to not text/call and drive since it's illegal) Still no response. Then 47 minutes later, when we've already gone to the gym, and are working out. They respond. Pissed as hell we're already there. Says they don't get group notifications (even though they were individually texted as well) and that we should have called or just stopped by. I had a large homework assignment that day, and had no extra time to wait for someone to either be awake or get ready. The expectation was they'd be up/ready/responded. Since I was kinda going out of my way to get them anyway. And they do not pay me gas money ever as a side note.\n\nThen they go off on me because I've canceled a couple times in the last few months. Says I can't treat people like shit just because I'm incredibly depressed/very busy with school/work/my business I run/my 5 year old/my rescue parrots/etc. Freaks out on me, and basically talks down to me. At one point I had told them \"I'm going to take the high road, and not get angry\" then they tell me I'm patronizing them. When the intention of saying that was admitting I usually get upset and yell. I didn't want to do that, and I'm trying to be better about anger. Then in that same breath, they turn around and text me saying \"Repeat back to me why you think I'm upset\" like I'm a small child! Which seems super patronizing!! AND to top all of this off they wouldn't be able to get into the gym without me. I have the special membership that means I can bring a guest. They have no membership, no way to get themselves to the gym, and no way to get home from the gym. (They could take the bus, but refuse I guess??)\n\nSo not only am I a taxi.

POST : FTP, LTL, please forgive formatting as I don't post on Reddit much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe end of September my dad passed away. We have never been a religious family so we didn't have a traditional church service/wake for him. Instead our family and his friends gathered at his and stepmoms house to tell stories and remember him. My brother lives close to them with his wife and two small kids. This is his second marriage (and second family). Brothers wife, in my opinion, is a controlling, narcissistic bitch who loves to play the victim. My first time meeting her was at the baby shower for their oldest. As she was opening gifts, it was like she was taking inventory. Not a smile, not a thank you. She didn't seem happy to be there. She was just taking stock of what she got. My brother had to delete all social media a long time ago because he can't be friends with women. Brother and the oldest kid had to quit Cub Scouts because one of the leaders was a woman and Brother was \"flirting\" (talking to) with her. Apologies, I'm getting distracted by my dislike for this woman... I think you get the type of person she is though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay before the gathering at Dads house Brothers ex-wife comes to dads house to bring their 17 year-old son. Ex-wife loved dad, they had a great relationship. She's come to pay respects to stepmom and bring her son to his grandpas gathering. Ex-wife is very respectful, she knows Brother and Wife are there. She knows how Wife is and stays mainly by the front door talking with me and stepmom. Wife proceeded to lose her damn mind. Apparently, because Brother didn't IMMEDIATELY get up and tell Ex-wife that she needed to leave because, \"It's disrespectful for her to be here when my wife is here\", he must want to go back to her. In Wife's mind, if Ex-wife had any respect or sense she wouldn't have even shown up because Wife was there and Brother is her husband now. Brother and Wife started arguing the minute Ex-wife arrived. When Brother and Wife's youngest kid woke up (he was taking a nap during all of this) an hour later, she hustled him out the door, plopped him in the car, and sped away (getting uncomfortably close to the other kids playing outside) while telling Brother he should just go ahead and file divorce papers. She even said that if they get divorced, Brother is taking one of the kids with him because she doesn't want them both.(Spoiler alert: they're not divorced)  I mean, who says that?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe made my Dads gathering/wake about her and unnecessarily more difficult for my brother. A week ago I got a call from Brother asking for a picture of dad. Apparently Wife is making something for the family members. I'm not sure what it is; I should receive it later in the week. I'm not sure that I care. Brother thinks it's her way of saying sorry for what happened. I recognize that she's making an effort, but AITA for still needing to hear the words \"I'm sorry\" from her? She's never said it.

POST : Obligatory this is a new account because i don't want people who know me correlating it to me snippet. TLDR ar bottom.\n\nMy girl is bipolar and has her manic/depressive episodes every now and then. Most are manageable, but this one was one of those major ones.\n\nI work graveyard shifts and work usually 10-12 hours each shift. So I'm doing my thing and I get a text from the gf, she's depressed and has been crying, so naturally I'm worried for her. I rush through my work as fast as possible and race home (we live together) so I can comfort her.\n\nI get back around 1p, and there I see my girlfriend in all her depressed glory, sleeping in the bathtub. I wake her up, she starts crying and saying how she wanted to draw a bath and maybe the warm water would feel good, I dry her off, she stops crying, all is well. I get some food in her and we watch a couple of episodes of this show we've been following for a while and eventually we both nod off to sleep.\n\nOr so I thought. She woke up about 2 hours into our nap (or my sleep), and what does she do? She cries. But I'm so tired that I don't wake up to her sobbing.\n\nAbout 5 hours later, I wake up to it as it's progressed into her crying so much she has the occasional dry heave and the sound is loud and disgusting. I keep trying to comfort her, but she's being so difficult-- she wants to eat, but doesn't want to make or buy food, but before that she wants her dog to be fed and walked so he can go to the restroom and she wants to do it but can't will herself out of bed, and she also doesn't want to be left alone but she knows I work, which makes her cry and dry heave harder. I held her and stroked her hair and tried to calm her, though she was having none of it. Through all the hours of crying, I was surprised she could still produce tears.\n\nBut hours and hours of crying on top of me working 10-12 hr shifts and only sleeping 5 hours just really stressed me out. I peeled her weeping body off of me, told her I'd take the dog to go restroom, got said dog and left for 2 hours.\n\nI couldn't deal with it. I walked the dog for a little, but eventually came back home, grabbed my car and put the dog in with me, and drove to Carls Jr to eat a burger. I got a burger for the pup, too, since he hadn't eaten. We sat for a while, then I got another burger for my girlfriend and went home.\n\nWhen I finally came back, she had cried herself into a stupor and had passed out on the floor. She's currently still there, I just put a blanket on her. I don't want to deal with her if I wake her up and she just goes on with her waterworks again, but her burger will be waiting for when she's awake.\n\nAm I the asshole for needing some space away from all that? It just gets overwhelming and I'm tired and running on very little sleep.\n\nTLDR; Bipolar GF is having a really bad episode but I'm stressed from working long hours and having very little sleep.

I cut this guy out of my life because of this and the fact that he already made me uncomfortable, I just didn\u2019t have a reason to stop talking to him yet.\n\nNow recently, I said that I was mad at A to one of my friends, let\u2019s call him B, and basically he didn\u2019t know what was going on (this is just the gist of things, I can explain more if you ask) and he found out why via me saying something in a group chat.

I said that was a lie because that wasn\u2019t my intention, but then I realized that it may be what I\u2019m doing without realizing.\n\nI screenshots the accusation to a group chat (who also know about the situation and were already annoyed with A in general, the chat was actually made to make a secret poll to remove her from a chat on the day she lied about the guy just before she started talking).

SO and I are playing video games when he gets a call at 9:30pm from a work friend who lives one street over, asking if we want to go over to his house to drink and hang out with some other friends.\n\nI'm really not in the mood to go over there. I take medication every night for nausea and it doubles as a sleeping pill. I'd already taken this medication, plus I'm in my pajamas, about ready for bed. I told him he should go without me and that i was going to bed instead.\n\nAs he's leaving, I tell him not to do anything with any girls. He has never done anything with another woman as long as he's been with me, so I have no reason to think that he would tonight. I was mostly joking, but I'm also feeling a little self conscious. I'm in my second trimester of pregnancy, so I've started to get a little bit of a bump, plus I'm not pooping regularly and I'm extra gassy today. I just feel really unattractive and my anxiety brain was telling me he might think this as well. He obviously didnt find my comment funny, however.\n\nCut to about 10 minutes after he left. I'm in bed, getting settled in, and I hear glass breaking. I automatically imagine someone watching my SO leave and, thinking the house is empty, break in through a window. I jump up to lock the bedroom door and immediately call my SO, asking if he was in the house because I heard glass shatter. He didnt even seem phased by this, from what I could tell. He tells me he'll walk back and for me to get his gun by our bed. \n\nWhile I'm waiting for him to get back, I start to realize a couple things. 1.) We have a dog who barks if he hears anything strange at night. He w as s suspiciously quiet. 2.) The shattering noise definitely wasnt loud enough to be something big, like a window breaking. I started to feel pretty stupid right as my husband walks into the apartment.\n\nHe clears the house and doesn't see anyone, so I go to check the living room. Yup.

It's raining so hard and I don't have an umbrella.\"\n\n She tells me where she lives, which is an apartment complex on my way home, about a two minute drive away from the store.

And she filled my head with all of the stories in the news about abductions, or Good Samaritans being lured into well laid traps. So I started thinking, is this about to happen to me? Will she lead me to an inescapable place, and I'm suddenly surrounded with no way to defend myself? \n\nI told her that I was sorry, but I was going the other way, and got in my car and drove an extra 10 minutes around to get home.\n\nEver since that day, however, I have been eaten up with guilt.

He needed to go to the doctor for a follow up visit, and he just bought a brand new dually crew cab 4 wheel truck.

But some how I ran a red light and got t boned. I have never been in an accident I caused before this. Not sure how I ran a red light on a street a half mile from where I have worked the last 25 years. I will say he tinted the windows way darker than I ever would have and I think that affected my ability to see. It was still dark out when it happened. \n\nSo I go through the steps of reporting it to insurance. My insurance says the vehicles insurance pays not the drivers. So all the companies have been notified. \n\nWithin a couple hours my daughter texts me saying I need to pay for the damages so there rates don\u2019t go up. Well the car that hit me was almost brand new and was totaled. And the truck probably has $20,000 in damages if not totaled. So any where from $55,000 to $90,000 in damages. So I suggest we deal with that as it happens. Can\u2019t imagine their insurance going up because of my accident.  But if it does I would work it out. \n\nThen today she text me saying that I need to do something for the diminished value of the truck when they go to trade it in.

And if she expects a large sum of money from me for the damages to trucks value, I would have to cancel this loan so I could borrow money to cover the truck. \n\nAnd she accused me of guilting her instead of just admitting i am wrong.

I didn\u2019t say anything initially but I sent her a text shortly after saying \u201c I will never ever go on a friends date with you. You obviously don\u2019t care but I\u2019m  still dealing with the emotional fallout and will likely be dealing with it for some time\u201d. I threw in the \u201c obviously don\u2019t care\u201d part because I\u2019ve put up boundaries before yet she fails to respect them. Since my reply, I\u2019ve been name called and all sorts of hurtful shit. To be fair, after she started in I name called back. I shouldn\u2019t have but I did. Still...damn, a simple \u201cok\u201d from her or nothing at all and I wouldn\u2019t be here.

POST : So, some quick background, my husband 3 kids and I moved in with my MIL back in July to help raise our 2 nephews because she works 2nd shift ft and I'm a stay at home mom. There's more details in my post history if anyone cared to dig. \n\nMy MIL is mostly a very nice lady. She can be very passive aggressive though, instead of acting like an adult and saying she'd prefer something else, she pouts or rage cleans. My husband has always been lazy when it comes to helping with kids, he will be staring at his phone while I'm busy as he'll, and when I ask him to jump in a nd help, acts like he's totally put out. \n\nLast week, we got a call my BIL was found unresponsive. After several days in hospital,  he was declared brain dead. MIL decided to donate his organs, so it took several more days in hospital while they did testing and set up donations. This is also winter break for the kids (5 total). I was happy to jump in (99% of childcare already on me, I am now doing 100%). That's all over now, and his service is Sun. \n\nKids have been sick, so has MIL, and now I've got it. I was up all night before last with screaming 3 yo with ear infection,  got no sleep. Now I'm exhausted and sick too. I told husband and MIL if I was taking care of kids last night, bedtime was going to be early, as I'm sick too and exhausted. MIL had been going through pics at table for last few days. Her rule is only food at table. So dinner last night,  I started to throw down a blanket for a picnic dinner. She got bit snappy Says she was cleaning table off. Ok. Tgen bedtime snack, table still mostly clear except for album directly in front of her. I set 3 of kids at table, said be careful with your drinks. If she didn't want them at table, she could have said as much, I'd have moved them elsewhere. Instead she grabbed her things went into bedroom and slammed door then started sobbing loudly. Kids were freaked out by it, so I was then reassuring them that grandma was just sad about thier uncle, it was ok, just brush teeth lay down with thier tablets. Once they were in bed, I went and sat on futon in front room, only other place for me to sleep. I left lights on in case she decided to come back out with pics. She came out in PJs, got drink went back in bedroom. I assumed that meant she was going to bed o r at least her room for night. So I finally turned off light laid down. Few minutes later, I heard 3 yo crying. Husband had laid down with her at 630 fell asleep, left me with other 4 kids. I told husband his mom was upset, ran over what happened. He went off on me, saying I should have asked what she wanted, or should have known. I was a bitch for being mean to his grieving mom. \n\nI'm truly trying my best to be helpful, but I'm also sick and was already at my breaking point as caretaker. My break got cancelled twice with the goings on due to my BIL dying. I understand that, it sucks for me, but it is what it is. But I think expecting me to read Mil's mind is a bit much. She could have easily said hey, not at table, I'd have changed plans. Instead she threw a fit. \n\nSo, AITA for thinking even if grieving, an adult should be able to express their feelings to me without all the drama? Keep in mind, this is not new to her grieving period, she's done this several times since we have been here.", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

I\u2019m being accused by my now ex of being the asshole.\n\nYesterday was my birthday, so my boyfriend picked me up to go out to eat when he got off work. We noticed two dogs on the side of the road, wearing collars/tags, and I insisted we stop and try to save them, though he did not want to. I got out of the car and was walking toward them, when two men on bicycles came from the other direction, so the dogs ran across the road, and one was hit by a car. We managed to get the dog out of the road, and I asked my boyfriend if we could take the dog to the emergency vet. He agreed, unfortunately the dog died on the way. \n\nHe subsequently was upset because he was worried about the interior of his car, which I did offer to have professionally cleaned. As I sat there crying, clearly very upset, and said that had I not stopped, the dogs wouldn\u2019t have crossed the road and died, he just said, \u201cprobably.\u201d No words of comfort. Though I do believe it was my fault, I was still traumatized. Had he been upset and crying, even if I disagreed about why, I\u2019d try to comfort him. He took me to a bar after, though I just wanted to go home, and freaked out when he finished his drink and I asked him to take me home. I got out of his car and shut the door harder than I intended (100% my fault) and said I\u2019d talk to him the next day. He peeled out, and I was worried he\u2019d get hurt driving like a maniac. I asked him to let me know when he got home, and one hour later with no message, I kept calling and then got sent to voicemail.  At least then I knew he was alive and not in a ditch somewhere. Either way, I sent a text breaking up with him, because he had been a complete jerk and then didn\u2019t let me know he was home safe (I\u2019d also like to point out, I\u2019m not asking if I\u2019m the asshole about the breakup. I shouldn\u2019t have done it the way I did, that definitely makes me an asshole. But it\u2019s also been coming for a few months. Every single person in my life told me they didn\u2019t feel he was right for me, and this was just the last straw for me. We definitely had other issues, both his fault and mine. We just aren\u2019t right for one another.) \n\nAt the end of this, I think he\u2019s an asshole because he cared more about his cars interior than the life of the dog, and treated me like I was the asshole for not caring about his car. Also for not letting me know and sending me to voicemail when I wanted to know he was home safe. And I will admit, I was upset and not looking at it from his perspective, which is why I had wanted to talk about it the next day, when we were both calmer. And he thinks I\u2019m the asshole because he can\u2019t really afford his car and wants to get rid of it as soon as he can, and the dog could have damaged his interior (which he did not I mention before we put the dog in the car, and the interior was not damaged, as the dog was not bleeding.)\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA, or is he?

POST : My boyfriend and his brother are 4 years apart and growing up his brother has always been  a role model to him. My boyfriend loves him dearly and is like his right hand man. \n\nBut personally I never liked him. Can you guess why? He's really open about being a white supremacist and goes on \"left wings suck\",\"every other race is lazy\" rants on facebook a few times every month. The one time I met him though he was actually chill, and didn't really seem to take my race into account. I'm black by the way.\n\nMy boyfriend himself almost never brings up my race and honestly has this kind of intolerance to talk about it. Everytime I'd say some playful stereotype like \"Black people do this ____\" he just turns into a brick and you can just tell he doesn't want to talk about it. \n\nIt seems I'm the only one who's slightly conscious about race because before we got together - his fantasies surrounded white women and just out of paranoia/insecurities I would question if he's satisfied with dating me - to which he would reassuee me.\n\nHis brother was arrested 5 days ago for attempted kidnapping, assault, and hate crime. From what we know - he was in the parking lot of a club where he got into an argument with a black man because he was smoking in front of his car (he's really defensive about his health because his immune system is shit). When the guy was walking away he continued yelling racial slurs at him, and swung on him from behind. He beat him and attempted to push him inside the trunk of his SUV before a security guard intervened. \n\nThe first few nights my boyfriend was an indenial brick who refused to talk about it so I respected it and we carried on as normal. Just last night he came over and we were watching Happy Feet. The whole time I could see on his face that he was in deep deep thought, and just looked like he desperately wanted to say something. I asked if he was okay and it took him a minute before he said \"Yeah...I don't think Connor was wrong\" and that basically killed every mood. As our conversation progressed he revealed  that he's gonna side with his brother no matter what and this wasn't an exception. \n\nI'm asking if I'm the asshole because I feel like we've been together for 6 mos and race has never been an issue. He's not the bad guy, and it's really out of what transpired his brother did - and his choice to stand by him.

POST : Due to uni/career/relationship, both my sister and I moved away from the seaside town we grew up in around 20 years ago. I genuinely excuse my sister- she's thoroughly established in the city she lives in now, which is just about easily drivable to our home town, but is where her job, her children's school &amp; friends, her husband's job and her husband's family are. I can't excuse myself though. I currently live much further away, I can't drive so it's a 4 hour train journey and I need to take a couple of days' holiday and arrange for cat care to get home, and my partner and his family, and my job which is going well and which I could progress in and would like to progress in are here. I'm 40; I have no, and can't have, children, I live alone with my cat but my partner and I are happy and very much in love as we are which is living separately (for irrelevant reasons). But, my dad passed a couple of months ago so my mum is now on her own in the seaside town we both grew up in. She's doing really well; she has a lot of friends, she's making a lot of good progress in terms of adapting her life, my sister can visit more regularly than I can and does so and also has her children who want to see their grandma. But, the town is dead- there is no work there, it is run-down and younger (than me, but it was the same when I was 18 or so) people have to leave to find better work; my friends I grew up with have all but left- there is nothing for me there, unless I took a job at a supermarket or something and tried to work up which would be in stark contrast to the job I have now in the city I live in, which is nearly management level but still ok-but-not-great-paid but the benefits are good. I'm happy here, is what I'm saying. My partner, my flat, my job, my friends, practical things like my doctor are here, I can see a future here. But, my mum's on her own and it's difficult to get down to her as often as I'd like- the train fare is about 1/10 of what I earn a month, I need to take holiday to make (just the journey, I'm not meaning this in relation to seeing her) worth it otherwise I'm there and turning back round to go to the station, and I just keep thinking go home, go and live with her, don't leave her on her own... but, I also think she wouldn't want me to leave my job and be working minimum wage (I'm not exaggerating about that; there is NO decent, prospective work in the town I grew up in), and to not be with my boyfriend like I am now because I'm 40 and I don't want to start again with that and she really likes him and she knows we're happy together, and I now it's all relatively new because it's only been a couple of months since my dad passed and we're all still adjusting and it's probably too soon as my long-term family friend/uncle has advised me, to think about any big thing anyway, and I've only come back from seeing my mum today so I'm probably just feeling raw about it, but AITA for not thinking immediately and rightly- I should move back to my dead-end home town to be with my widowed mum?

I've tried to be there for her, tried to get her into yoga, tried to get her to cheer up and look on the bright side of things.\n\nWe mostly chat at work and I think she's a good person. Her Facebook persona though... She's always complaining and ranting, but I never go on Facebook so that has never been a big deal for me..\n\nWell, my dad got really sick this past May, he was told by the doctors that he wouldn't make it till November. He's doing fine now but I was freaking out, and when I told Mary about this, I was expecting for her to tell me that everything would be fine, some sort of advise on how to keep my cool, but instead she said something along the lines of \"that's rough\" and never again has asked me about how my dad is doing. I started cutting her off after that.. I wouldn't invite her over or decline her invitations, at work we started having arguments about videogames and movies and I didn't really care to tell her about important stuff because I felt she wouldn't be there for me.. \n\nLast weekend there was a petrol pipeline explosion in central Mexico (that's where we live in) and 114 people died while stealing the petrol.  I happened to open Facebook (which I very rarely do) and I saw my feed was full of her comments along the lines of \"they had it coming!\" \"I love happy endings!\" \"They deserved to die!\", I unfollowed her and thought to myself.. what the hell is wrong with Mary :s\n\nSo we didn't speak at all on Monday, and on Tuesday she asked me about my day and then soon after she started raging on how stupid the population is and how she drives so much better than the average driver and I had enough, so I told her to stop her Facebook rants and to stop ranting to everyone, because that just keeps spreading the hate and it's doing her more damage than anyone else.. she started crying and then a few minutes later she thanked me for telling her this, said I was such a good friend and.. I actually felt pretty bad for imposing my opinion on her and making her cry..\n\nWell.. yesterday I overheard my boss saying that she's getting fired (for using profanity on a corporate email)... I'm not sure she'd ever find out that I knew beforehand but I don't know if I should tell her or not.. I feel like she would go on a rant on FB and tell everyone I spilled the beans.. but on the other hand I feel like a terrible friend for not telling her..\n\nWhat do you think?

I then said that I don't have a way of recording 7 hrs of video footage as my phone is a dinky 8gb iphone, he replied by telling me to borrow some video camera that can. \n\nThe reason this was annoying me is because he said there's something called a sleep study which can be done.

I'd kind of known him for three years, but never talked to him until now. (He'll be called B.) He's a really chill guy. I trust him a lot, we've become really good friends, and I've developed crush-like feelings for him. All of my friends were supportive of this at first. (We even combined our friend groups and started hanging out together as one large unit.) That is, until a few months ago when M started saying he's a horrible person out of nowhere. \n\nI asked her why multiple times in a group chat where she first said this, then I confronted her privately. She just claimed he \"gives her bad vibes\". I tried to get her to elaborate on this, but she didn't. I let it be until she kept saying he was a bad person. I confronted her again on the issue; she said she was friends with his ex-girlfriend and their relationship ended messily. Of course, I already knew about this situation from B himself, but I asked her if he did anything to his ex, and she didn't answer. However, she wouldn't stop her claims that he was a bad person.\n\nA few weeks pass, and B cancels a date we were supposed to go on because he wanted to be there for a mutual friend having a rough time. M asked me about it, so I explained the situation to her. She flipped out, said that was rude and that I was being strung along. I told her I didn't care that he canceled, that I wanted B to help out our friend if that's what he thought was best. She claims once again that he's a bad person and he makes her uncomfortable. When I pressed her about it, she talks about the ex-girlfriend again, but just reaffirms that they had a messy breakup. Then, she says that I have to choose who's more important in my life--him or her--because he makes her uncomfortable. I say that I'm sorry she's uncomfortable around him, but I don't want to choose. She stops talking to me for the night. \n\nThen, I get a message from one of our mutual friends, R. R tells me that M ranted to him about the whole situation and said that she doesn't want to be friends with me. I freaked out. She and I had been fighting a lot (specifically about B), but I obviously still loved her. To hear she'd be talking behind my back hurt me more than what she said to my face. \n\nThe next day, I confronted her and said I shouldn't be forced to choose. She retaliated, saying I should've been more observant and known she was hurting from this. (Yes, she told me he \"gave her bad vibes\", but she also said she was happy because I was happy being friends with him. I know I should've checked in with her more on this, but I also feel like she should've communicated this better with me.) Then, she said I was friends with B because he \"shared traits\" with a family member who sexually abused me.  1. To my knowledge, B has never assaulted anyone. I encouraged M to tell me if he has, because I wouldn't want to be associated with him if he had. She didn't answer any of the times I asked her. 2. She doesn't know the family member in question, so she couldn't possibly know if they were anything alike otherwise. When I called her out for this, she said she was sorry I was upset, but not for what she said. After telling her how I was hurt over everything she's done (+other personal things in my life at the moment), she apologized for real.\n\nI know this is stupid, but I honestly forgave her for a while. We were mostly friends again after this incident. We still fought, but we both excused it as a thing that all best friends do. This went on for a few weeks until I got sick of her continuing to talk shit about B \\*and\\* me to friends and to my face. I finally texted her to end it all. She accepted it, and we didn't talk again for a month. \n\nA few days ago, I heard M was telling people secrets about me from the friend from before, R. I calmly texted her and asked her if it was true. She said yes, so I told her I wasn't happy about it. She claimed I was trying to text her again to pick a fight. At that point, I just stepped away and thanked her for answering my question. Today, she texted R asking him about what he told me. In their conversation, she said she had never been happier breaking off a relationship, that I guilt-tripped her into being friends again, that she never really wanted to be friends with me after that point anyway, that B was manipulating me, and that she never wanted to talk to me again. Keep in mind that she never communicated any of this to me. \n\nGranted, I was never the greatest friend in the last months of us talking. As she said, I should've been more observant. Often I ranted too much about my own issues, and I was probably an emotional burden in some way. However, I also listened to her when she ranted, even when she ranted about B to my face. I should've been more attentive, but she should've communicated her frustrations before they hit a boiling point. I don't hate her by any means. She was a very important person in my life, and I'll always reminisce about the good times we had, but the way she handled this, I feel, was unreasonable. \n\nKeep in mind that there are lots of details to this story, but I'd feel petty for including those, because they paint her in more of a bad light than not. This account is definitely biased in some way, but I tried to give her (both in real life and in this post) as much benefit of the doubt as possible. I just want closure now. \n\ntl;dr my close friend of four years was uncomfortable I was friends with someone she didn't like, so after months of putting up with her bullshit, I dumped her.

There's a lot that we could do to lower the bills that we don't do, and my parents prefer that I not bring these things up as \"it's too stressful to discuss.\"  They have the premium cable package and rarely watch the premium channels.

POST : So I'm typing this on mobile so I apologize for any autocorrect weirdness.\n\nI work in a company I really like and would like to stay in. My position is stressful, 60 hours a week. come in early and leave late kind of stressful. I've been in my current position for about 7 months. But I have been doing 60 hour workweeks for about 3 years now. I dont get much time to spend with my girlfriend, play games with my friends or really do much else. It's go to work. come home, goof off for 2 hours then sleep. I also only get Tuesdays and Saturdays off, so that doesn't help.\n\nI'm part of a department that has 5 people in it. Four techs, which I am one of and a supervisor. The supervisor is a mixed bag, she brings in starbucks for everyone and tries to be sociable. The other 4 text, get drinks together, take care of each others' cats, etc. They'll sit in their office and chat and sometimes get away with minor stuff I'd get in trouble for.\n\nGiven how much time they spend together the other 4 are close. But while I'm always nice and kind, I do want to go home, spend time with my own friends, girlfriend, etc. Not be at work or meetup outside of work. They are all girls and I'm the only guy if that matters.\n\nI feel as though my supervisor has let her personal feelings interfere with the way she treats us. My position has a lot of turnover because while the overtime is nice, it is excessive and we're not paid to deal with the stress.\n\nThing is, a friend of mine from another department about a month back stated that a position in his department would be opening up. I would go from a 60 hour week to a 45, also 3 day weekends. Their department is physically next to mine so if l did transfer I would likely still see my old co workers.\n\nI've already met with the new guy who would be my boss and he seems like a really cool guy and I'm excited to potentially work for him. Here's the big thing though, my department has really high turnover, in the last year thre have been three different teams that have come and gone. Because of this, replacing me might prove to be challenging, however they might be able to find another one of their friends and complete their Department of friendship or whatever.\n\nI've yet to mention this to my boss, and I'm pretty sold on moving to the new Department only because having that free time and the less stress would be life changing for me at this point. However I don't want to say anything until I know for a fact it's going to happen. My buddy in the new department is kind of nudging that I should be saying something because it could be hard to find someone new, but I want to wait until I have a concrete answer.\n\nSo, sorry for the long winded post. Obviously I'll work hard in my current apartment all the way up until the very end, but Would I Be The Asshole if I only gave two weeks notice only once I knew for a fact I was transferring?\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

They later showed me the receipt explaining the cost until I pointed out they were including the items they bought for their own personal use. \n* They consistently locked me out of the apartment. Its happened a few times in the rain and a once at midnight. (we don't live in a safe area). Its not by accident or occasionally, they will lock the top lock and wait until I asked to be let in. On average I was locked out for 5-20 minutes at a time.\n* They've told me I would have to pay extra for the privilege to lock my door.\n* When they ask me to buy a product, its usually the more costly name brand. When they have to replace a product, its the generic brand or a smaller version of the product. \n* They ran 2-3 loads of laundry every day, while I washed 1-2 loads on the weekends. For a while we took turns buying detergent but it didn't seem reasonable to me. I would purchase the large Tide 100-load boxes which they would use up in two weeks. \n* She'll enter my room when I'm not home to mess with my cat, then complain about the cat's claws and tell me she needs to be declawed. The cat has not scratched the carpet or any furniture in the room.\n* They made me replace the items she needed to clean her dog's urine off the floor. She used 1/2 the box of laundry detergent to clean the carpet, and told me I was \"nickle and dime-ing her\" and it was \"my turn anyway\" to replace the detergent. I had cats and didn't want to replace something i didn't use, and something she used on her dog's urine. \n* They've told me I was delusional and selfish for wanting to live on my own. I had an issue with my finances earlier in the year and they used this against me, asking how would I have gotten through it if I had to pay rent at the same time.\n\nThings I've been douchy about: \n\n* They told me to declaw my cat, **I fully admit, I agreed to do this**, but was never going to follow through. Once I received a deadline letting me know I had to declaw the cat or they would take her to a shelter I signed for whatever apartment approved me. I put the cat in boarding over the weekend and once I was approved, I told her that day.\n* I had a sense of entitlement when it came to paying the utilities. They had a benefit that allowed them to live rent free (none of my business, but relevant information), but I was paying them $200/mo. They asked for $145 for utilities. I didn't want to do this but did pay anyway.\n* They changed the wifi password and were going to request more money from me (I overheard the conversation). I already pay $145 in utilities. I reset the router when they left and continued using the wifi. \n* My bank doesn't have any ATM's in the area so we use an app for paying rent. She began asking for cash which is a hassle for me, and I did have a bad attitude about this. \n* I *was* paying rent late before, and began paying early/on time. Though I was getting the hang of getting to my banks ATM and paying early/on time they asked for a $50 late fee, with $10 every day after. I felt entitled, since she is family and living rent free she shouldn't be charging me this much for being late. This is entitlement and I know this now. \n\nMSC/Irrelevant\n\n* I'm 20 and have always lived with parents or family.

To be completely honest, I haven\u2019t been my enthusiastic animal mom self to them as I have in the beginning. \n\nThis morning, 10 mins after we wake up my so was hiding the fact that something happened to the couch and I walk over and he says \u201cit\u2019s either mud or poop. Gravey (my dog) must have tracked it in\u201d and I say \u201cthat looks like poop\u201d. That was apparently a trigger for me blaming this on his cats because they are the ones who poop inside the house. My very self conscious so doesn\u2019t necessarily fly off the handle but he shifts to trying to make me feel bad from it and says \u201cdid you clean up gravey\u2019s shit outside yet?\u201d Not to mention, I constantly clean up after him and do 90% of household chores. \n\nFor him to intentionally ask this question knowing that I didn\u2019t do it yet pissed me off. His intention was to paint me like an asshole and divert from his weird self induced drama he was creating himself (I was not mad at the \u201cpoop\u201d on the couch. I was just stating the fact)\n\nHe then proceeds to tell me that I\u2019m an evil step mom that doesn\u2019t treat the cats equally like I do my dog. I don\u2019t greet them the same, don\u2019t give them enough attention etc I have withdrawn a little which I feel bad about but I don\u2019t think I deserved to be called an evil step mom over it? \n\n\nI want to know if I\u2019m the asshole here? I genuinely want to know because I have noticeably withdrawn from the cats. I wish he would have approached it differently.

POST : Throwaway.\n\nI'm on the audition committee for a speech and debate program at my university. At the beginning of this academic year, we accepted a freshman, call him A. Due to the nature of the program, auditioning people is a rather difficult task, because it's hard to capture what a competition environment is like, and it's hard to get a read on their ability to adapt to direction long-term, internalize concepts and use them without a script, etc. However, the committee is usually very good at finding good people.\n\nSo A joins the team, he had an ok audition, not the best but not the worst, but we needed one more person. Now, ever since he joined, I've felt that we made the wrong decision with him. He still does not understand some of the basic concepts of debate, he constantly re-asks questions. He will take some direction when practicing in front of others, but the next practice all advice will be immediately forgotten. Nobody can figure out how to get through to him. He has improved over the year, though very slowly - much slower than what is necessary to perform well.\n\nI think the worst part, though, is his social ability. He was a bit awkward/shy during the audition, which I personally chalked up to audition nerves. But that awkwardness only ever got worse. No one in this program wants to be around him. And even though this is mostly an individual competition, teamwork is important, and so is the social well-being of the club. This guy acts like he's a freshman in high school - I realize that almost everyone changes a lot over freshman year, maturity wise, but A has not.\n\nNow here's the part where I might be an asshole. Every year all members barring those on the audition committee re-audition - mostly so the committee can see what a good audition looks like before looking at the newcomers. No one is guaranteed to return - they still must have a good audition. Almost always, returners will get a slot. But I think we should remove A. From a purely competitive standpoint, it would be optimal. He's been in this program for almost an entire season, he consistently does average-to-poor, with very slow improvement. And it would ease social tension.\n\nNow, I don't know much about A outside of the program, but I don't actually know if he has made any friends since coming to school, and I think he might have some issues or something from his past that influences the way he acts - not like autism, but maybe some sort of upbringing thing. On the one hand, none of us are therapists, nor are we meant to be. But on the other, if we're the only people he ever hangs out with, then it'd be pretty terrible to kick him out - even if it's no one's responsibility to be friends with him, or tolerate him more than necessary.\n\nI know he wants to come back next year. He wouldn't know why he wouldn't be able to return, other than someone had a better audition than him - which will almost certainly happen anyway.\n\nWIBTA?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : A little history first: my younger brother had a stroke when he was younger and now his legs are weaker than they should be. Because of this he has to wear leg braces for support and goes to school in a wheelchair in case his legs get to tired during the day. He is embarrassed of the leg braces and usually wears long pants to cover them. He\u2019d rather go out without a wheelchair when we do errands or go out and only really uses it for school or times we know he will walk a long distance.\n\nWe had this new family move beside us 3 weeks ago and other then saying hi when we see them on their driveway as we enter our house we don\u2019t interact.\n\nBut it just so happens that the timing of when my younger brother\u2019s bus that picks him up in front of our house and brings him to school is the same time our neighbor leaves for work in the morning.  The driveways on our street aren\u2019t the biggest and with the bus arm that is meant to stop cars from driving past the bus my neighbor\u2019s driveway gets blocked. It\u2019s been 3 weeks and it started with them smiling at us saying \u201coh don\u2019t worry\u201d to him being visibly upset about it, but there\u2019s nothing the bus driver can do because there needs to be enough room to load my brother and his wheelchair onto the bus.\n\nThis morning maybe he was having a bad start to his day because as he was waiting for the bus to load my brother and leave (which takes 10 minutes at max) he starts laying into his horn and then steps out of his car and then the interaction begins:\n\nNeighbor: Jesus Christ every morning you block my fucking driveway and I\u2019m late for work!\n\nMe: Sorry but there\u2019s nothing we can do the bus only has so much room to get my brother and his wheelchair. Maybe leave earlier if this makes you late for work everyday\n\nNeighbor: I don\u2019t have to change my schedule for you, how bout the bus come earlier and doesn\u2019t block me in, it\u2019s my fucking property. Also the kid doesn\u2019t even need the fucking bus I\u2019ve seen him walk perfectly fine. The schools 20 minutes away my kids walk to school he should too.\n\nNow here\u2019s where I get pissed because he\u2019s screaming this at a level where my brother can hear as he is getting his wheelchair secured in the bus.\n\nMe: You\u2019re a fucking piece of shit dude! First of all you have no idea what my brother needs and doesn\u2019t need. Secondly it\u2019s the fucking law for you to yield for a school bus so you can either leave earlier so you\u2019re not late for work or fucking wait for the bus to leave and go to work.\n\nHe then starts yelling at me saying that I shouldn\u2019t ever talk to him that way and I should respect my elders but my brother\u2019s bus had already left so I tell him to fuck off and go inside my house. My mom heard the yelling outside and told me though I\u2019m not wrong, I was kind of an asshole with the way I said it and now our new neighbor probably hates us. \n\nWhile I guess I could have taken a better way to saying it, the dude escalated it first but I was wondering AITA?\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : Alright so this might be a bit confusing to read but that's because I'm confused as to what happened to me, this all took place over the course of two weeks but mostly in the last two days. It all started with a girl, let us call her Dee, Now Dee has had a pretty shitty life, without giving away too much personal information it is safe to say that she has been abused by her parents, her uncle died while taking good care of her, her mother is schizophrenic and chances are Dee will be in the future. right now her only living relative is her mother who she is forced to live with because she can't leave, because her mother forces her to pay for all the food and other things so she can't save to get an apartment. and recently she learned that she and her mother may be getting kicked out of the house. there are other aspects but again I am trying to respect her privacy. Just keep in mind she is pretty stressed. now I joined her server a few months ago and made some close friends on it all was well until at some point she started saying that I've been an asshole recently. Now on the server, we all give each other shit but we all knew it was in jest, like \"what's up cunts\" that sorta vibe. anyway whenever she said this and I ask her \"how have i been an asshole?\" she could never give me an answer, it was always \"I can't think of something off the top of my head\" and while at first, I took this in stride because I just thought she was joking, after a while it really started getting to me she I brought it up but again she just called me an asshole. so I started distancing myself from her, not consciously just I didn't go and talk to her as much as I did other people. And also we still talked and had fun together but mostly in groups so it's not like our relationship was purely her called me an asshole, we were still friends. Now as we become more and more distant she used that as evidence to justify her called me an asshole. At this point, I was pretty fed up with her and along with her other annoying behaviors such as needing constant attention and not respecting others wishing by whining, whenever someone didn't want to do something. This all leads up to me leaving the server during an argument in which she exploded on this guy who yea was rude but she was keeping the argument going, now I tried to break it up with a little humor by going \"guys guys we are ALLL assholes, ok?\" after which she and her boyfriend turned on me and again she started calling me an asshole and which point I said \"fine if I'm such an asshole ill just leave\" so I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow during my time on her server I joined another server where she was an admin, I stayed on this server because most of the friends I had made on the previous one were also here, and things were fine, I didn't talk to her she didn't talk to me. but eventually, she started getting more and more controlling in the server. For instance, she said that we couldn't post \"memes\" in the general chat and that we had to post them in meme chat, this was confusing to me and a few others because it was fine before and it wasn't in the rules. at which point she simply told us to read the roles and that it was the end of the discussion. Now in the rules, it does say that you \"should adhere to the commands of the staff\" but I wasn't alone in thinking that that rule wasn't really as \"valid\" as the others in that it is really just a catch-all rule and makes is so whichever admin or mod that was on at the time could say whatever they want and use punishments for whatever they wanted. we tried bringing this up to her but again she just links the rules and said it was the end of discussion. one thing to note is that there is a feedback and suggestions channel but not once did she say we could, ya know, talk about the rules in there, she always just told us to read the rules and if we didn't stop talking about this we would get in trouble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis all climaxed with me and a few others arguing with her in chat about recent events in the server that abruptly ended with her muting all of us and her other \"mod-lings\" comforting here, saying that she was nice to even let this go on for as long as it had. While we couldn't type in chat we did figure out we could change our nick-names, so we starting having fun with that with things like \"My cellmate \"likes\" me alot\" at this point she made another channel where we could \"talk\" \n\nwhich really meant me spending around an hour and a half trying to reason with her while also trying to get her \"mod-lings\" to stop injecting themselves into the conversation just to either stroke her ego or insult us and tell us to shut up. At the end of all of this we me being physically and emotionally drained she says that she been humoring me long enough and that nothing worthwhile has been said  and that \"she didn't want to lose me\" at this point I'm just tired so I want to talk about this another day but she says that she can't leave me on mute but she also couldn't unmute me yet because I might start another \\*riot\\* in discord general chat, which she says is bad because it might scare the other users and that she needs my compliance. She ends all of this by saying that she has let this go on long enough and that she is tired so I say \"just go to sleep then\" and leave at which point she bans me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso if you made it, congrats and now I want to know?

Basically, me and my flatmates were having a large pre session before going out clubbing in our accommodation as per student life. As a result of this, lots of people we didn\u2019t know were invited and one of which is the person in question(I\u2019ll refer to him as J from now on).See I hadn\u2019t interacted with J at all throughout the pre session nor out clubbing as he seemed in a different type of crowd which was later to be proven right. Anyway, after we were coming back to our house to sit about and chat, J\u2019s coming back with another flatmates friend holding him as he is quite clearly drunk. We had a girl who apparently knew him and such and was a possible ex of, but not sure, who he would tell to fuck off and stuff. This girl in question was also out of it so she would shrug it off but I didn\u2019t really like that but didn\u2019t do anything. So we and J make it back to our house only for J to be falling all over the place in our kitchen and throwing up in our sink. My flatmates friend was trying to look after him but he obviously didn\u2019t want to be there and was telling us that J, along with being drunk, had taken several Xanax so he was very drugged up. Eventually I ended up getting roped into looking after him and I\u2019m not very happy with this as I hate dealing with very drunk/high people. I ended up helping J do a variety of activities like taking him to the toliet/ walking him about etc. This is at roughly 1/2 in the morning and  I\u2019m tired and don\u2019t want to deal with this. After all this, one of female flatmates offered to have him sleep on the floor of her room which I was very adamant against as it was unfair on her as she\u2019d likely not get to sleep and would have to look after J. As a result I asked J, who had driven down to our flat, if he would like to stay in his car or in the house to which he said the car. Before I could take him to his car, he wanted to have another drink out of a box of cider in this room which he claimed to be his. I didn\u2019t think him drinking anymore was a good idea so I lied that it was mine but he kept pursuing so I ended up compromising and saying he can have the box but he had to put it in his boot which he said yes to. So after this I take him all the way to his car, have him put the cider in the boot and let him get in. I was very aware of the possibility of him attempting to drive off so I hanged around for a little bit to make sure. This is when he does turn the cars engine on, so I refuse to let him drive off and run over to his car saying he can\u2019t stay in the car and I\u2019ll take him inside. He starts getting aggressive telling me to fuck off, which I was not planning to do, repeatedly which, along with the other factors, made me angry to a point where I tried to forcibly remove him from the car which I fail at. He then gets out and starts screaming at me to fuck off which I lose my cool and hit him in the face. This absolutely sets him off as he starts screaming and cussing at me. Some people from the pre session drag him away to his car where he begins to start kicking his car and making loads of noise at 2 in the morning. Someone gets woken up by this and tells us to call the police which I ended up doing. The police ended up taking him away and I remained at home without consequences for what I did. I\u2019m not a natural angry fighter guy and this was the first \u201cfight\u201d I was in so I ended up crying in my room for a bit. Later I heard that J had previous episodes of being depressed and the Xanax he took was possibly for that which made me feel worse. We haven\u2019t heard from him since so I don\u2019t know what happened to him and the possible ex of him doesn\u2019t either as she and her friends blocked him as he tried to punch one of the females apparently.

POST : Obvious reasons for throwaway (hence the new account, I know this subreddit hates \"new\" accounts even though they are clearly allowed in the rules). \n\nIn early January, my sister called and asked if her former roommate could come stay with me in March while she attends several job interviews. For reference, my sister and her friend are 28, I'm 25 and I now live in the LA area while I'm going to grad school. I knew this girl by reputation and said that would be totally fine, especially since my roommate was moving out and a week help with the rent while I look for a sublet was a huge lifeline for me. \n\nTwo weeks ago she arrived at my apartment by uber and there was an instant attraction. She is very physically attractive. I knew from my sister that her friend has a problem with lying, maybe even pathologically. I also realized very early on that if I just sort of ramble, I had a good shot at hooking up with her. What was clear is that she is completely full of shit, even if I hadn't known her by reputation, her stories about her past are so fanciful and out there that a two year old could tell she was lying. After four days of hanging out and her being on a high from getting a sick job (pharmaceutical sales, she's going to be a billionaire with her looks and ability to spin a yarn) she asked if I'd like to have drinks with her.

It's not my place to be gratuitous so I'll spare details but it was a great time. \n\nShe just got home yesterday evening and my sister both called me and emailed me calling me a piece of shit, asshole, loser, scum bag and every other name in the book.

That it was my job as her brother and \"decent person\" to not play in obvious lies for \"selfish reasons.\" I explained to my sister it was completely consensual, my sister's exact response was \"I know that you fuck wit, I'm saying that you needed to be a bigger and better person and help JXXXXX out in her recovery from past traumas but you set her back by years!\" I feel I need to clearly explain that while I knew this girl was a liar, my sister never explained to me that I needed to stay away from her or that she was in \"recovery\" or counseling when my sister set up her staying with me. \n\nAm I the asshole here?", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : *all names are changed for privacy\n\nI used to attend a church youth group that was part of a small church (the pastor is the father of my sister\u2019s boyfriend). We would meet once a week, and have our bible study, then often go somewhere to eat, or have dessert if most of us are prior to that. We would often carpool, though I would usually go alone, since I didn\u2019t know the others that well. We would meet every Monday night, usually at 6:30 pm. Let me mention here that I\u2019m a paraprofessional in Special Education, and due to having morning duty at school, I have to be on campus by 7:15 am, so I wake up at 6 am at the latest, so I try not to stay up too late on school nights. \n\nOne night, I was super tired from work, the kids had been very active that day, so I was considering not going. My sister convinced me to go, saying that we didn\u2019t have to go anywhere afterwards. I went, and drove my sister and brother with me to save on gas. It ended a little earlier than usual, so my sister begged me if we could go somewhere after all. I told her that I was really tired, and didn\u2019t feel like going anywhere to eat, and would rather relax at home with something picked up to go, so she suggested that we just go somewhere to get dessert instead. I wasn\u2019t really wanting to, but I decided to go for their sake. We then, as a group, began debating on where to go. My sister and I made it clear that I wanted somewhere that wouldn\u2019t be a lengthy drawn-out meal, so we began naming places in the area that had desserts or good appetizers and sides. We eventually decided to go to an ice cream chain that was located somewhat nearby on a busy street that had many other restaurants and event type places. \n\nI drove my car, and my brother went with me. I thought my sister and her boyfriend were coming with us as well, but then they surprised us by going in his car, and with his two sisters and the boyfriend of one of them in another. I didn\u2019t particularly care, so headed on. Her boyfriend has a sports car, and likes to drive fast, so unsurprisingly, I saw him pass us on the highway. Though his sister left slightly before us, I passed them. I took the best exit to get to the place (there are multiple exits one could take, the one I took was the most expedient, but GPS doesn\u2019t say to take it, and if one isn\u2019t familiar with the area, they wouldn\u2019t know to take it). I saw the sisters pass by the exit, and figured they didn\u2019t know about it, and so assumed we\u2019d get there sooner than them. We arrived at the place, and I was surprised to see that my sister and her boyfriend weren\u2019t there (they had passed us earlier and he speeds, while I typically don\u2019t). A minute later they pulled up. He told us that he forgot about the exit I took which why I beat them there. We went in to see what we wanted while waiting for the others. \n\nAfter a few minutes in which they should already be there, I asked John where the others were. He said, and I quote, \u201cOh, Jane (one of his sisters) missed the exit too and got lost. She\u2019s so dumb. They\u2019re using the GPS now though, and should be here before too long, but let\u2019s order in the meantime.\u201d So we did. My sister ordered hers and finished it quickly, while my brother and I took our time. My sister said, \u201cThe others said that they didn\u2019t really want dessert after all, so they went to the fast food chicken place across the street. We\u2019re hungry, and John (her boyfriend) didn\u2019t want anything anyway, so we\u2019re going to join them. Come join us after you\u2019re done!\u201d Then left. I was mad, because after we\u2019d all agreed on going to the ice cream place, the others apparently on their own decided to go get chicken, without me. My sister tried saying that the others hadn\u2019t actually agreed to ice cream specifically, just something in the area. I say that that\u2019s untrue, as John told me that the others were on the way and were only delayed in getting there because they missed the exit and got lost, causing a big delay in their arrival to the ice cream place, when in actuality they took the next one (that only would\u2019ve caused a slight delay) and had gone straight to the chicken place across the street. \n\nI had a big bowl of ice cream, so I took my time finishing it, then texted my sister saying that I was going to pick up food to go from the place next door, and to be ready to leave (by that time she and her boyfriend would have been there at least half an hour, probably more due to the time it would take to pick up my food). I drove over to the other place, ordered my food, then when it was ready, brought my car next door to pick up my sister. I texted her saying that it was ready, so so her goodbyes and whatnot. I then walked in, and she\u2019s still eating. I told her that we need to go, it was already late, and I needed to get home. She started saying that she needed a lot to eat, that she had just ordered some fries and would have to waste the sauce if we left right then (her words, I still don\u2019t get what she meant). I told her that I\u2019d texted her in plenty of time, and she\u2019d had plenty of time to eat already. She wouldn\u2019t budge, so I simply said, \u201cWe\u2019re leaving. Now.\u201d Then turned and walked out, fully prepared to leave her there if she made no move to leave\n\nShe followed soon after, and upon getting in the car, started saying that I\u2019d embarrassed her in front of her boyfriend, his sisters, Joe (Jane\u2019s boyfriend) and everyone in the restaurant (which was a chain that she worked in another location of). She said that I was being unreasonable, and trying to act like her parent. I told her that I\u2019d given her plenty of warning to finish up, and had been doubly generous (possibly triply) as I hadn\u2019t even wanted to go that night as I was so tired, but went so she wouldn\u2019t have to drive, then after that agreed to go somewhere after even though I\u2019d said from the beginning that we wouldn\u2019t, then, when they changed what we had agreed on, didn\u2019t fuss about it (initially) and took my time with my ice cream to give her time to eat as well. I had texted her multiple times so she would know to be ready, but she claimed not to have checked her phone (which I suspect is a lie, as she\u2019s almost constantly on her phone; at other times when we\u2019ve been doing things together I\u2019ve had to tell her to get off of it). \n\nAs we walked out, I could see from their faces that the sisters were judging me. After that, I stopped going to the church (which is basically the only contact I\u2019d had with them other than a WhatsApp group they created for the youth group), as they apparently went out of their way to exclude me from the group, either because they didn\u2019t want me to be with them, or because they didn\u2019t want to have just a fast thing after and rather than simply disagreeing with me, pretended to go along, then changed the plan when I wasn\u2019t there to physically object.

She never finished high school, so while shes staying with me and my family, she's studying to get her GED and potentially an associate's degree.

She masterfully plays the victim card, in these conversations. Even though I know shes talking shit, I have to confront her.

POST : Help me out here Redditors. \n\nIm ALWAYS throwing parties for others, I love showing the people I care about how important they are. But i HATE being the center of attention. That said, past three years my friends threw me a surprise birthday (last year i threw a surprise for my ex-girlfriend who was born one day before me, so idk classify that how you want to, some of my friends were there).\n\nRecently, my life has slowly been falling apart and it kinda brought on a depression; im deeply disappointed in some short comings that my friends are VERY aware of. Im NOT in a festive mood. Not to mention nearly all my so called friends have honestly shown almost zero care, something i would NEVER do in return, even when i tried reaching out to them. So i made it clear to them for weeks i am completely uninterested in celebrating my birthday. Repeatedly. Time and time again for weeks. They have given me many problems but it seemed like they understood. \n\nWhat I did want to do though, is go out with this girl ive been casually seeing. Havent went out with her in a while, and made it super clear to her that im only interested in going out with her tonight to enjoy her company, NOT celebrating my birthday. Well, she agreed that we would treat today like it was any other day. Except my friends hit me up asking to join her and I. I didnt tell anyone we were hanging out. Only person who could have told them was the girl i was gonna go out with tonight. Shes part of said friend group... so it seems to me like an attempt at a surprise party or celebrating my birthday. I genuinely wanted to believe that she wanted to go out tonight just out of romantic interest, not out of some due-diligence of some sort with regards to my birthday. \n\nAITA for being upset by this and considering just not meeting up with her at all? I feel cornered by both her and my friends into doing that which i dont want, I seriously dont fucking want to celebrate my birthday, just wanted to go out on a quiet date.

It really on off friends with benefits and us being supportive of one anothers varying levels of depression and ups and downs.

POST : Trying to keep this as short as possible. **TL;DR**: My in-laws were not able to be present or supportive when my husband, their son, was dying in the hospital and now I'm not speaking to them. I don't know if I ever will again.\n\nOver the holidays my husband was in the hospital for near-fatal flu complications. (Get your flu shots!) He was in a medically-induced coma for about 2 weeks, and spent 10 of those days on specialized life support. After he woke up he spent a week awake on the ventilator and withdrawing from opioid drips, then another week awake and able to breathe on his own but delusional and kind of psychotic from kidney failure.\n\nFor those first two weeks his parents were overbearing and insufferable--as you might expect from the parents of an only child. They had secret meetings with doctors, tried to sign papers without me, interrupted doctors during rounds, and talked to people about clinical trials without telling me. And they were there 24/7. Never left.\n\nWhen Husband woke up from the coma, his sleep/wake cycle was  reversed, he was verbally and physically abusive to staff and visitors, and had to be restrained so he wouldn't pull out his breathing tube or the dialysis port in his jugular vein. Sounds like a perfect job for overbearing, ever-present parents, right?\n\nNope. They went back home and visited for a couple of hours every 2-3 days. They didn't believe me when I described how awful my husband was at night, because when they saw him during the day he was sleepy and docile. I *begged* them to stay for longer and to stay overnight. They'd promise they would and then just not show up, and never acknowledge it or apologize. \n\nI stood at my husband's bedside alone every night and got yelled at, smacked in the face, barfed on, and watched nearly every bodily fluid he has get sucked out or recirculated through one tube or another. While my in-laws were having drinks with friends and going downtown to see the Blue Man Group. (Not a joke, I saw the ticket stubs.)\n\nI get that everyone deals with tragedy in their own way, and maybe they just shut down and couldn't hack it. But why disappear right when your son is coming back to life? Why promise to be supportive and then stand me up? Why accuse me of lying? I was beyond furious.\n\nI was barely civil with the in-laws for the rest of the hospital stay and I haven't spoken to them since we came home from the hospital, January 8. Husband knows what happened, he's okay with how I feel towards his parents but he is still super close with them. He has communicated to them that I need space and I will reach out to them when I am ready, but they are always telling him \"give newjerseygoldrush a big hug and a kiss for me\" and they've texted me a couple times \"to check in\" and for my birthday, which pisses me off.\n\nI know I'm not going to forgive them, but do I have to forget it and move on for the sake of my husband's family?\n\nAgain, sorry this is so long.", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}]
