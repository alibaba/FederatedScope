We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it.

Nothing too bad at first, just very unhealthy relationships such as he would chase after girls for months at a time while the girl bounced between him and their baby daddy. \n\nThis goes on for over a year, all the while I stay as supportive as possible while also trying to be a bro and tell him to stop falling for these chicks.

Whatever, I can deal with this I just tell him I think hes an idiot. \n\nNow hes with a girl who he moves her and her two kids in. She has a drug history. She relapsed and moves in and out for about a year. It gets to the point where he is paying all of her bills and living expenses. Long story short again, he calls me one night after being bailed out of jail. His story is that he went to his girlfriends \"aunt\"s house to get her some cold medicine, went in the wrong house on accident, they called the cops and he got pulled over later and arrested because he met the description. Now I read the police report because I didnt believe him. \n\nHe went to a known drug house, he did go into the wrong address and almost got shot, got arrested on a felony drug charge, and then lied about it. He also had a large amount of cash on him. He was asked to resign from his job while under investigation. We all knew he wouldn't get his job back. After reading the report and talking to the city manager, he also lied to her about the story. \n\nI should mention, we both work in public safety and I had recently gotten my dream, full time job. After all of this went down, I immediately cut him off. I did not want to be involved in this in any way. I didnt want to risk my job or the way people view me by this, especially on probation. I think I am the asshole for straight cutting him out of my life without warning, but between a fulltime job, fulltime school and the positive people in my life, I felt like I had to.

I told him I was sorry for ignoring him but I had to focus on myself. What made me feel like less of an asshole was his response. He said stuff along the lines of \"shows you who is really your friend\" and \"I needed you to back me so I could get my job back\".

It's a long story, so here i go!   \n\n\nBackground : I (20M) am living with four other room-mates at my old mother's house. Since she wasn't able to sell it, she rented it to me and my friends (one guy and two girls). Note that we did not sign a lease, since it was a friendly agreement. At first, the rent was a bit expensive for only four people, so one of the girl brought her friend (26F) in September. It wasn't sure how many months she was supposed to stay, but we were pretty happy about it. When I met her, I immediately knew that she was the anxious kind of person, and I felt for her. But I didn't know what was to come.\n\n&gt;Her presence alone changed the dynamic in the house. She decided to buy a cat (to help reduce her anxiety), even thought the first floor was supposed to be cat-less because there is one girl that is allergic. I had cats that stayed in the basement and they had fights with the new cat, which she indirectly blamed me for. Every time I encountered her in the house, I tried to have a friendly chat with her, but I felt some weird tension. When I asked her for simple services, such as a little bit of olive oil, it always seemed to disturb her and she often declined with what seemed a lack of empathy. Often, I put that on the account of her anxiety disorder (she eventually told me she had one) and let it go. But then, she also started complaining about the housework in a backdoor way. For example, she left a list on the fridge on the 'steps not to forget when cleaning the kitchen' and notes such as \u00abParasites are at our door!\u00bb. Me and the other guy knew that it concerned us, we just didn't understand why she didn't told us about her discontent first. We did not felt good about it. Also, whenever she wrote in our house group chat, it was only to complain and express her discomfort about something.  \n\nAs you can see, I had my load of anxiety living with her and I considered many times having a talk about the situation, to explain how and why we feel uneasy, and also to understand why she acted that way. I never did, since I knew she would not be at ease and would start to either blame herself of reject the blame. Months passed and it was going fine, until she started worrying about what was going to happen in July 2019 (we were in January, btw). Since I did not want to live with her another year (and since the other girls were moving out of town next summer), I told her she'd have to look for another place to stay in July. Then, one week ago, she told me she had found a new place to stay and that she would leave at the end of the month. I was kind of shocked. I asked her if she would at least pay her rent for March, which resulted in a categorical refusal. I told her that usually, when leaving a housing, you need to notify one month in advance, therefore that she had to pay for next month also. Big anxious no. I asked again. Still refusing, saying that she won't pay for two rents at once, that she already signed the lease at the other place and that anyway, she hadn't signed any lease with us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's when I lost it. I got really pissed off, I raised my voice and started ineffectively asking again and again. I was boiling. She repeated that there was no lease. I shouted \u00abWell if there is no lease, we could just kick you anytime we want and you'd have no right to stay here!\u00bb \\[Still refusing\\] \u00abDon't expect to stay the whole month here\u00bb. I then left the house for the rest of the day. When I came back, she was gone. She took all her things and left. \n\nI had talked about this with my friend and he agreed with me that she was a toxic person. But the girls were on her side, even thought we never talked about it. I know it wasn't right to burst in anger and shout at her, but I feel that it was justified. Am I the asshole?

When I asked she was kind of hesitant. She was engaged too and said we\u2019d probably be planning weddings at the same time and she was worried she wouldn\u2019t be able to devote a lot of time to my wedding. I told her it was going to be super laidback and she wouldn\u2019t have to do much and that I wanted her there, so she agreed. \n\nPlanning the wedding has had its own ups and downs (lots of drama from family), but Jane has been a good enough bridesmaid. My friend Jim has been planning my bachelorette, and they both went to see me get my veil. I think she could stand to be a bit more involved, but considering distance and time she\u2019s doing enough. \n\nWhen Jane first got engaged, she wasn\u2019t even sure if wanted to have a traditional wedding. She was talking about doing something really small and only inviting immediate family and close friends. It turns out that she actually is going to have a ceremony and reception in the fall. \n\nI awkwardly found out over dinner after pushing her for wedding details that she was planning on having bridesmaids, and I wasn\u2019t one of them. She claimed it was because I live far away (not really, we live on different cities on the east coast and are about a train ride away) and she didn\u2019t want to bother me because I\u2019d be busy with my wedding and marriage. \n\nTo make matters worse, the two girls I had a falling out with are of course in the wedding. \n\nIt hurts so much since I assumed we\u2019d all be together during our weddings. I\u2019m hurt. Jane and I went through a lot together and I really wanted her to be a part of my wedding. I\u2019m hurt that she doesn\u2019t feel the same way. \n\nWhen I told my mom she was shocked and said how rude Jane was. My fianc\u00e9 said it was okay to feel hurt and that it was a dick move, but that Jane also has a right to have whoever she wants in her wedding party.\n\nAm I wrong for feeling like this? Should I confront her? I don\u2019t even know if I want her in my wedding anymore.

She has other people who also work for her as well as friends and family that know how to assist her in the ways she needs as well. It is worth noting that she is completely disabled. She cannot do anything on her own (no use of legs or arms) without someone there to assist her. I met her through mutual friends at a funeral, one of her fill-in caregivers had passed away and the person who passed away had been my friend too. She needed help badly and my heart ached for her. We got in touch via social media and I asked her what days of the week she needed a caregiver, it just so happens that my availability matched her needs. \n\nMy job is physically demanding and as much as I feel bad admitting - stressful - at times. I am beside my \u201cboss\u201d all day while I\u2019m at work and although I really have enjoyed a lot of the time I have spent helping her and getting to know her, she can be pretty bossy (for lack of better words), in the \u201cdemanding\u201d context of the word. My job is to help her with daily tasks and essentially live life, so she has to tell me what she needs or would like to do so I can do it for her or help her do it but she can be kind of mean about it which can be taxing. Between the physicality of the job and the mental aspects I can get worn out at times so I appreciate my days off to recoup.

Anyways,If at any point u can answer that, feel free to stop there and let me have it. \n\n\nTl;DR: KINDA LONG TOO BECAUSE I WANT TO PAINT THE FULL PICTURE BECAUSE IM REALLY MISSING SOMETHING.(I\u2019m honestly desperate for an answer. I know it\u2019s not an advice thread but please point out what I wish was obvious to me.Full details in the bottom. Happy new year before I forget. ) Gf and I had a bit of a falling out tonight after I found out she slept with another dude while we were in a weird spot but definitely not dating. but for once it\u2019s me getting a taste of my own medicine.  And it hurt like fucking hell because I treat others like shit and put myself first and I came to a massive realization after a rough relationship with my gf I (I\u2019m 22, and I want to stop this cycle of bullshit. I\u2019m miserable because Ive been stuck in this loop and now that I\u2019m for some reason seeing things differently I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m good for a relationship) . I really believe I love this girl. I really feel like I would use our current incident against her. It\u2019s just how I cope. And I don\u2019t want to do that because it\u2019s not fair to her. Treated a wonderful girl and person like shit and she took it. Almost decided to bail out after getting her pregnant after a couple of months of us meeting.   (I have 2 kids already that I love to death and have every other weekend. The only time I was sober was when I was with my kids and at work. I started losing my shit and drinking seemed to be the answer [DUMB] A lot of other details and this shit just happened and I just... really feel taken back by it. I think I should end it. I believe she\u2019d stand by me if I really went to therapy or something to sort out what\u2019s in my head but.. I\u2019m mad. I honestly want space. And I feel bad but I can\u2019t not be upset and I can just lose my shit randomly just by thinking about it. My kids don\u2019t see this shit too much. I\u2019d love to take them more but my shitty work schedules and a lot of other things (like their mother not being willing). \n\n\nHonestly, there\u2019s so much backstory to this that it\u2019d take til next year. I was not a very good boyfriend at all.  She and I met at a bar. It was cool. And then I started losing my shit, treating her kinda bad, and drinking a lot. Fast forward. She\u2019s pregnant. I push for abortion but he l we decide to try it out.  Long story short, we try an apartment. I can\u2019t stand it. She has her family move in to replace me. I start dating someone else and move back home. (Not sure what o was doin here. I\u2019d like to cry that I have a mental illness but I really am just a fuckin idiot sometimes)\n\n\nShe\u2019s a perfectly fine girl tbh. She\u2019s smart and pretty. And sometimes she definitely deserves better than me. Fast forward some more. I realized I fucked up. She takes me back immediately but she comes to live with me for a bit so we can get back on our feet. (The stress of the apartment and all really sucked and strained us both so it was a relief no matter what and I was wrong to just leave, I know)\n\nFast forward more. I quit drinking. . We try it again, ya know. Not workin. She\u2019s bitter which is understandable. But she\u2019s totally stuck ( family is fuckin shit.) So we live together.us and the baby. I also have my other kids on the weekend. ( she\u2019s great with them) . At some point, I just get bored and start talking to someone from work. Fuck around a bit. She finds out. (Which hurt her feelings and honestly, I wish I didn\u2019t do it. But I did. And it hurt her bad. I came to a realization though.. I really fucked my head up between blowing things out of proportion, justifying my own actions by twisting things ( any time she would go out or something when we were first dating, I\u2019d be a dick sometimes but in my head I would come up with bizarre shit. It seemed like she slept around a bit and that hit my insecurity hard [seriously fucked up. I know.... ]) , and drinking hard for almost a year. She\u2019s perfect.. she\u2019s wonderful. And about 2 months ago she said she was going out with a friend (she and I were friendly and having sex again at this point but definitely not dating.. and she instead messaged some dude and fucked him. And fuck I am angry. And not exactly at her. She never planned on telling me but I called her out on something earlier tonight because I couldn\u2019t shake a feeling. Ya know that fucking awful pit? It\u2019s even worse because I deserve it. \n\n\n\n\nNow, sharing ever bitty detail, well, as much as I can remember, am I the asshole for.. for being upset? I know it\u2019s not fair to her. But before this, it seemed like we were getting closer. And I felt like we were getting somewhere. And then.. we even got back together. She\u2019s put up with so much of my shit and I\u2019m fairly certain has never really done anything else behind my back. (Which it kind of wasn\u2019t, even. [I\u2019m not too sure if a comma goes there. ]) But I just feel stupid. I act like an asshole and so dumb shit to protect myself. It\u2019s shitty but it\u2019s kept me okay(so far).

Moving on after that occurrence and September, I started having more thoughts that they secretly hated being around me and didn\u2019t actually appreciate my company, and were doing it just out of pity or something. This gave me a lot of anxiety, especially since I kept repeating a problem like back in August where I thought they just wanted to avoid and get rid of me.  Eventually it got to the point where they did in fact want space away from me, and yet I still joined their lobby in game and asked what was happening, and if they just wanted to get rid of me or something. Eventually it caused one of these friends to feel like I was just directing it all on her, since I began specifically making my messages toward her out of anxiety because they went silent. This made her really upset since she usually goes quiet to calm herself down and not say anything she might regret, \n\nA day later, I talked to her and the other friends about it and she was very angry at me for what I kept doing and repeating. I tried saying that I was sorry and not trying to do it on purpose, and they were all aware of me being really depressed and having some other troubles. Eventually the conversation spiraled into her saying something about wanting to be friends, and wanting to be someone I can rely on if I need them, but I need to stop causing her and the rest of them feel like they are being controlled by me and that I need to stop doing that. Afterward i don\u2019t remember what I said, but I remember something the lines of I don\u2019t know what to do and that I\u2019m just sorry about everything I kept doing, I just don\u2019t know how to stop feeling like that and repeating it. She started crying during the call after what I said and left it for the rest of the night. \n\nA day later, I notice she made her own discord server and the other two friends were in it. I found it on social media since I thought it was just something interesting so I joined it. I was kicked out a bit later and messaged her and the other friends what exactly was going on. I was under a lot of stress and worry that this was all going to be a repeat of the past and what I kept being scared of happening, which was them getting rid of me. She never replied to the message or call I tried sending, and the other two friends just basically told me they don\u2019t know. As more and more time went on, more problems arose between me and the other two friends since I kept talking to them for support throughout my confusion, and getting upset and asking too much from them. \n\nOne day, the conversation I had between one of the friends led to him telling me he was taking screenshots of all of our conversations throughout each week, showing them to her and the other friend. A bit later, things spiraled down and he got upset and cried because he felt attacked due to me using bolding, caps lock, etc. to kind of show my surprise and confusion as to why he would be doing that. A little later I got a long message from her saying that I\u2019m being unempathetic to all of them and that she wants me to no longer talk to her at all. I asked if I can respond and was told it would be just a waste of time, but I tried saying I\u2019m sorry anyway. The next several days felt awful for me, and I kept talking to the other two friends as well as other people for help. I eventually came up with sending an apology letter and gift despite being told in her long message that an apology was \u201cway overdue.\u201d I asked if she got it the same night and all I got was a thumbs up emoji. \n\nAnother week or so passed, and during the amount of time I spent seeking support and advice on what was going on, I was given the suggestion and idea to try calling her just for closure on it all and apologize or something. I tried doing that, and I kept saying \u201chello?\u201d Because no one was responding. Eventually they hung up and I got an angry message from one of the friends asking why and if I was trying to call her. Later that day I noticed she left my discord server, as well as another one of the friends in our circle. I messaged her what happened and why this was going on, why apologizing didn\u2019t matter and that I just don\u2019t understand. I got blocked from every social media and removed from them. She got forced out of my class we shared at school for the semester, and I was forced to do it for the second semester so she could have the teacher for the second half of the year. \n\nOver the course of all of that I had looked for help and support for my anxiety and problems, and I\u2019ve made newer friends and became an overall less anxious and clingy person, but still get uncomfortable knowing that if I see them, I cannot contact them at all or think of them as a close friend anymore. They\u2019ve also been rude when I did try contacting them those times, and one of the other friends blocked me as well since they kept insulting me when i tried messaging them about it all and I decided to insult them back, and so I got blocked as well. The third friend understands what I\u2019m going through and knows I\u2019m sorry, but said he\u2019s just staying away for his own past experiences and in case of this happening again, since it was a huge negative impact on him.\n\n So...

My fianc\u00e9 and I have very similar visions for what we want the wedding to look like, and for the most part I\u2019m just letting her pick what she wants to do. However, since the start of the wedding planning, she\u2019s been very firm on having a no kid wedding. I\u2019m not sure where she got the idea, but since she started planning she keeps talking about it. I thought the idea was interesting, but it\u2019s not feasible. She comes from a very small family, maybe 10 total, and I come from a massive family, probably 80 cousins and uncles and stuff total, and a lot of them are still in the 7-10 range, and quite a few under 7. She hasn\u2019t met most of them, but I have, and they\u2019re all decently well behaved. Not statues, but not running around with juice box stains on their face destroying the house. Just regular nice kids, with the exception of the 3-4 actual babies, which are babies so I can\u2019t vouch for their behavior.\n\nI\u2019ve held firm on my position of saying we can\u2019t say no kids, because everyone in my family either has kids or have kids who have kids. My sister for instance, just had twins about a year ago, and one of them is my godson (hers too, kind of, they were born before we got engaged). I kept saying not to worry about it, if people don\u2019t want to bring their kids they\u2019ll just leave them with a babysitter, and if they do bring their kids, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll stay until midnight drinking. Keep in mind, these are all my cousins, not just people I know. None of my non-family friends have kids. \n\nAnyway, after months of trying to be nonchalant about it, I put my foot down and said we\u2019re not having a no kid wedding. It\u2019s the only thing I requested for the wedding apart from my groomsmen and the after party. She acquiesces, but then recently, I\u2019m at dinner with her mother and her sisters, and the topic somehow comes up. Her mom is going off on all these crazy tangents about how the kids could get burned or hurt in some way, or they\u2019d get electrocuted or they are having a fussy day they\u2019ll throw fits, all kinds of things. I was trying to be understanding, like I said, it\u2019s a smaller family. My fianc\u00e9 only has one cousin, who\u2019s around 10, and then her two sisters. But all four of them were ganging up on me. Her mother was still going on about how she\u2019d be legally liable for hospital bills if a kid gets hurt (which I can\u2019t imagine a scenario where that would be true) and there\u2019s going to be a firewall and the church has animals, or if a kid gets hurt then the wedding has to come to a halt. The whole thing came off as very condescending, and the conversation seemed to turn from \u201cIt would be difficult to have fun at a wedding with kids running around,\u201d to \u201cwell I\u2019m paying XX thousand dollars and if you were paying for the wedding then you wouldn\u2019t want kids there either\u201d kind of thing. \n\nAt this point my fianc\u00e9 was backing me up against her mother, but I shut the whole thing down and said we\u2019re not banning kids from the wedding. I didn\u2019t say the wedding was off if no kids, or anything like that, I just told her mother and her sisters the same thing I\u2019d been saying since the start: I have a lot of young cousins, and we\u2019re not going to alienate my family members by having a no kid wedding. Her mother and her sisters seemed to give in, but they were not happy, and the whole dinner was super awkward, and ever since then my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom has been a little chilly about wedding planning. \n\nI don\u2019t think I was being an asshole here, but I wanted some outside input to see what other people thought.

However 6 months ago she hooked up with a boy we'll call David (17M), and the time we spend together has decreased considerably. I\u2019m fine with this, and I couldn't be happier for her finding someone who really cares about her in a way I can't.\n\nHowever, what I'm slightly irritated by is him tagging along to almost everything Danielle and I do.

Well David tells me this morning point blank that he's doing something special with Danielle on Sunday and that I'm not welcome to be in attendance. I ask if I can drop off my gift to her and leave then. He says just give him the gift and he'll give it to her Sunday from me. Me being the unsuspecting sucker that I am agreed.\n\nAfter school today however, I see who else but David and Danielle in line for the bus. David says something along the lines of he has an early gift for her to hold her over till Sunday, and lo and behold, it's the earring box I handed off to him. I had to sit there in complete disbelief at the fact that he just did that. (On the bright side though, she loved the gift) About an hour ago I texted her telling her about this, and she has refused to believe a word of it. She thinks I'm a liar when I tell her the earrings were from me, and she thinks I'm just being jealous still, but no she also called me an asshole for accusing David of stealing.\n\nI'm so fed up with David and everything surrounding him, but I feel like I may lose my best friend over it at this point.

R is also enlisted and dated a mutual friend for a while, and while they had a bit of an ugly breakup we stayed friends with both parties because we feel that whatever happens between them, baring any kind of abuse, shouldn\u2019t affect our friendships with either. A little over a two years pass and we get a wedding invitation from R and we\u2019re happy for her, but there\u2019s some lingering concerns because she marrying a guy she\u2019s only been dating for 2 months...\nFast forward a year later, my husband gets stationed near R and we meet to catch up since we haven\u2019t seen her in 2 years. Since we just moved to the area, we don\u2019t have our own place yet and staying at a hotel while we try to find an apartment is draining our finances quick, so R happily agrees to let me and our 3 pets (2 cats and our 5lb dog) stay with her and her husband while my husband stays with another friend until we find a place. I didn\u2019t find out until the night I came to stay she didn\u2019t at least ask her husband, just sprung it on him, but despite the awkward introduction her husband, T, turns out to be a really cool guy and we bond over video games and other mutual pop culture stuff.\nWhile I\u2019m staying with them, I cook and clean up after myself, buy my own groceries, and basically do my best to not disrupt their daily lives; we only have one car that my husband obviously needs to get to and from work, so I\u2019m pretty much housebound in a new town where the only people I know are R and T and spend my free time filling out apartment applications and playing video games.\nFinally, after nearly 2 months, we get approved for a place perfectly in our budget and have a move-in date. Two weeks before I left, suddenly R\u2019s skeletons come tumbling out of the closet.\nDuring my stay, R and T got into a lot of petty fights over seemingly nothing, with R always instigating due to her having a short temper and it always made me super uncomfortable that they would do this in front of me almost every time. It had gotten to the point I was looking into staying with a friend nearly 5 hours away, worried that maybe my staying there was putting any stress on them, but when R found out she wanted to sit down and talk about it, asking what she could do to help me feel more comfortable. I was honest with her about my concerns, how I felt that she and T needed to work in their communication together and she needed to reign in her temper. Since they were already seeing a marriage counselor who had told her the same thing, she agreed with me and apologized and things were okay for a while after that, even T insisting they enjoyed my company and help around the house. R occasionally came to me for advice and I was always honest with her but did my best to word things gently so she wouldn\u2019t feel like I was shouldering all the blame on her; at this point in our friendship I already knew she had some issues from childhood trauma that affected her behaviors and how she dealt with situations, and encouraged her to continue seeing their marriage counselor and to consider a personal one for herself.\nI had also noticed during my stay that she drank a lot of wine, even on nights she worked early the next day. Now I enjoy a glass or two myself, but it was concerning to me that she would drink nearly a whole bottle every other night and apparently had a few stashed upstairs that she laughingly said T didn\u2019t know about, which was another red flag. One night when I tried to tell her I was worried, especially because she was taking medication at the time, she snapped at me and didn\u2019t speak to me the rest of the night. T served her with divorce papers the next morning.\nR left two days later on a sort of deployment for a month, and I discovered through T\u2019s sister (who had visited for Thanksgiving that I had cooked for everyone) that R had complained to her that I was \u201can overweight, lazy couch potato with no motivation\u201d and it hurt me pretty deeply. I have clinical depression and have struggled with an eating disorder since I was 12, things R has known since we became friends, so for her to have allegedly said those things cut to my core. Rather than confront her, I chose to temporarily block her on social media, my reasoning being she was going through a divorce and clearly had a lot of her own issues to work on and I didn\u2019t want her to feel attacked, deciding I\u2019d rather talk about it in person so there wouldn\u2019t be any misunderstanding over text, but that turned out to be the wrong decision as she almost immediately lashed out at my husband, telling him I was being petty and had no right to be angry with her. My husband gently diffused the situation, emphasizing that I was simply hurt by the accusation and for her to simply focus on herself and that we would get together when she got back.\nBut soon I had evidence via screenshots she\u2019d said these things more than once to multiple people; mutual friends, one of T\u2019s other family members, coworkers, even going so far as to tell them I was \u201ca bisexual in a poly marriage\u201d and to \u201cnot be surprised if she flirts with you.\u201d Admittedly that may not seem like a big deal to some, but in the military atmosphere people can get in trouble for what would be considered adultery, and I never disclose my sexuality or open marriage to people I don\u2019t feel comfortable with, so having complete strangers know these things made me extremely uncomfortable and worried about how it could potentially affect my husband\u2019s career if someone took it to his command; most don\u2019t care, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m comfortable gambling with.\nAt that point I had decided I was done, that I didn\u2019t want to talk to her about it because she\u2019d repeatedly tried to blame everyone else around her rather than just owning up and apologizing, but yesterday my husband received a message from R that said, \u201cIs Catsocks done being mad at me for something I didn\u2019t even do?\u201d\nSomething about that wording just feels so dismissive of my feelings, but am I really the asshole for stepping away from this friendship?", "output": "choosing to step out of a toxic friendship", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

At 6 am, I noticed that we were missing an important part of a drawing project due later. I hadn't noticed before.\n\nI texted F and she got mad that I didn't tell her sooner. I figured she wouldn't fix it (school lends us PCs &amp; wacoms, and we had two free periods so there shouldn't have been an issue), so I did a quick painting over my template (she was supposed to follow it so this wouldn't happen). I didn't use F's drawing bc I thought it would be rude to change it. \n\n\nFastforward to 30 minutes before the class, we're sitting in a classroom. G and other 2 students were there. I showed F what I had done in those 2 periods. Once again, F brought up that it was my fault for answering so late. I told her \"you had the time and means\". F got mad and continued talking loudly. Then, F got angry at T over the gc for not submitting the image to the teacher. No one had told T to send it, but we all assumed he was going to. I told F something like \"you can't expect T to send the image when you didn't even send it to him through e-mail. You sent a low-resolution jpg in the gc.\" \n\nShe got louder \"No one told me to send it. How was I supposed to know?\" I thought this was hypocritical of her and told her \"You already know the gc sends low-quality images.

The class agreed her drawing was prettier but mine fulfilled the checklist. I talked to my teacher and my bff and both told me to cut ties after the project was done.\n\nThen I told my BF. He defended F &amp; said \"Please understand F, she's having a hard time. Her mental health is bad. I know this doesn't excuse her but maybe it was a bad moment. I think you should just talk to her\". This hurt me a lot as I have mental health issues, too. \n\n\nI have F's texts to BF if anyone wants her side on this. \n\n\nAITA for not wanting to apologize?

So basically, this girl and her friends have been bothering me pretty much every day since the start of the school year. We all used to be cool but the girl caught feelings for me that I couldn\u2019t reciprocate so eventually I guess she began to despise me or something. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it and I still wanted to be cool with her and her friends, and for a short while we were. \n\nOut of the blue a couple months ago (start of the school year) they all became toxic asf and constantly disrespectful. Anytime I snapped back they would play the victim. On numerous occasions they tried to humiliate me by getting all together and \u201cjumping me\u201d which is basically them all pushing me around, punching me, slapping me, and pulling on my hair. For some reason I brushed this off and still tried to be cool with them, (probably my own ego and not being able to sit with the fact that a group of girls basically bullied me) I tried to flip the positions of power and act like I was the bigger person by ignoring their tirades of assault. \n\nEvery day it became more and more obnoxious until today. I finally snapped. Before I was never really hurt or cared too much about it, but today... The girl brought up some pretty personal and insulting things  about my family and said it loud enough so she could \u201cexpose\u201d me. She then punched me, right in my nose. (It was actually bleeding) I couldn\u2019t take it, I lost my cool. I ended up pushing her and kicking her to the ground as she turned around. Her friends jumped in and beat on me too. They were much smaller so I could easily ignore them, she was the biggest and quite close to my size (I\u2019m 6 2 she\u2019s 6 0 and quite strong) She proceeded to get back up and slap me a couple times, real fucking kangaroo slaps, I was going to reciprocate with real man punches but my boys had to hold me back.

Maybe my logic is backwards, AITA?\n\nTL;DR\nUpper classmates and her friends jumped me. They were all beating on me until he biggest girl who is basically my size brought up very personal things about my family and my own life and used it to insult me, while shouting it so everybody could hear. She then proceeded to throw a big ol hook right at me, striking my nose (it was bleeding later), I reciprocated by pushing her and kicking her to the floor. (Not stomping on her) Her and her friends continued to beat on me.

I'm currently 20 years old and in my 3rd year of college. Growing up seemed pretty regular with the exception of a very emotional abusive father and stockholmed syndrome mother (Married 32 years). We weren't always really well off on money but my father's business slowly got better and during my years through highschool we lived pretty comfortable. They could definitely afford college for me but I really didn't want to go to school on their dime. Although this might seem or be really prideful. I have just recognized throughout life that the things I don't buy or earn , I don't appreciate. There is also an awesome feeling when completing something you did by yourself. It was the last semester of my senior year at highschool and after hearing another one of my parents fights (They got pretty bad/abusive) I tried to make it clear I wanted to pay for college on my own. When telling my mother (The one I feel more comfortable talking to) she told me \" Listen, don't fuck up the last 17 years I spent suffering for you\". I was really bothered but decided to take the money to appease everyone. Don't get me wrong I notice the sacrifice my parents made for me growing up but I don't believe that I should be forced to take \"gifts\". Fast forward a year , Im a freshman in college. I come home  and stay with my parents for the break. During which another arguement/fight happens between my mom and my dad and I happen to get caught in the middle of it. My dad depersonalizes pretty quick and will cut anyone who is in his sight down. He told me while hitting the top of his shoulders sarcastically with his hand \" I spend alot of money every year for you to go to school and it sits right on my fucking neck\".( My tuition isn't more than 5% of my parents income) \" I wish you'd had never come home\". This infuriates me because I didn't want his fucking money in the first place. Everything I have ever gotten from them has seems to come locked with a ball and chain. Now, present day I'm in my third year because I keep telling my self It wont matter as long as I graduate. I have this overwhelming dread that I'm not able to do things my way and that they will contribute my degree to themselves and that I wont feel as if I have earned my degree. There are multiple instances where I'm reminded by the both of them of the financial \"burden\" I seem to be and how ungrateful I am to ask if I can do it on my own. My siblings tell me that I'm spoiled and that I should count my blessings. They also tell me that I would never be able to do it. I do want to go to school and prosper in my respective field (nursing) but I wanted to do it on my own terms. ( I know its hard, but I know I can do it.) Am I the asshole?

She asked me if I was comfortable with that, and I didn't want to be \"that guy\" and say no, so I said yes. But really, it makes me uncomfortable that she would be dancing to a love song dedicated to another man at our wedding. I am happy to make space in our lives for his memory.

We've been playing here for about 2 years and things are good most of the time. \n\nIn terms of food, we've gone through phases where we'll order a couple pizzas and someone will take the bill but it's never consistent. I could buy a pizza for all 6 in the house one day and the next week someone would buy pizza for only 2 people. It goes up and down and the distribution of wealth was uneven making me uncomfortable with the set up. 1 of the group members \"L\" is my bestfriend and I'm always down to foot his bill but not necessarily all the others all the time. I'm a student, working on call jobs so there's not always a sea of money flying in. I dont like the risk of saying I'm going to order pizza and having to pay for everyones. Even if they pay me back I'm not sure I have enough in my account to take in the first place.\n\nThe pizza thing lasted like 2 months then we went to doing our own thing. Most weeks I show up with food of my own, so does everyone else. Some people cook in the house and some buy and bring it with them.

On Thanksgiving this past week she sent the \"Turkey lurkey slut\" chain message to our group chat- you can do a google search if you are wondering what the message says. \n\nLater that day i dm a joke to her that one brand of clothes is way better than another brand of clothes that she likes. she says \u201cfk no\u201d, and I say \u201cfk yes\u201d. Then she says \u201cfk you\u201d, and I respond \u201cfk you, fkin bitch, turkey slut\u201d. Before I called her a \u201cturkey slut\u201d it was a really lighthearted \u201cargument\u201d, we were just joking around. I didn\u2019t mean any harm by it and called her that term only to reference the chain message she sent earlier that day.\n\nHer immediate response is \u201cdon\u2019t disrespect me\u201d and saying she doesn\u2019t want to be called derogatory terms like that. It was so serious and direct that I thought she was joking. But she reaffirmed herself by saying \u201cIm serious\u201d and  \u201cIm not joking\u201d. I was in disbelief because I completely did not expected her react like that. So I just respond with \u201cok\u201d and leave it at that. After the conversation ended I was still very confused that she would say that over a lighthearted joke like that. I understand that out right calling a girl a slut can be considered by many to be very offensive and it I have not ever done that. I felt like this was different.\n\nI wanted to know how she felt about what I said so the next day, I ask her how offended she was that I called her that. \nShe said \u201cnot really because I know you didn\u2019t mean it. But I don\u2019t want you to call other people derogatory terms even if its a joke, because some could get really offended\u201d. I was still unsure how she felt so I said \u201cYou sounded pretty serious, are you sure were weren\u2019t offended\u201d. She says \u201cI sounded serious so you would take it serious,\u201d and asks me why I cared if she was offended. At this point it sounds to me like she wasn\u2019t offended, but only said that to teach me not to say that to people. \n\nSo I tell her \u201cif you were trying to teach me not to say that to ppl, you shouldve just said that instead of acting offended and srs about it\u201d. In hindsight I can see now that saying this didn\u2019t help the cause of understanding how she felt, and could\u2019ve been seen as condescending and rude. I admit that the way I handled it was a very bad attempt at that. But to end the conversation she tells me \u201ci was serious about it u better not fucking call me those things again. idk if you\u2019re trying to start something but back the fuck off and watch your mouth\u201d.\n\nBefore this, I considered her a very close friend. I had never even jokingly called her any derogatory names- e.g, slut, whore, hoe, etc. While she has sent many of those expletive chain messages and even jokingly called me a slut in the group chat once before.

My mentor (now referred to as DT) took over my training when I started with the competitive teams from 11-18 years old, she also bought the studio when I was about 11. I was going through a really traumatic point in my life and was severely bullied by my teammates which lead to a deep depression and developing an eating disorder. The bullying from my team continued in plain sight to the point more than 1 other teacher spoke to me about it but it never got any better. DT would have to be blind not miss it since these girls would make nasty remarks about my body in front of her when we tried on costumes, tell me I was never good enough to be on the team, mock me at every chance they could and were just monsters towards me. I finally broke down at 17 and had a meeting with DT about all the years of abuse and torment these girls had put me through to which she said she had no idea. She then brushed it under the rug and never addressed it again resulting in me only competing in solos that year and being pulled from all of the competitive teams. Not only did this ostracize me but it made the bullying worse. As company owner and head choreographer DT also pulled me from all solos I would have gotten for the final ballet I ever did with this company. I was so defeated and broken by the end of it all that I left and refused to ever again set foot near the place that cause me years of torment.\n\nI removed everyone aside from a small number of people who were a part of that studio from my life and went on to recover from my ED and put my life back together. A few months ago I got a call from one of my former teammates that my DT had passed away after battling cancer and that her memorial would take place a month later. My mom had been on the board for this studio as the Treasurer so she knew DT and most of what I went through there. She kept asking me in the week leading up to my DT's funeral if I would go and I kept saying no. I didn't feel comfortable being surrounded by the people that made my life hell to celebrate the life of the woman who not only watched as it happened but never made any attempts to stop it. The day of the funeral my mom calls me to again ask if I would come with her and I say no. She proceeds to tell me how selfish I'm being, how much my DT had done for the community and all the people\u2019s lives she enriched and that I owe it to my DT to be there. When I wouldn't budget she changed tactics by saying that I should go because my DT had been such a huge part of my life, that I was being cruel for not wanting to show my love and support for DT's mother and how unchristianly I was being (note: I am not religious but my parents are).
