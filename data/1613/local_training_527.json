IRS-1 protein binds to several oncogene proteins. Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the initiation and progression of cancers. Cancer cells produce greater levels of ROS than normal cells do because of increased metabolic stresses. However, excessive production of ROS kills cancer cells. Autophagy usually serves as a survival mechanism in response to stress conditions, but excessive induction of autophagy results in cell death. In addition to inducing necrosis and apoptosis, ROS induces autophagic cell death. ROS inactivates IRS-1 mediated signaling and reduces intracellular IRS-1 concentrations. Thus, there is a complex relationship between IRS-1, ROS, autophagy, and cancer. It is not fully understood how cancer cells grow rapidly and survive in the presence of high ROS levels.', 'In this study, we established mouse NIH/3T3 cells that overexpressed IRS-1, so mimicking cancers with increased IRS-1 expression levels; we found that the IRS-1 overexpressing cells grow more rapidly than control cells do. Treatment of cells with glucose oxidase (GO) provided a continuous source of ROS; low dosages of GO promoted cell growth, while high doses induced cell death. Evidence for GO induced autophagy includes increased levels of isoform B-II microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), aggregation of green fluorescence protein-tagged LC3, and increased numbers of autophagic vacuoles in cells. Overexpression of IRS-1 resulted in inhibition of basal autophagy, and reduced oxidative stress-induced autophagy and cell death. ROS decreased the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase signaling, while overexpression of IRS-1 attenuated this inhibition.

DM monocytes revealed higher expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products. Stimulation with advanced glycation end products ligands resulted in activation of non-DM monocytes and inhibition of VEGFR-1-mediated chemotaxis.

The A domain of CAO participates in the regulation of the CAO protein stability.', 'In order to clarify the physiological function of the A domain, we constructed transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants which either overexpressed the complete CAO or a truncated version of CAO lacking the A domain. The transgenic plants overexpressing the A-domain-deleted CAO accumulated an excess amount of chlorophyll b during greening. The transgenic plants which lacked the A domain either died or were obviously retarded when they were exposed to continuous light immediately after etiolation. In addition, the loss of the A domain in CAO impaired another step of chlorophyll biosynthesis, namely the conversion of divinyl-protochlorophyllide a to monovinyl protochlorophyllide a under dark conditions.", "output": "0", "category": "Intent Identification 1472.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage classify if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal or not.

With the emergence of the nutrition transition in South Africa, there is an urgent need for interventions to prevent overweight and obesity in children and adolescents as risk factors for chronic diseases in adolescence may track throughout later life. This research explored the potential for faith-based organisations (FBOs) to be used as community organisations for overweight and obesity prevention interventions in adolescents by assessing the readiness of religious leaders to engage in such interventions.', 'Surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 51 religious leaders in Johannesburg and Soweto. The Community Readiness Model (CRM) survey was chosen to determine the stage of readiness of this community regarding overweight and obesity prevention. Six different dimensions were assessed in the CRM (community efforts, knowledge of efforts, leadership, community climate, knowledge of the issue, resources). The surveys were scored according to the CRM protocol. The survey data were supplemented with findings from FGDs. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the FGDs.', 'The mean community readiness score was 2.57\\u2009\u00b1\\u20090.76 which equates with the \"denial/resistance stage\". The mean readiness score for resources was the highest of all the dimensions (3.77\\u2009\u00b1\\u20090.28), followed by knowledge of the issue (3.20\\u2009\u00b1\\u20090.51).

The research conducted in this article examines a frequently identified fusion protein between FGFR3 and transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (TACC3), frequently identified in glioblastoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, oral cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and cervical cancer. Using titanium dioxide-based phosphopeptide enrichment (TiO2)-liquid chromatography (LC)-high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), it was demonstrated that the fused coiled-coil TACC3 domain results in constitutive phosphorylation of key activating FGFR3 tyrosine residues.

Sinus rhythm maps were used to predict the location of the isthmus (central common pathway [CCP]), which is the protected region of the circuit bounded by arcs of block (mean accuracy 76.7 +/- 4%). Although reentrant circuits differed, the positions of the entrance point of each CCP were common. The location of the line that would span the CCP at its narrowest width also was estimated (mean accuracy 91.3 +/- 5%). Ablation at this line is expected to prevent reentry recurrence. In one test experiment, ablation prevented recurrence of both sustained reentrant tachycardia morphologies.", "output": "0", "category": "Intent Identification 1472.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage classify if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal or not.

Here, the impact of EWS/FLI1 inhibition, by RNAi-mediated knockdown, on cellular signaling was investigated using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to quantify global changes in phosphorylation. This unbiased approach identified hundreds of unique phosphopeptides enriched in processes such as regulation of cell cycle and cytoskeleton organization. In particular, phosphotyrosine profiling revealed a large upregulation of STAT3 phosphorylation upon EWS/FLI1 knockdown. However, single-cell analysis demonstrated that this was not a cell-autonomous effect of EWS/FLI1 deficiency, but rather a signaling effect occurring in cells in which knockdown does not occur. Conditioned media from knockdown cells were sufficient to induce STAT3 phosphorylation in control cells, verifying the presence of a soluble factor that can activate STAT3. Cytokine analysis and ligand/receptor inhibition experiments determined that this activation occurred, in part, through an IL6-dependent mechanism. Taken together, the data support a model in which EWS/FLI1 deficiency results in the secretion of soluble factors, such as IL6, which activate STAT signaling in bystander cells that maintain EWS/FLI1 expression.

The hypothetical total incidence of child MVA victims (N) is calculated from N = (S x H)/n.', 'Estimates of the incidences of \"serious\" injuries in MVAs under various conditions of stratification and matching. The overall procedure is tested for conformity with accepted criteria for valid use of mark/recapture.', 'About one third of the 1009 police and 836 hospital records could be exactly matched. There were significant variations in matching proportions by class of accident (pedestrian v passenger v cyclist). This selective recapture or \"heterogeneity\" was not affected by sex, but was independently influenced by the age of the child. Further uncertainty was introduced when matching criteria were slightly relaxed. Estimates of the total population of children with serious injuries vary accordingly from 1729 to 2743. A number of plausible reasons why these two data sources might not be unbiased or mutually independent samples of the total target population are proposed as explanations for this heterogeneity.", "output": "1", "category": "Intent Identification 1472.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage classify if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal or not.

Therefore, the proteasome has become an attractive target for pharmaceutical interventions. Inhibition of the cardiac proteasome by specific proteasome inhibitors has been shown to attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and ischaemia reperfusion injury of the heart. We have resolved the cardiac proteasome into its subtypes and have addressed the key question of how proteasome inhibitors affect single cardiac proteasomal subtypes.', 'The 20S proteasome from rat heart was dissected into three different subpopulations (groups I-III), each comprising 4-7 different subtypes. The major group (group II) comprises standard proteasome subtypes; the two minor subpopulations (groups I and III) contain intermediate proteasome subtypes. All subtypes exhibit chymotrypsin-, trypsin-, and caspase-like activity but to different degrees. We have tested the effect of two common proteasome inhibitors on the chymotrypsin-like activity of all subtypes: 20-30 nmol/L MG132 caused 50% inhibition of all subtypes from groups I and II, whereas 100 nmol/L was necessary to affect group III subtypes to the same extent. However, another inhibitor, bortezomib (VELCADE), already used clinically, inhibited 50% of the activity of group III proteasome subtypes even below 20 nmol/L, a concentration showing almost no effect on group I and II proteasome subtypes. The caspase-like activity of group II proteasome subtypes was not affected by MG132 and was inhibited by bortezomib only at concentrations above 100 nmol/L.", "output": "1", "category": "Intent Identification 1472.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage classify if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal or not.

These abnormal protein inclusions are composed of either amorphous TDP-43 aggregates or highly ordered filaments. The filamentous TDP-43 accumulations typically contain clean 10-12 nm filaments though wider 18-20 nm coated filaments may be observed. The TDP-43 present within these lesions is phosphorylated, truncated and ubiquitinated, and these modifications appear to be abnormal as they are linked to both a cellular heat shock response and microglial activation. The mechanisms associated with this abnormal TDP-43 accumulation are believed to result in a loss of TDP-43 function, perhaps due to the post-translational modifications or resulting from physical sequestration of the TDP-43. The formation of TDP-43 inclusions involves cellular translocation and conversion of TDP-43 into fibrillogenic forms, but the ability of these accumulations to sequester normal TDP-43 and propagate this behavior between neurons pathologically is mostly inferred.

Here, we investigate the role of early experience and genetic background in determining the outcome of settlement by pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) breeding in two habitat patches between which dispersal and subsequent reproductive performance is influenced by phenotype (body size).

Nevertheless, nearly a third (27.6\\xa0%) moved away from the rearing habitat and, as previously observed in unmanipulated individuals, dispersal between habitats was phenotype-dependent. Pied flycatchers breeding in the oak and the pine forests are differentiated by body size, and analyses of genetic variation at microsatellite loci now provide evidence of subtle genetic differentiation between the two populations.

However, it is well established that hepatocytes cultured on monolayers of dried stiff collagen dedifferentiate, losing specialized liver functions. In this study, we show that hepatocyte dedifferentiation is a reversible consequence of a specific signaling network constellation triggered by the extracellular matrix. A dried stiff collagen activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) via Src, leading to activation of the Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathways. Akt causes resistance to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-induced apoptosis by antagonizing p38, whereas ERK1/2 signaling opens the route to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Apoptosis resistance is reversible by inhibiting Akt or Src, and EMT can be abrogated by blocking the ERK1/2 pathway. In contrast to stiff collagen, a softer collagen gel does not activate FAK, keeping the hepatocytes in a state where they remain sensitive to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis and do not undergo EMT. In this culture system, inhibition of p38 as well as overexpression of constitutively active Akt causes apoptosis resistance, whereas constitutively active Ras induces EMT. Finally, we show that matrix-induced EMT is reversible by replating cells from dried stiff to soft gel collagen. Our results demonstrate that hepatocyte dedifferentiation in vitro is an active process driven by FAK-mediated Akt and ERK1/2 signaling.

In the presence of heparin, a chemotactic response of EC to cytokine was seen at all doses, with no significant difference between FGF-1 and R136K. A dose-dependent difference was noted in this group between the 100 and 200 ng/mL concentrations of cytokine (for FGF-1, P <.0001; for R136K, P <.0001). SMC showed no difference in migration with FGF-1, R136K, or negative control at any dose in the presence or absence of heparin.

We previously showed that the quiver/sleepless (qvr/sss) gene encodes a membrane-tethered protein that is required for normal sleep in Drosophila. SLEEPLESS (SSS) protein functions, at least in part, by upregulating the levels and open probability of Shaker (Sh) potassium channels to suppress neuronal excitability and enable sleep. Consistent with this proposed mechanism, loss-of-function mutations in Sh phenocopy qvr/sss-null mutants. However, sleep is more genetically modifiable in Sh than in qvr/sss mutants, suggesting that SSS may regulate additional molecules to influence sleep.', 'Here we show that SSS also antagonizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to reduce synaptic transmission and promote sleep. Mimicking this antagonism with the nAChR inhibitor mecamylamine or by RNAi knockdown of specific nAChR subunits is sufficient to restore sleep to qvr/sss mutants. Regulation of nAChR activity by SSS occurs posttranscriptionally, since the levels of nAChR mRNAs are unchanged in qvr/sss mutants. Regulation of nAChR activity by SSS may in fact be direct, since SSS forms a stable complex with and antagonizes nAChR function in transfected cells. Intriguingly, lynx1, a mammalian homolog of SSS, can partially restore normal sleep to qvr/sss mutants, and lynx1 can form stable complexes with Shaker-type channels and nAChRs.", "output": "0", "category": "Intent Identification 1472.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage classify if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal or not.

In addition, Bmal1 overexpression increased the expression of osteogenic genes including inhibitor of DNA binding (Id1), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and osteocalcin (OC). Interestingly, expression of Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2), an important upstream factor of Id1, Runx2, and OC, was markedly increased by Bmal1. Finally, we confirmed that insulin-induced BMP2 expression was attenuated in Bmal1 knockout (KO) cells.

Compared with controls, CF1-CRP mice had hypertension that was predominantly systolic, and the severity of hypertension varied in parallel with changes in CRP levels modulated by dietary manipulation. Mice that were hemizygous for the transgene with CRP levels of 9 microg/mL were also hypertensive, indicating that modest elevations in CRP are sufficient to alter BP. CRP transgenic mice had exaggerated BP elevation in response to angiotensin II and a reduction in vascular angiotensin receptor subtype 2 (AT2) expression. In contrast, the decline in BP with angiotensin receptor subtype 1 (AT1) antagonism and vascular AT1 abundance were unaltered, which indicates a selective effect of CRP on AT2. Ex vivo experiments further showed that the CRP-induced decrease in AT2 is a direct effect on the vascular wall, not requiring systemic responses, and that it is reversed by an NO donor, which indicates a role for NO deficiency in the process.

Then we used statistical analysis to evaluate the diagnostic value and the associations of FGFR4 expression with clinical parameters. In vitro studies, the effects of FGFR4 on proliferation and migration of NPC cell line CNE2 were measured by the starvation-refeeding experiment, CCK8 assay, wounding healing assay and transwell migration assay. The changes of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in CNE2 cells after knocking down the expression of FGFR4 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis.', 'FGFR4 was overexpressed in NPC as compared with the inflammatory tissues. High expression of FGFR4 was correlated with Ki67 expression, clinical stages and prognosis in NPC patients (P<0.05).While in vitro, the upregulation of FGFR4 was accompanied with CNE2 cells released from serum starvation. Moreover, it could increase cell proliferation and migration by regulating EMT markers in CNE2 cells.", "output": "0", "category": "Intent Identification 1472.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage classify if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal or not.
