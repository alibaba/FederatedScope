Garcia knew all four victims, police said, but they didn't reveal details about the relationships. \n\n\"The individuals who were shot were known to the suspect. It was not necessarily a random act,\" Monroe County Sheriff Patrick O'Flynn said. \n\nThe first two victims -- Mary Sillman, 23, and Randall Norman, 41 -- were fatally shot before 5 a.m. at Lakeside Memorial Hospital in Brockport, where Garcia was once employed, O'Flynn said. Another woman was wounded and is undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital, he said. \n\nThe second shooting happened at a house in nearby Ontario County on Saturday afternoon. \n\nChristopher Glatz, 45, and his wife, Kim, 38, were killed \"execution-style\" while their two teenagers were in the suburban Rochester home, Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said. \n\nThe teens were not wounded, but it is unclear whether they witnessed the event. \n\nPovero said neighbors reported Garcia went door-to-door looking for the Glatzes' home. \n\n\"He was in fact looking for the residence,\" Povero said. \"He was saying different things to different people, but he was clearly looking for that home.\" \n\nBallistic evidence has connected the two crime scenes, Povero said. Investigators found the matching brass cartridges from a pistol found on Garcia when he was arrested, he said. \n\nGarcia was arrested at a restaurant Saturday afternoon, CNN affiliate R-News in Rochester reported.

The hot filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections. \n\nIncandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.", "output": "What is the energy source for an incandescent bulb?, How does it get hot?, How is is protected?, How about in a halogen bulb?", "category": "Question Generation 1534.json"}]
