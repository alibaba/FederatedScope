I still had interest in her but she started dating someone else and on that evening she flirted with some other guy. I didn't really care since I had other things in mind and I just didn't want to destroy the evening for myself. Later me and my good friend,best friend of the girl, go for a little walk (5-10 minutes), and she tells me that the girl told her that she wanted to make out with me again, so me who is interested in her goes like \"Yeah, I'm down.\" I have to mention that i'm pretty drunk at this point and when I look back now i'm kind of ashamed but me and my good friend walk back and she went in before me. As soon as I walk in my best friend told the girl something and the girl just comes out and we started making out for like 5 minutes straight until her brother started looking for her but I think he didn't see anything. Anyway next day we went to a \"Fasnachtsumzug\" (i really dont know how to explain it in english, look it up you will immeaditely get it.

On that evening i text her and ask why she so devastated since she has made out with 2 guys the evening before. The didn't remember making out with me because of the alcohol and i explain her what happened and again we just remained there. But a day later she texts me asking what the fuck is wrong with me and stuff like that and accuses me of using her to make out only because she was so drunk which I really didn't know since at the point where we made out I didn't see her for like 40 minutes and couldn't have known. Now she makes it look like I knew that she was drunk and I was too irresponsible to check on her before she literally ran me over to make out with me and flirted with me on the same evening two hours before. I actually apoligized that I should have been more responsible and stuff like that but she just spitted on that. And in between the 2 evenings we talked a lot and were pretty good friends.

He had moved into his late father\u2019s house and there were a lot of my grandparents belongings there. One day I came home from school and my dad told me to look in my room for a surprise. On my dresser was this jewelry box. It used to belong to my grandmother, my dad\u2019s mom, who died before I was born, but whom I\u2019ve heard was a wonderful woman. \n\nIt is, unfortunately, not the most... beautiful jewelry box. It\u2019s HUGE, maybe a foot tall and six inches wide. It\u2019s shaped like an armoire, with a curved top and this kind of murky brown pine colored wood. With poorly done stained \u201cglass\u201d (plastic) that\u2019s just painted to look like stained glass. It\u2019s also pretty non-functional too, with weird shallow drawers and a big, tall empty space that I couldn\u2019t really use anything for, but as a teenaged girl at my dad\u2019s house I took what I could get. (Girls living with their fathers part time can probably understand this). So I used it throughout high school, and then left it there when I moved to college.\n\nSince then, my family has moved around a bunch and I\u2019ve upgraded my home room to something a lot better. I\u2019ve been living away from home at school for most of the year for a few years, so I\u2019ve accumulated a lot of my own things to furnish/decorate my own apartment. A couple of those things happen to be a very beautiful hand carved wooden box that a friend of mine gifted me that I use as a jewelry box, a smaller ring box as a gift from my cousin, and a really gorgeous larger jewelry box that I got as a Christmas gift from one of my best friends. \n\nNow that I\u2019m about to move back home, I want to make my room feel \u201cmine,\u201d and want to bring back all of the things that have sentimental value to me in my room now, and display them in my room there. These three jewelry boxes are so beautiful and very sentimental to me, and they have served me well here, and I want to bring them home. \n\nMy grandmother\u2019s jewelry box is not very useful to me, and isn\u2019t really beautiful to look at either. And I know it means a lot to my father but, to be blunt, I\u2019ve never met her. I don\u2019t know her at all, so I don\u2019t have a huge attachment to the box. I don\u2019t want to throw it away or sell it, though. So I was starting to consider moving it from my dresser at home and putting it in storage, and replacing it with my other jewelry boxes. But I\u2019ve started to feel badly about doing this, because it is my late grandmothers and my dad would probably be upset if he noticed it was no longer in my room.\n\nI think it may serve a better purpose when I move into my own place, maybe as a decorative piece in a guest room or something, but right now I\u2019d like to have other things in my space.  \n\nSo, WIBTA if I stored my late grandmother\u2019s jewelry box and put other sentimental items in its place?

About a week ago, my friends and I signed up  to perform at a Battle of the Bands competition.  The day of the competition is March 27(about 5 weeks from posting this) and we need to learn 5 songs for a 20 minute performance. Our band has performed twice before for small crowds but If we do win, we get to perform at an even bigger gig and would be the step in the direction our band wants to go in before we graduate.\n\nOur rhythm guitarist is one of my best friends and has been in the band since day one. But due to a head injury in his childhood and some shitty events in his recent life, he\u2019s been depressed and anxious. I talked him into getting the band back together for battle of the bands and he agreed.\n\nBut then he texted me that night saying that he had an anxiety attack about the performance and said he wanted to get out of the band. The next day, I was able to convince him to stay.\n\nTwo days ago, I asked him if he was coming to practice and he couldn\u2019t because he was working on a project for school but he would be able to come to the next practice.\n\nThen, the guitarist texts me that night essentially saying that he needs to quit because he\u2019s been relapsing into a deeper depression and with all the stress in his life right now, he can\u2019t handle doing this and that it\u2019d be better to meet in person the next day to discuss it face to face.\n\nYesterday, we met up and he apologized for the long text saying that he has been bipolar recently due to his medications and that he is willing to go past that to perform with the band. I told him that I was sorry but we couldn\u2019t let him come back. I told him that the reasons why:\n\n-He\u2019s been known to get out of things last minute and make up excuses to not go to things. We can\u2019t deal with that because every practice counts and we can\u2019t trust if he is busy or lying.\n\n-Quitting the day before made everyone mad at him for a bit but we got over it. If he were to quit later on though, it would put even more stress on all of our friendships than if he just left now.\n\n-If he did end up quitting last minute, he would leave us unprepared and make us lose.\n\nAfter I told him that, he argued that most of my points rely on him not performing and that he swears that he will come to the all of next practices and that he needs this to get out of his rut. I said I just cannot trust him enough to put in the effort. He didn\u2019t take too kindly to that and called me a \u201cselfish prick\u201d and got up and walked away.\n\nI informed the band of my decision and two of them thought that what I did was probably the right thing to do while the other guy said \u201cThat was a dick move man. We\u2019ll work around it but cmon man, you didn\u2019t have to do him like that.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I did the right thing or if I was being selfish and inconsiderate.

He later texted me saying \"Gay people spend money.\" further making me believe that he's only interested in trying to make some quick money.

We're not American, and culturally, it's the appropriate/expected living arrangement. Just to clear up any potential misunderstanding that I'm some kind of lazy freeloader.\n\nSo basically, I'm on a diet. This morning, I asked my mother, who was running some errands, to pick up some additional bananas to make banana bread for everyone. She declined, so I said sure, I'll just make for myself. I proceed to put an enormous effort researching, adapting, and logging in every single pinch that went into that bread to make sure it adapts to my diet. \n\nSome friends of my mother come over, and she asks me 'Could I serve them banana bread?' I'm not too excited about this, and mention it, but ultimately say 'Sure, I can spare a couple pieces.' I try to get the pieces out and manage to take out two, since it's fresh out of the oven, they start falling apart. I tell her this, and give her the two pieces, and say 'This is the best I can do, they're falling apart'. I turn around to grab some water, and she's helping herself to another piece, wrecking the entire goddamn thing in the process.\n\nSo I tell her \"Seriously, you couldn't have asked? I worked so hard for this and now it's ruined. Can't I ever enjoy something I made without you prioritizing someone else?\"\n\nHer response was not to say sorry, but to roll her eyes, raise her eyebrows, purse her lips, and sloooowly put the broken pieces of banana bread back to make a point. This made me so angry because fuck, can you just say sorry and move the fuck on?\n\nSo I tell her \"You know, it's really hurtful and not productive to the conversation for you to make all these passive-aggressive faces. There's a conflict and you and I should talk and resolve this, instead of you mocking me for my feelings, which I think are VERY valid.\" \n\nHer answer? \"Well, I can't control how you interpret things. It's not my fault.\" And she rushed out to give the banana bread to her guests.\n\nI know I made a big deal out of this but to be honest, it's kind of the straw that broke the camel's back. She's constantly putting me last for everything after she makes sure all her guests and everyone she knows are happy, and I'm honestly sick of it. I know it's JUST a dessert, but it feels to me like she's constantly disrespecting my efforts.

My other friend and roommate, B, and I make fun of people who get involved in MLMs. For me, I think that\u2019s it\u2019s just funny but B thinks MLMs are the scum of the Earth. She especially HATES the essential oils that A sells, and will always be really over dramatic about how much the oils irritate her lungs. \n\nSo for April Fools, I bought a bunch of peppermint oil from A and sprayed them in B\u2019s room. I knew essential oils could be harmful to cats, so I took her cat out of her room. I waited, and after B came back from work she IMMEDIATELY smelled the oils from the door. It got stronger as she got closer to her room, but to my surprise, she started having a legit asthma attack. The worst part is her inhaler is in her room, so I had to run in and get it for her. \n\nNow, B can\u2019t stay in her room and her cat won\u2019t even go near it. The cat\u2019s litter-box and food were in the room as well, which makes it even worse. \n\nTo top it all off, A hates me and B now because she realized that we think her \u201cbusiness\u201d is a joke, and can\u2019t believe I only bought it for a prank. She found out through snapchat, and blocked us both. \n\nI promised B I\u2019d de-oil her room and wash her sheets, open windows, replace everything for her cat, etc. But B is SOOOO mad she said she is going to sublet her room and find someone else to live with.

My roommate and I have been friends since high school and are now in our second year of college together. We\u2019ve got a group of friends up at our school and we were all pretty cool with one another until September. \n\nSo my roommate, I\u2019ll use A to identify her from here on out, had been on again off again seeing this guy for the better part of our freshman year. He was an absolute creep that made everyone uncomfortable, yet A always brought him around even when we told her we didn\u2019t like him.  He strung her along for many, many months, despite the friend group urging her to cut him loose as he was causing her substantial amounts of anxiety. \n\nThen in October of the same year she held a party at our apartment, without asking if I was okay with it. To be honest I\u2019d be fine with her hosting one, but I found out that she\u2019d told one of my friends that I\u2019d said it was okay to host one when I didn\u2019t even know that it was a plan in motion??? That kind of pissed me off but I didn\u2019t make a fuss about it. \n\nThere\u2019s also a girl in our group, C, that is the nicest and most caring person I\u2019ve met in a while. But A only talks to her whenever she needs a ride somewhere and in that time she verbally berates C and the rest of the friend group for not inviting her to things. But for hanging out it\u2019s an open door policy, we show up at C\u2019s apartment and chill and do homework, none of that\u2019s planned so I\u2019m not sure why she gets angry at that. \n\nSlowly since then she\u2019s been isolating herself from the group, and then a few days ago she went on a twitter rant. She said that it was the friend group\u2019s fault that she was depressed and that we should\u2019ve reached out to her and seen if she was okay and that we should just assume that she was alright.

I\u2019m starting to think she wants to be miserable?\n\nAll of this has led me to believe that moving her out of the friend group would be a stress reliever for the handful of us that have been dealing with her shenanigans for the past six months, AITA for thinking this and leaving her?", "output": "OTHER", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

The flirting is definitely mutual. We both are have low-key petnames for eachother, kinda more like possessive things, where he'll call me his girl casually or vice versa.\n\nHe lives in Europe while I live in the US, and we have an 8 hour time difference. I'm a full-time student and he works, making the time difference harder but we persist. I text him during my classes and he texts me whenever he can from work. We started off just flirting super over the top when we met through a friend, but now we talk daily for hours on end. We were video-calling a few weeks back, and his roommate basically assumed I was his girlfriend, which he didn't accept or deny. While I was on vacation for two weeks, I didn't talk to anyone in our groupchat except him. We exchange good mornings for both of our time zones and if we don't fall asleep mid-conversation, we say good night. He can sense when my emotions are off and will make sure I'm alright and not upset, and will stay up helping cheer me up. He puts up with my quirks and flaws, and is genuinely an amazing guy, almost perfect for me.\n\nI've had friends ask what our thing was before and I just answer vaguely, saying i don't know, we don't really have a label. I just talk about how I'm always smiling when talking with him and that he makes me happy. I also mention that I'm in no rush to label things because I'm scared that it'll fuck things up and that I'm happy with whatever. \n\nIn our group chat, another one of our friends, me and him were talking about little things that annoy us and one of his was labels, he basically said he felt they were unnecessary. So he didn't really say that explicitly to me, but knew I was on.\n\nWhile I'm fine without a label, sometimes I do wish we had one. I'm not the type of person to bring up the \"What are we?\" discussion and I don't think he is either. And even if I do bring it up, I'm scared of ruining our happiness. We joke about kids and marriage, because neither of us are ready for that yet, but neither of us are opposed to that in the future as a possibility. We joke and imply sexual stuff a lot but haven't done anything sexual. I personally shy away a little because I'm scared of oversexualizing things and ruining the potential relationship, but I'm not against it. \n\nHowever, we always talk about visiting each other and going on dates and dinners and cuddling, so I feel like this isn't just something small. I definitely like him and my friends can tell when I'm talking with him. He likes me back, he hasn't said it in those words but implies it heavily. Our mutual friend has basically said that we'd be perfect for each other and its not one-sided.

I am the eldest of the 5 siblings, and my grandma doesn\u2019t speak English.\n\nSo basically what happened is that last night, I was on my Nintendo Switch playing an online match of Super Smash Bros in our living room. I was in the middle of a game, and I was extremely concentrated on it.  2 of my younger sisters (2 and 5), are singing into some toy microphones they have, so I\u2019m already pretty annoyed. I tell them calmly to be quiet, and go somewhere else, and they don\u2019t. So whatever. \n\nThen, my grandma asks me a question, and I\u2019m not really paying attention, so she keeps saying my name. I lose a stock in the game and say \u201cWhat?\u201d in a kind of harsh tone in her language. My mom yells my name and says why I said that to her in that way. I say that it wasn\u2019t that rude, but she still is upset at me. After the match, I asked my grandma what she said, and she asks the question and I answer it (it wasn\u2019t even that big of a deal).  \n\nI start another match, and this time, it\u2019s really close. When I really concentrate on something like a video game, I kind of make little facial and head movements in a jerky way. My mom has pointed this out and laughed at me for it before, and my siblings have as well, and it really bothers me. My mom notices me doing it again and starts laughing at me, trying to tell me to keep my face straight. But I interrupt her and tell her to be quiet and I don\u2019t care. She gets mad and spills all the a cup of water she was holding all over my shorts (it was lucky she didn\u2019t get the water on my controller). My oldest sibling had a look of shock on her face when she did that. My mom has lashed out like this before. \n\nI get extremely mad and start yelling at her, saying \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d She starts saying it back to me with an annoying look on her face. I leave the living room very mad and hotheaded. My grandma asks what\u2019s wrong and my mom keeps repeating \u201cHe was disrespecting me,\u201d which makes me even more mad. I go change my shorts and throw my wet shorts on her bed. I then take her tooth brush and rub it in the toilet in her bathroom. (I don\u2019t know why, it seems very stupid now looking back at). I then throw myself in my bed and go on my phone, feeling sorry for myself, thinking how much of a b**ch my mom is. She then comes back half an hours later- and throws the wet shorts back on me in bed. I\u2019ve calmed down a little and start laughing in my head thinking about how mad she was. I put my shorts in the laundry room and go back to bed. \n\nIt\u2019s the next morning now, and I really feel like a dick, thinking I shouldn\u2019t have done all that stuff.

GMF accepted. About a week later when I'm offline BF and GMF are hanging out online in our Discord server with two other players. Now I only have second hand accounts of what happened so I'm doing the best I can with what info I have. This is the rise of the first issue They were hanging out when BF said he was playing a game and GMF said that was gay. One of my other players who is actually LGBT (They will be called P1 for player one.) and called them out for saying using gay in a derogatory way. BF tried to keep the issue from escalating, but GMF pretty much responded with, \"Get over it.\" The issue was taken up with me and I decided to wait and watch to see if he would do it again, he never did.\n\nCut to about a month later where we're discussing doing a one shot based around a kids show and GMF and BF both made jokes about the source material that literally everyone has made but P1 decides to take it personally and starts a moral crusade against both of them. I get pissed about this and try to point out that this is literally just a joke. He gets mad and tells me about how it shaped P1's childhood in DMs. This is an issue he brought up but used it to say that GMF wasn't fitting in with the group. For the next two months we have no issues except for one where GMF is talking over other players and I message him to see if he could not do so. He agreed and kept to his word for the rest of the campaign of letting others speak before he did. He took it to that extreme, I did not ask him to take it there but he did.\n\nCut to another month later and I receive a message from P1 that another player is having issues and says that they would not be able to confront GMF if asked to. The other player does. Their reasoning that they feel uncomfortable with GMF playing with them. The second player asks me to talk to a third player, and that third player states that they are neutral but doesn't see GMF as trying to be a member of the group.\n\nSo I decide that in order to preserve the group I have to get rid of GMF because as the GM of the group I have to remain impartial and everyone here is a friend. BF is upset by this, I am pissed about this but I felt powerless in this situation since I knew I wouldn't be able to resolve the issues.\n\nTL;DR: My friends got in a fight on the internet and I'm the one that has to deal with the fallout. I had to kick out a friend because of a joke he made 3 months ago. I took my own feelings out of the equation when making the decision but I feel like an asshole so I wanted to confirm if this was the case or not.", "output": "EVERYBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

There's a girl I go to highschool with I always just assumed she was one of the special education students cause (I thought) she had a really noticable speech impediment as well as the fact that I always hangs out with some of the other special Ed students at lunch and I've only ever had her in my open classes (open is the identifier for courses that meant to be passable by anyone. The classification is mostly used for art and religion courses). So today she had a presentation in our religion class it was a break down of a song any way she chose a song that wasn't English and at the beginning of the presentation somebody asked what language it was and she said she didn't know but that it wasn't English and wasn't German. I thought it was weird that she mentioned German and then it all made sense. It's not a speech impediment it's a German accent (confirmed by actually paying attention and Listening to the presentation. Previous to this I had only ever heard her respond to questions with just a word or two, I had never actually heard her really speak a lot) I mean this doesn't prove or disprove my the possibility of being a special Ed student (not that it really matters). I guess the real question is am I an asshole for mistaking an accent for a speech impediment? \n\nPs.

My cousin is having her male friend from out of town sleepover at her place for a few days. She is also in a 1.5 year committed relationship with her boyfriend who lives apart from her. (Who recently became a friend of mine) Last night when her SO was not over she decided to bring said friend into her bed to watch movies. He fell asleep and then she fell asleep soon after. My sister tells me this saying they were cuddling also. I give her my opinion on the matter. Saying \"I would not be happy at all with my SO if he brought a gal friend into a bed to cuddle and fell asleep. In *my relationship* I'd consider it microcheating as its a form of intimacy. Intimacy I wouldn't be comfortable with my SO sharing with anyone but me. I be mad if I was her SO but my boundaries may differ and in the end it's up to him.\" As that's the case for me I wanted to know if I was overreacting and went without outting her to people asking \"if you found out your SO purposefully or accidentally was found cuddling in bed with a friend of the opposite gender or preferred gender how would you feel.\" I wanted outside perspectives to have a more informed opinion or see if it was a bigger deal than I thought. Most shared the same opinion as me. They didn't like the idea but up to SO.  I go to bed after a long day and wake up to her chewing my head off saying how dare I accuse her of cheating. That it was an accident and it's my sister's fault for not waking her up or it be a different story than it was. That as her cousin she's mad I would shit talk her. I told her I didn't shit talk just stated an opinion. That I asked others without saying her name or letting anyone know who it was about so if the overwhelming majority said it was wrong I could privately pull her aside and see her side of the story but never got the chance...

People have been telling me that my gf flirts with other guys and my best friend told me she sees him eyeing his crotch and acts flirtatious around him. I decided to test this out for myself and I made a fake Facebook account, got a lot of friends and i told some people at my school to add him as a friend so it seems like somebody she would know, the mutual friends. He (brian) adds girlfriend as a contact and she accepts asking how she knows him. Brian explains he added the wrong person but should become friends because he's transferring to the university and lives in the area, share similar friends. They talk for a few weeks and my gf never told me about this. They talk about their interests and other stuff and to make sure that she's 100% the cheater i made sure that brian never started a sexual or romantic conversation or even about meeting up. That was all gf. Gf eventually asks him on a date and he asks if she has a bf and she says \"its complicated but not really\" and that was when i had it. I video called her and she was shocked to see who was on the other end of the line. She says i violated her trust and i was an asshole. She ranted about it on twitter and Facebook which clearly backfired. She claimed i led her on and that i am a scumbag. She pretty much proved she was a cheater yet all of the girls in our friend group and her mom harassed me online until i blocked them. I broke up with her, on Facebook via post when she ranted about it causing a massive flame war within our friend group. She went to the university counselor and now they want to speak to me about it and they're upset with me", "output": "EVERYBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

When I was in elementary school I had to always get 100s on tests or my dad would be insatisfied and I would have to study until midnight memorizing everything for the exams.\n\n Not being able to sleep properly made me always be in a bad mood and angry so I wasn't able to make a lot of friendships through elementary school. I understand that its important to have good grades for your future and stuff but it still was a pain that I couldn't get a single \"good job\" if I got a 96 or 98. And it would get me angry some years later in middle school when my sister got a bad grade on an exam yet he didn't seem to care about it. I would get forced to play soccer or karate even if I wasn't good at it just because my dad wanted me to play and I would never actually play in anything official since I just naturally suck at most sports, yet I would still be looked down upom just because I'm not athletic enough.\n\n As for my brothers, they didn't want me to hang out with them so I was always stuck on my parents room playing by myself. They mostly stayed on the living room and whenever I managed to be in there for a while my brother would talk about why do I even want to be there because I'm not talking at all or stuff like that. My sister mostly ignored me, but my brother was more like the asshole older brother you see on TV, so I was stuck being made fun of by him or treated roughly, and since we slept on the same room he would sometimes just throw my out of it for hours. Seems reasonale that being a little kid you could be annoying to older kids, but not having almost anywhere in your own house where you could feel comfortable and playing monopoly and LEGOs by myself for 7 years wasn't really fun at all. \n\nAfter starting middle school and nowadays on my last year in high school my parents act like they were always nice and want me to talk with them more, yet I don't really have anything that I would like to talk with them about. My brother just sends me messages like if we were best friends or something and it annoys me a lot so I just never reply. I mostly am \"accustomed\" to being by myself both in school and at home, since I never experienced that much what it was like having fun or talking with others.\n\nI sometimes feel I could be playing victim as those things happened in the past and I should move forward, but even if I try I don't think I can ever get to like my family.", "output": "OTHER", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

The not-GF also wanted to go out of the city for a drive. I did not want that and neither did the other person in the car but my mate still went and took us to the middle of butt-fuck nowhere for 15 minutes before driving back to drop us off.

She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy.
