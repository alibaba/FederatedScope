Chiefs' running back Priest Holmes would meet with a neurosurgeon about his October 30 neck injury, suffered against the Chargers' Shawne Merriman.  Holmes must practice by November 7 to be eligible to remain in the season.  Trent Green suited up for the game against the Rams, but was listed as the third quarterback behind starter Damon Huard and rookie Brodie Croyle.  Herm Edwards said there was no chance Green would play against the Rams, but could be back by week 10. Damon Huard threw a 43-yard pass to Samie Parker which put the Chiefs in the red zone at the 3-yard line.  Huard continued the drive with a 3-yard pass to Tony Gonzalez, his 58th career touchdown and the Chiefs' all-time record breaker for Tight ends.

In the second quarter, a 44-yard field goal by placekicker Justin Tucker got the Ravens on the scoreboard. McManus later countered with a 43-yard field goal just before halftime to put the lead back to 6. Three plays into the Broncos' initial possession of the second half, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Ravens' cornerback Jimmy Smith for a 24-yard touchdown, in what was the Ravens' only touchdown of the game. After forcing a Broncos' punt, the Ravens increased their lead, with a 44-yard field goal by Tucker. The Broncos were forced to punt on their next two third-quarter offensive possessions. With 10 seconds remaining in the third quarter, the Broncos re-claimed the lead, with cornerback Aqib Talib returning an interception off Ravens' quarterback Joe Flacco 51 yards for a touchdown, in what was the Broncos' only touchdown of the game.

Newly emancipated peasants earned too little and were not allowed to sell or mortgage their allotted land. Ethnic minorities resented the government because of its \"Russification\", discrimination and repression, such as banning them from voting and serving in the Imperial Guard or Navy and limited attendance in schools. A nascent industrial working class resented the government for doing too little to protect them, banning strikes and labor unions. Finally, radical ideas fomented and spread after a relaxing of discipline in universities allowed a new consciousness to grow among students. Taken individually, these issues might not have affected the course of Russian history, but together they created the conditions for a potential revolution. \"At the turn of the century, discontent with the Tsar's dictatorship was manifested not only through the growth of political parties dedicated to the overthrow of the monarchy but also through industrial strikes for better wages and working conditions, protests and riots among peasants, university demonstrations, and the assassination of government officials, often done by Socialist Revolutionaries.\" Because the Russian economy was tied to European finances, the contraction of Western money markets in 1899-1900 plunged Russian industry into a deep and prolonged crisis which outlasted the dip in European industrial production. This setback aggravated social unrest during the five years preceding the revolution of 1905. The government finally recognized these problems, albeit in a shortsighted and narrow-minded way. The minister of interior Plehve stated in 1903 that, after the agrarian problem, the most serious issues plaguing the country were those of the Jews, the schools, and the workers, in that order. \nQuestion: How many things caused  Tsar's dictatorship to manifest? \nAnswer type: Number ", "output": "5.", "category": "Question Answering 27.json"}, {"instruction": "This task involves creating answers to complex questions, from a given passage.

In early 1910, Qing China sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet for direct rule. However, the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution, which began in October 1911. Although the Chinese forces departed once more in 1913, the First World War and the Russian Revolution isolated the now independent Tibet, reducing Western influence and interest.  Ineffectual regents ruled during the 14th Dalai Lama's infancy and China began to reassert its control, a process that culminated in 1950-1951 with the Chinese invasion of Tibet by a newly-formed Communist China. The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangz\u00ea was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of \"Head of British Mission Lhasa\", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. The British seem to have misread the military and diplomatic situation, for the Russians did not have the designs on India that the British imagined, and the campaign was politically redundant before it began. Russian arms in Tibet amounted to no more than thirty Russian government rifles, and the whole narrative of Russian influence, and the Czar's ambitions, was dropped. The defeats the Russians experienced in the Russo-Japanese war that began in February 1904 further altered perceptions of the balance of power in Asia, and the Russian threat. However, it has been argued that the campaign had \"a profound effect upon Tibet, changing it forever, and for the worse at that, doing much to contribute to Tibet's loss of innocence.\". \nQuestion: How many years after the British left their physical occupation of Chumbi Valley did the British have a permanent posting in Lhasa? \nAnswer type: Number ", "output": "29.", "category": "Question Answering 27.json"}, {"instruction": "This task involves creating answers to complex questions, from a given passage.

These raids began after Crimea became independent about 1441 and lasted until the peninsula came under Russian control in 1774. Their main purpose was the capture of slaves, most of whom were exported to the Ottoman slave markets in Constantinople or elsewhere in the Middle East. The raids were an important drain of the human and economic resources of eastern Europe. They largely inhabited the settlement of the \"Wild Fields\" - the steppe and forest-steppe land which extends from a hundred or so miles south of Moscow to the Black Sea and which now contains most of the Russian and Ukrainian population. The raids also played an important role in the development of the Cossacks. Estimates of the number of people involved vary: according to Alan W. Fisher  the number of people deported from the Slavic lands on both sides of the border during the 14th to 17th centuries was about 3 million. Michael Khodarkhovsky estimates that 150,000 to 200,000 people were abducted from Russia in the first 50 years of the 17th century.

After the two teams traded punts on their next possessions, the Chargers tied the game with a time-consuming drive, culminating with 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Philip Rivers to wide receiver Keenan Allen.

In overtime, the Dolphins nearly lost again as Stover missed a potential game winning 44 yard field goal. However, the demons were lifted as QB Cleo Lemon completed the game-winning 64-yard TD pass to WR Greg Camarillo. Soon after players and coaches rejoiced in the locker room after a long-awaited first win. With the win, not only did Miami improve to 1-13, but it also snapped a 16-game losing streak dating back to last season's December 10 win over the New England Patriots, notching their first win of the 2007 season and avoiding their becoming the first team in NFL history to go 0-16. This was their only win in a 1-15 and would keep them from being possibly labeled as the worst team in NFL history. They also avoided having to play with a 0-14 record against a New England Patriots team carrying the complementary 14-0 record, and widely rooted for to become the first team in over 30 years to match the perfect season feat originally posted by the Dolphins. Cleo Lemon got his first career 300-yard game, as he completed 23 out of 39 passes for 315 yards and 1 touchdown. \nQuestion: How many field goals did each team kick? \nAnswer type: Number ", "output": "3.", "category": "Question Answering 27.json"}, {"instruction": "This task involves creating answers to complex questions, from a given passage.

The Packers received the opening kickoff and stormed 81 yards needing only 7 plays with James Starks running in a 3-yard touchdown. The drive was so efficient they didn't even face a third down. As a sign of things to come, the Falcons struck right back with a 4-yard Steven Jackson touchdown run to end a 72-yard drive. The Packers, as they did often, answered the Falcons with another touchdown of their own. Showing off their ability to kill the clock with long drives, the Packers used 13 plays and over 7 minutes to go 80 yards with Lacy running in his second touchdown of the game on the first play of the second quarter. After a Falcons three-and-out the Packers again worked the clock, driving 80 yards in just under six minutes, but the Falcons defense made a rare stand and Crosby kicked a field goal. Morgan Burnett intercepted Matt Ryan on their next possession and returned it 32 yards to the Falcons 15. Four plays later Rodgers threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Lacy. The Falcons offense continued to sputter as they punted. The Packers stayed hot with Rodgers hitting Nelson for a 10-yard touchdown with twenty-four seconds left in the half. The Falcons managed to reach field goal range with the big play being a Ryan 30-yard bomb to Julio Jones. However, Brad Jones blocked Matt Bryant's 53-yard field goal attempt, leaving the score 31-7 at halftime. The Falcons busted out in the third quarter. On the first play from scrimmage Ryan launched a pass to Jones for 79 yards the Packers 3-yard line. However, they lost two yards on their next three plays, but on fourth-and-goal from the 5-yard line Ryan threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Eric Weems, trimming the score to 31-14. After a Packers punt the Falcons reached the Packers 31, but were forced to settle for a 50-yard field goal. The Packers added a field goal on their next drive, the Falcons mimicked the Packers clock-killing strategy (possibly, ultimately to their detriment) taking six-and-a-half minutes off the clock as they traveled 72 yards with Ryan dropping a 22-yard touchdown pass into the hands of Jones who had the best game of his career. However, Rodgers and the Packers offense regrouped and stormed 74 yards in four plays with Rodgers hitting his number one guy Nelson for a 60-yard touchdown pass. The Falcons' Rashede Hageman blocked Crosby's PAT keeping the deficit two scores at 40-24. The shootout continued as the Falcons answered right back with Ryan lobbing a 1-yard touchdown pass to Roddy White, but the two-point conversion failed which would prove critical as the score remained 40-30. The Falcons onside kick attempt failed, but they didn't allow a first down, keeping them in the game as Crosby nailed a 53-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 43-30. Ryan continued to shred the Packers' defense, darting a 2-yard touchdown pass to Harry Douglas, making the score 43-37 and giving the Falcons a chance to pull off the improbable comeback. However, a 41-yard run by James Starks enabled the Packers to run out the clock and hold on for the win. \nQuestion: How many total points were scored in the game by both teams? \nAnswer type: Number ", "output": "80.", "category": "Question Answering 27.json"}, {"instruction": "This task involves creating answers to complex questions, from a given passage.

Collins and Sir James Craig signed an agreement to end it on 30 March 1922, but, despite this, Collins covertly supplied arms to the Northern IRA until a week before his death in August 1922. Because of the Irish Civil War, Northern Ireland was able to consolidate its existence and the partition of Ireland was confirmed for the foreseeable future. The continuing war also confirmed the northern Unionists' existing prejudices against the ethos of all shades of nationalism. This might have led to open hostilities between North and South had the Irish Civil War not broken out. Indeed, the Ulster Special Constabulary  that had been established in 1920  was expanded in 1922 rather than being demobilised. In the event, it was only well after their defeat in the Civil War that anti-treaty Irish Republicans seriously considered whether to take armed action against British rule in Northern Ireland . The northern units of the IRA largely supported the Free State side in the Civil War because of Collins's policies, and over 500 of them joined the new Free State's National Army. The cost of the war and the budget deficit it caused was a difficulty for the new Free State and affected the Boundary Commission negotiations of 1925, which were to determine the border with Northern Ireland. The Free State agreed to waive its claim to predominantly Nationalist areas in Northern Ireland and in return its agreed share of the Imperial debt under the 1921 Treaty was not paid. \nQuestion: How many months did Collins covertly supply arms to the IRA after he signed an agreement to end the conflict? \nAnswer type: Number ", "output": "5.", "category": "Question Answering 27.json"}, {"instruction": "This task involves creating answers to complex questions, from a given passage.

Although his mother Blanche of Castile had coped with baronial uprisings before and carried on the royal affairs since 1226, with the title \"baillistre\" , Louis IX decided to go to the assistance of his brother and forcibly take control of the County of La Marche. In April 1242, Louis assembled a force at Chinon that some contemporaries estimated at around 50,000. On 9 May, he marched against the castle of Montreuil-Bonnin, the fortress of Lusignan. After having seizing a multitude of rebel castles, he steered towards Saintes. On 20 May 1242, Henry and Richard departed Portsmouth for Royan and joined the rebelling French nobles, forming an army that may have numbered about 30,000. The two kings exchanged letters, but these resolved nothing. Henry had intentions to regain the past Angevin Empire of his predecessors on the basis that the title of Count of Poitou stills belonged to his brother, Richard. This was not the first war that Henry had waged in France either as he had earlier lead an expedition to France in 1230, however, Henry was convinced that Hugh would provide the necessary support to reverse the lackluster results of the last war. While completing his conquest of lower Poitou, he declared war on Saint Louis on 16 July.

Following a punt by Chicago on the opening possession, with great field position, the Patriots stormed 55 yards in just 5 plays, with Tom Brady connecting with Rob Gronkowski for a 6-yard touchdown, the first of three touchdown receptions on the day for Gronkowski. After a Bears punt, the Patriots took over 7 minutes off the clock in driving to the Bears 5-yard line, but could only settle for a 23-yard Gostkowski field goal, and a 10-0 lead. The Bears fortunes didn't get any better and they punted again on their next drive. The Patriots struck again with a five-and-a-half minute, 76-yard drive culminating with a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wright, pushing the lead to 17-0. On the Bears next drive, McCourty intercepted Jay Cutler at the Bears 22, but the play was nullified by an illegal contact penalty on Brandon Browner. With new life, the Bears marched another 54 yards and Cutler found Matt Forte on a 25-yard touchdown pass, making the score 17-7. Then Patriots took control of the game from there. In a 57-second span, the Patriots scored 3 touchdowns. First, the Patriots marched 80 yards in 10 plays, with Brady throwing a 2-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski. Following a Bears three-and-out, Edelman's 49 yard return plus a 10-yard holding penalty on the Bears' Trevor Scott set the Patriots up at the Bears 9. On the first play, Brady hit LaFell for a 9-yard touchdown. On the first play of the ensuing Chicago possession, Cutler was strip-sacked by rookie defensive end Zach Moore with Rob Ninkovich recovering and returning it 15 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 38-7 lead blowout lead. Revis intercepted Cutler on the last play of the first half, and the Patriots lead stood 38-7. On the first drive of the 2nd half, Brady hit Gronkowski for 46-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown. This was Tom Brady's fifth touchdown pass of the day (his third career five touchdown game), and the third for Gronkowski (his second career three touchdown game), extending the lead to a 45-7 massacre. Later in the third quarter, the Bears marched 80 yards with Cutler hitting Martellus Bennett on a 20-yard touchdown pass, with a successful 2 pt. conversion, making the score 45-15. The Patriots countered by marching 71 yards in just under six minutes, extending the lead to 48-15 on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal. With the game well out of reach, backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo took over for Tom Brady. The Bears would score again when Culter marched the bears 80 yards and hit Alshon Jeffery for a 10-yard touchdown pass, with another successful 2 point conversion, making the score, still insurmountable, 48-23. With a short field after an unsuccessful onside kick attempt, the Patriots moved 21 yards before Gostowski made the score 51-23. The Bears Jimmy Clausen drove them to the Patriots 26, but turned the ball over on downs. Garoppolo took a knee to end the game. The Patriots' 51 points were their largest single-game total of the season. Tom Brady made history in the game. This was his 17th career game with four touchdown and zero interceptions which tied him with Drew Brees for the most all time. In addition, this was his 43rd career game with 3 touchdowns and zero interceptions which placed him second by Peyton Manning. On top of that, he threw for 354 yards. The Patriots totaled 122 yards rushing as well. Gronkowski and LaFell combined for 20 catches for 273 yards and four touchdowns, with both catching every ball thrown to them. Jay Cutler actually played well, completing 20 of 30 passes for 220 yards and three touchdowns, but threw an interception and lost a fumble.

Seattle scored on their first play from scrimmage on a 90-yard reception by Koren Robinson, but did not threaten the rest of the game.  Robinson beat Lito Sheppard and Brian Dawkins missed the tackle as the Seahawks jumped out to a 7-0 lead.  Donovan McNabb had another ugly start, firing incompletions on his first seven pass attempts.  However, in the second quarter, the Eagles began to move the ball and McNabb found Reggie Brown for a 22-yard touchdown.  On the next drive, with first and goal, the Eagles ran a play-action fake and McNabb threw it to offensive guard Todd Herremans (who was lined up as a tight end) for a 1-yard touchdown and a 14-7 lead.  Philadelphia's next four drives led to David Akers field goals as they sailed to a 26-7 win.  The Eagles' defense forced Seattle to punt on their final ten possessions and Darren Howard had two sacks.  McNabb finished with 349 yards passing, two touchdowns, and an interception.  Backup tight end Brent Celek had the game of his life - finishing with six catches and 131 receiving yards. \nQuestion: How many catches did Koren Robinson have? \nAnswer type: Number ", "output": "1.", "category": "Question Answering 27.json"}, {"instruction": "This task involves creating answers to complex questions, from a given passage.
