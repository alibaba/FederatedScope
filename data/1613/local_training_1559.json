This just goes to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that TRUMP is 100% innocent.  When you have to \"probe\" (read- harassment) into a sale of a property that Trump sold to some Russian guy, after IT SAT ON THE MARKET AND NO ONE BOUGHT IT,  and the price was almost cut in half for a couple of years, that says it all.  It was a dog of a mansion, you can see the pics on the internet.  Trump bought it for $40M, sold it for $100, after reducing it from $200M or thereabouts.  They never reported that fact in here.  Gee, I WONDER WHY?  PROBABLY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT THE NARRATIVE!  I saw the home when it was first listed.  Trump should fire this guy now and half the country will be done with these rubes.  They have nothing or they would be leaking it all over the place.  THIS IS A SHAM ARTICLE AS USUAL! They have nothing, and now they are just going far past the line in order to \"get Trump!\" It is time to fire this guy, and this article is a disgrace to reporting!", "output": "Non-threat", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 950.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

Every single person I took a crime report from with them as the victim didn't wake up that day thinking they'd be a victim.  If you \"fear\" an inanimate object that much, see a shrink.  I do know of a woman whose boyfriend used to beat her severely enough to hospitalize her.  Even after a \"restraining order\" (Now THERE's some protection for ya), he'd kick in her door and beat her.  She finally purchased a weapon, learned how to use it, and was able to, at last, defend herself (see, we never COULD get there until AFTER she had the crap beat out of her, as she could never call the PD DURING the beating.)  Guess she just reached the point where her \"fear\" of guns, was surpassed by her fear of dying...or maybe it was just the \"fear\" of having to pay thousands more in hospital bills.  That's just one example.  But you do, or don't do, what you \"gotta\".  I'll do what I \"gotta.\"", "output": "Non-threat", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 950.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.
