The answer to your question is yes  you would have to. If you truly wanted to equalize and integrate schools  you would have to. But you can go a step shorter than that. New York City public schools are majority black and Latino. But you can go to any of the suburbs around  and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very heavily white. So in New York and all across the North  you could simply move into an all-white community and go to all-white public schools. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how you avoided desegregation. In the South  most school districts were countywide. So you either paid for private school or you dealt with desegregation. In the North  you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do that. The key difference between the North and the South is for the vast majority of the history of this country  90 percent of all black people lived in the South. The South responds with Jim Crow  by passing laws that restrict the movement of black people. The North doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do that. It has a very tiny black population. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only once black people start migrating out of the South in the 1900s that the North shows its true ugly racist head.  Goldberg : You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve described something that I actually experienced as a kid in the 70s. I was in a school system growing up that was about 60 percent black  35 white\u00e2\u0080\u0094the local system right outside New York City. Very unusual.
