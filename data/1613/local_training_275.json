When I realized in the morning that it hadn\u2019t synced, I tried looking for a signal manually (a few times, too!), but no luck with that either. These methods had previously worked for another Marathon model (slim jumbo wall clock), when it took around 30 minutes to sync (again, after some manual intervention). I\u2019m in the Bay Area, if it helps. Anyway, after all attempts at automatic and manual syncing failed, I was forced to program the clock manually \u2014 the process was a bit tedious, if you ask me. Bought it in the white & gold, and it looks and works fine otherwise \u2014 as a regular digital desk clock, I mean, just not as an atomic one. And since it was rather cheap, I won\u2019t complain *too* much. I\u2019m actually glad that it\u2019s not constantly backlit (with a bright light), because why would I want my bedroom bathed in neon orange light all night when I\u2019m trying to sleep?! The screen lights up for a few seconds at the touch of a button (on top), so when I do want to tell the time at night, it\u2019s not that complicated a process at all. The numbers are large enough and easy for me to read. The clarity of the numbers does depend on the viewing angle, as some reviewers have mentioned. The size of the clock is appropriate for a desk/alarm clock, IMO. Haven\u2019t used it as an alarm clock, so have no insight to offer in that regard. So, all said and done, my biggest, and *only* grievance is that its absolute *main*, *featured* functionality, is totally non-functional and useless.

That's when I realized how overpriced this item was. Thank goodness I am pretty good at fixing things and devising solutions to problems. Basically, fixing other people's/companies' poor/cheap designs. After figuring out the right way to assemble this pump, I used it on the first new filter. All I got was a lot of air mixed with some water. I thought at first that this was just the air contained in the new filter element that was being \"expelled\" and replaced by water. After a time, I realized this was not right and looked for the problem. About this time, the plastic tube between the plastic filter adapter and the one-way inlet valve came off of the valve and would not reseal. To fix this, I resorted to a small spring clamp, that you operate with pliers, to fit around and seal the tube to the valve. On the next try, I was still sucking air, so I looked for another problem. This time, after completely submerging the filter in water past the plastic adapter, I discovered that it was the adapter leaking air around the threads. No matter how tight I got the fitting, It still sucked air. I solved this by wrapping some teflon tape around the threads on the filter and the problem was solved. My take away....this is a high priced, poorly designed device and Berkey should redesign and upgrade it. How??? Pre-assemble these using longer tubes and spring clamps on the one-way valves.

Each light takes 3 AAA batteries and the only way to keep their brightness is to get a HUGE dock of rechargeable AAAs and to rotate them few every few days. I\u2019ve only had mine for 10 days and 3 out of 5 are completely out of battery already! I noticed a few days in that the brightness wasn\u2019t like it was when I first put them up but I didn\u2019t pay much attention. I was SO excited for under-cabinet lighting and all of the options that these have. What a waste of money...the amount of batteries that I would go through, totally not worth it. I would rather pick some up from the dollar store that I have to manually click on and off because those at least last.

Neither of us is a train hobbyist; we purchased this to put on a table top around a small Christmas tree. Parts were broken, misaligned, and did not easily 'push' together. The notes below detail these issues. 1. One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together.", "output": "We were very disappointed with this product and plan to return it", "category": "Summarization 1245.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given reviews from Amazon's products.

Cutting on the highest length, the 4ah battery only lasted about 15 minutes. I bought a 4ah and 2ah battery with a trimmer based on the quoted run times where an hour is all I'd need. As it is, I eat through the batteries faster than they can get any meaningful charge (5 minutes isn't enough for anything) and have to stop mowing to simply allow the batteries to charge. I'd need at least three batteries and two chargers and swap every 10 minutes to work continuously. My suggestion is to stick with gas if you have the type of grass that people compliment. Very disappointed considering the cost. Edit: At the close of the 2019 cutting season, we're still using the mower because I'm too cheap to buy another mower. It's held up well and we can accomplish mowing with two 4ah and a single 2ah battery (normally without charging required). Due to the thickness, it takes almost twice as long as a gas mower simply because it isn't as powerful and will bog down and not cut (note that I came from the gas size they say is equivalent - not at all true). It does a lot better if bagging - just stinks at mulching. Still wish I never made the mower purchase, but the other tools in the line are good. At least it is quiet and doesn't smell while also requiring only blade maintenance.
