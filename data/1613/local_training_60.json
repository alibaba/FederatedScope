Two leading journalists who covered the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s died yesterday. Roy Reed was white. Simeon Booker Jr. was black.

He was 87 when he died.  Simeon Booker  was 99. Both men were there during the pivotal march from Selma to Montgomery  Ala.  when police attacked protesters on Pettus Bridge.  Booker  was working for Ebony and Jet magazines. In 2013   he  told NPR  he  was just as shocked as any other Northerner by what was going on in the South.\nULABY:  Booker  was the first full-time black reporter at The Washington Post. Wil Haygood got there years later. He told NPR in 2007  Booker 's experiences were not easy.\nWIL HAYGOOD:  He  would go out and  he  would introduce  himself  to people as  Simeon Booker  of The Washington Post. And  he  said people would throw their heads back and just start laughing out loud in  his  face because they thought  he  was joking because they had never met a black reporter from The Washington Post. I mean  that's just heartbreaking.\nULABY:  Booker 's colleagues would not sit next to  him  in the cafeteria. After only two years   he  left. While working at Ebony and Jet   Booker  heard about the murder of a 14-year-old accused of whistling at a white woman.  He  took a photographer to Emmett Till's funeral. The pictures of Till's open casket and mangled face became a civil rights catalyst.  Booker  found stories no one else could.\nULABY: Wil Haygood says  Simeon Booker  became friendly with an FBI agent who'd tip him off to danger.\n BOOKER : My whole life was one of fright in newspapering when I was in the South.\nULABY: Later  some criticized  Booker  since the FBI was also working at the time to undermine the civil rights movement.  His  wife of 40 years  Carol McCabe Booker  co-wrote  his  memoir. Almost to the end  she says   Simeon Booker  loved speaking about  his  experiences.

Domino  enjoyed a parade of successes through the early 1960s  including \"Be My Guest\" and \"I'm Ready.\" Another hit  \"I'm Walkin '\" became the debut single for Ricky Nelson.\n Domino  appeared in the rock 'n' roll film \"The Girl Can't Help It\" and was among the first black performers to be featured in popular music shows  starring with Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers.

He  has never managed at all.\nMaddon had his eye on  Martinez  for two decades before their partnership began. He first chased him down in 1983 when  Martinez  was playing in instructional league.  Martinez  was 19  and his play spoke louder than he did.\nHe was fresh off an uncomfortable stint in Puerto Rican winter ball. Though born to Puerto Rican parents in Brooklyn   Martinez  didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grow up speaking Spanish  other than occasionally with  his  grandmother. When  he  was 12   his  father sent  him  to live with an uncle in Florida so  he  could play baseball year round  but  he  never quite picked up the language. This was a surprise to Cubs staff when  he  arrived at winter league. The veterans never let  him  live it down.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI like the way you play \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Martinez  said  he  remembers Maddon saying. He all but shrugged it off  not thinking much of the compliment.\nAlmost 25 years later  a half-decade after  Martinez \u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing career had ended  Maddon asked him to be a guest instructor at Rays spring training in 2006. Andrew Friedman  the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GM at the time  noticed  Martinez \u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact immediately.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

We're doing this by encouraging meaningful connections between people rather than passive consumption of content.\"\n Zuckerberg  noted that the company's recent news feed changes  such as reducing the volume of viral videos  have caused time spent on Facebook to decline by about 50 million hours every day - an average of about 2 minutes per person every day.\nOn a conference call with investors   Zuckerberg  emphasized that time spent alone offers limited insight into the value of the social network and that  he  expects short-term drops in time on the site to make the product stronger in the long-term.\n\"By focusing on meaningful interactions  I believe that the time spent on Facebook will be more valuable \"  Zuckerberg  said. \"If people interact more  it should lead to stronger community. When you care about something  you\u2019re willing to see ads to experience it.\"\nFacebook\u2019s results come just a few weeks after  Zuckerberg  announced that  the company  plans to make a year-long shift across  its  products to prioritize interactions between friends and family and reduce the prominence of unpaid posts by brands and publishers. In the near-term  the change will cause news to make up only 4% of news feed  down from about 5% currently. Facebook plans to display news sources in accordance with how users rank their \u201ctrustworthiness.\u201d  Zuckerberg  also said  the company  plans to elevate local news in a push to help \u201cbuild community.\u201d Facebook correctly warned that the changes could lead to a decrease in time spent on the social network in the short-term. However   Zuckerberg  has said  he  sees the shift as critical to Facebook\u2019s long-term success as a business and product.\nWhen Facebook reported its third quarterly earnings in November   Zuckerberg  said  he  was \u201cdead serious\u201d about addressing the social network\u2019s security and safety issues  ranging from election meddling to moderation issues  such as violent live videos and misinformation.  Zuckerberg  warned that the bolstered efforts \u201cwill impact\u201d the company\u2019s profitability.  The company  said last year  it  plans to double  its  headcount working on safety and security from 10 000 people to 20 000 people over the course of 2018  and add thousands more content moderators. (Facebook said it has 25 105 employees as of December 31  up 47% from a year earlier.)\nZuckerberg continues to emphasize video advertising as key to the future of the company\u2019s business. Facebook recently added a \u201cWatch\u201d section for video shows and series  which competes with Google-owned YouTube and is intended in the long-term to foster interaction between friends  family and groups. Higher-quality content in the tab could drive stronger video ad sales over time.  Zuckerberg  also noted in Wednesday's conference call that  he  expects \"Stories\" -- chains of disappearing photos and videos -- to overtake posts and feeds as the most common content format across apps  and that the growth of the feature will shape how Facebook evolves its apps and business.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

On Wednesday morning  NBC confirmed that they had fired morning news anchor  Matt Lauer .  Lauer  has served as the centerpiece of Today  which The New York Times calls \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most important part of the NBC News franchise \u00e2\u0080\u009d since 1997. A memo from NBC News chairman Andy Lack cited \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriate sexual behavior\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the grounds for termination.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn Monday night \u00e2\u0080\u009d Lack wrote  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by  Matt Lauer . It represented  after serious review  a clear violation of our company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhile NBC took swift action against  Lauer  even before the allegations went public  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to assume that this story is far from over. As Lack himself acknowledged  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been at NBC News  we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIn the wake of  Lauer \u00e2\u0080\u0099s unexpected departure  Today was forced to reckon with the story in real time. Lauer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s co-host Savannah Guthrie was tasked with reporting on the latest in a string of sexual misconduct stories  this time involving her \u00e2\u0080\u009cdear  dear friend\u00e2\u0080\u009d and colleague. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d an emotional Guthrie asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll we can say is we are heartbroken; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m heartbroken.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nLike the other recently disgraced media men before him  Lauer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career is now open for reexamination. One incident that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already been circulated and picked apart by social media is the Presidential Forum that  Lauer  moderated in September 2016. At the time   Lauer  was widely criticized for the way  he  interacted with candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton  with many accusing the Today host of employing a sexist double standard. In one article  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow Sexism  Like Matt Lauer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Could Imperil the Nation \u00e2\u0080\u009d Adele M. Stan wrote  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen questioning Clinton   Lauer  was all alpha-male  interrupting  her  and tsk-tsking  her  for criticizing  her  opponent after he had asked  her  not to do so. But when paired with Trump  it became clear who was the alpha in that set-up. It clearly wasn't  Lauer   who allowed Trump to talk over him  and to evade specifics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhile  Lauer \u00e2\u0080\u0099s tendency to interrupt Clinton repeatedly\u00e2\u0080\u0094while letting Trump go largely unchallenged\u00e2\u0080\u0094was certainly cringe-worthy  it may not be Lauer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most painful on-air interaction. Anyone searching for an example of overt sexism need look no further than his 2012 Today interview with Anne Hathaway. The actress  who was promoting her film Les Miserables at the time  had had the misfortune of being photographed during a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwardrobe malfunction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was getting out of the car and my dress was so tight that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize it until I saw all the photographers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 flashes \u00e2\u0080\u009d she reportedly said in response to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevastating\u00e2\u0080\u009d incident. As if the revealing photographs weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough  Hathaway was then grilled on the minor controversy by  Lauer   who opened the interview with a gross allusion to the intimate pics.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnne Hathaway  good morning  nice to see you. Seen a lot of you lately \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Lauer  greeted  his  guest. While Hathaway  who responded that  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be happy to stay home \u00e2\u0080\u009d clearly had no interest in discussing the upskirt shots   Lauer  continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just get it out of the way. You had a little wardrobe malfunction the other night. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lesson learned from something like that  other than that you keep smiling  which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll always do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To summarize:  Lauer   mistaking pervy paparazzi pics for actual news  asked an accomplished actress about a painful incident  phrasing the invasion of privacy as a personal failing (\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lesson learned from something like that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d). To make matters even worse  he all but told Hathaway to smile through it\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is just what every woman wants to hear from a man who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking down to her about her lack of underwear on national television.\nHathaway  to her credit  managed to own  Lauer   replying  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell  it was obviously an unfortunate incident. It kind of made me sad on two accounts. One was that I was very sad that we live in an age when someone takes a picture of another person in a vulnerable moment  and rather than delete it and do the decent thing  sells it. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry that we live in a culture that commodifies sexuality of unwilling participants  which brings us back to Les Mis  because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the character [Fantine] is.

Hey  Elise.\n ELISE HU   BYLINE: Hey there.\n HU : This certainly is the first time that North Korea has signaled a willingness to talk with the United States in years  but talks themselves are unlikely anytime soon because this is so vague right now. The South Korean presidential Blue House put out a statement yesterday that North Korea expressed a desire for talks that was again confirmed today. And North Korea agreed that as these North-South ties improve that there should be an improvement in North Korea-U.S. ties as well. And this is really helpful to the South Korean president  Moon  who really hasn't wanted to look like he's not getting anything from the North in return for all of the peace and goodwill gestures he's offered during the Olympics. So one of the demands by South Korea seems to be that the North be more willing to reopen dialogue with the U.S.\nMARTIN: All right.

There is no question about that \"  Murkowski  wrote. \"It is important to emphasize that eliminating this tax penalty does not take care away from anyone. Instead  it provides important relief to those who have been penalized for choosing not to buy unaffordable insurance.\"\n\"Repealing the individual mandate simply restores to people the freedom to choose \"  she  continued. \"Nothing else about the structure of the ACA would be changed.

They planned to swoop low over a rendezvous point marked with three small bonfires and use a tail hook to pick up a Chinese agent off the ground without landing. Downey was to reel in the agent with a winch aboard the plane.\n Also  Downey was well known to the Chinese operatives because he trained them.

But on important issues -- from opposing new settlement building in the Occupied Territories , to supporting the nuclear framework with Iran -- Clinton has not taken the hawkish side , as so many of her liberal critics fear she would do if she becomes president . \nNone of this is to suggest that Clinton will be Robin to Obama 's Batman . \nThen there are the issues of wage stagnation and income inequality , two longstanding trends that will likely be at the heart of Clinton 's pitch to voters . \nA recent report drafted by Clinton allies , including Neera Tanden and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , laid out what David Leonhardt at The New York Times described as the \"first draft\" of a Clinton economic platform : a mix of improving education , providing direct aid to the lower and middle classes , bolstering child care , strengthening financial regulation , raising taxes on the wealthy , and cutting taxes on the middle class . \nThen there are three issues -- gay marriage , women 's rights , and immigration reform -- that are of immense ideological and electoral importance to the Democratic Party , and can expect an ardent champion in Clinton . \nIt depends on whether you see Obama 's foreign policy , which is so entwined with Clinton 's tenure at the State Department , as a disaster for which the U.S. is primarily responsible or the result of organic crises erupting in the Middle East and elsewhere that are largely beyond the administration 's control . \nThe fear is that a President Clinton , likely facing a Republican-controlled Congress , will not be content to be the safeguard of Obama 's legacy ; that she will foolishly trade away Democratic priorities like entitlements in some ill-conceived Grand Bargain ; that she will succumb to the many demons whispering in her ear , whether they be Wall Street bankers , neoliberal triangulators , purveyors of hoary Beltway wisdom , or the Wormtongue-like advisers that are always hovering around Clintonland . \nBut if Clinton is smart , and I believe she is , she will realize that the days of repealing Glass-Steagall are over , and that her ticket to a historical legacy is to be part of a great era of policy reorientation away from the conservative-neoliberal consensus that has produced decades of middle-class stagnation and one huge financial crisis . \nIn contrast , Hillary Clinton , who officially announced her campaign for president on Sunday , will not face the same array of challenges should she be elected -- which is another way of saying that she will have fewer opportunities to remake the political landscape in her image . \nTo that end , there are ways Clinton could be a far more effective president than Obama . \nBut there is still plenty for Clinton and the Democratic Party to do -- and plenty of space to leave her mark . \nShe is also better at greasing her own side with the kind of glad-handing and thank-you-card-writing that Obama constitutionally dislikes -- my guess is that another President Clinton would have an easier time getting her side to fall in line on , say , the Iran deal than President Obama . \nFirst , simply by virtue of being elected , Clinton could consolidate the gains that Democrats have made in the Obama era . \nAt the very least , Clinton would face pressure from her party and her base to protect those reforms . \nMany critics have accused Clinton of helping turn Libya into a failed state , and note that her support for U.S. intervention echoed her support for the Iraq War . \nIt is worth remembering that in 2008 , Clinton actually ran to Obama 's left on the issue , which should give progressives hope that policies like the public option and greater subsidies will be on Clinton 's 2016 agenda .", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

On June 19  Alessandra Stanley  a prolific writer much admired by editors for the intellectual heft of her coverage of television  wrote a sum-up of the Cronkite career  to be published after his death.\n In her haste  she said  she looked up the dates for two big stories that Cronkite covered -- the assassination of Martin Luther King and the moment Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon -- and copied them incorrectly. She wrote that Cronkite stormed the beaches on D-Day when he actually covered the invasion from a B-17 bomber. She never meant that literally  she said. \"I didn't reread it carefully enough to see people would think he was on the sands of Omaha Beach.\"\n June 19 was a Friday  a heavy time for the culture department  which was processing copy for Saturday  Sunday and Monday. Lorne Manly  Stanley's editor  read the article but did not catch the mistakes; worse  he made a change that led to another error. Where Stanley had said correctly that Cronkite once worked for United Press  Manly changed it to United Press International  with a note to copy editors to check the name. In the end  it came out United Press and United Press International in the same sentence.\n Janet Higbie  a copy editor  said she started reading the article that Friday and caught the misspelling of the Telstar satellite and the two incorrect dates  but fixes she thought she made didn't make it into the paper. \"I don't know what happened \" she said. Higbie said she had to drop the story and jump to deadline work  and she assumed that someone else would pick up the editing later. No one did -- for four weeks  until Cronkite died late on another busy Friday. \"It fell through the cracks \" Higbie said.\n Two days before his father died  Chip Cronkite sent me an e-mail message labeled  \"pre-emptive correction.\" He said that CBS  in reviewing its obituary material  had found inaccuracies. \"As a life-long admirer of your newspaper \" he said  \"may I suggest that you have someone double-check ahead of time?\"\n Douglas Martin  who had written an advance obit of Cronkite several years earlier  phoned Chip Cronkite.

The movie that was nominated for several Oscars began as a self-published book by  Andy Weir . NPR's Lynn Neary looks at how an unknown author's book became a hit audio book and major motion picture.\nSelf-published authors often dream of snagging a big contract with a major publishing house. But after  Andy Weir 's self-published \"The Martian\" online  its next stop was not print. Instead   it  got picked up by a small Canadian audiobook company. Of course   it  was eventually made into a movie and nominated for multiple Oscars.  We 'll find out tomorrow night how many  it  wins. NPR's Lynn Neary has  our  story.\nLYNN NEARY  BYLINE: When Podium Publishing discovered \"The Martian \" it was a new and very small audiobook company.  Andy Weir  was a complete unknown.\nGREG LAWRENCE: When  we  talked to  Andy Weir   when I talked to him on the phone  he'd never spoken with a publisher before.\nNEARY: Tonn had to be persuaded to read the book. But once he did  he was on board. And Podium reached out to the author.  Andy Weir  says it had never occurred to him to pitch his book to a publishing company. And it didn't bother him at all that he was being approached by an audiobook publisher.\n ANDY  WEIR: I was surprised that anyone was interested. Remember  at this time  I didn't think that the book would have any mainstream appeal. So I thought it was just - oh  you know  it's just a book  you know  by a dork for dorks.\nNEARY: The growing popularity of  Weir 's self-published book also caught the attention of Random House  which wanted to make a deal for \"The Martian.\" But   Weir  says  there was one small problem. By then  he already had a contract with Podium.\n WEIR : The contract basically said I couldn't make a print edition of the book. So when Random House started expressing an interest  thankfully  the guys at Podium were just  like  oh  sure  we'll let you buy that back.\nNEARY: Podium Publishing  said Greg Lawrence  has never had any regrets about its decision to revert the rights back to  Weir .\nNEARY: One immediate benefit - both contracts required  Andy Weir  to take down the online version of the book. And that  says  Weir   gave the audiobook a big sales boost.\n WEIR : For about six or eight months or something like that  there was no version of \"The Martian\" available at all  other than the audiobook. So I think everybody won.\nNEARY: There have been one more than 100 000 reviews of the audio version of \"The Martian \" on audible.com. And   Andy Weir  says   he 's made more money from the audiobook than  he  has from the movie.

It comes in a contract that will extend through May 28  2018. The agency signed contracts for golf carts at  Trump 's clubs as early as February  but they never exceeded about $18 000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and only lasted for one month at a time.\nIn August  USA TODAY first reported that the Secret Service can no longer pay the overtime for hundreds of agents it needs to carry out an expanded protective mission \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in large part due to the sheer size of  Trump 's family and efforts necessary to secure their multiple residences up and down the East Coast. Secret Service Director Randolph \"Tex\" Alles said more than 1 000 agents have already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year.\nMore: Exclusive: Secret Service depletes funds to pay agents because of  Trump 's frequent travel  large family\nMore: How  Trump  could ease the burden  he 's putting on the Secret Service\nMore: Donald Trump Jr. gives up Secret Service protection\nWhile Congress has been working on a fix to raise the caps for the agents  critics have said  Trump  could ease the financial burden on the agency by reducing  his  travel and staying at the White House more often.\n\"There's a question about how fast  Trump  is racking up bills that the taxpayers have to pay  which are largely trips to  his  hotels and  his  golf courses \" said Harrell Kirstein  American Bridge communications director.\nUnder the law   Trump  cannot provide or pay for any equipment or services the Secret Service needs to protect  him . The rule is intended to stave off any potential conflicts of interests for the agency.\nThe Secret Service has signed several more golf-related contracts.

TAMPA  Backup goaltender Antero Niittymaki is making it tough for the Lightning to put him back on the bench.\n Niittymaki  making his second straight start  came through with several spectacular saves Monday night against the Panthers  with one sparking the Lightning's go-ahead goal in a 3-2 come-from-behind victory in front of an announced 14 126 at the St. Pete Times Forum.\n Tampa Bay (2-1-2) has won two straight for the first time since mid March  taking advantage of another strong third-period flurry. Make no mistake: Mike Smith is the Lightning's No. 1 goalie  but Niittymaki was the No. 1 star Monday night.\n Niittymaki \"was huge \" Steven Stamkos said. \"It was definitely not one of our better games  and he really bailed us out. And that's what great goaltenders do. And he did that for us (Monday night). He was great.\"\n Niittymaki had 31 saves  including several on Panthers odd-man rushes; he even picked up the assist on the-winner. With less than seven minutes left  Niittymaki made a save on a breakaway by David Booth. Stamkos picked up the rebound and went the length of the ice  ripping a shot through Florida goaltender Tomas Vokoun. The puck trickled off the post  but Ryan Malone crashed the net and tapped in the rebound. \"I was lucky enough; I got the garbage there \" he said.\n Before making the rare end-to-end rush  Stamkos said  he looked back and saw three Panthers standing still near the red line  so he decided to go for it.\n \"It was just kind of an instinct play  and obviously a great save by Nitty \" Stamkos said. \"He deserves all the credit on that one.\"\n Niittymaki was tested early  having to stop Booth on a first-period breakaway  an experience he drew on when he came in alone in the third period.\n \"He tried to deke-backhand the first time  so I was kind of guessing he might shoot  and he did \" Niittymaki said. \"So I think I had a little advantage there.\"\n The Lightning didn't play its best hockey  being a little too careless with the puck  which is partly why Niittymaki faced so many odd-man rushes.\n And though Niittymaki  29  has played just two regular-season games for the Lightning since signing in the offseason  Tocchet likes what he is made of  too.\n \"Niittymaki was solid as can be  he was excellent \" Tocchet said. \"He's done everything  and more.\"", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Nathan Chen  hit the ice jumping when  he  landed in PyeongChang  South Korea to compete in  his  first Winter Olympic Games. Despite not sleeping through the night because of jet lag  the young American star managed to skate all three practice sessions to which  he  was assigned and  he  held little back  landing most of the challenging quadruple jumps for which  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s known.\nThat bodes well for the first member of the U.S. Olympic figure skating team scheduled to compete in PyeongChang.  Chen   18  will skate the short program portion of the team event this Thursday  Feb. 8  at 8pm ET  a day before the official Olympics opening ceremony on Feb. 9.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a moment  Chen  was all but groomed for. When  he  was seven   Chen  used to perform a routine set to \u00e2\u0080\u009cI Just Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Wait to be King\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the Lion King  decked out in a Simba costume with hoodie  ears and tail that  his  mother made for the occasion. Few could have predicted how prescient it was.\n Chen  is now the two-time U.S. national figure skating champion and is known as the Quad King for being the first skater in the world to land five quadruple jumps in a single program. Most elite figure skaters perfect just one or two of the four-rotation jumps. But  Chen \u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to whip off five different quad jumps makes  him  a favorite to win individual Olympic gold in PyeongChang.\nA native of Salt Lake City and the youngest of five   Chen  displayed  his  extraordinary skating skill from an early age  landing  his  first triple jumps at 10. Mastering quad jumps was an extension of the work ethic instilled by  his  parents  who immigrated from China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy parents always wanted the very best from me  and pushed me further and further \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Chen  tells TIME. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat stuck with me  and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken hold of  myself  and tried to improve on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAs a rising junior figure skater   Chen  noticed a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdry spell\u00e2\u0080\u009d in men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skating in the U.S. during which there \u00e2\u0080\u009chasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been too much motivation to do quad jumps \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  says. (A U.S. man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last Olympic skating medal was Evan Lysacek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gold in 2010.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was seeing younger guys at international competitions do crazy things  and realized we were a little far behind  and that we needed to keep pushing forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWatching a competitor from China packing his figure skating programs with three quad jumps sparked a competitive fire in  Chen . \u00e2\u0080\u009cKnowing that other guys were far ahead of  me  switched a light on in my head  that it was really important to get these quad jumps \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  says.\nTrained in ballet and gymnastics along with skating   Chen \u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength and technique offered a strong foundation for building  his  repertoire of quad jumps.  His  training partner and Olympic teammate  Adam Rippon  says  Chen  is \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the best jumpers in the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d and credits  Chen  with improving  his  own figure skating.\n Chen  is also among the most versatile.  His  programs seem to be a continuous work in progress \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this season  he  has not performed the same long program twice  switching up  his  figure skating jumps depending on how  he  is feeling physically and compensating for any mistakes  he  may have made. Because  he  is able to execute five different quadruple jumps (not to mention their triple versions too)   he  has a range of tricks  he  can slide into  his  routines. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the only skater currently who can do all five quads. So having that technical difficulty in my arsenal allows me to manipulate my program however I want during competition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe downside of all that flexibility (and sheer physical force) is the toll it can take on  his  body. Just after winning  his  first medal  a bronze  at the senior U.S. national championships in 2016   Chen  injured  his  hip  forcing  him  to spend five months off the ice to recover.\nOnce back in the rink   Chen  focused on soaring even higher. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never set out to do these programs  or to make history \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just like to keep pushing  myself  and the sport.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

After a slight scare when Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  Chair Ajit Pai  received a note to evacuate in the middle of  his  closing argument in favor of overturning net neutrality rules implemented by the Obama administration in 2015  the commission voted to end those rules Thursday.\n Pai  spent the majority of  his  closing argument reiterating  his  position on why the Orwellian-named net neutrality rules \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which essentially implemented federal oversight of the internet under Title II regulations created in the 1930s to manage the Ma Bell telephone monopoly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had been an Obama administration mistake.\nPrior to 2015 when net neutrality was implemented  the internet was regulated under what  Pai  is fond of calling a \u00e2\u0080\u009clight-touch framework\u00e2\u0080\u009d; simply put  the federal government had less regulatory oversight which allowed internet service providers and tech companies the ability to invest and innovate.

Veselnitskaya is Negative . A report with the New York Times today is saying that there was more to the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr.  several members of the Trump campaign team  and a Kremlin-connected attorney   Natalia V. Veselnitskaya   was more calculated than originally reported.\nBut interviews and records show that in the months before the meeting   Ms. Veselnitskaya  had discussed the allegations with one of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most powerful officials  the prosecutor general  Yuri Y. Chaika. And the memo  she  brought with  her  closely followed a document that Mr. Chaika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office had given to an American congressman two months earlier  incorporating some paragraphs verbatim. The coordination between the Trump Tower visitor and the Russian prosecutor general undercuts Ms. Veselnitskaya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account that  she  was a purely independent actor when  she  sat down with Donald Trump Jr.  Jared Kushner  the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son-in-law  and Paul J. Manafort  then the Trump campaign chairman. It also suggests that emails from an intermediary to the younger Mr. Trump promising that  Ms. Veselnitskaya  would arrive with information from Russian prosecutors were rooted at least partly in fact \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not mere \u00e2\u0080\u009cpuffery \u00e2\u0080\u009d as the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son later said.\nThe memo that  Ms. Veselnitskaya  brought to the Trump Tower meeting alleged that Ziff Brothers Investments  an American firm  had illegally purchased shares in a Russian company and evaded tens of millions of dollars of Russian taxes. The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers  two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton. By implication   Ms. Veselnitskaya   said  those political contributions were tainted by \u00e2\u0080\u009cstolen\u00e2\u0080\u009d money. Kremlin officials viewed the charges as extremely significant. The Ziff brothers had invested in funds managed by William F. Browder  an American-born financier and fierce Kremlin foe. Mr. Browder was the driving force behind a 2012 law passed by Congress imposing sanctions on Russian officials for human rights abuses. The law  known as the Magnitsky Act  froze Western bank accounts of officials on the sanctions list \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including Mr. Chaika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and banned them from entering the United States. It was named after Sergei L.Magnitsky  a tax lawyer who had worked for Mr. Browder and who died in a Moscow jail after exposing a massive fraud scheme involving Russian officials.\nAs a former prosecutor for the Moscow regional government   Veselnitskaya  has traveled to the U.S. quite a bit  in order to lobby against the Magnitsky Act.\nWhile investigating Mr. Browder and his investors   Ms. Veselnitskaya  unearthed what  she  considered evidence of a financial and tax fraud scheme. In October 2015   she  took  her  findings about Mr. Browder and the Ziff brothers directly to Mr. Chaika  Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top prosecutor and a man whom  she  has said  she  knows personally. Mr. Chaika was highly pleased with  her  report  according to a former colleague of  Ms. Veselnitskaya  who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions. In April 2016   Ms. Veselnitskaya  teamed with Mr. Chaika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office to pass the accusations to an American congressional delegation visiting Moscow. An official with the Russian prosecutor general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office gave a memo detailing the charges \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stamped \u00e2\u0080\u009cconfidential\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 to Representative Dana Rohrabacher  a California Republican who is considered to be one of the most pro-Russia lawmakers in Congress and who heads a subcommittee that helps oversee U.S. policy toward Russia.\n Ms. Veselnitskaya  handed a nearly identical memo to Representative French Hill  Republican of Arkansas.  She  has said  she  also met with Mr. Rohrabacher then  although he said that he does not recall the encounter. The next month  Mr. Chaika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office described the alleged scheme on prosecutor general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website.\nThe documents brought by  Veselnitskaya  resembled the same documents given to Rohrabacher  with some of the wording exact.\nRussian elites have been known to mount independent initiatives to curry favor with the Kremlin.

The similarities between Joe Kennedy III and Donald Trump are  in a sense  obvious. Both are white men  northeasterners  teetotalers. They are products of the Ivy League and great wealth. They joined their respective family trades \u2013 real estate for Trump  politics for Joe III.\nThe differences are obvious too  and more illuminating. Joe III is a liberal avatar of American institutions: the Kennedy family  Stanford  Harvard Law. Self-effacing in person  he recognizes how easy his path has been \u2013 he only briefly served as an assistant DA before taking a House seat -- and had  until now  chosen to mitigate charges of nepotism by playing the part of diligent backbencher. The Kennedys  for all their famous faults  have the saving grace that comes from being in on the joke; when President Kennedy appointed his younger brother attorney general  he quipped that he was just trying to give Bobby some experience before he started practicing law.\nThe result is the great destabilization of the Trump era. Few  it seems  have a firm grasp on what is happening  let alone what might happen next. Everybody  regardless of their ideology  thinks they're losing. A realignment appears to be happening in our politics  but nobody can agree on what it looks like. \"We all feel the fault lines of a fractured country \" as  Joe III  put it in  his  stilted  awkward speech on Tuesday night.\nThere is  of course  an element of nostalgia in liberalism's newfound fondness for our institutions. Trump-era liberalism  with its emphasis on American global leadership and veneration of federal agencies and the mainstream press  would be easily recognizable to that first generation of Kennedys. And in that sense  it makes sense that  Joe III  would become a natural face of contemporary Democratic politics.\nTuesday night was an attempt to make  Joe III  a symbol of institutional resistance to Trump. To the question of whether the institutions are worth saving  and therefore capable of reform   Joe III 's answer is an enthusiastic yes.  He  is  in a sense  already a symbol of how  his  own family has repaired itself from its reckless  impulsive  and selfish ways;  he  seems serious   he  is sober. The message  he  sends is that  his  family   his  party  and all the other institutions that nurtured  him  still have an innate and positive utility  an essential role to play. Where Trump says the rot must be amputated   Joe III  promises that a strong dose of antibiotics is all that's needed.\nWhether this message resonates among the Democratic rank-and-file is another story. While the liberal commentariat   Joe III's  natural constituency  remains fixated on norms and the need to defend institutions  a newly ascendant left sees civility as a neoliberal plot to uphold the status quo. And whereas  Joe III  and  his  ilk see Trump as an aberration  the left sees  him  as a symptom of a decayed political order  they  wish to abolish and replace.\nRobert Kennedy once said that he wished he had been born poor so he could have been a revolutionary.

But fire officials said as darkness fell that with the hot   dry Santa Ana winds not as fierce as expected   crews had been successful in building some fire lines between the flames and the towns of Montecito and Carpinteria . \u201c This is a menacing fire   certainly   but we have a lot of people working very diligently to bring it under control  \u201d Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told an evening press conference . Still   some 5   000 residents remained under evacuation orders in the two communities   near Santa Barbara and about 100 miles ( 160 km ) northwest of Los Angeles . Some 15   000 homes were considered threatened . The Thomas Fire   the worst of six major blazes in Southern California in the last week and already the fifth largest in the state since 1932   has blackened 230   000 acres ( 570   000 hectares )  more than the area of New York City . It has destroyed 790 houses   outbuildings and other structures and left 90   000 homes and businesses without power . The combination of Santa Ana winds and rugged terrain in the mountains that run through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have hampered firefighting efforts   and officials said the Thomas Fire was only 10 percent contained on Sunday evening   down from 15 percent earlier in the day . But wind gusts recorded at 35 - 40 miles per hour were less than those predicted by forecasters   giving crews a chance to slow the flames \u2019 progress down slopes above the endangered communities . The fires burning across Southern California have forced the evacuation of more 200   000 people and destroyed some 1   000 structures .

In the last week   only one death has been reported   a 70 - year - old woman who died Wednesday in a car accident as she attempted to flee the flames in Ventura County . Scores of horses have died   including at least 46 at a thoroughbred training facility in San Diego county .

But Madrid had little interest in any exercise of Catalan self-determination. In a speech Sunday evening   Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy  pinned the blame for what happened on Catalan secessionists  who engineered the confrontation by staging what Madrid deems an illegal vote. \u201cToday there has not been a self-determination referendum in Catalonia \u201d  Rajoy  declared. \u201cThe rule of law remains in force with all its strength.\u201d\nBut although  Rajoy  thwarted the immediate prospect of independence   he  \u2014 not  his  Catalan opponents \u2014 looks like the day's big loser.  His  government took a heavy-handed line with Catalonia's secessionists in the buildup to the vote  and  Rajoy  is being slammed by opponents both inside Catalonia and elsewhere for making a mess of the proceedings.\n \u201cRajoy  faces an extraordinarily difficult task.  He  is adamant that it is  his  government\u2019s fundamental duty to uphold the law and preserve the integrity of the Spanish state \u201d wrote Tony Barber of the Financial Times. \u201cYet the police\u2019s use on Sunday of batons and rubber bullets to disrupt the referendum risks deepening the confrontation and putting off the moment when Madrid and the Catalonian authorities sit down to find a way out of the impasse.\u201d\nCritics say  Rajoy 's own right-wing nationalist politics made it impossible to deal with Catalan secessionists  a coalition of pro-independence factions who came to power in 2015 regional elections and swiftly signaled their intent to stage the referendum. From the outset   Rajoy  treated their aspirations as both illegal and intolerable.\n Rajoy  probably has little time for Puigdemont's proclamation.  The prime minister  built  his  political reputation in the mid-2000s by fiercely opposing a Catalan charter for greater autonomy  which a Socialist government in Madrid at the time had agreed to and was later ratified by a referendum in Catalonia. In 2010  a Spanish constitutional court struck down a series of key provisions in that charter  based on an appeal filed by  Rajoy 's center-right People's Party. That  in turn  kicked off Catalan rumblings toward independence.\nBut  Rajoy  is also on rocky ground in Madrid  where  he  presides over a fragile  minority government in parliament.\nPablo Iglesias  leader of the left-wing Podemos party  tweeted against the \u201crepressive strategy\u201d of  Rajoy  and his allies  warning that it has \u201cdeteriorated democracy and coexistence [in Spain] to unprecedented limits.\u201d Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the center-left Socialists called for political negotiations and seemed to blame  Rajoy  for not seeking talks earlier  saying that \u201cdoing nothing is the worst way of solving any problem.\u201d\nNow  though  the political conversation is far more polarized. A tense standoff is in the cards in the coming weeks  with the possibility of further protests and mass strikes rocking Catalonia.  Rajoy  will have to own the crisis  and  his  opponents already have one idea of how  he  should do so.\n\u201c He  is a coward who does not live up to  his  state responsibilities \u201d said Ada Colau  Barcelona's mayor. \u201cAs a result   he  must resign.\u201d", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

We have some news now on how the Trump administration is pushing back against illegal immigration. The administration has for months talked about separating immigrant families at the border as a way of discouraging them from coming in the first place. A federal lawsuit filed on Monday says federal agents are increasingly doing that  and the idea has outraged activists. The plaintiff is an undocumented Congolese woman who's being detained in San Diego while her 7-year-old daughter is being held 2 000 miles away at a shelter in Chicago.  NPR's John Burnett  has the story.\n JOHN BURNETT   BYLINE: In recent years  the Department of Homeland Security has attempted to discourage asylum-seekers from coming to the U.S. Under Obama  they detained some unauthorized families in camps in South Texas rather than release them in the U.S. while their cases are heard. The Trump administration has gone even further. It has arrested immigrant parents in the U.S. who paid smugglers to bring their children across the border  and it wants to expand detention space. Now comes the most extreme measure yet  family separation.\n BURNETT : That's Lee Gelernt  deputy director of the ACLU's National Immigrant Rights Project. He's representing a 39-year-old mother who traveled from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Mexico with her 7-year-old daughter. They surrendered to immigration agents near San Diego in December. They said they were fleeing violence in Congo and asked for asylum. She's being held apart from her daughter. They're only able to speak by phone.\n BURNETT : A spokeswoman for Homeland Security declined to give a reason why the child was taken from her mother  saying only the agency does not comment on cases under litigation. The practice of separating undocumented families to discourage them from coming is not a formal stated policy of the administration  but immigrant activists say it's been quietly growing in frequency along the Southern border. Katharina Obser is with the Women's Refugee Commission.\n BURNETT : Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services has documented 53 incidents of family separation in the last nine months  mostly Central Americans. They say they're fleeing rampant gang violence. But the administration believes most of them are gaming the system  and it wants to stop the flow  first  because the trek is dangerous for young children. And  second  Matt Al Bent's  an official with ICE removal operations  told NPR...\n BURNETT : Immigration lawyers say the strategy could work. Mothers may drop their cases and go home to be reunited with their children. But is that a reasonable way to curtail illegal immigration? Dr. Lisa Fortuna  director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Boston Medical Center  is an expert on the impact of trauma on immigrant families. She's submitting an amicus brief in the ACLU lawsuit.\n BURNETT : The lawsuit claims that immigration agents violated the Congolese woman's constitutional right to due process. It asks the government  if it's going to detain a mother and child during the asylum process  at least allow them to be together.  John Burnett   NPR News.

Kim  promised to focus this year on producing nuclear warheads and missiles for operational deployment   adding that the United States could now \" never start a war against me or our country .\" But  he  also struck a conciliatory note   opening the door to dialogue with South Korea and saying  he  would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics to be held in  his  southern neighbor in February . \" The United States should know that the button for nuclear weapons is on my table  \"  he  said during the nationally televised speech   according to a provisional translation by The Associated Press . \" The entire area of the U .

In typically bellicose language   it declared the latest round of United Nations sanctions imposed last month an \" act of war  \" and  Kim  said  his  country had achieved the historic feat of \" completing \" its nuclear forces . North Korea ' s nuclear capabilities do not yet match  Kim  ' s boasts   experts say   since it is far from clear it could successfully deliver a nuclear weapon on one of its missiles . Yet there is little doubt its capabilities have advanced significantly in the past year . But  Kim    dressed in a Western - style gray suit and a tie   also offered a potential olive branch to Seoul saying it is imperative to lower military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and improve ties with the South .  He  said that the path to dialogue was open and that  he  would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang   South Korea . \" North Korea ' s participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to show unity of the people   and we wish the Games will be a success  \"  he  said   according to a Reuters translation of the speech . \" Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility .\" South Korea has been trying to reassure the rest of the world that the Olympics will be safe despite the nuclear tensions   and President Moon Jae - in has said North Korea ' s participation would ensure their safety . He also proposed last month that Seoul and Washington postpone annual joint military drills until after the Olympics   and he generally takes a less confrontational approach to relations with the North than his predecessor   Park Geun - hye . John Delury   a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul   said Kim ' s message to Seoul was \" more promising \" than he had anticipated   addressing in a specific and actionable way South Korea ' s desire to make the Games a success . \" That should give hope to those in the South who are trying to get something going and open a channel at least  \" he said . The idea of improving relations between the two Koreas is one that is frequently spoken about but seldom achieved   and Kim ' s warmer words could also be seen as an attempt to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington . While Kim ' s words were more combative towards the United States   he also refrained from a personal attack on President Donald Trump   after the two men engaged in several rounds of mutual name - calling in 2017   Delury noted . When asked about North Korea ' s nuclear claims on Sunday night   Trump said only   \" We ' ll see   we ' ll see .\" Daryl Kimball   executive director of the Arms Control Association   said Kim ' s claims about his country ' s nuclear capability underscored that there was no viable \" military solution \" to denuclearizing North Korea and that sanctions alone would not persuade Pyongyang to halt or reverse its nuclear buildup . \" To avoid a nuclear conflict and the full - scale deployment of an operational North Korean strategic deterrent force   U . S . leaders   in concert with South Korea   should redouble efforts to engage North Korea in direct talks and cease any further explicit or implicit threats of military action against the North  \" he said in an email . \" The upcoming Olympics provide an important opportunity to break the ice and to begin discussions with the North Koreans on mutual steps that reduce the chances of miscalculation and war  \" he added .

Obama  the architects said  wants an outdoor plaza framed by the three buildings to be able to host food trucks. A fourth building south of the main cluster  an athletic center  would house facilities including a basketball court where the former president could shoot hoops.

They did not disclose the nature of his mental illness.\nEarlier this year   Kelley  worked for five and a half weeks as an unarmed security guard at Schlitterbahn New Braunfels  park spokesperson Winter Prosapio said in an email. The water park in this San Antonio suburb is located about 35 miles north of where  Kelley  conducted the largest mass shooting in Texas history.\nAir Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said  Kelley  served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in southern New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014.

Kelley \u00e2\u0080\u0099s domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Air Force officials at Holloman Air Force Base  Stefanek said in a statement.\nThe Air Force was required to provide the information to the database because  Kelley  was convicted of a domestic assault and under federal law would not have been able to purchase a gun legally.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said  Kelley  owned four guns  purchasing two in Colorado and two in Texas since 2014.\n Kelley  had another run in with law enforcement in August 2014 while living in a Colorado mobile home park.\nFour witnesses at the mobile home park said they saw  Kelley  repeatedly punch a white and brown husky  according to an El Paso County Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Department incident report.\nOne witness said  Kelley  picked up the dog by its neck and slammed it onto the ground. Other witnesses also said they saw  Kelley  punch the dog and then drag the dog away.\n Kelley  initially refused to leave his camper when deputies arrived at the scene and told them he wouldn't talk to them about the incident or let them see his dog without a search warrant.\nHe later admitted to deputies that he jumped on the dog  because the animal had been acting aggressively toward another dog in the area.

And oh  by the way  the Cowboys also need  Elliott  in their lineup desperately  Jones acknowledged as well.\n[NFL says Ezekiel Elliott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suspension is in effect after appeals court denies him an injunction]\n Elliott  has begun serving  his  six-game suspension under the personal conduct policy and  barring yet another last-minute legal twist  will not play Sunday when the Cowboys face the Falcons in Atlanta.  He  will have missed four games by the time  his  appeal of the rejection of  his  injunction is heard by a federal appeals court Dec. 1.\nIn the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case  that question is yet to be answered. Certainly the NFLPA was doing all that it could for  Elliott . But for the union  the issues are bigger than one suspension and one case. The NFLPA wants a fundamentally different system of player justice than the one used by Goodell and the league under the collective bargaining agreement and the personal conduct policy. In the meantime  the union is doing what it can to ensure that cases are decidedly as fairly as possible  in its view  and players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights are protected as much as possible under the current system.\nBut those changes probably will have to come  ultimately  at the bargaining table as part of the next CBA rather than in the courts. The union managed to delay the  Elliott  suspension for half a season. But now  Elliott  is about to sit. The NFLPA managed to delay the four-game suspension of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady  through the courts  for an entire season in the Deflategate case. But Brady sat out the first four games of last season. The union managed to prevail in court in a disciplinary case involving Adrian Peterson  only to lose on appeal.\n Elliott  has denied that  he  was guilty of domestic violence in a series of incidents last year in Ohio involving  his  former girlfriend.  He  was not charged with a crime. But the NFL determined after its investigation that  Elliott   in  its  view  was guilty of domestic violence.\n Elliott  has said the courtroom challenge was  for  him   about justice and  his  reputation. Was it worth it for  him ? Only  he  can answer that.\nBut in terms of on-field considerations for  Elliott  and the Cowboys  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly debatable whether the decision to go to court was a good one  in retrospect.  Elliott  could have missed the first six games of the season.  He  would have returned and played the past two games  and the Cowboys would have  him  in the lineup for the second half of the regular season and beyond.  He  would have been available for the season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest games.\nAs things now stand   Elliott  won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play again until Christmas Eve.  He  will have to regain  his  game sharpness and get back in sync with the Cowboys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offense in a hurry for the games that could determine the outcome of the Cowboys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 season. In the meantime  they will have to try to get by with backup running backs Alfred Morris  Darren McFadden and Rod Smith and attempt to remain in postseason contention without  Elliott .\nCourt denies Ezekiel Elliott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest injunction request  Cowboys star again suspended by NFL", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

So  McCabe  was overseeing domestic and international investigations  which gave  him  a central role  of course  into the biggest and most high-profile cases of late. That would be the Clinton email server investigation and the Russia probe.  He  also  you may remember famously  stepped in as acting director after Comey was fired in May. And  McCabe  is expected to retire early next year when  he 's eligible for  his  full pension  and that's been the plan for some time.\nFRAYER: So why is Trump then taking aim at  McCabe  on Twitter like he is?\nLUCAS: That's right. Yes. Now  the FBI says  McCabe  cleared everything with ethics folks at the bureaus. Everything was above board. And also  McCabe  didn't become deputy director until after that election. But still  Republicans have suggested that it may have tainted  McCabe 's decision-making in the Clinton probe. And all of this  of course  is part of a broader pattern from the president and his allies of  you know  disparaging remarks directed at the FBI and the Justice Department  alleging political bias in the upper ranks of the bureau in particular and by extension  of course  with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team conducting the Russia investigation.\nLUCAS: That's very much so.  McCabe  was dragged up to Capitol Hill twice last week.  He  spent around eight hours testifying behind closed doors for the House Intelligence Committee. That was about Russia. And  he  spent a little more than eight hours with the House Oversight and House Judiciary Committees a few days later talking about the Clinton matter.\nLUCAS: Well  it's not a position that the bureau wants to be in. It was in the middle of the political fight in 2016  and that's continued into 2017. And there's a lot of pressure from Republicans to clean house in the senior ranks at the FBI. That's made life difficult for Christopher Wray. But one source has told me that there's not a lot of appetite at the bureau to bend to that pressure and dump  McCabe  before  he 's set to retire.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Some of his appetites  at least  had waned\u2026.With a pencil neck and a sagging jacket he clambered gamely onto the stage after Hillary\u2019s acceptance speech and played happily with the red balloons that fell from the ceiling. When the couple repeatedly reminded the crowd of their new status as grandparents it was to suggest very different associations in voters\u2019 minds. \u2026Yet let us not forget the sex crimes of which the younger  stronger Bill Clinton was very credibly accused in the 1990s.  Juanita Broaddrick  reported that when  she  was a volunteer on one of  his  gubernatorial campaigns   she  had arranged to meet  him  in a hotel coffee shop. At the last minute   he  had changed the location to  her  room in the hotel  where  she  says  he  very violently raped  her .  She  said  she  fought against Clinton throughout a rape that left  her  bloodied. At a different Arkansas hotel   he  caught sight of a minor state employee named Paula Jones  and  Jones says   he  sent a couple of state troopers to invite  her  to  his  suite  where  he  exposed  his  penis to  her  and told  her  to kiss it. Kathleen Willey said that she met  him  in the Oval Office for personal and professional advice and that  he  groped  her   rubbed  his  erect penis on  her   and pushed  her  hand to  his  crotch. It was a pattern of behavior; it included an alleged violent assault; the women involved had far more credible evidence than many of the most notorious accusations that have come to light in the past five weeks. But Clinton was not left to the swift and pitiless justice that today\u2019s accused men have experienced. Rather  he was rescued by a surprising force: machine feminism. The movement had by then ossified into a partisan operation and it was willing\u2014eager\u2014to let this friend of the sisterhood enjoy a little droit de seigneur.\nA resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that  Juanita Broaddrick  never received a fair hearing for  her  charge of rape against the then-Attorney General of Arkansas William Jefferson Clinton  later President of the United States.\ncondemns the actions which  Ms. Broaddrick  alleges occurred in Little Rock  Arkansas in 1978 by then-State of Arkansas Attorney General William Jefferson Clinton as unacceptable and outrageous  to be condemned by all people of all races  creeds  and religions; pledges to do everything in its power  including holding public hearings  to probe the underlying causes of this brutal alleged rape by William Jefferson Clinton and an alleged threat to silence the victim by Hillary Rodham Clinton to make sure that the United States does not return to the days when such brutality and violence against women  along with threats to silence them  were deemed acceptable; calls on the Federal Bureau of Investigation  the Department of Justice  the White House  and all other Federal law enforcement agencies to conduct an immediate  full  and fair investigation into all of the facts of the case; calls upon each Senator and every citizen of the United States  in his or her own way  through his or her church  synagogue  mosque  workplace  or social organization  to join in denouncing and getting others to denounce this outrageous alleged rape of a defenseless woman and pledges to join in efforts to bring an end to rape and an end to the fear and hatred which underlie it  and to encourage all Americans to dedicate themselves to ending sexual violence in the United States.\nSenators Mitch McConnell  John McCain  Susan Collins  and others like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee have condemned Judge Moore in the strongest terms and have called for his withdrawal from the Senate race. There should be no problem with these Senators and those who agree with them on the House side introducing identical resolutions that promise the American people and  Ms. Broaddrick  that they will at last take a serious look at  her  charges and act to educate the American people that both the Senate and the House will not stand for this kind of behavior as alleged by  Ms. Broaddrick . Or others who accused the Clintons like Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey.\nWill this launch a demand from Democrats to do the same to President Trump? Doubtless \u2014 and having seen the allegations the American people elected him anyway. Nothing new has emerged since the President took office. The  Broaddrick  allegation on the other hand did not emerge until 1999  and  Broaddrick herself  says that NBC News withheld its explosive  graphic interview with  her  until it was too late to affect the Clinton impeachment trial. Bill Clinton would never be on a ballot with this spectacular charge in the public domain.\nWill they do it? Will Moore opponent Doug Jones pledge to support such a resolution investigating the Clintons and the  Broaddrick  rape accusation if elected to the Senate?\nBut if all of a sudden so many Senators and Congressmen and Congresswomen are racing to microphones to say they are outraged? Then they need to do something about  Juanita Broaddrick  and what happened with the Clintons. To hold one hearing after another about Hollywood\u2019s sex problem. To name names and hold people accountable.\nThe addition of Ted Cruz and Mike Lee to this fight bodes well for  Juanita Broaddrick  \u2014 and finally and at last holding Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton responsible for their deeds. As even some notable liberals like the Atlantic and MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes are finally doing.\nThe real question now? There is no excuse for this kind of behavior. Period. So where are the McCains and Flakes and other GOP insiders in and out of the Senate and the House in holding to account not just Roy Moore but their friends and fellow Establishment insiders? Will they bring about the Clinton reckoning as the Atlantic asks? Will they finally turn their Senate spotlight on the infamous Ted Kennedy/Chris Dodd \u201cwaitress sandwich\u201d and the behavior of their own colleagues? Will these Senators put their time and actions in the Senate where they now say they really stand? Will they finally give  Juanita Broaddrick   her  due?", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Primary among those is Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy   a guy named Andrew Weissman .  Weissman  is a civil service employee in the upper ranks of Department of Justice.  He  was at Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cvictory\u00e2\u0080\u009d party on the night of November 8  2016.

Federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann  now a senior attorney in the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office   met with AP journalists on April 11 after reporters informed  him  of their own investigation into Manafort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukrainian officials. The reporters had reached out to Weissman on a different story earlier in the year and it was during that conversation  that the AP team told  Weissmann  of their investigation into Manafort  stated the sources. The AP published the explosive expose on April 12  a day after their meeting with  Weissmann . According to sources familiar with the meeting  the reporters had promised to share documents and other information gleaned from the own investigation with the Justice Department.\nMost of this is utter bullsh** as Mueller wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appointed until May 17. BUT AP reporters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meet with the head of Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Criminal Fraud Section for funsies. And a senior official doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a meeting on the day before a major story runs for sh**s and grins. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work that way. AP obviously had information they wanted corroborated by Justice.  Weissman  didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to meet with them but  he  did. Now you have to ask yourself  why? According to the stories there was no open investigation into Manafort. So what could  he  possibly contribute that a press officer couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Perhaps the AP  animated by civic spirit  decided to just give  Weissman  all  their  source material. Perhaps  they  flew there on broomsticks  too. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rate both options just as likely.\nThen you have to ask why  Weissman  made the jump to Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team? Did  him  having AP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s source material represent  his  buy-in to get on a high profile investigation that could offer  him  the satisfaction of a bit of payback after sitting in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cvictory celebration \u00e2\u0080\u009d shell-shocked and dumbfounded  as the election was called for Donald Trump?\nAnd you saw  Weissman  try to get Manafort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bond revoked for editing an op-ed.\nWeissman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history of legalized thuggery  his obvious and egregious partisanship  his collaboration with AP on their investigative work on Paul Manafort  and the abusive way  Weissman  has gone after Manafort all reeks of a personal animus.

Don Christensen  who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force at the time of  Kelley 's general court-martial  tells NPR that the case was serious.\n Kelley  accepted a deal  pleading guilty to a charge of assault on  his  wife and to a charge of \"intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm\" on the child  Christensen says. His crimes were punishable by up to five years confinement (the military equivalent of a prison term).

Several students responded to a request from The Washington Post via Snapchat to talk about how the news of the tragedy weighed on them as they returned to their own classrooms .

Sam  I think comes at any problem more from scientific method.  He  examines the evidence  and if the evidence leads you to one conclusion  then that seems sort of obvious. And Dean operates off of his gut  and what his gut is telling him is this is the spawn of Satan. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if that kind of character has ever been presented in a favorable light. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re conditioned to that Omen kind of thing  and this kid has got qualities that while he obviously can be potentially dangerous  he is curious and inquisitive and willing to believe  and that  Sam  takes as adding up those positives. So he becomes a parent first. Dean is more slow to come around and is determined to get rid of this problem.\"\n\"I mean  Dean has been a parent all his life. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parented  Sam .

On Tuesday  the chief of the National Security Agency  Admiral Michael Rogers  said a \u00e2nation-state\u00e2\u00e2meaning Russia\u00e2had intervened in the 2016 elections \u00e2to achieve a specific effect.\u00e2 He was referring to the hacking of Democratic targets and the release of the stolen information via WikiLeaks. And on Wednesday  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called for a congressional investigation of Russian meddling in the campaign. On Thursday  the call for a Capitol Hill inquiry gathered momentum  with  Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.)   the ranking Democrat on the House government oversight committee  publicly urging the committee\u00e2s chairman  Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah)  to launch such a probe.\nIn a letter sent to Chaffetz and released publicly   Cummings  noted that  he  and Chaffetz had discussed opening such an investigation on Wednesday and that Chaffetz had told  him   he  was \u00e2open to considering such an investigation\u00e2 but wanted  Cummings  to \u00e2show the evidence\u00e2 that Russia had tried to influence the election.  Cummings  did so in this letter  citing Rogers\u00e2 statement.  Cummings  also pointed to a statement issued on October 7 by the Office of Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security  which said  \u00e2The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions  including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow\u00e2the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia  for example  to influence public opinion there. We believe  based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts  that only Russia\u00e2s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\u00e2\n Cummings  also noted that House Speaker Paul Ryan has said  \u00e2Russia is a global menace led by a devious thug. Putin should stay out of this election.\u00e2\nIn his letter to Chaffetz   Cummings  contended that this investigation should be a bipartisan endeavor to ensure the security of American democracy:\n Cummings  proposed that the oversight committee immediately request \u00e2a classified briefing from the Intelligence Community\u00e2 and start \u00e2a robust investigation designed to identify specific recommendations for actions that our country can take to respond to these attacks and safeguard against similar attacks in the future.\u00e2\nHere \u00e2s Cummings \u00e2 full letter:", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

A letter sent to all 32 NFL teams by Commissioner Roger Goodell  makes clear that the league wants to \"move past\" the anthem controversy. The league will propose a standardized policy on behavior during the playing of the National Anthem that will include all players and team personnel standing.\n The letter  does not mention any punishment for players who refuse to stand  which makes enforcement of the policy problematic.\n Goodell  made it clear in  the letter   obtained by ESPN's Adam Schefter  that  he  wants players to stand during the anthem.  He  did not provide specifics on how  he  intends to ensure it  but  he  wrote that it would \"include such elements as an in-season platform to promote the work of our players on these core issues.\" The issue will be discussed  and likely acted upon  during the NFL's regularly-scheduled fall meetings on Oct. 17-18. In  the letter    Goodell  said  he  wanted to end the controversy by agreeing on a uniform approach for all teams. \"Like many of our fans \"  Goodell  wrote  \"we believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem. It is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country  and our fans expect that of us. \"We also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues. The controversy over the Anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues. We need to move past this controversy  and we want to do that together with our players.\" The NFL's current anthem policy states that players \"should\" stand for the anthem  but it stops short of requiring it. The proposed new policy is the result of \"many of discussions with clubs and players \" Goodell added.\nLocal 100 of the United Labor Unions has filed a complaint charging that Jones's implicit demands of players violated the National Labor Relations Act. \"[T]he employer  evidenced by repeated public statements  is attempting to threaten  coerce and intimidate all Dallas Cowboys players on the roster in order to prevent them from exercising concerted activity protected under the act by saying that he will fire any players involved in such concerted activity \" the National Labor Relations Board said in its filing. Jones has not actually threatened to fire players  instead saying they \"will not play \" but a labor union spokesman told ESPN that is a \"distinction without difference when it comes to the law.\" The NFL's game operations manual has said players \"should\" stand for the anthem   a stance NFL commissioner Roger Goodell  reaffirmed Tuesday in a memo to team owners. \"Like many of our fans  we believe that everyone should stand for  the National Anthem \" Goodell  wrote. But there's a gap between \"should\" and \"must \" and in trying to bridge that gap  Jones overreached  the labor union contends. The NLRB will investigate the case and will take it to trial if it determines a violation occurred and a settlement can't be reached. Meanwhile  Jones appeared to moderate his stance the tiniest bit on Tuesday  allowing for the possibility of pre-anthem protests similar to what the Cowboys did prior to their game against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 3. \"If we're going to have any other recognition the place to have it is before the anthem in my view and be real clear that it's not associated with the anthem \" Jones told 105.3 The Fan in Dallas. \"I think it's real important for our players that they have that to reply to anybody whether they're asking them to express themselves or not that the way we do it where I work  where I earn my livelihood  is that we stand for the flag.\" It's impossible to overstate the distraction that Jones has created in the Cowboys' locker room  as well as others across the NFL. Players must decide whether paychecks outweigh principles  and star players must decide whether to take the heat for lesser-known teammates.

Alumni from Morgan State University and Maryland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other historically black institutions  sued in 2006 to dismantle what  they  say are vestiges of racial segregation. (Paul Burk/National Trust for Historic Preservation)\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Wednesday offered the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically black colleges and universities up to $100 million to resolve a 12-year-old lawsuit over inequality in public higher education.\nThe proposed settlement is more than double the amount the state pledged early in the case. It arrives a day after a federal judge granted the state a temporary reprieve as it appeals an order issued in November to establish a set of unique and high-demand programs at its four historically black institutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Morgan State University  Coppin State University  Bowie State University and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.\nBut the proposal may not be enough to satisfy the coalition of alumni from Maryland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically black institutions who filed the lawsuit in 2006 to dismantle what they say are vestiges of racial segregation. The group has accused Maryland of insufficiently funding historically black colleges and allowing other state schools to duplicate their programs  placing pressure on enrollment.\nThe state appealed a month after Blake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling  and has since suggested mediation in an attempt to resolve the case. The settlement offer revealed Wednesday would supplement state appropriations to the four public historically black institutions over a 10-year period  according to a letter Hogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief legal counsel Robert F. Scholz sent Wednesday to Cheryl D. Glenn (D-Baltimore City)  who chairs the Black Caucus.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGovernor Hogan wants to bring this litigation to an end in a manner satisfactory to all parties  and in the best interests of all Marylanders  especially current and future [historically black institution] students \u00e2\u0080\u009d Scholz wrote.\nTraditionally white public universities in Maryland count 122 academic programs not duplicated elsewhere within the state system  while historically black schools have only 11 such offerings. That disparity is why advocates have fought for more high-demand academic programs they say would enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of the four schools.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter just talks about dollars \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it does not talk about putting any kind of dent in that 10-to-1 disparity \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael D. Jones  lead attorney for the alumni coalition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe goal is to address the disparity by placing a certain number of unique programs at the [historically black institutions]  and it was up to the special master to figure out which ones and at what cost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOver the years  the coalition has called for increased funding and merging the University of Baltimore with Morgan State  the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest public historically black school. A more recent proposal to transfer programs from traditionally white state schools raised the ire of the Maryland Higher Education Commission and some university presidents who said the plan would ultimately harm students.\n[At Md.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically black schools  the pursuit of equity without forgoing identity]\nJudge Blake dismissed those proposals  but delivered a ruling that Jones and other advocates of desegregation have considered significant. Jones said he is willing to hash out the terms of the proposed settlement depending on the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stance on creating programs. The money alone  he said  will not dismantle the structural inequality that exists between traditionally white and historically black state colleges.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you say . . . we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to give the [historically black institutions] these new programs that are going to meet the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workforce needs and anybody black  white or Latino who wants the program can attend  that starts to upend the structural inequality \u00e2\u0080\u009d Jones said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that needs to be a part of the remedy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

When asked by the interviewer to explain the difference between rock bands and rock & roll bands   he  replied  \"Rock bands don't really swing ... a lot of rock is stiff. They don't understand the feel  the movement  you know  the jungle of it all.\"\nRelated  Malcolm Young   AC/DC Guitarist and Co-Founder  Dead at 64 Musician who co-founded Australian rock legends in 1973 with  brother Angus Young  dies following battle with dementia\nFew rock & rollers have ever understood \"the jungle of it all\" like  Malcolm Young   and fewer still have ever been as single-mindedly devoted to  its  perpetuation. From 1973  when  he  formed AC/DC with  his  younger brother Angus  to 2014  when dementia and other health issues forced  his  premature retirement   Malcolm  never once allowed the band to deviate from its swinging  swaggering  riff-driven course. During  Malcolm 's tenure  AC/DC's recordings featured three different lead vocalists  three different bassists and five different drummers; and yet  the band's musical aesthetic remained so stubbornly consistent as to make the Ramones look like flighty trend-jumpers by comparison.\nBut if AC/DC's public image was largely defined by Angus's naughty schoolboy  Bon's lascivious pirate and Brian's lusty bricklayer personas  it was Malcom who truly defined the band's lean 'n' mean sound. In addition to serving as the captain of the good ship AC/DC  he was also its chief architect and mechanic  tinkering with riffs and songs as tirelessly as he tinkered with his 1963 Gretsch Jet Firebird  which underwent countless modifications as he strove to unleash the ultimate guitar tone. \"He's the engine in the Mack truck that is AC/DC \" Anthrax's Scott Ian told Loudwire in 2014. \"He's the driving force behind that band; has been since Day One. To the casual listener  they probably don't know who Malcolm Young is ... but Malcom's the guy. He's the greatest rhythm guitar player ever.\"\n\" Mal  always had a better ear for recording and mixing than I did \" Angus told me. \" He  was more involved with that when we were younger  fiddling around with sounds and stuff.  He  tunes into it more than  me ; I'm more about just picking up the thing and play it.  He  helped me a lot with dialing in sounds from my amp; I would be saying  'I can't get nothin' out of this Marshall ' and  he  would help me sort it out and get the best out of it.\"\nWhile Malcolm's death at the too-young age of 64 is certainly a massive blow for AC/DC fans everywhere  it's unlikely that he would want Angus to bring it all to an end on his account. Even in his absence  AC/DC has continued to function like a finely-tuned clockwork mechanism \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the band successfully soldiered following his retirement  recording and touring behind 2014's Rock or Bust with nephew Stevie Young taking over for his uncle on rhythm guitar. That the band continues to thrive without Malcolm isn't a reflection on his lack of importance to it  but rather a testament to the enduring brilliance of the material he wrote  and the perfection of the musical machine that he designed to deliver it. So long as there's enough electricity left in the world for some guitarist somewhere to hit a ringing  window-rattling A chord  Malcolm Young's spirit will live on. Rock in Peace  Mal.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Breitbart News has been provided with an exclusive preview of and excerpt from the new book   Let  Trump  Be  Trump   by Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie  published by Center Street and available on December 5  2017.\nFrom Let  Trump  Be Trump:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want you to know I have the greatest air force in the world \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Trump  began  unprompted  in Corey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first meeting with the candidate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a 757  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a Citation X. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got three helicopters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Corey sat there with a half smile on his face  not knowing quite how to respond.\nWhen  Donald Trump  listed the aircraft  he  had during Corey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job interview  Corey shrugged it off as a random boast. But  Trump  wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t boasting.  He  was pointing out the military equipment  he  had for the war ahead. A candidate with a jet has a formidable advantage over rivals without one. A candidate with an air force was going to be tough to beat.\nWhen you flew with  Trump   you flew first class times ten. Except  that is  when it came time to eat.\nThe first time Dave told his wife Susan that he was going to be on Trump Force One  she asked him to take some photos of what they served him to eat on the plane. She had read somewhere that  Mr. Trump  had a personal chef who traveled with  him . When dinner came on the flight  Dave pulled out his BlackBerry and snapped a picture of the bag of McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hamburgers and unopened package of Oreo cookies and emailed it to Susan.\nOn Trump Force One there were four major food groups: McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Kentucky Fried Chicken  pizza  and Diet Coke. There were also ancillary groups  including Vienna Fingers and the ubiquitous Oreo  before the boycott (after it was Hydrox). The reason the package of Oreos was unopened was because  Mr. Trump  would never eat from a previously opened package. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the Seinfeld episode in which George double-dips  his  chip  you have a pretty good idea of the boss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasoning. Packages of cookies  along with small airliner-size bags of pretzels and potato chips  filled the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cupboards. An army might march on its stomach  but Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team flew on junk food. And those snacks would have to sustain us during long flights and even longer days.\nThe candidate would hardly ever eat lunch and would eat dinner only after he finished the last event of the day. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be in the jet or on the road from seven or eight a.m.  make however many scheduled stops we had  and after the last one  perhaps around nine p.m.   Mr. Trump  would clap  his  hands and say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the food needed to be hot and ready for  him . Some of the time  especially when  he  was pleased with  his  performance at a rally or event   he \u00e2\u0080\u0099d say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think I deserve a malted today? I think I deserve one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Trump   a city kid  grew up drinking malteds  so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what he always called a milkshake. Whatever you want to call it  it better be there and it better still be thick.\nWhen traveling in the air with the boss  you also learned pretty quickly to like Elton John.  Donald Trump  really likes Elton John. Anthony \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Mooch\u00e2\u0080\u009d Scaramucci got in all sorts of hot water\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is not at all an unfamiliar position for him\u00e2\u0080\u0094when he told an interviewer that Elton John would play at President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inaugural. It had been wishful thinking on Mooch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part  probably because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been on the plane when the boss had \u00e2\u0080\u009cTiny Dancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cRocket Man\u00e2\u0080\u009d playing as loud as the concert-level speakers could bring it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling you  when the boss cranks up Elton  you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear yourself think.

He's not quite paraphrasing gun-lovin' Charlton Heston  You can have my bank when you pry it from my cold  dead fingers. Not yet. But Conoley is battling every way he knows how to win precious time he says he needs to revive Horizon Bank's role as a respected lender to small businesses in Bradenton  Manatee County and the surrounding area.\n \"We are profitable and  yes  we are desperately trying to raise new capital \" says Conoley. Unlike most bankers struggling under the thumbs of bank examiners  Conoley wants to tell his story  that Horizon can come back from the brink  even as part of him listens for the sound of the FDIC knocking on his door with the message: This bank is closed.\n A boyish 51  Conoley sits in his modest office at Horizon  located on the corner of a shopping center near modest homes and businesses. He points to the inexpensive trappings of his main office  including the Formica surface at the teller windows  as tangible proof he knows the value of a buck.\n That  Conoley says  is why Horizon makes a difference in a place like Bradenton.\n Indiana born and Purdue University educated  Conoley's been a Florida banker for decades. He worked for Barnett Bank  the last big bank to be based in Florida before out-of-state behemoths bought it and dominated the state. He started Horizon in the late 1990s by borrowing startup money on his own credit card because he wanted to control his own destiny and wanted to stay in his beloved Bradenton.\n Conoley is bitter over what he sees as a double standard. His community bank's capital levels and loan problems are no worse than those at giant Citibank  he says. But Citibank is not going to fail. When the U.S. Treasury unveiled its Wall Street bailout scheme with a plan to lend government money to banks  Citibank was among the big banks to get lots of new capital.\n When Horizon applied for nearly $5 million from the feds  Conoley says the Treasury never responded. Later  the banker says  after prodding  the government finally told him to take back Horizon's application. That way  it would look better than the bank being denied funds. Conoley refused.\n Two allies of Conoley are Florida Bankers Association chief Alex Sanchez in Tallahassee and lobbyist Karen Thomas  who heads government relations at the Independent Community Bankers of America trade group in Washington.\n None of this cheers Conoley in his quest to save Horizon Bank.\n If he pulls off this revival and Horizon sticks around  Conoley may be banking's miracle worker. But even if the FDIC stops by at closing time some Friday evening and hangs its \"Bank Closed\" signs on the doors  this banker will know he gave it his best shot.\n Robert Trigaux can be reached at       trigauxsptimes.com.

My family was upset that I had to leave early from or missed gatherings. In fact  this is the first Thanksgiving I'll get to go in the past three years. However  the customers for the early shift were cheerful  courteous and not yet exhausted and stressed. It was not the worse sales day of the year. And if it were optional  I would take the extra hours and extra pay  since I don't have kids of my own. It's much harder for people with families to care for.\n LUDDEN : So is that what you mean by making adjustments? You kind of shift it to the day before?\n LUDDEN : There you go.

President Donald Trump's critics are arguing that GOP calls for the Justice Department to investigate  Hillary Clinton  and Democrats' ties to Russia are an effort to distract from the real Russia investigation  into potential Trump-Russia collusion.\nEver since Watergate  the mantra of all major corruption investigations has been to \"follow the money.\" Well  Americans of all political stripes should be outraged by the fact that both Democrats and Republicans in Washington are up to their eyeballs in Kremlin cash. Russian money found its way into the pockets of not only Trump advisers like Paul Manafort and Rick Gates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who were recently indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller \u00e2\u0080\u0094but also Democratic power lobbyist Tony Podesta   Bill Clinton  and the Clinton Foundation.\nThis should suggest to objective observers that Russia was using its money to influence both sides in order to advance the Kremlin's interests. And it means that any full and impartial investigation of Russia's efforts to influence our political process needs to follow the Russian money flowing into the coffers of  the Clintons    their  foundation and  their  top associates.\nThe New York Times reported in 2015 that \"shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One   [former President Bill] Clinton  received $500 000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.\" In total  $145 million went to  the Clinton Foundation  from interests linked to Uranium One  which was acquired by the Russian government nuclear agency Rosatum.\nThink that was just a coincidence? As former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy points out  the Uranium One deal is not a national security scandal  it is a corruption scandal involving \" Clinton  family self-dealing.\" Ask yourself: How many half-a-million-dollar speeches has  Bill Clinton  given to Kremlin-linked banks since  Hillary Clinton  was defeated? How much Russian money is flowing into  the Clinton Foundation 's coffers today? If Donald Trump had given a $500 000 speech paid for by a Kremlin bank  and his private foundation had accepted $145 million from Vladimir Putin-linked oligarchs and their Western business partners  do you think that his critics would be insisting there was nothing to see here?\nA look at  Hillary Clinton 's time as first lady  U.S. senator  secretary of state and a Democratic candidate for president.\nWe should all be deeply concerned by how much Russian cash was sloshing around Washington  and how much of it found its way into  the bank accounts of the Clintons  and those around  them . And we should all  Democrats and Republicans alike  want to get to the bottom of it.\nAs Americans  it goes against our sensibilities to encourage the Justice Department of one party to investigate the vanquished candidate of the other party. But does the fact that  Clinton  lost mean Americans don't deserve to know the full extent of Russia's efforts to influence our political process?\nNone of this absolves the Trump campaign or calls into question the intelligence community's conclusion that \"Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help ... Trump's election chances.\" But it does underscore that the Russians were smart in what the intelligence community calls their efforts to \"undermine public faith in the US democratic process.\" They played both sides  and in so doing preyed on the singular weakness of the Clintons and those around them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 greed.\nAny impartial investigation of Russia's efforts to meddle in our democratic process needs to include a full inquiry of the Russian money flowing into  Clinton  world.

Image: lance ulanoff/mashable\nThere\u2019s been a lot of calamity in the world in the last few months  but  apparently  it\u2019s not the source of the production issues. \u201c\u2026there are no fundamental issues with  the Model 3 production or supply chain  \u201d  Tesla  said in the release.\n It  might be a while before you see your Model 3. Image: lance ulanoff/mashable\nThe cause is  Tesla \u2019s own facilities: \u201cproduction bottlenecks\u201d at both  its  Fremont production plant and the massive Gigafactory in Nevada.\nConsidering how much Musk said  Tesla  learned from the production hell it went through with  its  previous  Tesla  models  this is surprising. Musk recalled in July how the Roadster  its first electric car  was the worst. \u201cWe went through hell and then actually did a return journey \u201d Musk said  \u201cWe had to redo almost the entire car and recapitalize the company  which sucked.\u201d\nThere were roughly 30 Model 3's ready to go on July 29.  Tesla  managed to produce another 230 Model 3 cars since then. Image: lance ulanoff/mashable\nDoug Field   Tesla \u2019s VP of Engineering said they designed the Model 3 to move as quickly through production as possible  while maintaining as high production quality as possible.\nWhere  exactly  those production bottlenecks exist is  since Tesla isn\u2019t saying  anyone\u2019s guess  but it doesn\u2019t take much to slow down a production line like this. As Musk explained in July  \u201cThere\u2019s 10 000 unique components in the car and production will move as fast as the slowest one.\u201d\nBeyond statements made in the release   Tesla  wouldn't comment on the delays.\nNo matter where it is  the numbers speak for themselves: 260 Model 3 cars off the production line. Even with an S-Curve  it\u2019s is hard to imagine that in fewer than three months   Tesla  will rocket to 20 000 a month.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Ideas for research projects can germinate from the least likely moments  as when a student asked  Firearms Trainer Tom Aveni  if he'd ever visited the ACLU's website. He hadn't (\"Why would I even want to go there?\")  but out of curiosity he did.\nNot only did the ACLU statistic turn out to be not as far off as he imagined but  Aveni  has made other unexpected discoveries - pertaining especially to hit ratios  low-light shootings  multiple-officer confrontations  mistaken judgment calls and less-lethal technology - that have convinced him police firearms training needs a significant overhaul.\nDr. Bill Lewinski  executive director of the Force Science Research Center at Minnesota State University-Mankato  says that by pursuing \"important and different kinds of questions \"  Aveni  has produced \"valuable new insights into officer-involved shootings.\" His findings are expected to provide \"a cutting-edge demographic foundation\" for upcoming research projects at FSRC that hopefully will result in \"profound changes in law enforcement training in the future.\"\nAn ex-cop with 23 years' training experience   Aveni  now heads the Police Policy Studies Council  a research  training and consulting corporation based in Spofford  NH  and is a member of FSRC's National Advisory Board  as well as a busy expert witness in police litigation. Like other trainers   he  says   he  \"made a lot of assumptions that are not true\" until  his  research provided \"an epiphany for  me \" about some of the nuances of police shootings.\n He  was struck first by how tough it is to find out anything meaningful on the subject from law enforcement agencies. Most don't compile detailed data on their shootings  fearing in some cases (perhaps rightly) that it would be misinterpreted and misused by the media and \"agenda activists\" if available. Of the few departments that do collect deadly force information  \"even fewer freely share it \" Aveni claims. If they don't outright suppress it  they tend to present it in bare-bones  \"sterilized table formats\" that have no standardized consistency and that \"make detailed analysis difficult.\"  Aveni  observes: \"The devil is in the details  and the details of police shootings have always been lost.\"\n Aveni  spent more than 6 months dissecting that material according to different variables. That information  combined with limited statistics  he  managed to obtain related to shootings on other major departments  including New York City  Baltimore County (MD)  Miami  Portland (OR) and Washington (DC)  has allowed  him  to spotlight a number of deadly force subtleties that have not been so thoroughly examined before.\nFor example  it has long been believed that officers overall have a dismal 15-25 percent hit probability in street encounters  suggesting truly poor performance under the stress of a real shooting situation. Actually  this figure  while essentially true in the aggregate  is markedly skewed by certain shooting variables   Aveni  found.\nDuring a 13-year span  the Baltimore County PD  which  Aveni  regards as one of the best trained in the country  achieved an average hit ratio of 64 percent in daylight shootings - not ideal  but clearly much better than commonly believed. In shootings that occurred in low-light surroundings  however  average hits dropped to 45 percent  a 30 percent decline. The data from Los Angeles County (LAC) reveals a somewhat comparable 24 percent decline.\n\"Until this research \"  Aveni  says  \"performance has never been accurately matched to lighting conditions \" even though as many as 77 percent of police shootings are believed to occur under some degree of diminished lighting. Some departments tally \"outdoor\" versus \"indoor\" shootings  but most appear not to precisely differentiate between low-light and ample-light events  despite the preponderance of shootings during nighttime duty tours.\nA multiple-officer shooting  in which more than one officer fires during a deadly force engagement  has an even greater influence on hit probability   Aveni  discovered.\nMultiple-officer shootings   Aveni  told Force Science News  are three times more likely to involve suspects with shoulder weapons than single-officer shootings. This tends to \"increase the typical stand-off distance \" he says. Many of these confrontations also embody fast-changing  chaotic and complex circumstances. These factors  Aveni believes  help explain the negative impact on accuracy.\n Aveni  also discovered a correlation between multiple-officer shootings and number of rounds fired.\nWith LAC shootings involving only one officer  an average of 3.59 police rounds were fired. When 2 officers got involved  the average jumped to 4.98 rounds and with 3 officers or more to 6.48. \"The number of rounds fired per officer increases in multiple-officer shootings by as much as 45 percent over single-officer shootings  \" Aveni  says.\nThe ACLU's statistic that got him started on this project turned out to be based on fatal shootings that occurred before the landmark Supreme Court decision Tennessee v. Garner  when nearly half the states still legally permitted the shooting of any fleeing felon  regardless of the threat he or she presented. After the restrictions imposed by Garner  \"you'd expect fewer unarmed suspects to be shot \"  Aveni  explains.\nNot necessarily true  though   Aveni  found. In a recent 12-year period  Metro-Dade (Miami) PD reported 34 shootings in which suspects were \"clearly unarmed\" or in which officers thought they saw a gun but none was found. All told  about a third of all shootings in which suspects were shot and killed by that agency's officers were considered \"questionable.\" In a recent Texas study  25 percent of suspects shot by officers in one metropolitan county were found to be unarmed  33 percent if shots fired at moving vehicles are included. LAC's data put the unarmed target figure at 18 percent  well below the ACLU's pre-Garner assertion.\nHigher or lower  many of these shootings are \"mistake-of-fact\" (MOF) situations   Aveni  says. Usually a suspect is displaying an item that is falsely but reasonably perceived to be a deadly weapon (a cell phone  for example)  or the suspect is behaving in such a way that in context is believed to constitute an immediate lethal threat (making a fast  furtive movement toward the waistband  for instance).", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Botticelli  struggled even to answer questions on the subject.\nOperating within these political and legal constraints   Botticelli  and others adopted more nuanced approaches to their work. The office pushed to obtain more federal funding for treatment. It supported states that sought to route those addicted to illegal substances like opioids away from the criminal justice system and into treatment.  Botticelli  supported the Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to shed the more onerous drug war era initiatives such as requiring mandatory minimum sentences for even low-level drug possession.\nLater in that interview   Botticelli  was asked about legalizing marijuana  not just decriminalizing penalties for its use.

He left his favorite firecracker in Argentina.\" In 1997  even before the Monica Lewinsky scandal  Letterman joked about a near-collision involving Air Force One: \"Thank God no one was injured  though a flight attendant was thrown from President Clinton's lap.\"\n And sometimes Letterman goes too far. In June  he apologized to Sarah Palin for a joke about her daughter getting \"knocked up\" by Yankees star Alex Rodriguez. After hesitating for several days  Letterman said: \"I told a joke that was beyond flawed  and my intent is completely meaningless compared to the perception.\"\nLetterman joked about a near-collision involving Air Force One: \"Thank God no one was injured  though a flight attendant was thrown from President Clinton's lap.\"\n And sometimes Letterman goes too far.

Admit it: You thought  Mark E. Smith  would be the last to go. And in a way   he  was the last to go \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when the punk legend died on Wednesday  after 40 years leading the U.K. band the Fall   he  took most of the world's bile with  him . \"There are 12 people in the world \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the rest are paste  \" Smith  snarled in  his  1981 anthem \"The Classical \" and nobody's sure if  Smith  ever met the other 11. Somehow  he  was only 60  but  he 'd never seemed young. The \"Hip Priest\" had the most evil sneer in rock & roll  punctuating  his  rants with a sarcastic \"aaaah\" to give every word a serpentine hiss.  He  hired and fired dozens of bandmates  notoriously terrorizing anyone foolish enough to join  his  band  yet no matter who was in the Fall  you could always recognize them instantly \u00e2\u0080\u0093  he  stuck with  his  signature jagged guitar groove for life. Every time  Mark E. Smith  spat on the ground  another 10 bands rose up  and  he  hated every one of them.\nRelated The Fall: 10 Essential Songs Hear highlights from late  great post-punk malcontent  Mark E. Smith's  sprawling four-decade discography\n Mark E. Smith  was legendary as the most cantankerous bastard in town \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and  his  town was Manchester. In  his  dozens of Fall records   he  created  his  own wonderful and frightening (but especially frightening) world.  He  stayed mean right up to the end. \"People still cross the road from me; I've still got that \"  he  said in  his  final interview. \"I can clear a pub when I want to. It's a talent.\" If there's a punk heaven   Mark E. Smith  is already on  his  third drummer.\nIf  his  huge and sprawling catalog seems too daunting to explore  it's easy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 start with \"The Classical \" a song that sums  him  up perfectly  from the 1981 masterwork Hex Enduction Hour  a monster groove with two drummers and crazy bass. \"Hey there  fuckface-aaaah! Hey there  fuckface \u00e2\u0080\u0093 aaaah!\"  Smith  announces at the outset; it's  his  way of welcoming you in.  He  harangues away with insults (\"This is the home of the vain! There is no culture!\")  complaints about how it all sounds too pretty (\"too much romantic here\")  bad jokes (\"I just left the Hotel Amnesia ... where it is  I can't remember\")  advice (\"Kill  it ! Kill  it !\") and cultural commentary: \"You won't find anything more ridiculous than this new profile razor unit  made with the highest British attention to the wrong detail.\" At the end  the song explodes into the sarcastic chant  \"I never felt better in my liiiiife\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he makes it terrifyingly true.\n Smith  was a working-class lad who left school at 16 to become a Salford dockworker who read voraciously by night. Then  he  heard the Sex Pistols  decided  he  could do better  and began one of punk's longest  strangest careers  a hard-drinking left-wing literary autodidact and self-proclaimed \"Prole Art Threat.\" \"The difference between you and us is that we have brains \"  he  told the crowd on an early live album.  He  set the tone for  his  whole career with early anthems like \"Totally Wired\" (\"I drank a jar full of coffee and then I took some of these\") and \"Repetition.\"  He  was notoriously fond of lager  whiskey  speed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead's Lemmy  who  he  resembles in so many ways   he  thrived at a chemical pace that would have turned anyone else to slush.\nWhen a rock star dies  other musicians line up to share affectionate memories of their warmth and compassion. This will not happen to  Mark E. Smith .  He  famously fired a soundman for ordering a salad. (In  his  defense   Smith  said \"the salad was the last straw\"  dismissing  his  ex-bandmates as \"dickheads who couldn't hold their beer and needed to get home to Cheshire.\")\n He  scared away so many musicians  the journalist Dave Simpson wrote a 2008 book called The Fallen compiling their horror stories \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of them quit by escaping from the van on the freeway during a snowstorm.  He  liked to dismantle  his  bandmates' equipment onstage  just to keep them from getting too slick.  He  fined  his  drummer five pounds every time  he  hit the tom-tom. On  his  disastrous 1998 visit to New York  the band disintegrated into an onstage fistfight that ended with  Smith  in jail for a couple of days.\nBut no matter how legendary  his  offstage personality  it was  his  music where  Mark E. Smith  truly became the stuff of nightmares. You can spend years exploring  his  catalog without coming close to figuring this guy out. The Fall hit their stride with the perfect 1980 EP Slates  in blurts like \"Leave the Capitol\" and \"Fit and Working Again!!\" At one point on Slates   he  orders the band  \"Don't start improvising  for God's sake.\" (When Pavement made Slanted and Enchanted  their future label boss Gerard Cosloy praised them in in his zine Conflict as \"a Slates tribute band\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the ultimate compliment.) \"The only thing real is waking and rubbing your eyes \"  he  announced in \"How I Wrote Elastic Man.\"\n His  music took a totally unexpected turn in the early Eighties when  he  arrived home with a young American bride on  his  arm. Brix Smith was a blonde California art girl who was glam  tuneful  flashy and a few dozen other things that Mark E. Smith wasn't. They were perfect for each other  as her eccentric pop flair fit  his  caustic two-chord minimalism. They meshed beautifully in the 1983 Perverted by Language \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially in \"Hotel Bloedel \" where her doomy crooning meets his slang-king snarl over droning violin for a profoundly creepy sound.\n Smith  kept churning out music right to the end.  He  made 30 albums  or 31 or 32 or something like that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 part of the fun in being a Fall fan was knowing that  even Smith  wasn't keeping score. Despite  his  rigorous ethic  they varied widely in quality  especially in the Nineties  after Brix left and things got dark. The Infotainment Scam was mind-blowingly bad in that \"influenced by acid house in 1990\" kind of way  while 1994's Middle Class Revolt was a hearty blast with \"You're Not Up to Much.\"  He  remained a legendary crank \u00e2\u0080\u0093 check out  his  infamous 2007 interview on the U.K. chat show  Transmission  where the poor host tries a harmless question about why  he 's so tough on  his  bandmates. \"People seem to go a bit crackers when they're around  me  \"  he  says with a straight face. \"I'm a nice fellow  as you can see.\"\nWhen the jazzman Chet Baker died in 1988  art critic Dave Hickey paid tribute by pointing out that Baker \"died with gigs left to play  thus deserving the freelancer's ultimate epitaph: 'If This Dude Wasn't Dead  He Could Still Get Work.'\"  Mark E. Smith  went that one better:  He  died with gigs still getting cancelled on  him . The Fall had an oft-delayed  oft-rescheduled string of NYC shows booked for February at Brooklyn's Baby's All Right; they sold out instantly  even though literally nobody thought these shows would ever happen. Here's to  Mark E. Smith   a lesson for us all in how to remain magnificently yourself and unshakably tough. A man made with the highest British attention to the wrong detail.

Manny Pacquiao had a hat perched jauntily on his head  a bandage wrapped neatly around his right ear. His real work done for the night  he was heading down the Las Vegas Strip to sing a few songs with his band.\n \"Of course  you have to buy tickets for the concert \" Pacquiao said.\n Not a problem. Anyone who watched Pacquiao cement his place in boxing lore Saturday night by giving Miguel Cotto a terrible beating would have gladly paid a few more dollars to see him in action again  even if it was with a microphone in his hands.\nAnyone who watched Pacquiao cement his place in boxing lore Saturday night by giving Miguel Cotto a terrible beating would have gladly paid a few more dollars to see him in action again  even if it was with a microphone in his hands.\n Across an ocean  a grateful country celebrated the kind of hero they never dreamed possible. For a few brief hours the devastation of a typhoon was forgotten  and even the Filipino army took a break from chasing rebels to cheer Pacquiao on.\n They used to have him as their own. Not many people outside the Philippines paid much attention to the little fighter with the big hands even as he kept moving up in weight over the years and winning belts by the handful along the way.\n But now they're going to have to share Manny Pacquiao. Greatness comes with a price  and it's hard to argue that Pacquiao hasn't now earned a spot among boxing's greats.\n Maybe not Muhammad Ali great  as promoter Bob Arum was trying to claim when he said Pacquiao was better than any fighter he ever promoted  including Ali. But it's Arum's job to build Pacquiao up  especially with negotiations for a possible megafight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. expected to begin this week.\n Still  no fighter had ever won titles in seven different weight classes  even in an era where titles are as common as platinum blondes in the MGM Grand casino. And no fighter in recent times has had the kind of year Pacquiao wrapped up by stopping a game but outclassed Cotto 55 seconds into the 12th round of their welterweight title fight.\n He leaped into the global boxing consciousness 11 months ago by making Oscar De La Hoya quit  giving him such a beating that he retired. He followed that by knocking Ricky Hatton stiff in the second round with a left hand that left Hatton contemplating his mortality.\n And then came Saturday night  when he put on six more pounds to fight the supposedly bigger and harder punching Cotto. It looked early as if it may have been a mistake  with Cotto controlling the action in the first round with a sharp jab and accurate punches.\n Bad advice. Less than a minute into the third round  it was a right hand from Pacquiao that put Cotto down for the first time. He was up quickly and the two continued battling at a frenzied pace late into the fourth round when Pacquiao threw a huge left hand as Cotto was moving forward and dropped him for the second time.\n Cotto was never the same after that and Pacquiao was relentless in administering a beating that sent blood flowing down Cotto's face  staining his white trunks. By the ninth round he was taking such punishment that his wife and young son got up from their ringside seats and left the arena  unable to watch any further.\n Once again  Pacquiao had not just beaten a world class fighter  but systematically dismantled him. He did it in his usual -- and very unusual -- style  bouncing in and out and throwing punches from all angles in a frenetic style never before seen in boxing.\n When it was all over  Pacquiao had another belt and his large entourage probably had a few more members. Cotto had inflicted some damage of his own  marking up Pacquiao's face and causing his right ear to require a bandage  but Pacquiao wasn't going to miss his own party.", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

The greatest Bears player since their iconic Super Bowl XX team more than three decades ago received the highest NFL honor Saturday when  Brian Urlacher  was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nUrlacher  39  becomes the 28th Hall of Famer to represent the Bears for all or the primary portion of their careers  the most in the NFL  and the first since defensive end Richard Dent was inducted in 2011. Urlacher and Lewis bring to 28 the number of modern-era linebackers in the Hall. Five of those 28 were Bears  a nod to the history of the position for the franchise from George Connor to Bill George  Dick Butkus  Mike Singletary and now  Urlacher .\n\u201cIt\u2019s unreal \u201d  Urlacher  said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great tradition.\u201d\nSelected ninth in the first round of the 2000 draft   Urlacher  becomes the first Hall of Fame playerfrom the University of New Mexico.  He  was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and was an established star before coach Lovie Smith arrived in 2004 with a scheme that accentuated  Urlacher \u2019s freakish athletic ability for a player with such a large frame \u2014 6-foot-4  258 pounds. The next year  he  was named the league\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year  becoming the fifth player to win both awards. The next season  in 2006   Urlacher  helped lead the Bears to Super Bowl XLI.\nNamed to the NFL\u2019s All-Decade Team of the 2000s   Urlacher  was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times and was first team All-Pro five times. In 13 seasons  according to pro-football-reference.com   he  amassed 1 354 tackles  41\u00bd sacks  22 interceptions  two touchdowns  90 passes defensed  11 forced fumbles and 15 fumble recoveries.\nPersonnel boss Mark Hatley made the decision to draft Urlacher  who had played safety in college. The Bears knew they were getting a player who could transform their defense but initially weren\u2019t sure how to deploy  him .\n\u201cWe knew we would like to play  him  at the mike (middle) linebacker  but the problem was  he  had been a safety  and we didn\u2019t want to stick  him  there right away and beat  him  up and lose  him  and ruin an excellent prospect \u201d defensive coordinator Greg Blache said. \u201cWe started  him  off at the sam (strong-side) linebacker position  where everything is coming at you from one direction in the traffic  and we played  him  at the mike in the nickel situation  where 95 percent of it was passing. So  he  was getting a feel for it but  he  wasn\u2019t getting in the heavy traffic with the guards coming on  him  and combination blocks \u2026 because it\u2019s a whole different beast when you\u2019re playing 12 to 15 yards deep as a safety and you move up to 5 yards from the line of scrimmage with the 300-pounders.\n\u201cWe knew we had something special and we knew  he  would be a guy who would be a hell of a player for a long  long time if we had some patience and were just judicious in how we approached it. Having (linebackers coach) Dale Lindsey there was a huge help because Dale had developed so many linebackers and he was a great voice in saying he had seen rush jobs when guys were put in situations they weren\u2019t quite ready to handle. It ended up working out really well just because we got him eased into it to the point where he was comfortable seeing it all happen.\u201d\nIt happened faster than anyone would have imagined  which in retrospect isn\u2019t surprising to anyone who was involved. Lindsey marveled at the amount of information  Urlacher  could process and then apply on the field. A lot of players  even really good ones  can lose the fine details when they move from the meeting room to the practice field and then into games  but  Urlacher  absorbed it all.\nWhen middle linebacker Barry Minter was sidelined with a back injury in the third week of the 2000 season  the Bears moved  Urlacher . They never again discussed where  he  was best suited to play or what  he  could handle.\n\u201c(Head coach) Dick Jauron said  \u2018Put  him  at the middle \u2019 \u201d Lindsey said. \u201cDick could see the big picture. Luckily for us  Brian was more than willing to learn the new position. It\u2019s nice when you have rare talent and a guy who wants to do it. That\u2019s the difference between the real great players \u2014 they want to do it and they\u2019ll do anything to be successful. He was like a sponge. You just kept giving him information and he absorbed it and would want more. The thing about the guys with the rare talent: They can do any damn thing you ask them. You can ask them the impossible and they can get it done. And Brian did it for us as a great middle linebacker.\u201d\nWhen the Bears signed massive defensive tackles Ted Washington and Keith Traylor in 2001   Urlacher  raised  his  game to a new level as the duo kept offensive linemen off of  him  and allowed  him  to make plays with  his  remarkable speed.\n\u201cThere are a lot of guys who can run fast in a straight line  but the athleticism  he  showed for a guy that size  off the charts \u201d Blache said.\nHe spearheaded the \u201cMonday Night Miracle\u201d at Arizona in 2006 with 25 tackles and a forced fumble that resulted in a touchdown.  Urlacher  had five interceptions and five sacks in 2007  a testament to  his  ability to do anything needed.\n Urlacher  was never very comfortable in the spotlight but always at ease around  his  teammates  which made  him  immensely popular.  He  treated the newest rookie the same way  he  did the most tenured veterans. When former teammate Todd Johnson became a high school coach in Sarasota  Fla.  he didn\u2019t have enough uniforms to dress all of his players.  Urlacher  provided new jerseys \u2014 home and away \u2014 for the entire roster and did so without seeking any attention  one of countless anecdotes of how  he  helped friends.", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

No one is arguing that diet is less than extremely important to health and well-being  but seemingly everyone is arguing as to what constitutes the best diet. \"A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature  predominantly plants  is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention.\" The voices that carry the farthest over the sea of diet recommendations are those of iconoclasts\u00e2\u0080\u0094those who promise the most for the least  and do so with certainty. Amid the clamor   Dr. David Katz  is emerging as an iconoclast on the side of reason. At least  that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how  he  describes  himself . From  his  throne at Yale University's Prevention Research Center  where  he  is a practicing physician and researcher  said sea of popular diet media is the institution against which  he  rebels. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that nutrition science is corrupt  just that the empty promises of memetic  of-the-moment diet crazes are themselves junk food. To  Katz   they  are more than annoying and confusing;  they  are dangerous injustice. Scientific publisher Annual Reviews asked  Katz  to compare the medical evidence for and against every mainstream diet.  He  says they came to  him  because of  his  penchant for dispassionate appraisals. \"I don't have a dog in the fight \"  he  told me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care which diet is best. I care about the truth.\"\n Katz  and Yale colleague Stephanie Meller published their findings in the current issue of the journal in a paper titled  \"Can We Say What Diet Is Best for Health?\" In it  they compare the major diets of the day: Low carb  low fat  low glycemic  Mediterranean  mixed/balanced (DASH)  Paleolithic  vegan  and elements of other diets. Despite the pervasiveness of these diets in culture and media  Katz and Meller write  \"There have been no rigorous  long-term studies comparing contenders for best diet laurels using methodology that precludes bias and confounding. For many reasons  such studies are unlikely.\" They conclude that no diet is clearly best  but there are common elements across eating patterns that are proven to be beneficial to health. \"A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature  predominantly plants  is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention.\" Katz  Meller/Annual Reviews Among the salient points of proven health benefits the researchers note  nutritionally-replete plant-based diets are supported by a wide array of favorable health outcomes  including fewer cancers and less heart disease. These diets ideally included not just fruits and vegetables  but whole grains  nuts  and seeds. Katz and Meller found \"no decisive evidence\" that low-fat diets are better than diets high in healthful fats  like the Mediterranean. Those fats include a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids than the typical American diet.\nThe Mediterranean diet  which is additionally defined by high intake of fiber  moderate alcohol and meat intake  antioxidants  and polyphenols  does have favorable effects on heart disease  cancer risk  obesity  metabolic syndrome  and \"is potentially associated with defense against neurodegenerative disease and preservation of cognitive function  reduced inflammation  and defense against asthma.\" They also found carbohydrate-selective diets to be better than categorically low-carbohydrate diets  in that incorporating whole grains is associated with lower risks for cancers and better control of body weight. Attention to glycemic load and index is \"sensible at the least.\" Eating foods that have high glycemic loads (which  Katz  says is much more relevant to health outcomes than glycemic index\u00e2\u0080\u0094in that some quality foods like carrots have very high indices  which could be misleading) is associated with greater risk of heart disease. Finally  in a notable blow to some interpretations of the Paleo diet   Katz  and Meller wrote  \"if Paleolithic eating is loosely interpreted to mean a diet based mostly on meat  no meaningful interpretation of health effects is possible.\" They note that the composition of most meat in today's food supply is not similar to that of mammoth meat  and that most plants available during the Stone Age are today extinct. (Though it wouldn't surprise me to learn that Paleo extremists are crowd-funding a Jurassic Park style experiment to bring them back.)\nJust because  Katz  is not one to abandon  his  scientific compass under duress of passion does not mean  he  is without passion  or unmoved by it in  his  own ways. The subjects of media headlines and popular diet books are dark places for  Katz . \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just linguistic  I really at times feel like crying  when I think about that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re paying for ignorance with human lives \"  he  told me. \"At times  I hate the people with alphabet soup after their names who are promising the moon and the stars with certainty. I hate knowing that the next person is already rubbing his or her hands together with the next fad to make it on the bestseller list.\" \"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an excellent idea  and yet somehow it turns out to be extremely radical.\" \"The evidence that with knowledge already at our disposal  we could eliminate 80 percent of chronic disease is the basis for everything I do \"  Katz  said. Just as  he  was finishing  his  residency in internal medicine in 1993  influential research in the Journal of the American Medical Association (\"Actual Causes of Death in the United States\") put diet on a short list of the lifestyle factors blamed for half of deaths in 1990. \"Here we are more than 20 years later and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made just about no progress.\" A nod to the fact that popular media is not totally lost   Katz  borrows from the writer Michael Pollan  citing a seminal 2007 New York Times Magazine article on \"nutritionism\" in concluding that the mantra  \"Eat food  not too much  mostly plants\" is sound. \"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an excellent idea  and yet somehow it turns out to be extremely radical.\"", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

In the venal world of college football   Paterno  built a reputation as a coach who valued integrity over winning \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuccess with Honor\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his motto \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and now he stood accused of covering up for a pedophile to protect his public image.\nIn including  Paterno   Freeh had gone further than prosecutors  who would charge the administrators with crimes but said they did not believe  Paterno  participated. In defending his conclusion  Freeh cited \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most important evidence in the case\u00e2\u0080\u009d: a chain of emails between the three administrators from 2001.\nA newspaper with the headline rewritten was left near a statue of  Paterno  outside Beaver Stadium on Jan. 23  2012  the day after he died.

(Matt Rourke/Associated Press)\nThe emails showed the men planned to report Sandusky to child welfare authorities but changed course after Curley met with  Paterno . Instead  they banned Sandusky from bringing children to Penn State and informed the Second Mile of the incident. Sandusky was convicted of assaulting four boys after this incident.\nIn an email  one trustee urged then-Penn State president Rod Erickson to tear down the statue of  Paterno  outside the stadium  if it would pacify the NCAA.\nEleven days after Freeh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s news conference  the NCAA announced that Penn State had entered into a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsent decree \u00e2\u0080\u009d accepting a $60 million fine and the erasing of all of Paterno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wins after 1998  the year Sandusky was investigated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but cleared \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by Penn State police and a state child welfare agency. Freeh had concluded  Paterno  should have suspected then his assistant was a pedophile.\nPenn State students protested the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handling of the Sandusky scandal.

But that's incredible.\"\nThe U.S. did go on to investigate the idea of a nuclear-powered missile   Geist  says. Known as the Supersonic Low Altitude Missile  the idea was more like a nuclear-powered drone aircraft. \"It was actually supposed to fly around autonomously and drop nuclear gravity bombs \"  Geist  says.\nThe nuclear reactor that would keep SLAM aloft would also spew radioactive exhaust   Geist  says. At the time  that was advertised as a feature  not a bug  because it would have had the added benefit of polluting the Soviet countryside.\n\"It was supposed to be really  really dirty \"  Geist  says.\nThe U.S. got as far as actually building the nuclear engine for Project Pluto  a development project at the Nevada Test Site. The reactor was tested a number of times in the early 1960s  and it performed well. But by that point  awareness had grown about the dangers of nuclear fallout  and arms control treaties were coming into place   Geist  says. Those concerns were among the reasons the project died in 1964.\nThe type of reactor used in Project Pluto was particularly messy because it exposed the nuclear fuel directly to the outside air.  Geist  says the new Russian missile may use a different system that keeps the fuel somewhat isolated from the air. But   he  quickly adds  that wouldn't make it safe.\n\"There are a bunch of different ways to do it  and frankly  they're all terrible \"  Geist  says.\n He  suspects that the Russian design would involve what's known as a \"fast reactor \" which is more efficient  but also less safe  than most nuclear reactors. If the missile crashed or the reactor failed  it would trigger a major incident.\n\"It's just crazy they field-tested this thing \"  he  says.\n Geist  says  he  expects Russia's provocations to continue. \"They're sending us a message that they are not OK with our U.S. missile defense posture \"  he  says.\nThat message? \"They're willing to go full Strangelove on us \"  Geist  says.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Mr. Kasanoff started Threshold in 1992.

He  worked with IBM for on-demand processing power off site  an early precursor to cloud computing that  Mr. Kasanoff  predicted would save the production millions in operating expenses.\n He  also decided that  he  would produce and direct  despite never having supervised a full-length animated feature.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c His  approach  because  he  had gotten the money for it  and no one could say no to  him   was very idiosyncratic \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kenneth Wiatrak  a layout artist on the project. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know from day to day what would occur.

He  wanted to direct it like a live-action movie  complete with retakes  motion-capture performances and more spontaneity. As a result   he  and animators were speaking two different languages.\nA roving  Mr. Kasanoff   animators said  would request that things be \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore awesome\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009c30 percent better\u00e2\u0080\u009d and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why someone trained in texture couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do modeling work.

The result was subdued  with eyes appearing vacant or looking in the wrong direction.\nIn 2005  Threshold secured roughly $20 million in additional financing through private investors represented by StoryArk  a financing firm that had been impressed by the brand tie-ins  the celebrity voice cast and a new distribution deal Mr. Kasanoff had struck with Lionsgate.

A Rasmussen survey in November showed Patrick at 33 percent  Baker at 28 percent  and Cahill at 25 percent.\n Political analysts said Patrick is trying to more actively define Baker in the minds of voters before Baker can introduce himself on his own terms.\n \"Given the Rasmussen poll today essentially showing a dead heat  it's clear that Governor Patrick really has to step up and go on offense more  not only touting what he's done  but go on offense against his real challenger in this race  and that's Charlie Baker \" said Mary Anne Marsh  a Democratic political strategist. \"It signals a stage in this race  and it shows you we'll see an even more aggressive Deval Patrick going into the spring and the summer.\"\n The Patrick campaign has been honing two main lines of attack against Baker as it looks toward the November election. One is to tie Baker to the exorbitant cost increases of the Big Dig  whose finances Baker helped oversee as the top budget aide to governors William F. Weld and Paul Cellucci in the 1990s.\n \"They talk about why it is they can't help but charge double-digit increases every year to small businesses and families \" Patrick said. \"Those small business and families don't have a voice at the table. They have my voice at that table.\"\n Baker's running mate  Senate minority leader Richard R. Tisei  Republican of Wakefield  joined Alcivar in dismissing Patrick's comments as a political ploy. \"The governor is really electioneering  instead of taking a more thoughtful approach \" he said.", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

What is known for sure about  American military scientist Frank Olson  is that on November 28  1953  the bacteriologist and father of three plunged to  his  death from the thirteenth floor of the Statler hotel in New York City  not long after  he  was secretly drugged with LSD on the orders of  his  CIA superior. Whether  Olson  was pushed  or jumped  or was nudged into committing suicide remains unclear. But indeterminacy with a generous side of conspiracy is catnip to director Errol Morris  who has made either a 241-minute film or a six-part television series depending on where and how you plan to watch it  about the tragedy's long reach into  Olson 's family and America's secretive political culture.\n Olson 's death  and the murk surrounding its cause  cast a defining shadow over the life of his son Eric  whose endless quest to find out what happened that night has pre-empted all other endeavors. The blight spread around his family. His mother became an alcoholic with  the film implies  the active encouragement of one of her husband's colleagues. But Eric  now in his sixties  has arguably been completely derailed by the tragedy. He is the central focus of Wormwood  a hybrid blend of documentary and Cold War thriller that makes The B-Side  Morris's loving portrait of radical photographer Elsa Dorfman earlier this year  look almost straightforward.\nMoving back and forth between the 1953 events and 1975  when a Rockefeller commission confirmed that an army scientist had been purposefully drugged with hallucinogens   Wormwood carries us from secret meetings at Deer Lake through the long tail of misery and obfuscation left by  Frank 's death  to Eric's pursuit of the truth all the way to the corridors of power.\nIn hushed and menacing re-enactments  Peter Sarsgaard  whose mild manner lends itself to all kinds of tonal nuance  charts the decline and fall of  Olson   a patriotic team player whose growing unease about his agency's secretive involvement in biological warfare overseas first worries his boss (a reptilian Tim Blake Nelson) and then moves him to seize the day and use his hapless employee as a guinea pig. By the time  Frank  arrives at the hotel flanked by ambiguously supportive colleagues  he's rapidly unraveling into a gibbering wreck.\nWormwood's breathless  hopped-up style harks back to Morris's 1988 The Thin Blue Line  which called into question a murder verdict and resulted in the release of a wrongly convicted suspect from Death Row. Here the noir markers are writ so large as to verge now and then on self-parody. Morris keeps returning the action to the hotel to act out different angles and competing versions of what happened to  Olson  that night. The hypothetical range between possible perps \u00e2\u0080\u0094  Frank 's boss  his friends  two wordless thugs in fedoras  a CIA allergist played by a sinister Bob Balaban \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is narrow enough to make these scenes a touch repetitive if you're watching in one sitting. Certainly they underscore Morris's standing as a lifelong participant observer of American paranoia. For which  it must be said  there is undeniable fodder in the manner of Olsen's going  the secrecy surrounding his death  the ambivalent admissions the Rockefeller Commission along with a dwindling financial settlement that looks suspiciously like hush money to  Olson  and to Morris  and the merrily chuckling presence in old footage of two well-known knowns  Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney.\nFor all the formal beauty of the re-enactments  the most compelling scenes in Wormwood are the unembellished interviews that Morris \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ordinarily an off-screen interlocutor with an appetite for the subtly leading question \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is seen conducting across a table with Eric Olson  who waves his arms around with the befuddled intensity of a superannuated schoolboy as he tells his story. Articulate and charming  Eric is a talented collage artist who seems to have sacrificed career and significant relationships to his endless search for justice and truth  even after the case was officially closed and after he contacts investigative reporter Seymour Hersh  who first reported the drugging of  Olson  in The New York Times. Grandiose as always  Hersh insists that  he knows who murdered Frank Olson   but won't say for fear of compromising an anonymous source. We can't tell whether  he 's fibbing either.\nA romantic view \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I wouldn't entirely put this past Morris \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is that  Olson  is  like  his  interlocutor  an artist with a magnificent obsession that sustains  him  even when it's doomed to failure. But in Wormwood  he  emerges with enormous poignancy as a tragic figure  perpetually stuck in limbo like the father we see tumbling  over and over  to  his  fate.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

We have some news now on how the Trump administration is pushing back against illegal immigration. The administration has for months talked about separating immigrant families at the border as a way of discouraging them from coming in the first place. A federal lawsuit filed on Monday says federal agents are increasingly doing that  and the idea has outraged activists. The plaintiff is an undocumented Congolese woman who's being detained in San Diego while her 7-year-old daughter is being held 2 000 miles away at a shelter in Chicago.  NPR's John Burnett  has the story.\n JOHN BURNETT   BYLINE: In recent years  the Department of Homeland Security has attempted to discourage asylum-seekers from coming to the U.S. Under Obama  they detained some unauthorized families in camps in South Texas rather than release them in the U.S. while their cases are heard. The Trump administration has gone even further. It has arrested immigrant parents in the U.S. who paid smugglers to bring their children across the border  and it wants to expand detention space. Now comes the most extreme measure yet  family separation.\n BURNETT : That's Lee Gelernt  deputy director of the ACLU's National Immigrant Rights Project. He's representing a 39-year-old mother who traveled from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Mexico with her 7-year-old daughter. They surrendered to immigration agents near San Diego in December. They said they were fleeing violence in Congo and asked for asylum. She's being held apart from her daughter. They're only able to speak by phone.\n BURNETT : A spokeswoman for Homeland Security declined to give a reason why the child was taken from her mother  saying only the agency does not comment on cases under litigation. The practice of separating undocumented families to discourage them from coming is not a formal stated policy of the administration  but immigrant activists say it's been quietly growing in frequency along the Southern border. Katharina Obser is with the Women's Refugee Commission.\n BURNETT : Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services has documented 53 incidents of family separation in the last nine months  mostly Central Americans. They say they're fleeing rampant gang violence. But the administration believes most of them are gaming the system  and it wants to stop the flow  first  because the trek is dangerous for young children. And  second  Matt Al Bent's  an official with ICE removal operations  told NPR...\n BURNETT : Immigration lawyers say the strategy could work. Mothers may drop their cases and go home to be reunited with their children. But is that a reasonable way to curtail illegal immigration? Dr. Lisa Fortuna  director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Boston Medical Center  is an expert on the impact of trauma on immigrant families. She's submitting an amicus brief in the ACLU lawsuit.\n BURNETT : The lawsuit claims that immigration agents violated the Congolese woman's constitutional right to due process. It asks the government  if it's going to detain a mother and child during the asylum process  at least allow them to be together.  John Burnett   NPR News.

Novelist Emma Cline  is counter-suing  her  ex-boyfriend's suit against  her  alleging that  she  plagiarized  her  2016 bestseller The Girls from his own work.\n Cline 's novel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which features a 60s-era Manson-like cult as seen from the perspective of its followers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stuck around for 12 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and is the first installment in a three-book Penguin Random House deal that reportedly topped $2 million.\nThe former boyfriend  Chaz Reetz-Laiolo  alleges  Cline  installed spyware on her computer before selling it to him in order to record keystrokes on the computer. \"Using the spyware \" the complaint says  \"she obtained his email password  which she then used to access and systematically surveil his private email obsessively over a period of years.\"\nHowever  Emma Cline's complaint calls this \"a ludicrous theory\" and counters with the claim that this is just the latest in a \"two-year assault on  Cline \u00e2\u0080\u0099s mental health and literary reputation\" from an abusive Reetz-Laiolo. Any alleged plagiarism  the complaint states  is limited to a \"few brief phrases or facts \" which are not subject to copyright protection and which don't appear in the published version of the novel. Both parties are requesting the case go to trial.\nMost plagiarism cases are tough to prove  and this one is made harder by both the lack of evidence and lack of copyright protections available for most of the instances of alleged plagiarism cited by Reetz-Laiolo. So why file the complaint at all? The initial 15-page letter first sent to  Cline  in February 2017 by Reetz-Laiolo's law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP might hold a clue: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe [. . .] that it may be fruitful to engage in a confidential negotiation or mediation to determine whether our clients can reach a resolution with you rather than file our complaint \u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter states.  Cline 's argument doesn't mince words when concluding what the fruitful resolution that interests Reetz-Laiolo could turn out to be  stating his actions were \"undoubtedly in the hope of a financial windfall.\"\nOne element that both parties can agree on:  Cline  did install spyware on  her  computer. According to  her  complaint   she  installed it while they were together because Reetz-Laiolo used it and  she  wanted to confirm his infidelity. Reetz-Laiolo's argument that  she  tracked his email address after selling him the laptop in 2013  after they were no longer together  hinges on the assumption that  she  somehow updated this software to allow  her  to remotely access it.\nDavid Boies  the founder of the Boies Schiller Flexner firm  was named as an attorney in the February 2017 letter to  Cline   according to a New Yorker article on the firm  though his name does not appear in the complaint filed by Reetz-Laiolo.

( CNN )  Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad  has been named the prime ministerial candidate for the country ' s opposition in the next elections   completing a stunning return to politics at the age of 92 . The doctor   who served 22 years as the country ' s leader before retiring in 2003   is determined to topple the party he once led -- and in his quest to do so   has joined forces with his arch nemesis   former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim   whom he once jailed for corruption and sodomy . The former leader told CNN in an exclusive interview that his return to the political spotlight is down to his determination to oust the current prime minister   Najib Razak . \" I think it ' s a job I have to do . I cannot accept this country being destroyed by selfish people who only think about themselves ... who steal money  \"  Mahathir  told CNN last week . Malaysia ' s next elections will be held before August 2018   with many people widely expecting it to occur sometime in March . \" They [ the political opposition parties ] have not been able to get rural Malay votes  \"  Mahathir  said   explaining the rationale behind the opposition ' s decision to welcome  him  into their pact . \" They had a majority of popular votes in 2013   but they were not able to get [ the ] constituencies with Malay voters .  Mahathir  has made a bad habit of sniping at those who stepped into  his  shoes as prime minister . Post - retirement   Mahathir criticized  his  anointed successor Abdullah Ahmad Badawi incessantly from the sidelines . But that is nothing compared to the energy and viciousness with which  he  has torn into Najib . Mahathir   who said he attacked his successors because ' they were doing wrong things  ' told CNN he doesn ' t mind \" being used by the opposition \" to oust Najib   who for years has been embroiled in accusations that hundreds of millions of dollars were stolen from state investments . The US Justice Department filed lawsuits in 2016   amended earlier this year   to recover more than $ 1 . 7 billion that prosecutors said were laundered through a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund headed by Najib . JUST WATCHED Malaysian prime minister Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Malaysian prime minister 12 : 19 Besides the United States   several other countries are investigating state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad ( 1MDB )  which Najib founded . US justice officials said that between 2009 and 2015   more than $ 3 . 5 billion from 1MDB was misappropriated by high - level officials of the board and associates . Najib has been accused of siphoning money from the investment fund after $ 681 million was transferred into his accounts . He has consistently denied any wrongdoing and said the money was donated by a member of the Saudi royal family . The 1MDB scandal   rising costs of living and a growing rift among the country ' s multiracial   multi - religious populace have been often blamed on Najib ' s party   and the question now is   can Mahathir   the former leader   help the opposition boot the ruling government from power ? Mahathir and Anwar : From friends to foes and now   friends again The opposition in Malaysia is weaker now compared with the last election in 2013   when the Barisan Nasional coalition led by Najib limped to the finish line   losing the popular vote and failing to snag a two - thirds majority in parliament . Embroiled in internal squabbles and sullied by scandals of their own   the opposition for the longest time could not even agree on who would lead the country should they win the elections . Cue the strange alliance between  Mahathir  and Anwar   who is back behind bars after being found guilty of sodomy a second time in 2015 . The opposition convention on Sunday declared that while  Mahathir  would be their candidate for prime minister at the next elections   Anwar would assume the position if they manage to upset Barisan Nasional at the polls and Anwar is able to obtain a royal pardon for his sodomy conviction   which disqualifies him from contesting the elections or holding office . Dr Mahathir was interviewed by CNN at his office in Putrajaya on Tuesday   Jan 2   2018 Anwar ' s wife   Wan Azizah Wan Ismail   is the candidate for the deputy prime minister role . In his interview with CNN   Mahathir praised Anwar   a man he ' d once mentored and then maligned   fired and incarcerated . Mahathir said they are putting aside a bitter rivalry to focus on defeating Najib and United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO )  the Najib - helmed party that forms the largest constituent in the Barisan Nasional coalition . \" It is to get rid of this government . He [ Anwar ] wants to get rid of Najib and I want to get rid of Najib  \"  Mahathir  told CNN . \" If you want to get rid of Najib we have to work together . We have to forget the past .\" \" I am 92 going on 93  \"  Mahathir  pointed out . \" I won ' t last long and I am prepared for that . But for as long as I can contribute   I will continue   and I will back Anwar if that is the wish of the party .\" Can  Mahathir  bring in the votes ? Analysts are split over whether  Mahathir  has the x - factor needed to oust Barisan Nasional   which has ruled uninterrupted since the country ' s independence in 1957 . Wan Saiful Wan Jan   chief executive of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur   said  Mahathir  clearly has influence   judging by how quickly the opposition accepted  him  .  Mahathir  \" has the capabilities to bring in and influence people ... just like Anwar  \" Wan Saiful said . \" He is very attractive among the rural voters who feel Pakatan Harapan ( the opposition pact ) has not been defending the rights of the Malays  \" he said   referring to the country ' s majority race   which forms the bulk of the electorate . Wan Saiful added that support for the opposition is growing   especially in states where Barisan Nasional rules . \" Regardless what you think of the opposition   people want democracy to flourish . There are those who may disagree with  Mahathir  returning to active politics   but for the sake of democracy they feel UMNO must lose  \"  he  says . However   Jayum Jawan   a professor of government and politics from Universiti Putra Malaysia   feels differently and said  Mahathir  ' s shelf life as a politician has ended . \"  He  will have no impact on the election . The opposition has not been able to penetrate rural areas as the people there seem comfortable with what the government has done for them . Rural voters want stability  \"  he  says . '  He  has done a lot of damage ' While opposition leaders have welcomed Mahathir   some rank and file politicians remain skeptical . S . Manikumar   an opposition politician   said many party members are reluctant to back Mahathir openly because policies drafted during his reign favor the Malay majority at the expense of ethnic Chinese and Indian nationals . \" He has done a lot of damage in the past 30 years . He has no doubt developed the nation but many still view him as a racist  \" Manikumar said . \" The Indians   for one   were marginalized during his tenure as policies were not in their favor .

Charles Santiago   an opposition Member of Parliament   said the opposition needs a strong personality like Mahathir to lead its mission . \" Many say the country is headed in the wrong direction and we need someone strong from the Malay community to counter Najib  \" he said . \" Dr Mahathir is our top dog right now .

Alvin Kamara can do it all . ( Bill Feig / AP ) In the weeks and months leading into the 2017 NFL draft   New Orleans Saints Coach Sean Payton watched several running backs work out in person . He separated them into tiers   ranking them in order of preference . He inspected a small   jitterbug - quick back from North Carolina A & T   Tarik Cohen   and came away wanting to draft him . Just above Cohen   though   was another back Payton studied in a private workout . When the draft came and rolled into the third round   Payton seized the chance to trade up   into the 67th overall pick   and draft  Alvin Kamara  .  Kamara  has erupted   becoming the most explosive player on one of the league \u2019 s best teams and the clear favorite for rookie of the year .  He  has rushed for 606 yards   caught 60 passes for another 614 yards and scored 11 total touchdowns . The manner in which  Kamara  plays is instructive   a sign of where NFL offense is headed .  Kamara  is a running back comfortable taking on the duties of a wide receiver .  Kamara  may be the idealized version of a versatile back   but there are more like  him  on the way . The Panthers drafted Christian McCaffrey eighth overall as much for  his  receiving ability as  his  running ability   and they have attempted 90 passes to  him    tying Devin Funchess as Cam Newton \u2019 s most frequent target . The Chiefs \u2019 Kareem Hunt   despite slowing after a monstrous start to the year   has caught 39 balls for 347 yards . Dalvin Cook caught five passes for 72 yards in a game before being injured for the season . Cohen   the player Payton bypassed for Kamara   has been a key cog in Chicago \u2019 s passing game . And that is only a sampling of rookies from this season . While Ezekiel Elliott primarily succeeded by bruising behind the Cowboys \u2019 stellar offensive line last season   Dallas felt comfortable drafting him fourth overall because of his ability to run every route proficiently \u2014 head personnel executive Stephen Jones pointed out that Elliott had played slot receiver as a sophomore in high school .

But many running backs may be better viewed as skill players . The Steelers \u2019 Le \u2019 Veon Bell might be the best running back in football   but he can also line up wide . He caught 75 passes in 12 games last year   and he has another 61 catches already this season . The usage actually led to a contract dispute \u2014 Bell held out all of training camp because he wanted to be paid like a receiver . It may not be the last time the issue arises . In the NBA   the Golden State Warriors popularized the concept of positionless basketball   employing five players with skill - sets varied enough to capitalize on any opponent \u2019 s weakness or mitigate any strength . This NFL season has seen some offenses attempting to play positionless football . The New England Patriots are part of the vanguard . This offseason   they added Rex Burkhead   a powerful runner who had once played slot receiver for the Bengals   in free agency . They combined him with James White and Dion Lewis   and Tom Brady has targeted them a combined 111 times . The Patriots could motion any of White   Lewis or Burkhead out of the backfield   or just line them up as a receiver . The Patriots often employ two on the same play   bedeviling defenses that must decide which personnel to match them with . \u201c It depends how the defense wants to treat you  \u201d White said . \u201c If they want to treat me like a receiver   maybe they \u2019 ll put a [ defensive back ] on me . If they want to treat me like a running back   maybe they put a linebacker in . It all depends how the defense wants to match up against you . It \u2019 s really up to the defense .\u201d [ The Seahawks \u2019 upset of the Eagles shook the entire NFC playoff field ] White has seen more pass attempts than any Patriot after Brandin Cooks and Rob Gronkowski . In the Super Bowl last year   he caught 14 passes for 110 yards . Now in his fourth season   White came out of a run - heavy system at Wisconsin   but he said he played wide receiver in Pop Warner and other leagues growing up . Once in the NFL   he felt comfortable being used a variety of ways . \u201c More college teams started doing that   splitting the back out wide  \u201d White said . \u201c It translates in the NFL .\u201d The tide is not stopping . Saquan Barkley caught 47 passes for 594 yards this season at Penn State   and he will certainly be the first running back taken next April   likely among the top five picks . Coaches will be scouring workouts as Payton did last season   looking for the next Kamara .

Gordon is Neutral . In the film  which is set in Chicago  as he and  Emily  begin seeing each other and falling in love  Kumail's parents still expect that he will enter into a traditional arranged marriage. Rather than hurt his parents and risk being cut off from his family  he keeps his relationship with  Emily  a secret. Meanwhile   Emily  is diagnosed with a life-threatening infection that requires  her  to be put in a medically induced coma.  Emily 's parents and Kumail spend time together at the hospital sizing each other up as they worry about  Emily . The coma may sound like a fictional contrivance  but it really happened. Let's start with an early scene from \"The Big Sick\" in which Kumail and Emily first meet. He's just done a set at a small comedy club. He walks to the bar where he sees the woman who yelled out a woo-hoo during his set.\nKAZAN: (As  Emily ) I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed (ph) you. It's supportive.\nKAZAN: (As  Emily)  So if I yelled out  like  you're amazing in bed  that'd be a heckle?\nNANJIANI: Yeah  they had to take pressure off of  Emily 's body. So they would put some of the vital functions on machines so that  her  body wasn't taxed. I remember when I got to the hospital   Emily  was in the E.R. And I went in  and I was talking to  her . And the nurse came in. And the nurse - first thing  she  said to -  she  was holding reports and  she  said to me - or to  Emily   she  said  oh  you're a very sick girl.\nAnd I was like  what does that mean?  She  doesn't really look that sick.\nGROSS: Kumail  did you talk to  her  while  she  was in coma?\nGROSS: So you know  I've always wanted to ask this to someone.  Emily   what's it like when you come out of coma? Like what - what's the first feeling that you have?\nNANJIANI: I think that might be an appropriate term.  Emily  mentioned that people were coming in to say hi to  her . That was because  Emily  was by far the youngest person in the ICU at that time. So all the family members of all the other patients were very aware of  Emily . So they were all kind of rooting for  her . And so they were very excited. They were very excited when  she  was up because they just wanted  her  to get out of the ICU.\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us  my guests are Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon. They're married  and they co-wrote the new romantic comedy \"The Big Sick\" that's based in part on their relationship. And one of the parts of the movie that is true is that after they started seeing each other   Emily  had to be put in a medically induced coma because  she  had such a raging infection that they had to do that.\nAnd I actually recently found one of my mom's emails to me. And it was during the period that  Emily  and I were dating. And reading the email chain was kind of devastating because I saw how I was clearly leading them on and letting them think that I was going to do it. Honestly  at the time  I couldn't imagine a world where I did have an arranged marriage. And I couldn't imagine a world where I didn't have an arranged marriage.\nGROSS: Kumail  how did you tell your parents about  Emily ?\nNANJIANI: So I did while  she  was really sick. It had been - I forget  you know  what day it was or when it was. And I sort of remember where I was. My mom - my parents had been calling me just sort of to say hi to me all week. And I hadn't been answering the phone. And then one day when - you know  because being in the hospital was a rollercoaster.\nNANJIANI: In the moment  her reaction was is she - what's wrong with her? Is she going to be OK? Are you OK? And then she sort of checked up on  Emily  every day  called me every day. And then as soon as  Emily  was out of the coma  that's when she got really angry. She was like  how could you do this to me? But while  Emily  was sick   she  just wanted to make sure  Emily  was OK. And then  she  got angry later.\nGROSS:  Emily   was it an issue in your family that you were marrying a Pakistani man  you know  an immigrant who was Muslim? I don't know what religion you are if any at all. But was that an issue?\nGROSS: Kumail Nanjiani and  Emily V. Gordon  speaking to Terry Gross last year. He's the star and they're the co-writers of the movie \"The Big Sick \" which is nominated for an Oscar as best original screenplay. We'll hear more of their conversation in the second half of the show. And we'll also remember Wesla Whitfield  the cabaret singer who died recently at age 70. I'm David Bianculli  and this is FRESH AIR.\nBIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli  in for Terry Gross  back with more of Terry's 2017 interview with Kumail Nanjiani and  Emily V. Gordon . They're the co-writers of the movie \"The Big Sick \" which is nominated for an Oscar as best original screenplay. He also stars in the film  which is based on their real-life relationship and how they first met and became a couple. Kumail grew up in Pakistan  came to U.S. to attend college and stayed. When he and  Emily  were falling love  he knew his parents wanted him to have an arranged marriage with a woman who was Muslim and Pakistani.", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

For about 140 people over the past six years  the soft Texas drawl of Charles Thomas O'Reilly was the last voice they heard before they died.\n Some did leave an impression  although the only name that came immediately to mind for O'Reilly was Frances Newton  who in 2005 became the third woman executed in Texas in modern times. She was the only woman executed under O'Reilly's watch.\n \"One guy  he cracked jokes  he cracked jokes through the whole thing \" O'Reilly said. \"I can't remember his name.

They know why they're here. ... It's weighing kind of heavy on them. One way or another  it's weighing heavy on everyone here.\n Few condemned inmates balked when the \"time\" arrived  O'Reilly said.\n \"We've had some tell us: 'I'm not going to fight  but I'm not going to walk '\" he said. \"We picked them up and carried them. Ninety-nine percent of them  they walked on their own.\"\n He told inmates they could say whatever they wanted in their last statement  but it must be in English -- \"That's all I understand \" he said -- and it can't be profane. If the obscenities start  so do the drugs.\n \"He's got about 15 seconds to do all the cussing he wants to and it will be all over \" O'Reilly said. \"It is going to be the last thing they're going to say. It ought to mean something. Most of the statements are pretty decent. They apologize to the victim's family and tell their family they love them.\"\n The Huntsville Unit was the 11th stop in a career that took O'Reilly to prisons from one end of Texas to the other beginning in January 1977.\n Edward Smith  a warden who worked as an assistant under O'Reilly  called him \"a natural leader.\"\n Although he has no qualms about capital punishment  O'Reilly would prefer to remembered for other aspects of his career. He figures he's worked with about three generations of prison staff and sees some of the grandchildren of people who were there when he started.\n \"The things I want to stand out in my career  my past  isn't executions \" he said.", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

The first time I saw Titanic  my father left the theater in the middle of the movie to get a haircut. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice he was gone. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conscious of any reality but Titanic  even though I already knew exactly what was going to happen. One of my friends had briefed me on what to expect:  Jack  and Rose fall in love  the ship sinks  and  Jack  finds a piece of wreckage floating in the sea and helps Rose clamber onto it  saving her from the freezing death that claims him before the lifeboats return for survivors. But it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair  my friend explained: It was obvious to her that there was room for them both. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter that I knew exactly what was coming. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about anything else while the movie played. And even when the lights came up and I realized my father was missing  his absence didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to matter much. I was 9  but I already understood he had a habit of wandering off when he got bored. I was even used to it. What was new was this feeling: that I had to get back to Titanic as soon as possible. The credits were barely rolling as I began to strategize my next viewing. I knew that the movie had completely devastated me  and I knew that all I wanted was to be devastated again. But why? Viewers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many of them adolescent and preadolescent girls like me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would go back to Titanic over and over again while it was in theaters. It was the No. 1 movie in the US for 15 consecutive weeks  a feat that has yet to be surpassed  and likely never will be. Well before it was released  James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion project became notorious as the most expensive movie ever made  with a final budget of $200 million. Then it became the first movie in history to earn $1 billion at the box office. And it achieved this success despite months of advance press claiming that the movie was all but doomed; despite the widespread belief that James Cameron  who previously helmed the Alien and Terminator franchises  had no business trying to tell a story about love; and despite the fact that Titanic  in a way that is now all too easy to forget  is an immensely difficult movie to watch. When Titanic was released on video in September 1998  its 3 hours and 14 minutes had to be split across two VHS tapes. The same studio heads who were convinced Titanic could only recoup its budget at best (success was almost mathematically impossible) had seen its gargantuan runtime as just one of its many liabilities. Critics also pointed to its ungainly length as proof of its failure to play by the rules: It was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbloated leviathan \u00e2\u0080\u009d a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbehemoth \u00e2\u0080\u009d and a tiresome epic that  according to the Washington Post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Desson Howe  left viewers \u00e2\u0080\u009cthinking the unpardonable thought: \u00e2\u0080\u0098OK  sink already.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length was also bad news for movie theaters  since it meant they had to schedule fewer showings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and sell fewer tickets \u00e2\u0080\u0094 than they could with a normal movie. After screening Titanic for a test audience in Minneapolis  however  executives at Paramount and Fox  which had jointly financed the production  began wondering if  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s folly might not be a disaster of Waterworld proportions. The audience laughed and cheered and gasped at all the right moments  and gave the movie and its characters astoundingly high ratings on the survey cards they filled out after the showing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt went well \u00e2\u0080\u009d a Fox executive said cagily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot great  but well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When all was said and done  Titanic had cost a little over $1 million per minute of screentime  and it was sometimes hard for studio executives to look at the movie  Cameron  described as a way to honor the disaster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victims without wondering just how much this history lesson would end up costing them.  Cameron  had been dreaming of Titanic since Robert Ballard located the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remains in 1985 (\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be goddamned!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ballard exclaimed as Titanic loomed into view  a line  Cameron  later borrowed for  his  own characters). After watching National Geographic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s special on Ballard in 1987   Cameron  made a few notes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo story with bookends of present-day [wreckage] scene...intercut with memory of a survivor...needs a mystery or driving plot element.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Cameron  had always loved diving and deep-sea exploration  and The Abyss   his  third film as director and sole writer  had been a love letter to both. But that was fantasy; Titanic was real. And when  Cameron  first decided to pursue the project  the prospect of going to the wreck of Titanic might have been incentive enough to pitch the movie. When  he  first met with 20th Century Fox Chairman Peter Chernin to discuss Titanic  in the spring of 1995   he  asked for $2 million to fund a deep-sea expedition. It was an amazing sum of money to the Russian scientists and submersible pilots who took  Cameron  to the wreck. It was nothing compared to Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final price tag. When Titanic opened in theaters across the US  on the weekend of Dec. 19  1997  it became the No. 1 movie in America by the skin of its teeth  edging out the latest James Bond movie  Tomorrow Never Dies  by a margin of $3.5 million. But to the executives who had nervously overseen Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and watched its budget nearly double  from $110 to $200 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly encouraging news. For Titanic to earn a profit  executives calculated  it would have to attract viewers in utterly unprecedented numbers: Even if it sold more tickets than Dances With Wolves  the most profitable three-hour-long movie ever released  Fox would still be $70 million in the red. And to be a success? It would have to somehow repeat its $28 million opening-weekend ticket sales \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and stay the No. 1 movie in America \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for weeks and weeks in a row  in a way no movie had in nearly a decade. It would have to be more than just a movie. It would have to become a cultural obsession. And it did.  Cameron  had once \u00e2\u0080\u0094 optimistically  as the final budget reflected \u00e2\u0080\u0094 called Titanic \"a $190 million chick flick.\" By Jan. 31  1998  20th Century Fox estimated that 7% of all American teenage girls had seen the movie twice. They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only ones going back to see Titanic a second time  and perhaps a third  though they did receive the most press. In 1997  the average return viewer rate for a theatrically released movie was 2%. Meanwhile  Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was 20%. In February 1998  a survey found that 76% of Titanic's repeat viewers still planned to see it again. It made more money \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $32 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 during its 11th weekend in theaters than it did during its first. (It helped that this weekend also happened to fall on Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day.) Theaters that previously worried about losing money on a movie they could screen only two or three times a day started squeezing in showings as early as 8 a.m. and as late as midnight  letting out satisfied viewers at 3:30 in the morning. Adults  people with families  responsibilities  and jobs  flocked to see Titanic. Because for a little while \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for 3 hours and 14 minutes  to be precise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the rest of their lives disappeared. Titanic gave people a way to make the rest of their lives disappear  and so they kept coming back  and finding that the world  James Cameron  had created for them still felt just as real as it had the first time. What made Titanic not just a movie  but a destination? And what did it take to will such a world into solid reality?\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the night before shooting starts \u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate Winslet wrote in her diary on Sept. 15  1996  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand here I am  all pin-curled up and hungry  ready to go. Thinking about Rose. She was so young. I need to think about her childhood  her youth  and find my way through the 17 years of her life. I'll never sleep tonight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The next morning  Winslet added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo sleep. This is it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 My life is not my own and probably never will be \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that's Rose talking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seven months of production  the line between Kate and Rose would sometimes blur \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but it had been that way from the beginning. After she auditioned for the part  and  Cameron  left her waiting as  he  deliberated casting  Winslet tracked  him  down on  his  car phone  reaching  him  when  he  was on the freeway. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand \u00e2\u0080\u009d she told  him . \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am Rose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And she was. Kate Winslet was 20 when she began filming Titanic  and spent her 21st birthday shooting  Jack \u00e2\u0080\u0099s death scene. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were lying there on the raft  sort of shivering together \u00e2\u0080\u009d she told Rosie O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Donnell while promoting the movie  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I said \u00e2\u0080\u0098Leo  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my birthday today.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he said  \u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great  sweetie.

In the same Rosie appearance  Winslet said she and Leo had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe naughty children on the set \u00e2\u0080\u009d and remembered how  while filming the scenes where  Jack  and Rose waited for the lifeboats to return after the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sinking  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeo would sometimes say to me  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sweetie  sweetie  I gotta pee.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go  \u00e2\u0080\u0098So have I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d They would pee in shifts  taking turns swimming over to another part of the tank \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which was about the most romantic gesture anyone could get either of them to recall from Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set  though people tried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gorgeous \u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate Winslet told Vanity Fair  around the time Leomania became a bona fide pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd to me  he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just smelly  farty Leo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t called on to talk about his sex appeal  Winslet sang DiCaprio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s praises as an artist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gifted from God  as far as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m concerned \u00e2\u0080\u009d she told O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Donnell.

He won his first TV roles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after being kicked off the set of Romper Room  at 3 years old \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in The New Lassie and Parenthood. He was good at playing junior-high heartthrobs and squeaky-clean sons  but the more he got cast in those parts  the less interested in them he seemed to be. By the time he was cast as Jack Dawson  Leonardo DiCaprio had already been nominated for a best supporting actor Academy Award for his role as the title character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developmentally disabled younger brother  Arnie  in What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eating Gilbert Grape. Initially  director Lasse Hallstr\u00c3\u00b6m had believed DiCaprio was too handsome for the role \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a judgment born out by the fact that fan mail for him was already streaming onto the set of Growing Pains. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I was doing Growing Pains I had quite a teen following \u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio said in a 1993 interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor a while  I was third in fan mail or something like that. To tell you the truth  I don't like that. Being the hunk-of-the-month annoys me. ... I don't care about being a star. Anybody can be a star with a little makeup and a music video. I'm concerned about being an actor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  James Cameron  knew  he  wanted DiCaprio to be  his  Jack Dawson  but DiCaprio didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be  his   Jack . When DiCaprio auditioned for the role   Cameron  later remembered   he  first refused to read a scene with Kate Winslet  then \u00e2\u0080\u009cread it once  [and started] goofing around.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After that   Cameron  said  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could never get  him  to focus on it again. But for one split second  a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio had never played a character like  Jack  before: one who forced  him  to be  so relentlessly  in the light. Instead   he  had spent  his  early career playing roles like the heroin-addicted Jim Carroll in 1995\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Basketball Diaries  and Arthur Rimbaud (\u00e2\u0080\u009cyoung  gorgeous  and deranged\u00e2\u0080\u009d) in Total Eclipse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you do that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio said of  his  role in Titanic  even after filming had ended. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was asking Jim  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we add some dark things to  his  character?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And  he  was like  \u00e2\u0080\u0098No  Leo  you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just wasn't used to playing an openhearted  free-spirited guy \u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio told the Los Angeles Times shortly after the Titanic premiere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI've played the more tortured roles in the past. It was difficult to be someone closer to 'me' than anyone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis character doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go through torment \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  later said of the role  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Leo previously  and subsequently in his career  was always looking for that dark cloud. ... [It was] only when I convinced him [this] was actually the harder thing to do that he got excited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Titanic represented a new challenge for  James Cameron   too. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t his first romantic movie (try listening to the love theme from The Terminator sometime)  but it was the first movie he had ever made where a love story served as the primary dramatic engine. When he pitched Titanic to Fox Chairman Peter Chernin in 1995  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who had cracked into the big leagues after making 1984\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Terminator  and had seen his sequel  Terminator 2: Judgment Day  become the highest-grossing movie of 1991 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 found himself in the odd position of trying to sell studio executives on exactly the kind of movie they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he could make. \"They were like  'Oooooohkaaaaaay \u00e2\u0080\u0099\" he later told Paula Parisi  author of Titanic and the Making of  James Cameron . \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098A three-hour romantic epic? Sure  that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets  shoot-outs  or car chases?' I said  'No  no  no. It's not like that.'\" Yet  James Cameron  was  in a sense  a natural choice for the helm of a romantic epic:  He  knew how to translate love into action. From the beginning   his  heroes and heroines had been made powerful by their ability to love  and by love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to instill in them greater strength than any opponent could hope to defeat. The Terminator ends with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) speaking gently to her unborn son as she drives into a mounting storm; in Aliens  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) balances a little girl on one hip and a flamethrower on the other; and in Judgment Day  the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)  programmed to protect the adolescent John Connor  tells John \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know now why you cry\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he destroys himself to save the future of humanity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Better Worlds\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the space conglomerate slogan on display in James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Aliens  but it could just as easily apply to the worlds  Cameron  builds in  his  movies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or rather  the worlds  he  allows to come into being  by stripping away the rules as they have always previously applied. In The Terminator  Terminator 2  and Aliens  this idea seems to go hand in hand with getting rid of men \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Titanic follows this example. Even if men aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actively oppressing women  Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movies suggest  they still have a way of holding women back from doing what they need to. Even if all you want is to save John Connor  you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still a product of Skynet. The best protection you can offer the world is to leave it.\nBefore filming even began   Cameron  knew  his  $110 million budget projection was only an educated guess. To begin with  Fox would have to build a brand-new studio from the ground up  something neither it nor any other major movie company had done since the 1930s. No one knew how much it cost to do that kind of thing anymore \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to say nothing of the price tag for conjuring the past with computer-generated effects so brand-new that their final cost was also impossible to estimate. But if anyone could make Titanic work  Fox executives felt  it was  James Cameron . He had made Terminator 2  from script to premiere  in 13 months: He shot the movie six days a week  and on the seventh day  he edited. (Crew members somehow found enough time away from their grueling production schedule to make shirts reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scare me  I work for  James Cameron .\u00e2\u0080\u009d) He liked to say he had won his first directing gig \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for Piranha II: The Spawning  the sequel to a Jaws knockoff \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because he convinced producers he could make mealworms writhe on command. (He had called \u00e2\u0080\u009cAction!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then electrified them with an AC current.) He had a reputation as a miracle worker  and he encouraged it. How else could you convince a roomful of businessmen to give you the money you needed to project your dreams and nightmares directly into the American mind? The question was just how much this dream was going to cost.  Cameron  asked for $125 million to make Titanic. Fox Chairman Peter Chernin balked  and told  Cameron   he  could make the movie  he  had first pitched as \u00e2\u0080\u009cRomeo and Juliet on a boat\u00e2\u0080\u009d if  he  could have it ready for a July 1997 release  and keep the budget to $110 million.  Cameron   perhaps believing this might really be possible at the time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and perhaps also figuring it was better to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission \u00e2\u0080\u0094 said  he  could do it  offering to forfeit $4 million of  his  own salary to squeeze under the line. Almost as soon as Titanic went into production  it began to go over budget. In 1996  shooting a typical action blockbuster \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a Batman Forever or a Tomorrow Never Dies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 cost an average of $100 000 to $150 000 a day. Titanic averaged between $225 000 and $300 000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and this was after construction ended on the brand-new 40-acre movie studio  Cameron  needed to film it.  He  had considered locations all over the world  and ultimately decided on a spot 15 miles south of the border  in Rosarito  Mexico. Workers needed 10 000 tons of dynamite to blast a hole in the coastline big enough for the 17-million-gallon open-air tank \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the largest ever built \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that  Cameron  needed to hold  his  ship. And in a detail that becomes noteworthy when the movie in question is so concerned with the politics and hierarchies of labor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Titanic never for a moment lets you forget that the captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleasure in his \u00e2\u0080\u009cunsinkable\u00e2\u0080\u009d ship is powered by the sweat of the stokers in the hold  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Cameron  shot Titanic in Mexico in part to keep labor costs down. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is NAFTA at work!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tom Sherak told journalists who visited the set.)\nLess than halfway through its seven-month shooting schedule  the movie had gobbled up nearly three-quarters of its budget  and showed no signs of slowing down \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and  Cameron  seemed unwilling to make it slow down. So  Paula Parisi writes in Titanic and the Making of  James Cameron   the studio did its best to persuade  him . One night in the fall of 1996  20th Century Fox President Bill Mechanic visited  Cameron  onset during his 2 a.m. lunch hour  a schedule necessitated by the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endless night shoots. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom a financial standpoint \u00e2\u0080\u009d Mechanic told him  \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis film is wildly out of control. Nothing is going to change that. All we can do now is contain it. So here are some scenes we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like you to cut from the shooting schedule.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  studied the list of scenes  and immediately refused to cut any of them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you want to cut my film \u00e2\u0080\u009d  James Cameron  told the president of Fox  \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to fire me  and to fire me you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to kill me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he stormed off set. The scenes stayed in the picture. Mechanic had little choice but to relent: No other director could manage all the moving parts Titanic required. When  Cameron  asked Peter Chernin to fund  his  submersible expedition to Titanic   he  wanted not just to see the wreck himself  but to film it in a way that would allow viewers to feel they were there with  him . Doing so would also allow  him  to do Bob Ballard one better: Ballard may have found the ship  but  he  had only been able to capture video of it with  his  underwater remote operating vehicle  Jason. (Ballard had also initially wished to keep Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location secret.)  Cameron  might not be shooting Titanic first  but  he  was going to do it right.  His  engineer brother  Mike \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the only Cameron boy who finished college \u00e2\u0080\u0094 developed a titanium-encased film camera capable of independently withstanding the pressure of the ocean floor  and of capturing images of Titanic as it had never been seen before. Each dive would cost $25 000  and could record only 10 minutes of film. Some of the footage  Cameron  brought back from Titanic appears in the movie. Some is recreated. But what  Cameron  also seems to have brought back from those dives was a new sense of humility about the task before  him . After  his  second trip to Titanic   Cameron  told Paula Parisi  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just sat there  and I just started to cry  thinking about the dive and everything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seen and experienced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Later   he  wrote in James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Titanic: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat night I realized that my project  my film  was doomed to failure if it could not convey the emotion of that night rather than the fact of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d More and more  it seemed to  him  that  he  could only let viewers experience Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sinking by letting them fully experience the ship itself \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and  he  could only do that by recreating it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to be able to say to an audience  without the slightest pang of guilt: This is real \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  wrote of Titanic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what happened. Exactly like this. If you went back in a time machine and stood on the deck  this is what you would have seen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Second Officer Lightoller would be over there \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and Wallace Hartley would be leading the band in a lively waltz just there  a few yards away \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [and] slaloming between these immovable pylons of historical fact are  Jack  and Rose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In this way   Cameron  wrote  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe film comes full circle  from being a film about Titanic  to being a love story that happens merely to be set on Titanic  back to being about the emotional truth of Titanic after all. By feeling the fear  the loss  the heartbreak of  Jack  and Rose  we finally can feel for the 1 500.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After seeing Titanic for the first time  Harry Knowles compared the experience to traveling to the past through self-willed hypnosis  like the hero of Somewhere in Time. Titanic experts who visited Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set had the same experience in the flesh.  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s devotion to history was exacting  and at times excruciating: Every possible detail  from the davits used to lower the lifeboats to the carpet in the first-class dining saloon (recreated  all 18 000 square feet of it  by the same company that had manufactured the original)  was identical to what Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passengers would have seen. When the furniture being artificially aged for a scene recreating the wreck didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look quite right to  Cameron    he  spent a day and a half working on the props himself. ( He  was supposed to be finishing the screenplay at the time.) \u00e2\u0080\u009c Cameron  wanted real wallpaper and things like that \" the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head of physical production  Fred Gallo  recalled. \"I said  'Why don't you build the sets and have them paint on the wallpaper? No one will ever know.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d But  Cameron  would. Thousands of props  from ashtrays to teacups to forks  had to be stamped with the White Star Line emblem  even if it was impossible for viewers to see. The costumes alone cost $8.4 million. The chandeliers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be Lucite   Cameron  decided  because then they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t chime ominously as the ship began to tilt; they would have to be crystal  just as they had been in 1912. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere should be a little brass sign right here that says \u00e2\u0080\u0098Push \u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  said apologetically to Ken Marschall  as he led the Titanic expert through a doorway on D deck during a set visit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was one delight after another \u00e2\u0080\u009d Marschall said of his time on Titanic. But he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to work there.\n\"You don't just join one of his films \" editor Mark Goldblatt said of  James Cameron . \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou sign on for a tour of duty.\" On Titanic  two-thirds of the shoot had to be done at night  and even the cast sometimes worked 20-hour days. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing could have prepared me for it \u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate Winslet later said. Night after night  as Titanic sank again and again  she and Leonardo DiCaprio had to struggle through water pumped in straight from the ocean. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bet people will think it's heated \u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote in her diary  \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it isn't.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The crew watched actors vigilantly for signs of hypothermia. (Later  they would begin heating the water  even though Winslet had believed the cold would make her performance more authentic). \"I chipped a small bone in my elbow  and at one point I had deep bruises all over my arms \" Kate Winslet told the Los Angeles Times once Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arduous shoot was over. \"I looked like a battered wife.\" Filming underwater close-ups  where Winslet had to be weighted in a tank while completely submerged  terrified her.  Cameron   she wrote  \u00e2\u0080\u009cwouldn't have made me do that if I didn't say  \u00e2\u0080\u0098No  I'm okay.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\" But even though it was a highly supervised set  with safety divers everywhere  she sometimes felt like she was drowning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake after take \u00e2\u0080\u009d Winslet wrote in her diary  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI reminded myself that I wanted to be part of this. I will not admit defeat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNo one would. Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budget continued to swell as  Cameron  continued to fall behind schedule  and its release date was pushed back from July to December. Fox shunted Speed 2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which some executives had higher hopes for  anyway \u00e2\u0080\u0094 into the summer release slot Titanic was meant to fill. It flopped  and Titanic plunged ahead  its budget once rising by $20 million in the space of two chaotic weeks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot think of one crew member who didn't say  'I've had it \u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d first assistant director Sebasti\u00c3\u00a1n Silva said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut no one walked.\" As far as  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s temper went  Kate Winslet said  \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe actors got off lightly. I think Jim knew he couldn't shout at us the way he did to his crew because our performances would be no good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny idiot could figure this out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d This  Paula Parisi wrote  was a standard  Cameron  response to crew members who couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make his vision a reality fast enough. He raged at workers and he raged at executives and he seemed sometimes to want  more than anything  to simply be able to do every single job on Titanic himself. When the ice arrived  in hundred-pound blocks   Cameron  picked up an ax and started chopping  preparing it for the scene where it was to splinter off the iceberg and fall onto the deck. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGetting over their initial disbelief \u00e2\u0080\u009d Paula Parisi wrote  \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe crew followed suit. ... Giving up his ax   Cameron  stepped back and watched for thirty seconds  then  he  just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand it anymore.  He  pushed a puny guy aside  taking  his  ax. It was just too much fun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron   Parisi wrote  was \u00e2\u0080\u009cshowing that he knew full well the film was going to be hard work  but no one would work harder than he would.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maybe. But Titanic  Parisi also observed  \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a factory \u00e2\u0080\u009d and it had only one product:  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s dream. Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recreation of the ship itself contained 300 tons of steel  bolted together  at a breakneck pace  by 30 laborers. The wardrobe department needed 8 000 separate articles of clothing to dress the extras for the Southampton scene alone. Every time  Cameron  sank the first-class dining saloon  and raised it again for another take  crew members spent the next workday drying carpets  righting furniture  collecting 1 800 pieces of flatware off the floor  and recreating Titanic all over again. Titanic had one boss and hundreds of workers  and though it amassed superlative after superlative in terms of monetary costs well over a year before it even reached theaters  its cost in terms of human labor may be yet more staggering. What does it feel like to surrender seven months of your life  for nearly every waking hour of the day  to one man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision? What does it do to you? What makes you stay?\nFor the laborers and extras hired in Rosarito  it probably had something to do with the pay; for the crew  it probably had something to do with the prestige; for the cast  it probably had something to do with the exposure. But among the cast and crew members who described not just the tortuous process of making Titanic but their own dedication to the film  a shared conviction is always present: They were doing something real  and they could feel it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very important to me in life \u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate Winslet said while Titanic was in production  \u00e2\u0080\u009cis [that] through having a relationship with somebody and loving that person and being allowed to feel the whole emotion of love despite all of the risks  you can find out who you are. And when Rose meets  Jack  she cuts through all of the class and money nonsense and connects with something real and alive and passionate in  his  soul. And when I read the script I was in floods of tears  because it takes you to the point where you would do anything \u00e2\u0080\u0094 absolutely anything \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to stop that ship from sinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Titanic felt real \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if it was real \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then perhaps this painfully conjured time travel was the only way to make  Jack  and Rose  and the love between them  become real as well.  James Cameron  spent the summer of 1997 in an at-home editing room darkened by blackout curtains  faceting the dream  he  had now poured years of  his  life into. In late July   he  took a day off to marry Linda Hamilton   his  girlfriend of seven years  in a backyard ceremony. The next day   he  went back to  his  editing suite  and back to Titanic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaped to  his  editing machine \u00e2\u0080\u009d Entertainment Weekly reported in November 1997  \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a suicide device \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a razor blade with the simple instruction \u00e2\u0080\u0098Use only if film sucks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOn TitanicShack \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the many websites and forums that sprang up after the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release as outlets for people confronted by the grim fact that they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend every single day in the theater  watching Titanic again and again \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fans wondered why the movie had such a hold on them. Some felt as mystified as the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harshest critics did about just why they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop themselves from returning to Titanic: I've seen this movie 13 times (and yes  I must go back  if only because 13's unlucky! :-) Why do I  a thirty-something  sane woman keep going back? Because I love this movie \u00e2\u0080\u0094 everything about it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I know they'll letterbox it when it comes out on video and it just WON'T be the same on my tiny 19-inch tv screen. Someone told me a story about a woman in the States who was kicked out of the theatre for reciting every line with the movie. She had ticket stubs to prove she had seen it 84 times!! Now that's a bit excessive!!!! I can't really pinpoint why I keep going back. All I can say is that this movie gets to me every single time... The life lessons it teaches are many  but there is one theme in particular that all humankind never tires of hearing: love really is the greatest power of all. As it continued its dominance of Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hearts and minds  almost anything Titanic touched became a guaranteed moneymaker. The J. Peterman catalog began selling what it advertised as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfairly enormous\u00e2\u0080\u009d $198 Heart of the Ocean necklace  and quickly ran out of stock (disappointed customers could  however  content themselves with a $19 knockoff called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Jewel of the Sea \u00e2\u0080\u009d at least until Fox sued the company that made it). C\u00c3\u00a9line Dion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Heart Will Go On\u00e2\u0080\u009d became the world's best-selling single of 1998  and pushed the Titanic soundtrack to the top of the charts  too. ( Cameron  had initially resisted including any song over the closing credits  feeling it was akin to commissioning a pop single for the soundtrack to Schindler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s List. But Horner and Dion cut a demo in secret  and won him over.) Even \u00e2\u0080\u0094 maybe especially \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after the movie was gone from theaters  any piece of media that summoned its world would suffice for fans.  James Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s Titanic  a glossy coffee table book detailing the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production  shot to the top of the New York Times best-seller list  and candy-hued unauthorized biographies of Leonardo DiCaprio began appearing in bookstores  and in smitten girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backpacks. \"There's a lot of me in Jack  definitely \"  James Cameron  told Rolling Stone in 1998  in an interview in which  he  also discussed  his  recent separation from Linda Hamilton. She had been  his  fourth wife  and  his  Sarah Connor. \"Actually \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  clarified  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shouldn't say that. Jack is the guy I wished I could have been. I wished I had the courage and the openness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nReading the Titanic screenplay  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to tell which character  Cameron  wished  he  could have been: Even the simplest descriptions of Jack find a way to be adoring. One of Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sketches \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaptures [Cora and her father] perfectly  with a great sense of the humanity of the moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sketchbook is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca celebration of the human condition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Jack stargazes before his first conversation with Rose  he is thinking not just any thoughts  but \u00e2\u0080\u009cartist thoughts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as Rose begins to fall for Jack  we listen in on her first impressions of him: He \u00e2\u0080\u009cis so open and real...not like anyone she has ever known.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Remembering the iconic \u00e2\u0080\u009cking of the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d scene \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one he later reenacted  to near-universal disdain  at the 1998 Academy Awards \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Cameron described the kind of power  the kind of joy  that even the experience of commanding a vast and imposing structure \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a ship  a movie set \u00e2\u0080\u0094 couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily allow you to feel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see the power of [Titanic] \u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the scene  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you see the satisfaction of the officers who run the ship  and their domination of the elements. And then I take that energy and I give it to Jack. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an artist. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to have his heart soar. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his ship  man. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a dime. This is his ship  and his moment. He owns the moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To survey (and enjoy) the power of the vast system he commands  the captain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009ca great patriarch of the sea\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s script \u00e2\u0080\u0094 must stand on the bridge and look at Titanic itself. But Jack  because this is not his ship and not his dream  can stand at Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prow as it cuts through the water  feeling the sun on his face  and watching the dolphins that leap and swim \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the sheer joy and exultation of motion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He can fully experience Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power because he feels no need to convince himself he commands it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then he can give it to Rose. \"I've been part of a film that's broken cultural boundaries \u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio reflected in 2004. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went to the middle of Brazil  in the rainforest  and the Indians there knew [Titanic]. It's surreal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From the beginning  it was clear Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success transcended borders. When it finally left US theaters in the fall of 1998 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 staying on the big screen even after it was released on video \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it had made $659 million domestically. In the process  it became the highest-grossing movie in US history  shattering the record comfortably held  for 20 years  by Star Wars. (George Lucas took out an ad in Variety where Han and Leia posed like Jack and Rose to publicly congratulate Cameron  perhaps with some sense of relief: Heavy is the head that wears the big-gross crown.) But Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worldwide theatrical gross was nearly $2.2 billion. In a March 1998 article titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cFan Sinks into Titanic Obsession \u00e2\u0080\u009d the Associated Press reported that a 12-year-old girl named Gloria had gone to see Titanic  at the only movie theater in the town of Castelfranco Emilia  Italy  every single night since its release  and that she would go on watching it until she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anymore. She had seen it 50 times so far and wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tired of it yet; the theater no longer charged her admission  and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 recognizing that the love of an adolescent girl is nothing to be trifled with \u00e2\u0080\u0094 saved her favorite seat for her every night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJack is cuter than Leo \u00e2\u0080\u009d Gloria clarified  for anyone who wondered.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExperts say that the pure passion that pre-adolescent girls have for their idols represents a time in their lives that is brief  intense and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 once it's run its course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 gone forever \u00e2\u0080\u009d Frances Grandy Taylor wrote in the Hartford Courant in March 1998  in one of the countless articles and TV segments that tried to help parents understand Leomania. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cgone forever\u00e2\u0080\u009d part must have seemed particularly comforting. When the unafflicted tried to make sense of the phenomenon following the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release  they tended to focus on Leo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looks and his celebrity  and of course they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wrong. Like all adolescent crushes  he was perfect and remote: He couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt you  couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reject you  couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappoint you. And as Jack Dawson  he was pure fantasy: so handsome as to seem almost unearthly; an androgynous angel who wanted only to love you  to worship you  and to be the idea of a romantic partner  one with whom reality could never try to compete. He was a dream  the argument went  and that was why adolescent girls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who were overwhelmingly presented in the media as the driving force behind Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success  regardless of whether this was quite true or not \u00e2\u0080\u0094 kept going back to the theater for more. It was wish fulfillment. But what were we really wishing for? More than any  Cameron  protagonist before  him   Jack Dawson is heroic for his ability to love. He can watch the world as he knew it fall apart around him and not feel that everything he believed in \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hierarchy  order  masculinity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is being yanked out from under his feet  because he never felt much of a need to believe in it  anyway. When Jack turns up in a tuxedo to accompany Rose to dinner in first class  he first exaggerates the aristocracy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manners just enough to make them seem absurd  then captivates some of the wealthiest people in the world with stories of the kind of freedom they can barely allow themselves to imagine. Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life  as she has lived it so far  has taught her that she is an object to be bought and sold: All women are  and the best you can hope for  as a woman  is to be the most expensive object  sold to the richest buyer. Jack saves Rose from literal death \u00e2\u0080\u0094 twice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but he also saves her from the society- and self-imposed prison of believing that she can only ever inhabit the role she was born into. \u00e2\u0080\u009c'Titanic' is starting to sail out of movie theaters \u00e2\u0080\u009d conservative commentator Betsy Hart wrote in 1998  \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it may have left a wake of devastation in its path in the hearts of teenage girls everywhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As heartbreaking as the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ending was  Hart found that she was \u00e2\u0080\u009csaddened much more\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the thought of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe millions of teenage girls\u00e2\u0080\u009d who had helped make the movie a hit  and who had been duped into thinking that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe intense sentiment and easy sex over a few days that formed the romantic centerpiece of Titanic is the kind of love they should strive for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's little wonder \u00e2\u0080\u009d Hart concluded  that \u00e2\u0080\u009cour society has so many young people that need so much rescuing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis analysis has always been obviously wrong in at least one more way: Titanic is not a fun movie to watch. You aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t escaping from anything so much as putting yourself through an emotional ordeal: a decathlon of passion  dread  terror  numbness  and finally cathartic hope. You  yourself  have survived something by the end of Titanic; you have sat immersed in death  in dying  in questions about your own behavior in such a situation  and have asked yourself to believe in love in the face of all this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and perhaps have been able to. For that experience  we were willing to go back to Titanic over and over again. And if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focusing on the girls in the audience  then please \u00e2\u0080\u0094 let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really think about them. Who were these girls  and why were they there? Why was I? When Titanic was in theaters  girls of 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 and 13 shaped their lives around it  and fell in love not just with Leo  but with the whole story they had first found him in. We had a sense  maybe  that life as we knew it was not so different from Titanic: that we  too  lived in a world where society might have to fall apart completely before we could be liberated from the roles that gender and class and race forced us to occupy. In Titanic  Rose is freed not because her mother and her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 die (they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t)  but because a microcosm of the world as she knows it collapses around her  and in that moment she realizes its rules no longer dictate her existence. They were never really real  of course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but now that she has seen the spectacular defeat of every system the society that raised her guaranteed would work forever  she can no longer even feel its laws governing her. Something breaks when you no longer believe that anyone  anywhere  can build an unsinkable ship. And if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put your faith in a system like a ship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or a government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you have to start directing all your trust  all your love  to the people around you. Titanic poses the question of what we can hold onto when the structures and beliefs we have built our lives on founder beneath us  and one of the answers it allows us to reach is: each other. We hold onto each other. Recently  a writer friend told me that this year  as the world has started to feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s falling apart  he has found himself turning again and again to W.H. Auden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closing lines in \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeptember 1  1939\u00e2\u0080\u009d: Hunger allows no choice To the citizen or the police; We must love one another or die. In the past year  I have developed the same kind of relationship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have been taking the same kind of refuge  grasping for the same kind of wisdom \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with Titanic. When I first fell in love with Titanic  at 9 years old  I wanted to be Jack as much as I wanted to be loved by him. I wanted the freedom he enjoyed: freedom that seemed to give him the ability to love so deeply and so selflessly. It was the kind of freedom the world around me said a girl could never have. But the world had also told Rose that  and she had found that freedom  in the end. Yet no matter how vast James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abilities were  his imagination \u00e2\u0080\u0094 big enough to bring a lost ship back to life; big enough  even  to let the viewer feel some sense of what 1 500 lost souls really means \u00e2\u0080\u0094 still couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conjure a vision so radical that it could let Jack survive. If it were possible for  James Cameron  to imagine masculinity doing anything  in the long term  but infecting everything around it with violence and arrogance and greed and destruction  then Jack could have survived. If  Cameron  were able to imagine a world beyond the hierarchy of patriarchal control \u00e2\u0080\u0094 instead of just spectacularly destroying one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then Jack could have survived. If he could have imagined possibilities for men beyond either blindly following the patriarchy or dying for its sins  then Jack could have survived. But instead  Jack has to die  and to love Rose in the only way a world of patriarchal masculinity  even one reduced to flotsam  will allow: by giving his life for hers. Beyond even Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unresolved questions about masculinity  the one radical possibility  James Cameron  seems unable to imagine is one in which partners can lovingly empower each other through a life lived together. This is where we have no choice but to do what he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t: to imagine such love  and live it. To focus on nurture  and let go of heroism. To know that love is the only way through. To say: Get on this board  you idiot.

Over the next five years  relatives and friends could do little but pray for the couple's well-being. Hope came in the form of short video clips released by the captors. It was through that footage that the couple's families got to glimpse  Coleman  and Boyle's three children  born in captivity.\nHere's a look at how  Coleman  and Boyle's ordeal unfolded:\nJuly 4  2012: Shortly before she hopped on a plane   Coleman  sent an email to her friends. \u201cOur flight leaves at 4 p.m. \" she wrote. \u201cOnly God knows exactly where it will lead or what all can be accomplished  seen  experienced or learned while we travel.

The brothers hope it will help change how people think of their home .  OMAR KABBANI  : Whenever they talk about the Middle East or Lebanon   all they think about is extremism and terrorism . By painting a big word   salam   we want to show people that we ' re creative and positive things coming out from the Middle East . I think we made our goal happen . SHAPIRO :  Omar Kabbani  joined us from Lebanon on Skype to explain how  he  and  his  brother Mohamed put this project together .

It ' s the second biggest city in Lebanon . There was   like   two fighting militias fighting a small civil war between two areas   and we decided to go up and paint the word salam above this area in particular . We recruited 62 ex - militiamen or ex - fighters . KABBANI : So basically they dropped their guns and they started helping us with painting their own rooftops . SHAPIRO : And I understand some of these buildings had bullet holes . Some of them were uninhabitable . You could really see the signs of the violence in this neighborhood . It was a battle zone . There ' s plenty of bullets . The buildings were on fire . So it was funny but sad at the same moment . Like   when we used to go up to scout   they used to tell us   yeah   I used to sit here and point my sniper rifle . So ... SHAPIRO : Wow . KABBANI : It was like a really true story . Like   people who lived violence and lived   like   war started going up to their rooftop without the fear of being shot . SHAPIRO : I imagine that for some of these fighters who had sat on these rooftops with guns   to come back to those rooftops and paint them bright green to spell out the word peace must have been a very emotional experience . KABBANI : It was very challenging for us . And it was challenging for them . We stayed there for three weeks . Every day   we go up . And you can hear their stories . And you know   like   they are in rock bottom   complete poverty . So whenever someone gives them   like - I don ' t know - a small amount of money   they would go and hold the gun and start shooting . But if the people give them an opportunity to work   they will work . There are   like   really good - hearted people . They want to do something positive . And we used not just bright green paint - regular paint . We used   like - it ' s anti - leakage   and it prevents from - anti - UV also .  SHAPIRO  : Oh   like waterproof and reflecting the sun   so it cools the houses and keeps them dry . So it has - so people were really happy that we ' re in a way fixing the rooftops   you know ?  SHAPIRO  : Has the crew actually seen the finished work of art - because you can really only see it from a drone . There are photographs   but you could be standing on one of these rooftops and not know that it ' s spelling out the word salam . KABBANI : Yeah   of course . When we first briefed them about the project   we showed them what we were painting . And   like   every two days   we flew a drone to show them and for us to see the progress of the work . And of course   we showed them the end results . SHAPIRO : Omar Kabbani   thanks a lot . KABBANI : You ' re welcome . SHAPIRO :  Omar Kabbani     his  brother Mohamed and their crew painted more than 80 rooftops in the Lebanese city of Tripoli to say salam - peace in Arabic .  He  ' s looking forward to Google updating its map images so everyone who searches for the city can see the artwork .

Donna Brazile . (Joe Raedle/Associated Press)\nOn Thursday  former Democratic National Committee interim chair  Donna Brazile  made a surprising revelation: An August 2015 agreement gave Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign partial control of the DNC months prior to Clinton winning the nomination. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cagreement was not illegal \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Brazile  writes  \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it sure looked unethical.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The news reignited a debate among politicos and activists over whether the DNC influenced the Democratic primary. Whether the primary was \u00e2\u0080\u009crigged\u00e2\u0080\u009d or just business as usual though  Brazile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allegations are only the latest evidence of the Democratic Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s troubles  and why the party establishment is ill-equipped to solve them.\nStart with something that  Brazile \u00e2\u0080\u0099s article doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch on: the electoral record. At the federal level  Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress. The GOP House majority is at its largest in 70 years. Though two-thirds of the Senate seats contested in 2016 were held by Republicans  Democrats only gained two seats  losing races against very vulnerable GOP incumbents. At the state level  Republicans are at their strongest since the 1930s. Republicans control both the state legislatures and governorships in 24 states  compared with Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 five. The GOP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruthless exploitation of gerrymandering \u00e2\u0080\u0094 aided by its control of so many states \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has helped increase GOP control  but much blame still lies with Democratic leaders.\nHere is what you need to know about the political storm sparked by  Donna Brazile 's allegations against the Clinton campaign. (Amber Ferguson Melissa Macaya/The Washington Post)\nThen there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the financial mismanagement. Money troubles for the DNC are hardly unprecedented  but the struggles appear to have worsened considerably in the past few years.  Brazile  says that the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monthly expenditures had doubled in the previous five years  in large part because of former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and President Barack Obama keeping expensive consultants on the payroll. (Given Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 electoral failures  what these consultants were doing is anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guess.) Of course  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in  Brazile \u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest to blame things on  her  predecessor. But a former senior party official independently confirmed the troubles to the Intercept\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ryan Grim  adding that the DNC was unable to make payroll in August 2015 and was \u00e2\u0080\u009capproaching the equivalent of bankruptcy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

James Damore   an ex-Google employee who wrote a controversial memo arguing the merits of gender and diversity programs  was interviewed by two YouTubers. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)\nA week ago   James Damore  worked at Google.

Damore  was fired for \u201cperpetuating gender stereotypes.\u201d But  he  quickly became a hero on the right-wing Internet  where a coalition of anti-politically-correct online personalities  Trump supporters and the alt-right believed that  Damore \u2019s firing was proof that Silicon Valley was hostile to conservatives \u2014 and that something was about to change.\nAs his Duke portraits show  that is a role that  Damore  has embraced.

IKEA Founder   Ingvar Kamprad   Dies At 91\n Ingvar Kamprad  the man who created IKEA   leaves behind a professional legacy that's all about simplicity: sleek  affordable  Scandinavian-designed furniture with wordless assembly instructions.\n His  personal legacy  however  is more complicated: from a reputation for strict frugality to flirtations with fascism.\n Kamprad  died Saturday at the age of 91 at  his  home in Smaland in southern Sweden  with  his  loved ones by  his  side  according to a statement from IKEA.  The company  says  he  had faced a \"short illness.\"\n\" His  legacy will be admired for many years to come and  his  vision \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to create a better everyday life for the many people \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will continue to guide and inspire us \" says Jesper Brodin  the CEO and president of the IKEA Group.\n The company Kamprad  founded at 17 grew into a multinational behemoth  with nearly 400 stores worldwide  almost a billion store visits per year and more than $36 billion in annual retail sales in Europe alone.\nThough  the company  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which never went public \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was and remains secretive about  its  finances   it  did reveal  its  balance sheet for the 2009 fiscal year. NPR's Jacob Goldstein reported the upshot of the financial disclosure in 2010:\n\" The company  is sitting on a huge pile of cash  and managed to grow throughout the economic turbulence of the past few years. \"In  its  2009 fiscal year  Ikea made $3.5 billion in profits on $30.2 billion in revenues. And the company was holding $19.7 billlion in cash at the end of that year. (Ikea reported results in euros; I converted the figures to dollars at the current exchange rate.)\"\n Kamprad  was born March 30  1926 and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 despite struggles with dyslexia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 exhibited an entrepreneurial spirit from a young age  selling matchboxes as a small child.  He  quickly realized  he  could buy them dirt cheap in bulk and then sell them for a low price while still earning a profit.  He  later moved on to selling fish  Christmas decorations and pens.  He  ran advertisements in local papers and also distributed a \"makeshift mail-order catalog \" as the Associated Press reports.\nAt the age of 17   he  formed IKEA  an acronym built from  his  own initials and those of  his  family farm (Elmtaryd) and the local parish (Agunnaryd).\nIn 1950   he  added furniture sourced from local manufacturers to  his  catalogs and  when it became evident that it was  his  most popular product  it became  his  sole focus.\n Kamprad 's lightbulb moment arrived in the 1950s when  he  saw an employee removing the legs from a table to help a customers transport it.  He  pioneered flat-pack furniture that would fit snugly inside its box  saving space and money. What's more  the costs of assembly would be eliminated by letting consumers build their own furniture.\n Kamprad  prioritized an image of austerity for  himself  and  his  company  even though Bloomberg Billionaires Index calculated  his  wealth at $58.7 billion and ranked  him  the eighth wealthiest man in the world. In a book  he  wrote about IKEA's history   he  wrote that  he  often perused local vegetable markets just before they rolled up shop for the night  always on the hunt for a better deal.  He  reportedly drove a modest Volvo  flew economy class (and made  his  executives do the same)  ate cheap meals and stayed in budget hotels.  He  spent many years living in Switzerland to avoid Sweden's steep taxes  a decision that rankled some in  his  home country.\nThrift was one of the virtues  he  laid out in a manifesto  he  published in the 1970's titled  \"The Testament of a Furniture Dealer.\"\nReporters later found that  his  reputation for penny-pinching was not entirely accurate  however  as the New York Times reports:\n\" His  home was a villa overlooking Lake Geneva  and  he  had an estate in Sweden and vineyards in Provence.  He  drove a Porsche as well as the Volvo.  His  cut-rate flights  hotels and meals were taken in part as an exemplar to  his  executives  who were expected to follow suit  to regard employment by Ikea as a life's commitment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and to write on both sides of a piece of paper.\"", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Norwegian is replacing St. Thomas visits through the end of the year with calls in the Western Caribbean; Celebrity is shifting its ships to places like St. Kitts.\nMartinique experienced some flooding and power outages last week in the wake of  Maria   but its port has reopened. Tours and tourist sites are expected to be up and running this week. No cruise ships are scheduled to call in Martinique until the middle of October.\nSt. Croix was relatively unaffected by  Irma  but early reports are that the island suffered significant damage from Maria  which passed by on Sept. 19. Damage assessments are underway. St. Croix isn't normally visited by cruise ships at this time of year. Before  Irma   the next scheduled cruise call for the island wasn't set to take place until Nov. 5  when a Celebrity Cruises ship was due to arrive. But in the wake of  Irma   several lines had been planning on using St. Croix as a substitute port for nearby St. Thomas and St. Maarten  which were heavily damaged by the storm.\nSt. Barts was hit hard by  Irma  and is in no shape to receive cruise ship visitors for now. But there are no ships scheduled to call at the island until late October. There's been no official word as to whether the overseas collectivity of France will be ready for cruise tourists by then.\nDominica was hit hard by  Maria  late on Sept. 18 through the morning of Sept. 19  with the island's prime minister saying there was \"mind-boggling\" damage  and it's not expected to reopen to cruise ships for some time. The good news for cruise operators: No ships are scheduled to call at the island until late October.\nSamana was relatively unaffected by Irma and  Maria . On Friday  the Dominican Republic's Ministry of Tourism issued a communique that said the port and all others around the country were back open and operating normally. Even if the port area had suffered damage from the storm  it would have had little impact on cruise schedules as there are no ships set to visit Samana until November.\nThe port of San Juan bounced back quickly after  Irma  passed nearby  but it may take longer to resume its place as a major cruise destination in the wake of Maria. The storm made landfall on Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 as a powerful Category 4 hurricane \u2014 the first hurricane of that strength or higher to directly hit the island in 85 years \u2014 and reports are of significant damage in many locations. Both of the major lines that operate cruises out of San Juan  Royal Caribbean and Carnival  have canceled this week's sailings out of the city. Carnival also has canceled trips out of San Juan scheduled to start on Oct. 1 and Oct. 8. In addition  three Florida-based ships that were scheduled to visit San Juan this week have been re-routed to other ports.\nCarnival said late Friday that its terminal in San Juan sustained extensive damage from  Maria  that will takes weeks to repair.\nSanto Domingo was relatively unaffected by Irma and  Maria . On Friday  the Dominican Republic's Ministry of Tourism issued a communique that said the port and all others around the country were back open and operating normally.\nAntigua suffered a glancing blow from  Hurricane Irma  which passed to the north along a path that devastated sister island Barbuda . Antigua still is on cruise schedules for the fall  with the next scheduled ship visit set for Oct. 3 \u2014 a call by Celebrity Cruises' Celebrity Equinox. The Equinox call originally was set for Sept. 30 but was pushed back as part of a larger shuffling of the ship's schedule due to the closures of St. Thomas  St. Maarten and Tortola.\nThe British Virgin Islands were hard hit by  Irma  and could be closed to cruise ships for many weeks if not months. Norwegian Cruise Line already has canceled all of its stops at Tortola through the end of the year  replacing them with calls in the Western Caribbean.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Oct . 1 was the day Catalonia held a referendum on whether to separate from Spain   a move the Spanish government had tried desperately to prevent . Police and other armed forces were sent into the region to try to keep people from the polls   but Catalan leaders still declared a victory for the independence movement .

Seven major parties were vying for seats on Thursday . But for most voters   instead of thinking of things in terms of right and left   it was a decision between a pro - Catalan independence voting bloc and a rival bloc of parties that have campaigned on Catalonia remaining a part of Spain .

His body has never been found.\nAuthorities contended that Carrick was selling pot for  Casciaro  and owed him money.\nA third co-worker  Shane Lamb  testified at both trials that  Casciaro  told him to \"talk\" to Carrick about the debt. Lamb said he confronted Carrick inside a produce cooler at the grocery store and punched him  knocking him unconscious. Lamb testified that  Casciaro  told him to leave the store and that he would take care of the body. Authorities said Carrick's blood was found in and around the cooler  but  Casciaro  has denied having any involvement.\nLamb  facing a lengthy sentence in an unrelated drug case  agreed to testify against  Casciaro  in exchange for immunity in Carrick's death.\n Casciaro   now 33  was released from prison in 2015 after an appellate court ruled that the state's case was improbable and Lamb's testimony did not match the physical evidence found at the scene.", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

This article originally appeared on VICE UK . I gave up smoking cannabis eight years ago . I \u2019 d been promoted \u2014 from telemarketing supervisor to the noble heights of telemarketing manager \u2014 and I couldn \u2019 t come to work high anymore . My abiding memory of the following week was a nightly stream of terrifying dreams . It was like I was dreaming in stereo   as my brain experienced the novelty of truly deep sleep for the first time in years . Within a week   once the night terrors and the cold sweats had stopped   my short - term memory started to improve . I was more sociable in and outside of work . I left the job within a few months and started doing something I loved . Everything about my life improved . But giving up weed isn \u2019 t so easy for everyone   and for some   it \u2019 s fraught with acute problems \u2014 physical   mental   and emotional . \" Stopping my consumption of cannabis used to mean a lot of pain : vomiting   diarrhea   and not being able to sleep or eat  \" says  Alex Fraser   26  .  Alex  has Crohn \u2019 s disease   which was diagnosed when  he  was 19 .  He  just had an ileostomy   in which a diseased part of  his  bowel was removed . This has drastically improved  his  quality of life   but he \u2019 s still hugely reliant on cannabis to keep  him  up and running . \" Despite the surgery   I still have issues with eating   nausea   and sleep  \"  he  says . \" If I don \u2019 t have cannabis   I end up using meds like Zopiclone for sleep and Oxycodone for pain . But nothing particularly helps my nausea or appetite   except cannabis .\" WATCH : The Safest Possible Way to Use Weed Alex   who generally vapes but occasionally smokes and eats marijuana   also relies on it to keep his mental health in check . \" It \u2019 s extremely helpful with the mental health issues I \u2019 ve had since surgery . Anxiety attacks   self - esteem issues   and my energy levels are all improved or eliminated with cannabis  \" he explains . Jon Liebling is a Director of the United Patient \u2019 s Alliance   which is currently lobbying hard for the legalization of medical weed in the UK . Liebling has a long history of profound mental health issues and has recently been diagnosed with complex PTSD . \" I ' ve been managing my anxiety   depression   and suicidal thoughts most of my life   but have kept myself relatively happy with the use of cannabis  \" says Liebling . \" About two years ago   I had a number of traumatic events take place in a rather short period of time . I realized I needed a bit more help   so I asked my doctor to refer me to a therapist . When I informed him I used cannabis   he refused to refer me unless I stopped using . He prescribed me Prozac and Diazepam . I \u2019 ve always had suicidal thoughts   but what \u2019 s kept me alive is my dissatisfaction with them . Prozac made my thoughts happier   but also   made me happier with those suicidal tendencies . So I acted on them for the first time in 20 years .\" Liebling went back to his doctor and found that a locum was working that day . She immediately removed him from his Prozac prescription and referred him to talking therapy . She also told him to return to managing his condition with cannabis   and he \u2019 s thankfully still here to tell the tale . Unfortunately   beyond anecdotal evidence   it \u2019 s quite hard to back up Alex and Liebling \u2019 s comments with science because currently   there just isn \u2019 t much out there . Plus   their personal health conditions \u2014 despite being undoubtedly severe \u2014 are not indicative of the population as a whole . A 2010 paper called \" Assessment and management of cannabis use disorders in primary care \" suggests that to differentiate between a psychiatric disorder and chronic cannabis intoxication   a patient should cease cannabis use for two to four weeks . In a small 20 - person impatient study of withdrawal   it found that \" mean baseline depression symptom scores reduced to normal levels after four weeks of abstinence .\" One of the study \u2019 s creators was Professor Adam Winstock   founder of the Global Drug Survey \u2014 a study of how the world consumes drugs \u2014 and a consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist . Between these two roles   he \u2019  s  analyzed the drug - taking habits of approximately 500   000 people   and 300   000 cannabis users .  He  \u2019 s extremely well - placed to advise on dealing with the more established effects of cannabis withdrawal . For most people   as it was with me during my promotion back in the mid - 2000s   that means : a ) insomnia and vivid dreams ; and b ) nicotine withdrawal . A huge part of the first problem comes from an unlikely source . \" Lots of people who smoke lots of weed drink too much caffeine : Red Bull   tea   coffee   fizzy drinks . This is often to offset the sedating effects of weed . If you keep drinking 15 cups of tea when you \u2019 ve given up weed   this is going to worsen your insomnia   which will make you agitated  \" says Winstock . If you \u2019 ve grown up smoking joints with tobacco in them   there \u2019 s a good chance you will also experience cravings from the nicotine withdrawal . For those looking to give up weed   Winstockadvocates giving up cannabis and nicotine at the same time \u2014 but adds that   crucially   you should gradually reduce your tobacco intake in the run - up to quitting . This will have an unexpected second benefit in the fight against withdrawal sleeplessness . It breaks it down  \" he explains . \" So when you stop smoking tobacco   your caffeine levels go through the roof . You ' re left with this double whammy : of not only taking a stimulant drug [ caffeine ] that you likely drink too much of anyway   but you ' re taking a stimulant drug whose levels are going to go through the roof because tobacco is no longer breaking it down .\" Winstock also says that the intensity of your withdrawal will likely be affected by the type of weed you smoke . \" If you smoke a high THC cannabis   then I think the insomnia would be worse \u2014 your weird dreams would be worse   your craving would be worse   and your low mood would be worse .\" Withdrawal symptoms with weed peak around day two or three and are generally over after seven . Sleeplessness and vivid dreams may last for two weeks   but Winstock \u2019 s absolute gold standard advice for giving up weed is to \" get into good sleep hygiene .\" Admittedly easier said than done   but there are some common sense habits that will help . \" Exercise is probably the best thing you can do  \" he says . \" Obviously   you shouldn ' t over - exert yourself   but if you \u2019 re exhausted when you go to bed   you \u2019 re much more likely to sleep well . Turn off screens a couple of hours before bed   and avoid caffeine . And don \u2019 t give up and call your dealer if you don ' t sleep well !

Waln\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frequent tours of reservations and his blunt  firebrand style have made him well-known among his people (he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a two-time Native American Music Award winner). Recently   Waln  has made a splash in the mainstream media too: He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been featured on NPR and MTV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rebel Music: Native Americaand in Vibe and USA Today; he has performed at the South by Southwest festival in Austin  and at concerts in France and Germany. The day before his Albuquerque concert  he spoke at a Harvard University symposium on Native politics.\n Waln  is an ascendant member of a Native American hip-hop vanguard that is taking  its  message of social justice off of the reservation. What separates  Waln  and other socially engaged artists  like War Party  Without Rezervation  and Supaman  from older generations of Native artists  says Alan Lechusza Aquallo  a professor of American Indian studies at Palomar College  is their authenticity.  Waln  doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play to Native stereotypes  like a preaching elder or a fierce sports mascot \u00e2\u0080\u0094  his  performing persona is young  charismatic  believably real. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a number of Native hip-hop artists who play off the kitsch of what it is to be Indian because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to give them notoriety \u00e2\u0080\u009d Aquallo says. \u00e2\u0080\u009c [Waln]  has  his  long braids  but  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s wearing street clothes.

And through his words and music  on the reservation and off   Waln  plans on delivering the wake-up call.\n Frank Waln\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  own education began on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation  on the Great Plains of central South Dakota.  He  grew up in He Dog  a small Sicangu Lakota community  where  his  single mom and her sisters ran the family ranch.  His  father was abusive and mostly absent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the first of many scars  he  would learn to bear.\n Frank Waln . (Photo: Tomas Karmelo Amaya)\nHe Dog is located in Todd County  where the poverty rate approaches 50 percent  a problem with deep and tangled roots. Studies of modern Native Americans have shown that \u00e2\u0080\u009chistorical trauma \u00e2\u0080\u009d the name that social workers give to the perception of historical loss passed down through generations  has been linked to symptoms of emotional distress like anger  anxiety  substance abuse  and even depression.  Waln  remembers grappling with these manifestations even as a child. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was very confusing to me \u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was wondering why I was struggling with depression all the time  why I had suicidal thoughts  why the suicide rate was so high on our reservation. I was very insecure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Waln  says his confusion stemmed from the fact that  beyond the traditions passed down through his family  he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know much about the political history of his people. And indeed  with scant resources  schools on American reservations have fallen behind. A 2011 National Indian Education Study found huge deficits in reading and math scores for schools heavily attended by Native American students. Schools controlled by the Bureau of Indian Education  which are run by tribes  fared even worse: Fourth graders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reading scores averaged 182 on a 500-point scale  compared to 204 in public schools.

Although they have no affection for North Korean despot Kim Jong Un  they fear both the chaos that the collapse of Kim's regime could create as well as the prospect of a unified  pro-American Korea on its doorstep. While they are increasing economic pressure on Pyongyang  they are unlikely to cut off the spigot to any extent that would provoke genuine instability. Instead  China advocates a diplomatic track that could lead to negotiations  although potentially with conditions to which neither the United States nor its regional allies may be inclined to agree.\n\u00e2There are big differences in the way of thinking between the United States and China on North Korea \u00e2 Yang Xiyu  a former Chinese Foreign Ministry negotiator on North Korea  said to the New York Times. \u00e2 Trump  thinks of North Korea too simplistically \u00e2 that if China cuts off the oil  the nuclear issue will be solved.\u00e2\nOn trade  China will give  Trump  the useful headlines  he  seeks. The White House is expected to announce lucrative deals between U.S. and Chinese companies that could be worth as much as $250 billion  according to Bloomberg News.

Comey   who had been fired by Trump a week before the Times \u2019 story   alleged the president had urged him to shut down the federal investigation into his former national security adviser   Michael Flynn . The report was published just weeks prior to Comey \u2019 s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee   which was part of a federal investigation into whether Trump \u2019 s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with the Russian government .

Flanagan focused on one particularly horrifying case   in which Penn State University sophomore Tim Piazza fell down a flight of stairs at a Beta Theta Pi hazing event . It wasn \u2019 t until 12 hours later that some of the fraternity \u2019 s members called 911 when they noticed their pledge \u201c looked fucking dead .\u201d The student underwent surgery   but died the next day . Penn State shut down the fraternity in February and over two dozen people have been charged in relation to the student \u2019 s death . Since Flanagan \u2019 s report   at least two other fraternity - related deaths have occurred   according to The New York Times . Memorable line : Once again   a student is dead and a family is shattered . And all of us are co - authors of these grim facts   as we grant both the fraternities and their host institutions tax - exempt status and allow them to carry on year after year with little change .

The New York Times : \u201c Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers For Decades \u201d ( Oct . 5 ) Alexander Koerner via Getty Images Harvey Weinstein This is the explosive report that helped catapult the # MeToo movement into existence . The Times \u2019 Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey unearthed previously undisclosed allegations that Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein used his position of power to sexually harass women for decades   telling women to accept his sexual advances if they wanted his help with their careers . Days later   the New Yorker published Ronan Farrow \u2019 s disturbing investigation into Weinstein \u2019 s history of sexual abuse   revealing the film producer had been accused not only of sexual harassment   but of rape as well . The reports prompted the firing of Weinstein from his company   as well as the rescinding of several awards . The NYPD announced in October that it was investigating sexual assault claims against him . Since the Weinstein allegations   a powerful man has been publicly accused of sexual misconduct once every 20 hours   according to the Los Angeles Times . Memorable line : In interviews   eight women described varying behavior by Mr . Weinstein : appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them   requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself . 11 . International Consortium of Investigative Journalists : \u201c Paradise Papers \u201d ( Nov . 5 ) Francois Lenoir / Reuters Activists stage a protest on a mock tropical island representing a tax haven . Journalists from 96 media organizations across the world worked together to investigate over 13 million leaked documents that revealed elaborate offshore assets of politicians and corporations . The investigation   known as the \u201c Paradise Papers  \u201d concluded that such assets allowed the high - profile figures and companies to dodge millions of dollars in taxes . One of the most notable findings for U . S . politics is a report that Trump \u2019 s Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross shares business interests with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2019 s son - in - law . Ross previously failed to disclose the connection during his confirmation hearing . Many U . S . lawmakers expressed dismay over the findings . Several senators   including Sen . Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt .) called for an investigation into the findings . The Paradise Papers \u201c raise serious questions about the integrity of our tax system and the ability of the top one percent to rig it in order to benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else  \u201d Sanders wrote in a letter to the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee last month .

But then the allegations of sexual assault on minors began rolling in . Leigh Corfman told the Post that she was 14 when Moore   then a 32 - year - old district attorney   kissed her   touched her breast and forced her to touch him over his underwear . Corfman \u2019 s accusation prompted other women to come forward   though Moore has denied accusations of wrongdoing . The report likely cost Moore the race   despite having Trump \u2019 s endorsement . He lost to Democratic opponent Doug Jones   but has yet to officially concede . Memorable line : He took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes . He touched her over her bra and underpants   she says   and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear . \u201c I wanted it over with \u2014 I wanted out  \u201d she remembers thinking . \u201c Please just get this over with .\u201d MOHAMED EL - SHAHED via Getty Images Iraqi forces An on - the - ground account from veteran investigative reporter Azmat Khan and writer Anand Gopal found coalition airstrikes in Iraq are not nearly as precise as U .

Khan and Gopal discovered flawed or outdated intelligence contributed to accidental bombing of Iraqi civilians by the U . S . military . According to the report   one in five airstrikes resulted in the death of civilians \u2015 a rate more than 31 times acknowledged by the coalition . The report prompted Rep . Ted Lieu ( D - Calif .) to send a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis   requesting he take \u201c corrective actions \u201d in light of the investigation .

Jason Wong / HuffPost The impending financial doom facing most millennials has been a hot topic for the past few years   but no report has laid out the disaster quite as effectively and hauntingly as HuffPost contributor Michael Hobbes . Hobbes explained how decades of irresponsible political and corporate decisions have led this generation into a downward spiral of financial ruin . One in five millennials live in poverty   according to the report   and people ages 26 to 34 are more likely than any other age bracket to not have health insurance . Some lawmakers called on Congress to make a more concerted effort to help millennials   including Rep . Keith Ellison ( D - Minn .) and Sen . Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt .)  whose cornerstone issue is tackling wealth inequality . \u201c This is the direct result of an economy built to maximize corporate profits and protect the assets of the wealthy \u2014 an economy that is rigged against working class people who also cannot count on a stable safety net like generations before  \u201d Sanders wrote in a Facebook post .", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

David Scotton  in I Lived on Parker Avenue (trailer image via YouTube)\nA documentary about a young man who is grateful to  his  birth mother as well as to  his  adoptive parents.\nDo you want to meet gratitude? Then  David Scotton \u00e2\u0080\u0099s your man. At a time when we are taking public-policy advice from traumatized  grieving young students  consider this eternally grateful one.\n David Scotton  is a 24-year-old law student with a little movie with a big message. Adopted at birth   he  allowed  with some hesitation and prayer  a filmmaker to follow along  his  journey from New Orleans to Indiana when  he  was 19 to meet  his  birth parents.\nThe other day at the Sheen Center in Lower Manhattan  I heard George Weigel  the John Paul II biographer  assert that people of heroic virtue are all around us. Saints  they are frequently known as \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in this case  though  not canonized and in Heaven but living in our midst  often unaware that they are sources of great grace and inspiration.  David Scotton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  birth mother is chief among them. And all those things about saints is true of  her   if the documentary I Lived on Parker Avenue is any indication.\nOne of the first things  she  wants to do is seek forgiveness from David. For so many years  this mother  suffered with worry that the boy  she  gave birth to would be hurt by the fact that  she  chose to \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive him up for adoption \u00e2\u0080\u009d as the expression goes. Our language for adoption seems to suggest abandonment when  in fact  it is just about the greatest and most loving sacrifice. I think of the story  from the State of the Union some weeks ago  of the young police officer and his wife and a woman named Crystal who is suffering in the grip of addiction. But  she  wants better for  her  baby. And there is a couple who can help  her  realize that aspiration. As there was in the case of  David .\nMelissa had the added guilt that she and her boyfriend not only considered abortion when she was pregnant with  David  but that she went to the clinic. In I Lived on Parker Avenue she describes the dramatically painful scene she ran out from. In one of the most uplifting scenes I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever watched on video  Melissa and  David  visit the spot where that clinic once stood. (It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a health clinic now  and abortions are no longer performed there.) For him  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like the opposite of a memorial dedicated to some grave event. It was there where he was given new life  even in the womb. She should feel no guilt. She gave life and love to  David  and to  his  adoptive mom and dad.\nThe beauty of I Lived on Parker Avenue is that  in some respects  it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t primarily about abortion or even adoption  though promotion of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe adoption option\u00e2\u0080\u009d is certainly this young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about gratitude. One of the most compelling scenes of the 30-minute film occurs when  David  expresses in letters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 personalized and everything  there are communications beyond text messages still! \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what his adoptive family means to him. He wanted to assure his parents and extended family and friends that meeting his birth parents had nothing to do with finding his \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue\u00e2\u0080\u009d parents and everything with saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith only two adoptions to every 100 abortions in the United States  and with the stigmas society still unfortunately shares about adoption  it is important to get this film out there \u00e2\u0080\u009d  David  tells me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven though I am adopted  I am no different than a biological child. Even though my parents are my \u00e2\u0080\u0098adoptive\u00e2\u0080\u0099 parents  they are my mom and dad. My \u00e2\u0080\u0098birth\u00e2\u0080\u0099 parents are exactly that: birth parents.

His most recent album \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2016's Black \u00e2\u0080\u0093 featured a more polished  rock-infused sound.  Bentley  describes The Mountain to Rolling Stone Country as a combination of those two musical impulses.\n\"The Mountain mixes Up on the Ridge with Black \"  he  says. \"This record covers more ground in that Up on the Ridge area than I thought it would. The most successful part of my career is in large part due to [songwriter-producer] Ross Copperman  and these sounds and ideas that he has. But we've reached a place where we've pushed that as far as we can  so how do we grab some of the stuff I love from the first part of my career and blow that up even more  and put it all together in a cauldron.\"\nA new teaser video for the project released as part of the announcement seems to confirm that analysis  highlighting a marriage of roots instrumentation and a modern  rock-focused drive. In the video   Bentley  walks through a sweeping backcountry landscape as the fat-bottomed electric groove of The Mountain's title track plays in the background.\n\"Well I bet my soul on a six string gamble / I climbed like hell through the brush and the bramble / Even though I had my doubts / Told myself don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look down / And I turned that hill into a pile of gravel / It was only a mountain \"  Bentley  sings.\nRecorded and also largely written in Telluride  the album was produced by Copperman  Jon Randall and executive producer Arturo Buenahora Jr.  and features songs co-written by  Bentley  with hitmakers like Natalie Hemby  Luke Dick  Copperman  Randall  Jon Nite and Ashley Gorley.\n Bentley  previously debuted two new songs at a pair of year-end concerts in Las Vegas  road-testing the driving rocker \"Burning Man\" and optimistic ballad \"Living\" for enthusiastic crowds. His most-recent release is \"Hold the Light \" a collaboration with Bon Iver's S.

It would threaten to screw everything up.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always going to be about progress \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Johnson  said this week about how  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll evaluate the 2018 season. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get there fast enough. I want to get to the playoffs. I want to get to the Super Bowl. I was serious about that desire to get to the Super Bowl before my brother gets back here. I would love to have that happen. But  there are no mandates. I think the fans are going to be happy with the way we move forward here. I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put down a mandate for these guys.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Johnson   you see  is smart.  He  knows that setting a postseason-or-else directive is counterproductive.

But the Rangers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 veteran defenseman doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to wait much longer. He is set to return to the lineup for Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s road match against the Blue Jackets after six-game stretch as a healthy scratch.\nIt might not have been such a big deal had  Smith  not signed a four-year  $17.4 million deal this summer just days before  he  could have reached unrestricted free agency. After  he  came over last season in a deadline trade from the Red Wings   Smith  had shown an edge to  his  game the Blueshirts coveted enough to offer  him  a contract with a $4.35 million annual salary-cap hit. The 28-year-old was then slated to be in the Blueshirts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 top four  and yet  his  performance had led to coach Alain Vigneault deciding to dress  him  in only 11 of the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first 19 games.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely hard to stay positive \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Smith  said after the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practice Thursday  when  he  was paired with Marc Staal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how you bring it  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how your attitude [is] every day.

I tried not to do that.Thought I did a good job of staying positive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Smith  is set to bump Steven Kampfer from the lineup after  he  and Staal had a very difficult night against the Blackhawks on Wednesday at United Center  a 6-3 loss that ended the Blueshirts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 six-game winning streak. That team-wide success got the season back on solid ground  but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also what kept  Smith  from the lineup.  He  had not quite built up enough capital with Vigneault to stay in.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLogically  some guys have more money in the bank than others \u00e2\u0080\u009d Vigneault said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody has to show me something   he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only one. Everyone has to come out and play well  that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we expect as a group.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis was the longest time  Smith  has sat out in  his  seven-year career  and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t made any easier by constantly having to answer the questions about it. But  he  understood that was part of the process  especially after signing a new deal.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a lot of ups and downs when it comes to being sat out \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Smith  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah  you have to try to stay positive and make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting better every day because [if not]  then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to find yourself in a hole and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to do that. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to try to get that rust off real quick at the start and then play my game.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut what had undercut his own individual performance early in the season was very similar to what undid the team \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when things were going badly  they all tried to do too much.

Blake Griffin \u00e2\u0080\u0099s injury Monday night serves as the end of an era for the Clippers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one that was good  but not as good as it could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been. (Jae C. Hong/AP)\nAs  Blake Griffin  limped off the court at Staples Center on Monday night  the best era in Los Angeles Clippers history left with  him .\nSome of the faces remain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least for now. Doc Rivers is still the coach  and DeAndre Jordan is the starting center.  Griffin   meanwhile  is in the first year of a five-year max contract  and the MCL sprain  he  suffered Monday night when Austin Rivers fell into  his  leg will only keep  him  out of the lineup for a couple of months  as opposed to the rest of the season.\nThe writing on the wall for this run ended when Paul left for Houston this summer  as Redick followed him out the door to Philadelphia shortly thereafter. Even though the Clippers did well in getting a nice haul for Paul \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Patrick Beverley  Sam Dekker  Montrezl Harrell and a 2018 first-round pick \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while keeping  Griffin  and signing Danilo Gallinari and Milos Teodosic in free agency  it felt like a roster that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit together. It was also heavily reliant on several players with significant injury questions in  Griffin   Beverley  Gallinari and Teodosic.\nNow all four of them are on the shelf \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Beverley for the season following knee surgery  Griffin for the next two months  Teodosic for at least another month and Gallinari for at least another week. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also on the shelf is any hope of these Clippers making the playoffs  as it seems impossible they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to remain within striking distance of a playoff spot until  Griffin  comes back.\nRivers has been rumored in NBA circles to be on the verge of losing his job for weeks as the Clippers have floundered to start the season (and after he was demoted from running the basketball operations department this summer)  and those rumors will only intensify if the Clippers fall even further with  Griffin  sidelined. Meanwhile  Jordan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name is coming up in trade conversations  though it could be difficult to find a landing spot that returns any kind of real value \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least without taking on bad deals for more years than Jordan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expiring contract. Lou Williams  a talented scorer on an expiring deal  also feels like a piece that could be moved to a contender to bring some kind of assets back  and while moving on from Gallinari would be wise  his price tag (two more years at more than $20 million per) and injury history will make doing so difficult.\nThe Clippers have transformed from a laughingstock to a contender over the past several years  a once unthinkable change for a franchise that was defined for so long by dysfunction and embarrassment.

Certainly  Game 3 of the National League Division Series  won  2-1  by the Chicago Cubs over the Washington Nationals  was a kind of paradise for second-guessing. In fact  some might say the final score was: Decisions that blew up on Dusty Baker (2) over Decision that blew up on Joe Maddon (1).\nAsked whether he\u2019d heard Rizzo yelling  Baker said  \u201cNah  I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d have screamed  too.\u201d\nSoon  it was Baker\u2019s turn. In the seventh inning with one out  Ben Zobrist broke up what had been a marvelous  downright gallant no-hit bid by Max Scherzer  who had spent the last nine days wondering whether the next time he pitched full-bore he might blow out his tight right hamstring and be done for the year. Before this game  Scherzer said he figured he would be good for maybe 100 pitches. He was at 98.\n Baker  called for Solis. The Cubs countered with the dangerous Albert Almora Jr.  who hit .342 against southpaws this year. Almora singled home the tying run on a change-up that stayed \u2014 up.\nFinally  in the brutal eighth  in a decision and a moment that may be the most painful of the Nationals\u2019 season if they do not rebound from this deficit   Baker  decided not to intentionally walk Rizzo  the Cubs\u2019 top RBI man \u2014 by miles \u2014 and instead bring in lefty specialist Perez to cope with him. It was a journeyman-with-a-specialty against a superstar.\n Baker  had options.  He  could have walked Rizzo and let Brandon Kintzler  an all-star closer this year for the Minnesota Twins  pitch to Cubs cleanup man Willson Contreras  who is powerful but strikeout prone.  He  could even have (perhaps) overmanaged and brought in  his  best pure-stuff right-hander  Ryan Madson  to face Contreras to try to overpower  him .\nInstead   Baker  believed in Perez. And  since this is baseball  Perez won the battle but lost the game. Perez jammed Rizzo  forcing that weak  sickly blooper into left field. That  anyway  is how it was described by  several Nats  including Baker . To the Cubs  it was a perfectly placed clutch hit.\nFor the record  as they say  with perfect hindsight  I think that  the Nats  may have managed as if the playoffs were different from the regular season \u2014 which is a current vogue. If this game had been played in August  I suspect there would have been little complexity.\nAnd better options might have been chosen \u2014 ones that did not end up with  the Nats  losing a huge game in which neither of their two best relievers  Madson or Sean Doolittle  ever appeared.\nCould that all have worked out so simply? Kintzler in the seventh  Madson in the eighth and Doolittle in the ninth to put the Nats one win from the National League Championship Series? For what it\u2019s worth  not one Nat  and I asked several  had any problem with any Baker move. One veteran said  \u201cWe are a solid team \u2014 in every area. It\u2019s not like we have a couple of good relievers and nobody else we trust. Our bullpen is good all the way through now.

Trump . (AP /Carolyn Kaster)\nSo much for the metaphysics of dynamic growth.  The Trump team  late last year argued the tax package would unleash so much economic activity that the Treasury wouldn\u2019t notice a permanent  40 percent reduction in the corporate rate (the real reduction turned out to be 14 percent). The contention didn't survive the winter.\n\u2014 Plan shifts burden to state and private money. NYT's Patricia Cohen and Alan Rappeport: \" Trump \u2019s $200 billion plan to rebuild America upends the criteria that have long been used to pick ambitious federal projects  putting little emphasis on how much an infrastructure proposal benefits the public and more on finding private investors and other outside sources of money. Unveiled on Monday  the infrastructure program that  Mr. Trump  has championed since the campaign is intended to attract a huge amount of additional money from states  localities and private investors. The goal is to generate a total pot of $1.5 trillion to upgrade the country\u2019s highways  airports and railroads. Those financial priorities are crystallized in the new guidelines established by the White House. The ability to find sources of funding outside the federal government will be the most important yardstick  accounting for 70 percent of the formula for choosing infrastructure projects. How \u201cthe project will spur economic and social returns on investment\u201d ranks at the bottom  at just 5 percent.\"\nDems say  Trump  wants to cuts more than  he  spends. The Post's John Wagner: \"Besides unveiling  his  infrastructure plan   Trump  also released  his  2019 budget blueprint Monday. Combing through it  the office of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) identified more than $240 billion in proposed cuts over the coming decade to an array of existing infrastructure programs \u2014 a higher number than what  Trump  is proposing in 'new' spending.\"\n Trump  weighed in this morning:\nOur infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except  of course  the Democrats.

Politico's Sarah Ferris: \"Alongside its original budget request  the  Trump  administration Monday also released the details of what it would recommend doing with the extra money for domestic programs included in Congress' spending deal enacted last week. That includes an increase to the State Department  which the administration\u2019s original document proposed to slash by 30 percent this coming fiscal year. The extra cash would go into the budget for the United Nations  humanitarian aid and global AIDS programs.
