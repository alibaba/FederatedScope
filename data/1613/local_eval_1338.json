This test demonstrates that \n        North Korean long range ballistic missiles can now reach South \n        Korea, Japan, and Guam and can travel 2,000 miles over Japan \n        into the Pacific Ocean.\n            (6) North Korea ordered inspectors out of the country and \n        walked away from the 6 party talks on April 14, 2009.\n            (7) North Korea has deployed the Musudan intermediate range \n        ballistic missile which can threaten Okinawa and Guam, 200 No \n        Dong missiles which can reach Japan, and 600 Scud missiles \n        which threaten South Korea.\n            (8) On April 29, 2009, North Korea threatened to conduct a \n        nuclear test and an intercontinental ballistic missile unless \n        the United Nations Security Council apologized for imposing \n        sanctions against North Korea.\n            (9) North Korea, in violation of United Nations Security \n        Council resolution 1718, conducted a nuclear test on May 25, \n        2009.\n            (10) North Korea's missile launch and nuclear test \n        demonstrate present international diplomatic efforts are not \n        sufficient to deter North Korea from developing, deploying, and \n        launching missiles or developing nuclear technology.\n            (11) North Korea has test-fired six short-range missiles \n        off the country's east coast since the May 25, 2009, nuclear \n        test.\n            (12) Recently North Korea has asserted it is no longer \n        bound by the armistice which ended the Korean War and has \n        threatened war against the United States, South Korea, and \n        Japan.\n            (13) North Korea leads the world in missile proliferation.\n            (14) North Korea is known to share ballistic missile \n        technology with other weapons proliferating nations such as \n        Iran.\n            (15) North Korea aided Syria with its nuclear program.\n            (16) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency said on \n        June 9, 2009, ``The United States has fine-tuned its ability to \n        shoot down long-range missiles that could be launched by North \n        Korea based on a trio of tests mimicking such an attack.''.\n            (17) On February 3, 2009, the Government of Iran \n        successfully launched its first satellite into orbit--an act in \n        direct violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n        1737.\n            (18) General Maples, Director of the Defense Intelligence \n        Agency, recently said, ``Iran's February 3, 2009, launch of the \n        Safir space launch vehicle shows progress in mastering \n        technology needed to produce ICBMs.''.\n            (19) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama said, ``So \n        let me be clear: Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity \n        poses a real threat, not just to the United States, but to \n        Iran's neighbors and our allies.''.\n            (20) On May 19, 2009, the Government of Iran test-fired a \n        new two-stage, medium-range, solid fuel, surface-to-surface \n        missile, which can reach Europe, Israel, and United States \n        forces deployed in the Persian Gulf Region.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The People's Republic of China comprises one-fifth of \n        the world's population, or 1,200,000,000 people, and its \n        policies have a profound effect on the world economy and global \n        security.\n            (2) The People's Republic of China is a permanent member of \n        the United Nations Security Council and plays an important role \n        in regional organizations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic \n        Cooperation Forum and the ASEAN Regional Forum.\n            (3) The People's Republic of China is a nuclear power with \n        the largest standing army in the world, and has been rapidly \n        modernizing and expanding its military capabilities.\n            (4) The People's Republic of China is currently undergoing \n        a change of leadership which will have dramatic implications \n        for the political and economic future of the Chinese people and \n        for China's relations with the United States.\n            (5) China's estimated $600,000,000,000 economy has enjoyed \n        unparalleled growth in recent years.\n            (6) Economic liberalization in China has hastened \n        development of an informed middle class which demands greater \n        political and civil freedom; therefore, the Chinese people, \n        including a number of dissidents, favor increased economic \n        contacts between the United States and China.\n            (7) Despite increased economic linkages between the United \n        States and China, bilateral relations have deteriorated \n        significantly because of fundamental policy differences over a \n        variety of important foreign policy issues.\n            (8) The People's Republic of China has violated \n        international standards regarding the nonproliferation of \n        weapons of mass destruction.\n            (9) According to the State Department Country Report on \n        Human Rights Practices for 1994, there continue to be \n        ``widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in China, \n        in violation of internationally accepted norms . . . \n        (including) arbitrary and lengthy incommunicado detention, \n        torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. . . . The regime \n        continued severe restrictions on freedom of speech, press, \n        assembly and association, and tightened control on the exercise \n        of these rights during 1994. Serious human rights abuses \n        persisted in Tibet and other areas populated by ethnic \n        minorities.''.\n            (10) The unjustified and arbitrary arrest, imprisonment, \n        and initiation of criminal proceedings against Harry Wu, a \n        citizen of the United States, has greatly exacerbated the \n        deterioration in relations between the United States and the \n        People's Republic of China, and all charges against him should \n        be dismissed.\n            (11) The United States currently has numerous sanctions on \n        the People's Republic of China with respect to government-to-\n        government assistance, arms sales, and other commercial \n        transactions.\n            (12) It is in the interest of the United States to foster \n        China's continued engagement in the broadest range of \n        international fora and increased respect for human rights, \n        democratic institutions, and the rule of law in China.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Care for Vulnerable Older \nCitizens through Workforce Advancement Act of 2017''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As of 2012, more than 41,000,000 Americans are age 65 \n        or older. More than 75 percent of them suffer from chronic \n        conditions which require person-centered, coordinated care that \n        helps them to live in a home- or community-based setting. In \n        2012, the Government Accountability Office found that 34 \n        percent of Americans age 60 and older reported needing \n        assistance performing Activities of Daily Living.\n            (2) Direct-care workers (referred to in this section as \n        ``DCWs'') provide an estimated 70 to 80 percent of the paid \n        hands-on long-term care and personal assistance received by \n        elders and people with disabilities or other chronic conditions \n        in the United States. These workers help their clients bathe, \n        dress, and negotiate a host of other daily tasks. They are a \n        lifeline for those they serve, as well as for families and \n        friends struggling to provide quality care.\n            (3) Eldercare and disability services positions account for \n        nearly one-third of the 18,000,000 health care jobs in the \n        United States. The direct-care workforce alone accounts for \n        more than 4,000,000 jobs, expected to add 1,600,000 new \n        positions by 2020.\n            (4) The majority of DCWs are now employed in home- and \n        community-based settings, and not in institutional settings \n        such as nursing care facilities or hospitals. By 2020, home- \n        and community-based DCWs are likely to outnumber facility \n        workers by more than 2 to 1.\n            (5) A 2008 Institute of Medicine report, entitled ``Re-\n        tooling for an Aging America: Building the Health Care \n        Workforce'', called for new models of care delivery and \n        coordination, and dedicated a chapter to the central importance \n        of the direct-care workforce in a ``re-tooled'' eldercare \n        delivery system.\n            (6) An Institute of Medicine report on the future of \n        nursing, released in October of 2010, recommended nurses should \n        practice to the full extent of their education and training. \n        The report also states that all health care professionals \n        should work collaboratively in team-based models, and that the \n        goal should be to encourage care models that use every member \n        of the team to the full capacity of his or her training and \n        skills.\n            (7) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public \n        Law 111-148) emphasizes the need for improving care and \n        lowering costs by better coordination of care and integration \n        of services, particularly for consumers with multiple chronic \n        conditions. This will require developing new models of care for \n        those receiving long-term services and supports.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An individual who is 65 years of age needs 4 times the \n        amount of light to see at night as compared to an individual \n        who is 25 years of age.\n            (2) The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety projects that by \n        2030 1 in every 4 drivers will be 65 years of age or older.\n            (3) Increasing the retroreflectivity and size of traffic \n        signs provides added decision time for older drivers.\n            (4) Increasing the retroreflectivity and size of traffic \n        signs also provides for faster response time by emergency \n        medical technicians and police and fire personnel by increasing \n        their ability to read and understand signs and reduce travel \n        time to a site.\n            (5) More than 50 percent of traffic accidents resulting in \n        fatalities occur at night, and increased retroreflectivity of \n        traffic signs addresses this issue.\n            (6) In 2007, the following deadlines were established in \n        the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices in response to a \n        statutory requirement from Congress:\n                    (A) By January 22, 2012, roadway owners must adopt \n                a plan to ensure that their signs meet minimum levels \n                of retroreflectivity.\n                    (B) By January 22, 2015, regulatory and warning \n                signs and post-mounted signs must meet minimum levels \n                of retroreflectivity.\n                    (C) By January 22, 2018, overhead and street name \n                signs must meet minimum levels of retroreflectivity.\n            (7) The Federal Highway Administration has estimated that \n        the cost for making these retroreflectivity improvements for \n        signage throughout the United States is $37,000,000 over a 10-\n        year period.\n            (8) At no point must a roadway owner replace a sign that \n        meets the minimum levels of retroreflectivity.\n            (9) The United States is currently experiencing the worst \n        economic conditions since the Great Depression.\n            (10) As a result, local governments across the United \n        States are experiencing one of the most economically \n        challenging times in history, with available revenues unable to \n        match the costs of services demanded by the public.\n            (11) To compensate for depressed revenue collections during \n        the economic downturn, counties and cities are adopting severe \n        cost-cutting measures, such as laying off and furloughing \n        employees (including public safety personnel), cancelling or \n        postponing planned capital improvements, deferring necessary \n        maintenance, cutting equipment inventories, and in some cases \n        declaring bankruptcy.\n            (12) The costs of employee benefits continue to rise and \n        local governments have to devote more resources to keep up with \n        inflation.\n            (13) States are passing along the costs of services to \n        local governments as a method to balance their budgets.\n            (14) The outlook for recovery appears to be at least 5 \n        years away given that, even when the economy recovers, local \n        governments experience a delay in increased tax collections due \n        to the nature of property tax collections.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Portable Generator Safety Act of \n2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Portable generators are frequently used to provide \n        electricity during temporary power outages. These generators \n        use fuel-burning engines that emit carbon monoxide gas in their \n        exhaust.\n            (2) In the last several years, hundreds of people \n        nationwide have been seriously injured or killed due to \n        exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning from portable generators. \n        From 2000 through 2006, at least 260 carbon monoxide poisoning \n        deaths related to portable generator use were reported to the \n        Consumer Product Safety Commission. In the last three months of \n        2006 alone, 32 carbon monoxide deaths were linked to generator \n        use.\n            (3) Virtually all of the serious injuries and deaths due to \n        carbon monoxide from portable generators were preventable. In \n        many instances, consumers simply were unaware of the hazards \n        posed by carbon monoxide.\n            (4) Since at least 1997, a priority of the Consumer Product \n        Safety Commission has been to reduce injuries and deaths \n        resulting from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n            (5) On January 4, 2007, the Consumer Product Safety \n        Commission adopted certain labeling standards for portable \n        generators (section 1407 of title 16, Code of Federal \n        Regulations), but such standards do not go far enough to reduce \n        substantially the potential harm to consumers.\n            (6) The issuance of mandatory safety standards and labeling \n        requirements to warn consumers of the dangers associated with \n        portable generator carbon monoxide would reduce the risk of \n        injury or death.\n\nSEC. 3.

The acquisition of these lands would provide Federal \n    ownership of this valuable land in a critical area of Admiralty \n    Island National Monument.\n        (4) The United States is the owner of certain reversionary \n    interests to 143.87 acres, more or less, located adjacent to Silver \n    Bay near Sitka, Alaska, which interests were reserved in patent No. \n    1213671 issued to the Alaska Pulp Corporation on October 18, 1960. \n    The transfer of the reversionary interests of the United States in \n    such lands adjacent to Silver Bay to the Alaska Pulp Corporation \n    would facilitate future use and development of that land.\n        (5) The future acquisition by the United States of the Chaik \n    Bay property on Admiralty Island to be incorporated into the \n    Kootznoowoo Wilderness would be in the public interest.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Investments in infrastructure create jobs while \n        fulfilling critical needs in communities throughout the United \n        States.\n            (2) According to the Brookings Institution, nearly 14.5 \n        million workers--11 percent of the U.S. workforce--were \n        employed in infrastructure jobs in 2013.\n            (3) According to data from the Brookings Institution, \n        infrastructure occupations often provide more competitive and \n        equitable wages in comparison to all jobs nationally, \n        consistently paying up to 30 percent more to low-income workers \n        over the past decade.\n            (4) The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the \n        infrastructure of the United States an overall grade of ``D+'' \n        in 2017 and estimated that the United States will need to \n        invest $4.59 trillion by 2025 in order to improve the condition \n        of the Nation's infrastructure and bring it to a state of good \n        repair.\n            (5) The American Society of Civil Engineers assigned a \n        ``D'' grade to the Nation's roads, a ``C+'' grade to the \n        Nation's bridges, and a ``D-'' grade to the Nation's transit \n        systems and estimated that the United States will need to \n        invest $2.04 trillion by 2025 to bring the Nation's surface \n        transportation infrastructure to a state of good repair.\n            (6) TIGER, formally known as the Transportation Investment \n        Generating Economic Recovery grant program, is a nationwide \n        competitive grant program that creates jobs by funding \n        investments in transportation infrastructure by States, local \n        governments, and transit agencies.\n            (7) TIGER funds projects that will have a significant \n        impact on the Nation, a metropolitan area, or a region.\n            (8) In distributing grants under TIGER, the Secretary of \n        Transportation is required to ensure an equitable geographic \n        distribution of funds, a balance in addressing the needs of \n        urban and rural areas, and investments in a variety of modes of \n        transportation.\n            (9) TIGER received an appropriation of $600,000,000 in \n        fiscal year 2014, an appropriation of $500,000,000 in fiscal \n        year 2015, and an appropriation of $500,000,000 in fiscal year \n        2016.\n            (10) Past appropriations for TIGER are not sufficient to \n        address the need for investments in transportation \n        infrastructure in communities throughout the United States as \n        the amounts only fund a small fraction of the transportation \n        infrastructure projects for which TIGER grant applications have \n        been received.\n            (11) Appropriating $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2017 for \n        TIGER and allowing the funds to remain available for 6 years \n        will enable the Secretary of Transportation to begin \n        immediately to expand investments in transportation \n        infrastucture throughout the United States.\n            (12) Restricting appropriations for TIGER through the use \n        of arbitrary budget caps or sequestration undermines economic \n        recovery and job creation efforts; disrupts planning by States, \n        local governments, and transit agencies; and leaves critical \n        infrastructure needs unmet.\n            (13) Emergency supplemental appropriations for TIGER, \n        provided in addition to other appropriations and not subject to \n        sequestration, will improve transportation infrastructure and \n        create jobs throughout the United States without reducing \n        funding for other domestic priorities.\n            (14) An emergency supplemental appropriation of $7.5 \n        billion for TIGER to be made available in fiscal year 2017 and \n        to remain available for 6 years will allow the Secretary of \n        Transportation to begin immediately to organize new \n        competitions for TIGER grants and allow States, local \n        governments, and transit agencies to prepare grant \n        applications, thus ensuring an efficient use of funds and \n        timely job creation.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n        that between the periods 1988 to 1994 and between 1994 and \n        2004, tooth decay increased 15 percent among toddlers and \n        preschoolers 2 to 5 years old.\n            (2) During the period 1999 to 2004, 28 percent of young \n        children experienced cavities.\n            (3) Among 2 year olds in the United States, 1-in-10 already \n        have cavities, and by age 5 that figure jumps to 2-in-5 \n        children.\n            (4) Tooth decay is the single most common childhood chronic \n        disease, and it disproportionately affects poor and minority \n        children.\n            (5) Eighty percent of dental decay occurs in just 25 \n        percent of children.\n            (6) Parents are 3 times more likely to report that their \n        children's dental needs are unmet, when compared with general \n        medical care needs.\n            (7) While 9,000,000 of the children in this Nation do not \n        have medical insurance, more than twice that number--\n        23,000,000--do not have dental insurance.\n            (8) One out of 20 middle-aged adults in the United States \n        are missing all their teeth.\n            (9) More than 40 percent of low income adults have at least \n        1 untreated decayed tooth compared to 16 percent of non-poor \n        adults.\n            (10) Employed adults lose more than 164,000,000 hours of \n        work each year due to oral health problems or dental visits.\n            (11) For every adult 19 years or older without medical \n        insurance, there are 3 without dental insurance.\n            (12) About 25 percent of adults 60 years old and older no \n        longer have any natural teeth. Having missing teeth can affect \n        nutrition, since people without teeth often prefer soft, easily \n        chewed foods.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2008, during a year of record-high gas prices, \n        people in the United States took more than 10,500,000,000 trips \n        using public transportation, the highest level in 50 years.\n            (2) Public transportation use in the United States is up 31 \n        percent since 1995, a figure that is more than double the \n        growth rate of the Nation's population and is substantially \n        greater than the growth rate for vehicle miles traveled on the \n        Nation's highways for that same period.\n            (3) High gas prices in 2011 are expected to drive the \n        demand for transit services even higher, with some estimates \n        showing that $5-per-gallon gas could result in a nearly 15 \n        percent jump in transit ridership.\n            (4) Based on the price of gas in March 2011, riding public \n        transportation saves households an average of $825 per month, \n        or nearly $10,000 per year.\n            (5) Despite increasing demand for transit services, \n        widespread cuts in State and local funding have caused 59 \n        percent of public transit systems in the United States to raise \n        fares or cut service since January 2009.\n            (6) Although under existing laws Federal employees in the \n        National Capital Region receive transit benefits, transit \n        benefits should be available to all Federal employees in the \n        United States so that the Federal Government sets a leading \n        example of greater public transportation use.\n            (7) Public transportation stakeholders should engage and \n        involve local communities in the education and promotion of the \n        importance of utilizing public transportation.\n            (8) Increasing public transportation use is a national \n        priority.\n\nSEC. 3.

Revises the formula for price determinations for crude helium sales to eliminate all factors but inflation adjustments. \nRevises stockpile elimination guidelines to mandate that half the Federal helium reserves be placed under the authority of the Secretary of Defense, who shall determine and implement helium storage, transportation, and use.  States that the Federal Government shall forgive any debt owed on such reserves.  Retains the remaining Federal helium under the authority of the Secretary of the Interior. Instructs such Secretary to appoint an Investment Administrator to sell the helium reserves and their attendant production, refining, and marketing assets unless the Secretary of Defense determines such assets are essential to Department of Defense transportation or storage needs.  Mandates payment of helium sales proceeds to the Treasury, with a percentage of such proceeds paid as salary to the Administrator pursuant to an agreement between the Administrator and the Secretary of the Interior. \nStates that such Administrator shall be selected from individuals who submit and make an oral presentation of a written helium disposal plan (including any unobligated natural gas reserves and real estate used in helium refinement and production). \nAuthorizes the Secretary of the Interior to determine a sales price in consultation with the helium industry, and to sell helium during the period in which no Investment Administrator has been selected. \nDeclares that discovery of additional helium reserves shall not affect the duties of the Secretaries to make helium sales. \nNarrows solely to reserves under the authority of the Secretary of Defense the scope of a currently mandated National Academy of Sciences study on whether disposal of helium reserves will have a substantial adverse effect on U.S. scientific, technical, biomedical, or national security interests. \nRepeals the mandate that the Secretary of Defense make recommendations to the Congress on how to avoid potential adverse effects upon such U.S. interests by sales of crude helium reserves.", "category": "Summarization 751.json"}]
