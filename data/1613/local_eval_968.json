Unfortunately, our Caesar salads looked like coleslaw and were devoid of any \\\"Caesar\\\" taste.  \\n\\nOur entrees were bountiful, but it was quite obvious each came from a different batch.

I insisted on staying in the hotel for dinner because we were pretty tired from the drive (Palm Springs to AZ, approximately four hours) and we had bounced around the near by downtown area for lunch anyway. The place was quiet, but then again, it was also a Sunday night. Caf\\u00e9 Zuzu had a nice romantic ambiance to it. Kind of dark and the booths were put up against the wall, facing out to the dining room so it had a cool lounge feel to it too. \\nThe service was really good. Our server was knowledgeable, patient, and friendly. I couldn't make up my mind about what I wanted to eat and she was very patient and helpful with helping me make my decision. She explained the way things were cooked and what they were served with. I settled with sharing the stroganoff with my boyfriend and we ordered two sides; onion rings and mac and cheese.\\nFirst the stroganoff; OMG I cannot wait to go back and have it again. I am a seriously serious mushroom fan and the mushrooms in the stroganoff were HUGE and perfectly cooked. The meet in it was filet and it was tendered and cooked to perfection. I could have done without the sour cream on top because the sauce was perfect in itself.\\nAs for the mac and cheese, that was amazingly delicious as well! The three different cheeses gave it an adult indulgence type of mac and cheese flavor. The three cheeses they chose (I'm not sure which cheeses the used) to mix were flavored in perfect harmony. I'm so glad I picked it! The onion rings were good too. Nothing really special there. However the dipping sauce was pretty yummy. It was aioli something or rather.

I supposed there was really nothing they could do.

The 1st time I came here I bought 1 smoothie and a juice totalled to be $13.21. Instead I was charge $1300.21. If I didn't check my bank statement I would have never known. When I went to have it corrected no one knew what to do so it took 2 days for staff to figure out how to fix the situation. I got a $50 gc for waiting 2 hrs while they tried to fix it. I again came back to purchase using my gc and every time I go it it takes over 30 mins to get a smoothie. It's never completely packed. Last week I ordered a Pitaya bowl and the person making it clearly didn't look at the ticket and made an acai tropical bowl. So I asked if they had different products and she said oh I'm sorry I thought it was something else. Took 30 mins. Then a couple ordered and another staff member came from the back sucking on her fingers from eating something in the back, didnt wash her hands just put gloves on and made 2 bowls. Being in the health profession I was highly disgusted. Today I'm on my lunch break and I place my order and the cashier asked if it was ok if it would take 25-30 mins on my smoothie and Pitaya bowl I said no not really why are ticket orders so long and her response was \\\"Idk that's a good question.\\\" Mmmm ok if you know this is a constant issue why is it not being addressed. I wasted my whole hour lunch break waiting on a smoothie and a bowl for 45 mins. I just don't understand.  Nothing is being cooked.
