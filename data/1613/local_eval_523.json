The current study was designed to determine whether onsite adequacy assessment results in a significant decrease in nondiagnostic specimens between ultrasound (US)-guided FNAs of the thyroid and those performed by palpation alone.', 'A search was performed to identify in-house thyroid FNAs performed between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2003 that were obtained under US guidance or by palpation only. It was then recorded whether an onsite adequacy assessment was performed. The submitting physician and final diagnosis also were recorded for each case. Contingency tables were constructed and evaluated using chi-square analysis.', 'Of 1502 in-house thyroid FNAs included in the current study, 981 (65.3%) were performed under US guidance and 521 (34.7%) were performed with palpation alone. Onsite adequacy assessment of the aspirated material was performed in 323 cases (21.5%), whereas 1179 cases (78.5%) were performed without onsite evaluation. Of the 418 palpation-guided FNAs that were performed without adequacy assessment, 70 (16.7%) were reported to be nondiagnostic, whereas of the 103 palpation-guided FNAs with immediate evaluation, only 7 (6.8%) were determined to be inadequate for diagnosis. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.025). Of 761 US-guided FNAs without immediate adequacy assessment, 54 (7.1%) were nondiagnostic, which was not statistically different from the nondiagnostic rate of 4.5% (10 of 220 cases) for US-guided FNAs with onsite evaluation. However, when these US-guided FNAs were divided further into 2 groups based on the experience of the radiologist performing the FNA, the nondiagnostic rate in the group of experienced radiologists was only 5.4% (or 32 of 592 US-guided FNAs), even though onsite evaluation was not performed. Among radiologists with less experience, adequacy assessment significantly reduced the nondiagnostic rate from 13.0% (22 of 169 FNAs without adequacy assessment) to 4.5% (10 of 220 FNAs with adequacy assessment) (P < 0.01).\nAnswer: The results of the current study demonstrate that onsite adequacy assessment of thyroid FNAs significantly reduces the number of nondiagnostic aspirates. However, the benefit of onsite evaluation, at least for US-guided FNAs, depends on the experience of the radiologist. In the current study, experienced radiologists with a relatively low nondiagnostic rate did not benefit from onsite adequacy assessment. This finding confirms the importance of experience in the performance of FNA, but suggests that onsite adequacy assessment may assist the less experienced operator.", "output": "Is the value of onsite adequacy assessment of thyroid fine-needle aspirations a function of operator experience?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

Although T cells contribute to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), it is unknown whether negative T cell-dependent TIM-3 co-stimulation may rescue IR-stressed orthotopic liver transplants from innate immunity-driven inflammation.', 'We used wild type (WT) and TIM-3 transgenic (Tg) mice (C57BL/6) as liver donors and recipients in a clinically-relevant model of hepatic cold storage (20 h at 4\u00b0C in UW solution) and syngeneic orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).', \"Orthotopic liver transplants in WT or TIM-3Tg\u2192TIM-3Tg groups were resistant against IR-stress, evidenced by preserved hepatocellular function (serum ALT levels) and liver architecture (Suzuki's score). In contrast, orthotopic liver transplants in WT or TIM-3Tg\u2192WT groups were susceptible to IRI. TIM-3 induction in circulating CD4+ T cells of the recipient: (1) depressed T-bet/IFN-\u03b3, while amplifying GATA3 and IL-4/IL-10 expression in orthotopic liver transplants; (2) promoted T cell exhaustion (PD-1, LAG-3) phenotype; and (3) depressed neutrophil and macrophage infiltration/function in orthotopic liver transplants. In parallel studies, we documented for the first time that Gal-9, a natural TIM-3 ligand, was produced primarily by and released from IR-stressed hepatocytes, both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, exogenous recombinant Gal-9 (rGal-9) potentiated liver resistance against IRI by depressing T cell activation and promoting apoptosis of CD4+ T cells.\nAnswer: Harnessing TIM-3/Gal-9 signalling at the T cell-hepatocyte interface facilitates homeostasis in IR-stressed orthotopic liver transplants. Enhancing anti-oxidant hepatocyte Gal-9 potentiates liver IR-resistance.

Phenotyping of all patients was based on fundoscopy, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography.', 'We measured the allele frequencies of 25 AMD-associated SNPs and CFH haplotype frequencies in patients with cCSC and the effect of phenotypic subdivision of cCSC on genetic associations.', 'One SNP in ARMS2 (rs10490924) was significant after Bonferroni correction (Punadjusted=0.002; odds ratio [OR]=0.64). The SNPs at 3 other AMD loci (CFH, TNFRSF10A, ADAMTS9) showed a trend toward association with typical cCSC. Further analysis of the CFH locus identified 2 SNPs that significantly conferred increased risk for cCSC and 1 that was protective. The CFH-H3 haplotype was also found to be protective (P=0.01; OR=0.54). Using multimodal imaging, 197 patients were classified as having typical cCSC, 52 patients had unilateral abnormalities on FA that were otherwise typical of cCSC, and 43 patients had a clinical picture that could be compatible with cCSC, but with features that could also indicate other macular diseases. Significant differences of the minor allele frequencies of the tested SNPs were observed between these 3 phenotypic subgroups.\nAnswer: Chronic CSC is associated with genetic variants in ARMS2 and CFH, indicating a genetic and pathophysiologic overlap between cCSC and AMD. Intriguingly, alleles in ARMS2 and CFH that confer risk of AMD may be protective for cCSC, and alleles in CFH that are protective for AMD confer risk for cCSC.

In the present study, we aimed at finding brain areas that most discriminate dyslexic from control normal readers despite the large variance across subjects. After segmenting brain grey matter, normalizing brain size and shape and modulating the voxels' content, normal readers' brains were used to build a 'typical' brain via bootstrapped confidence intervals.

Furthermore, cerebellar and lentiform grey matter volumes interacted in dyslexic subjects, so that lower and higher lentiform grey matter volumes compared to controls differently modulated the phonological and lexical performances. Best performances (observed in controls) corresponded to an optimal value of grey matter and they dropped for higher or lower volumes.\nAnswer: These results provide evidence for the existence of various subtypes of dyslexia characterized by different brain phenotypes.

This mouse model exhibits progressive cardiac dysfunction leading to lethal arrhythmias.', 'Subcutaneous administration of aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, significantly suppressed the progression of pathological cardiac remodelling and improved survival among dnNRSF-Tg mice while reducing arrhythmogenicity. Genetic deletion of the angiotensin type 1a receptor (AT1aR) similarly suppressed cardiac remodelling and sudden death. In optical mapping analyses, spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF) initiated by breakthrough-type excitations originating from focal activation sites and maintained by functional re-entry were observed in dnNRSF-Tg hearts. Under constant pacing, dnNRSF-Tg hearts exhibited markedly slowed conduction velocity, which likely contributes to the arrhythmogenic substrate. Aliskiren treatment increased conduction velocity and reduced the incidence of sustained VT. These effects were associated with suppression of cardiac fibrosis and restoration of connexin 43 expression in dnNRSF-Tg ventricles.\nAnswer: Renin inhibition or genetic deletion of AT1aR suppresses pathological cardiac remodelling that leads to the generation of substrates maintaining VT/VF and reduces the occurrence of sudden death in dnNRSF-Tg mice.

The effective orifice area index was calculated for each patient on the basis of the projected prosthesis in vivo effective orifice area. It was considered a continuous variable and influence of its entire range of values on the extent of left ventricular mass regression was analyzed in a multivariate prediction model.', 'Even though, in the group with prosthesis-patient mismatch there was a trend for lower postoperative left ventricular mass index (115+/-24 g/m(2) vs 102+/-27 g/m(2), p=0.24) and postoperative peak trans-prosthetic gradients (32+/-9.8 mmHg vs 28.9+/-7.79 mmHg, p=0.35) these differences were not statistically significant. The prevalence of residual left ventricular hypertrophy at follow-up was 50% in the group with patient-prosthesis mismatch and 50% in the group without patient-prosthesis mismatch (p=0.83). In multivariate analysis the only factors associated with indexed left ventricular mass were the follow-up time (p=0.015, r(2)=0.22) and preoperative indexed left ventricular mass (p=0.0012, r(2)=0.11).\nAnswer: The major finding of our study is that patient-prosthesis mismatch does not affect left ventricular mass regression in patients older than 65 with pure aortic stenosis who underwent mechanical aortic valve replacement. In older patients with low cardiac output requirements, even a small change in the valve effective orifice area after aortic valve replacement with modern efficient mechanical prosthesis, will result in a marked reduction of pressure gradient and this will be associated with a significant regression of left ventricular mass.", "output": "Does indexed effective orifice area after mechanical aortic valve replacement affect left ventricular mass regression in elderly?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

In addition to morphological criteria, an antibody to high molecular weight cytokeratins and antisera against arginine esterase were used to selectively identify basal and secretory cells. Since prostatic acid phosphatase may be involved in the local regulation of phosphotyrosine proteins, its distribution was also evaluated with a human prostatic acid phosphatase antiserum.', 'In all prostatic tissues examined, basal epithelial cells were preferentially and specifically stained with antiphosphotyrosine. The staining intensity per basal cell was highest in the estrogen-supplemented dogs. In addition, basal cells were numerically increased and all were highly immunoreactive for high molecular weight cytokeratins. In prostates displaying a well-differentiated glandular epithelium, the number of positive basal cells and their staining intensity varied in the following order: normal < hyperplastic < androgen-supplemented dogs. At all times, the levels of phosphotyrosine proteins in prostatic acid phosphatase and arginine esterase positive cells (secretory) remained low. Fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells were unreactive to antiphosphotyrosine, even though estrogen supplementation increased the prostatic stromal volume.\nAnswer: The preferential localization of phosphotyrosine proteins in basal cells, their increased level per cell and the number of positive cells in the different experimental animals support the concept that basal cells represent the stem cells of the prostate. The sex steroid-mediated up-regulation of protein phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in these cells suggests that their proliferation is likely to involve growth factor regulated signal transduction pathways. In this respect, the lack of maturation of basal cells and the differentiation of secretory cells induced by androgen deprivation, combined with estrogen stimulation, favors the activation of these pathways and cell growth.

Area at risk (AR) was determined with Evans Blue dye and infarct size after staining of the area at risk with nitroblue tetrazolium.', 'In rats, which received the vehicle for simvastatin (10% DMSO, 1 ml/kg i.v. at 1 h prior to the occlusion of the LAD), occlusion of the LAD for 25 min followed by reperfusion for 2 hours resulted in an infarct size of 54 +/- 4% (n=7) of the AR. When compared with vehicle, administration of simvastatin (1 mg/kg i.v. bolus administration at 1 h prior to the onset of myocardial ischemia) caused a significant reduction in myocardial infarct size of 39%. LAD-occlusion and reperfusion caused a progressive fall in mean arterial blood pressure (when compared with sham-operated animals). Simvastatin had no significant effect on blood pressure.\nAnswer: The result indicates that simvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and a ligand of PPAR-a and PPAR-g, reduces the tissue necrosis associated with acute myocardial infarction.

The arginine-induced insulin responses (AIR) were inversely associated with insulin sensitivity (r > or = -0.55, p < 0.001). When related to the 3-year follow-up, the baseline product of AIR at 14 mmol/l glucose times insulin sensitivity, insulin effect index (IE) (r = -0.40, p < 0.001) and the arginine-induced glucagon response at 14 mmol/l glucose (AGR, r = 0.28, p = 0.009) both correlated with follow-up 2-h glucose. In a multiple regression model, baseline 2-h glucose, insulin effect index and arginine-induced glucagon response independently predicted 2-h glucose at follow-up (total r = 0.668, p < 0.001). Furthermore, delta insulin sensitivity (i. e. follow-up minus baseline) correlated with delta insulin secretion (r = -0.30, p = 0.006), whereas delta glucagon secretion correlated with delta2-h glucose (r = 0.30, p = 0.006) over the 3 years. In a multiple regression, alterations in 2-h glucose over the 3 years were independently determined by changes in fasting insulin and glucagon secretion (r = 0.424, p < 0.001).\nAnswer: Low insulin secretion, when judged in relation to insulin sensitivity, and high glucagon secretion, determine glucose tolerance over time in the individual subject. These processes are therefore potential targets for prevention of deterioration in glucose tolerance.", "output": "Is glucose intolerance predicted by low insulin secretion and high glucagon secretion : outcome of a prospective study in postmenopausal Caucasian women?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

This study investigates the association between LA size and exercise capacity in patients with HCM.', 'All HCM patients who underwent a treadmill test with direct measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2) and a standard transthoracic echocardiography within 30 days in the years 2001-2003 were identified. Patients with significant comorbidities were excluded. Exercise capacity was defined as percentage of predicted peak VO2. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were compared with those of a group of normal subjects.', \"Compared with normal subjects, HCM patients had increased left atrial (LA) volume index (36 vs 21 mL/m2; P < .0001) and mitral E/e' ratio (14 vs 9; P < .0001); 27% of the patients had at least moderate MR. LA volume index demonstrated borderline correlation with exercise capacity (r = -.20; P = .06) but was an independent predictor of exercise capacity in a multivariate linear analysis, together with body mass index, heart rate at rest, and left ventricular end-systolic diameter. Including the parameters E/e' ratio or moderate or severe MR did not add incremental value to the model.\nAnswer: LA volume index, reflecting the combined influences of MR and diastolic dysfunction, was independently associated with objective measures of exercise capacity in patients with isolated HCM.", "output": "Is left atrial index a predictor of exercise capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

Although studies have shown the importance of various signaling molecules in BBB formation during development, little is known about the molecular basis regulating the integrity of the adult BBB.', 'Using a mouse model with tamoxifen-inducible endothelial cell-restricted disruption of ctnnb1 (iCKO), we show here that endothelial \u03b2-catenin signaling is essential for maintaining BBB integrity and central nervous system homeostasis in adult mice. The iCKO mice developed severe seizures accompanied by neuronal injury, multiple brain petechial hemorrhages, and central nervous system inflammation, and all had postictal death. Disruption of endothelial \u03b2-catenin induced BBB breakdown and downregulation of the specific tight junction proteins claudin-1 and -3 in adult brain endothelial cells. The clinical relevance of the data is indicated by the observation of decreased expression of claudin-1 and nuclear \u03b2-catenin in brain endothelial cells of hemorrhagic lesions of hemorrhagic stroke patients.\nAnswer: These results demonstrate the prerequisite role of endothelial \u03b2-catenin in maintaining the integrity of adult BBB.

This study sought to evaluate the effect of adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (aSRS) on the time to significant growth of meningioma residuals requiring retreatment.', 'A total of 119 consecutive patients (2004-2013) receiving primary surgical treatment for a meningioma in proximity to a venous structure were included. The patients were assessed retrospectively, with a focus on retreatments and mortality. Radicality of initial tumor surgery was scored using postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Three subgroups were identified: 1) radical total resection (RTR); 2) near-total resection (NTR), followed by aSRS (NTR\\xa0+ aSRS); and 3) NTR but no aSRS (NTR\\xa0- aSRS). In the NTR\\xa0- aSRS group, intervention was initiated after radiologic (magnetic resonance imaging) findings verified growth of residual tumor, in contrast to the NTR\\xa0+ aSRS group, which received aSRS before regrowth. Time to first retreatment, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival were analyzed with the log-rank test and multiple-events Cox regression.', 'RTR was associated with the best prognosis. The patients in the NTR\\xa0+ aSRS group had significantly longer time to first retreatment compared with NTR\\xa0- aSRS patients (P < 0.001). There was also a significant difference in mortality (P < 0.05) and a tendency to prolonged PFS (P\\xa0=\\xa00.07) in the NTR\\xa0+ aSRS group. The Cox regressions confirmed the positive effects of NTR\\xa0+ aSRS on time to retreatment (hazard ratio, 7.3; P < 0.01) and PFS (hazard ratio, 3.69; P\\xa0= 0.055).\nAnswer: aSRS of meningioma residuals had a positive effect on tumor control and should be considered in patients with meningioma residuals.", "output": "Does adjuvant Stereotactic Radiosurgery reduce Need for Retreatments in Patients with Meningioma Residuals?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}]
