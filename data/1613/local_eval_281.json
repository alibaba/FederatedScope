Different events were photographed by taking 'stills' from the television monitor during play-back. Outgrowths from both tumour and normal explants formed only as monolayers. Mitoses were mainly found to be localized approximately mid-way between explant and the edge of the outgrowth. Some cells were seen to become suddenly active producing oscillating blebs and sometimes they detached themselves from the monolayer culture and changed appearance. This was more prevalent in the tumour cultures. In both tumour and normal cell cultures lymphocytes were observed and their normal chemokinetic movement was changed into a rapid chemotactic attraction by the presence of a mitotic epithelial cell. These lymphocytes appear to represent T-suppressor cells. The present study has shown that primary tissue culture can be a valuable tool in the study of laryngeal carcinoma. The interaction between mitotic tumour cells and lymphocytes may represent a transformation of T-lymphocytes into LAK cells. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Carcinoma 2)Cell Movement 3)Human 4)Laryngeal Neoplasms 5)Lymphocytes 6)Microscopy 7)Mitosis 8)Photography 9)Videotape Recording", "output": "Yes", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Groups of UVB-irradiated BALB/c mice were given an intradermal injection of the mast cell degranulator compound 48/80 into ears at various time intervals (30 min-7 days) after a single exposure to a bank of fluorescent sunlamp tubes (10-100 mJ/cm2). Both the compound-evoked ear swelling response (ESR) and mast cell degranulation were significantly suppressed by preexposure to UVB (25-100 mJ/cm2) after 0 (30 min) to 3 days postirradiation, with a subsequent recovery by day 7. No such effects were observed in mice irradiated with 10 mJ/cm2. The ESR induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine was not significantly affected by UVB radiation during the experimental period. While within this dose range UV radiation itself caused neither loss of mast cell counts nor a measurable degree of degranulation in ear skin, exposure to larger amounts of UV energy (200-500 mJ/cm2) produced tremendous ear swelling with histologic features of mast cell degranulation in an early phase of inflammation. The results suggest that UVB radiation exerts a dual effect on mast cells and that administration of smaller amounts of UVB may alter the mast cell/vasoactive amine system, suppressing ear swelling in response to the degranulator. Vascular reactivities to vasoactive amines were not affected by UVB irradiation. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Cell Line 3)Drug Resistance, Microbial", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

The classical symptoms are often absent. The disease is frequently characterized by cardiac, gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. As hyperthyroidism is readily amenable to effective treatment that can improve the quality of life, the clinical suspicion of this disease is always indicated and exclusion of this diagnosis should always be pursued. Recognizing the admittedly great difficulty in making, or even suspecting, the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in the elderly, our rule is to test for hyperthyroidism in essentially all geriatric patients presenting chronic systemic symptoms or signs. On the other hand, we do not recommend community-wide screening of persons over 60 for hyperthyroidism. Community-wide screening falls far below the break-even point in cost-benefit analysis. The most sensible detector of hyperthyroidism now widely available is the serum free T3 index (FT3I), but it may be falsely normal because of the effect of systemic illness on extrathyroidal T4-to-T3 conversion. The advent of ultrasensitive methods for TSH may change these statements considerably. It may become the single screening procedure for both hyper- and hypothyroidism. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Alcohol Drinking 2)Birth Weight 3)Fathers", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}]
