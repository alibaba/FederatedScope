Last Tuesday, a ninth-grader at John F  Kennedy High School in Paterson, N.J , was caught on video throwing his 62-year-old teacher to the ground and wrestling with him in order to retrieve his cellphone , which the teacher had confiscated . Teachers at the school allow cellphones to be used for educational purposes in the classroom , but they may take them and hold them until the end of class if a student appears to be using his phone for any other purpose . Granted , the boy may have demonstrated problems controlling his impulses in other settings, too , but the video of his attack has resulted in national attention . And that's because it isn't the first dramatic example of how attached to our phones we have become . Last year, a Houston woman was shot by a mugger when she refused to hand over her cellphone . She survived , and she later asserted that she had done the right thing . In 2013, a 22-year-old man was killed by a train when he tried to retrieve the cellphone he had dropped on the tracks . Without giving a great deal of thought to the psychological implications, our species has deployed mobile technology very quickly, in a very widespread manner . One reason is that the marketplace embraced smartphones in an astounding way  -- as if our phones and their apps are a lock-and-key fit with our psyches . According to one source, there are 7 billion mobile devices on earth, one for almost each person . What is \"in\" our cellphones that would lead people to attack others or risk death to keep them? I would argue that the phones absorb and record our thoughts and intentions so dramatically that we become unconsciously convinced they are \"parts of us.\" Why else would so many people hesitate even to leave a room without taking their cellphones with them? Why would they interrupt meetings and family time to check them? Why would young people be opting to spend their money on newer, faster ones, instead of on clothing? Why would there be so much interest in personalizing the sounds they make, the apps they hold and the cases that hold them? I contend we have already crossed the Rubicon, almost irrevocably incorporating technology into our psyches in a way that makes us part flesh and blood, part hardware . The fact that the hardware is outside our bodies(for now) does not mean the integration has not occurred . We are psychologically magnetized to our devices . That's why some people will fight for them, and even die for them . The selfie has become so ubiquitous that it no longer seems bizarre to see someone smiling into a cellphone or sticking out her tongue or making a sad face -- acting-- and then snapping a photo . And these images are then sent not only to her supposed \"friends,\" who may number in the hundreds, but also to her unconscious mind -- reinforcing the idea that she is what her cellphone records her to be . Take away the cellphone and, in some measure, she believes she disappears . She feels she dies a little bit, or more than a little bit, psychologically . The business of selling \"selfie sticks\"-- telescoping rods that hold a cellphone far enough away to facilitate a really good shot-- is robust enough to make many retailers place large kiosks of them near the checkout register . Cellphones, you might say, are growing arms . Ours apparently aren't long enough . This is just the beginning . Cellphones will soon be able to determine whether you are looking at the content on their screens, rather than looking away . They will demand attention . The extent to which we own them versus them owning us will be increasingly in doubt . Make no mistake : While technology can be good when harnessed for the good (raising money for charity occurs to me) , there will be hell to pay for giving so little thought to the downside . That downside likely includes an epidemic of narcissism in young people, increased rates of anxiety and dramatically decreased feelings of autonomy . Because to the extent that one's self-image is outsourced to a mobile device, it is no more deeply rooted than that .

The European Central Bank has just announced a EUR60 billion ($69 billion) monthly government bond buying program--Quantitative Easing -- but that won't do much for the moribund continental economy . Central banks can print money to purchase government bonds to push up prices and lower interest rates on those assets and competing debt, such as corporate bonds and bank loans . In the United States, the Federal Reserve also bought billions in federally-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, such as those issued by Fannie Mae . The aim is to encourage more borrowing by businesses and homebuyers-- stimulus spending financed by running the printing press . The Fed enjoyed some success boosting U.S  growth , but here are five reasons why QE won't work for the ECB . 1 \\. Eurozone Is Not a Country . The European Union does not have a large budget and issues few euro-denominated bonds the ECB could purchase . Instead, the ECB will have to purchase individual country debt -- it is as if the Fed had to purchase a basket of bonds issued by California, Iowa and other states . Markets for European bonds--both sovereign and corporate--and bank lending are highly fragmented along country lines . Consequently ,  it is unlikely that QE will have much effect on banks' willingness to make new business loans in places buffeted by the financial crisis, like Spain and Greece . 2 \\. EU Has No Fannie Mae . QE seems to work best when central banks inject capital directly into specific markets . The Fed purchased mortgage-backed securities that significantly lowered interest rates on mortgages across America . Housing prices recovered much of the value lost during the financial crisis , and new home construction rebounded . The EU has no analog to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and the ECB cannot readily purchase mortgage-backed securities to boost the European housing sector . 3 \\. Fiscal Policy Is Pulling in the Opposite Direction . Europe's largest economy, Germany, recently accomplished a balanced budget for the first time since 1969 , and austerity programs intended to restore solvency have forced massive government spending cuts and tax increases in Spain, Greece and other Mediterranean states . Those spending cuts-- though essential to sorely needed structural reforms-- will undercut the effects of any increased bank lending ECB bond purchase may induce . With unemployment hovering at about 25 percent in Spain and Greece, and 13 percent in Italy, banks will remain skeptical that lending to expand businesses will do much to create bigger markets for what they sell . 4 \\. QE Does Little to Fix Euro-Imposed Dysfunctions . Although structural reforms could make Greece, Italy and other high unemployment economies more attractive places to build factories and establish businesses in the long run, governments in Athens, Rome and other capitals face voters who need jobs now . And the cost of labor--though perhaps gradually falling--in these countries will remain too high to attract investment for many years . If Mediterranean countries still had their own currencies , those could let their currencies fall in value relative to those of northern European states . That would re-price labor to attract investment and jobs . But the single currency, the euro, deprives them of that lever . 5 \\. Absence of Pan European Institutions . Though the Europeans have a single currency, they lack common education standards and language that gives the United States a more or less single labor market . In the absence of currency devaluation to re-price Mediterranean labor, Greeks, Italians and Spaniards cannot migrate to Germany where unemployment is only 5 percent, with the same ease that Americans have migrated to South Dakota and Texas to participate in the oil boom . In the end, the EU and ECB lacks what the Fed enjoys--the punch of a national government that ran large deficits to augment its efforts to pull the U.S  economy out of recession and national credit, housing and labor markets that made monetary policies--like QE--reasonably effective .", "output": "The European Central Bank has just announced a EUR60 billion ($69 billion) monthly government bond buying program--Quantitative Easing that won't do much for the moribund continental economy", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

New Jersey governor Chris Christie's weight - and whether it will impact any run for higher office- is once again the subject of discussion . (It comes up every year or so, and this year it's bound to come up every month or so.) On Sunday, Christie drew some people's ire by sitting with (ok, and hugging) the owner of the Dallas Cowboys , the team of which he is a fan . It doesn't actually seem to matter what Christie does, though : the kneejerk reaction to a hefty politician is always, inevitably, to insult his body , and now Christie's brother is even reacting to that reaction on Facebook . Fat people are described as gross and disgusting often enough that some of us loathe our own bodies to the point of self-injury . People think we're stupid and weak(or we'd just lose weight, right?) before they even talk to us . Fatness is classified as a disease in the United States . For his part, Christie, with his long history of being fat in the public eye, turned to a weight-loss surgery called lap band in his efforts to lose weight . In that last linked article, those close to him claimed it would humanize him in the eyes of the public - without recognizing that he is, in fact and in fat, already human . Our humanity hardly seems to matter to people going for the easy fat jokes . The truth is that fat people often have a more difficult time finding a good job . (Even, maybe especially, THE job .) You're less likely to get a promotion when your body doesn't match the image of a desirable employee . This bias - this discrimination - on the part of employers costs them top talent and actually winds up adding to stereotypes about us . It's hard for fat people to be perceived as hard workers when no one believes in our work ethic in the first place . But that's hardly the worst of the stereotypes: a couple of years ago, during a televised \"debate\" about fatness and fat acceptance with anti-obesity spokesperson MeMe Roth and model Crystal Renn, Roth finally gave in and called me stupid - using a single study that proclaim that fat people just have smaller brains and are therefore less intelligent . I laughed : it was a desperate attempt at an insult more than it was scientific discussion , but it was also honest - because it's definitely not the first time I've run across that conviction . Chris Christie, for all of his accomplishments, faces the same sort of discrimination as the fat person passed over for a job because of a hiring manager's bias - he's just facing it on a very intense and public level . People look at him and judge his body . They don't evaluate his intelligence based on his decisions ; they just assume he's stupid because he's fat . They ignore that it does actually take quite a lot of work to get elected as governor - politics is many things, but it's never a cake walk , and he's been involved since 1977 . And America has had fat presidents before - not many of them, but some rather notable ones, including Teddy Roosevelt . Chris Christie is- and this is another uncomfortable thing for someone with my own fairly radical political views to say- a complicated and intelligent politician . His actions are often well-considered (even when I screamingly disagree with them, which happens a lot) and even sometimes moderate, at least in the sense that he occasionally works across party lines ... and certainly across state lines when it comes to the NFL . But the fat jokes keep on coming :. How bout hittin the gym?? ... Christie won't back down , may watch Cowboys in Green Bay via @POLITICO for iOS http://t.co/Vn6SS5J4EB . US News & World Report's David Catanese even said that his brother's defense makes Christie looks bad because... he countered \"'crazy, pathetic posts' with one of his own\" . Apparently it's more presidential when you take the abuse about your body without anyone saying anything . And the fat jokes keep obscuring the actual conversation that needs to happen about Christie's political views , even as he remains cagey about running for the Republican nomination in 2016 . And if you're one of the people who'd rather insult his weight than talk about his politics , I have to ask: who is the less intelligent person, really? I don't think it's the fat guy .", "output": "New Jersey governor Chris Christie's weight - and whether it will impact any run for higher office- is once again the subject of discussion, And the fat jokes keep obscuring the actual conversation that needs to happen about Christie's political views", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

It wasn't long after my 13th birthday that I descended into a spiral of heavy drug and alcohol abuse . It wasn't long after the abuse began that I met Mal, aged 29 . It wasn't that I hadn't learned my wrongs from rights, more that they didn't matter to the group of kids I then found myself around . Grades or sporting prowess accounted for nothing . Instead ,  accomplishment was measured by something that might actually be achievable: criminal records and the ability to tolerate copious amounts of drugs . Brownie points were awarded for any period of incarceration, be it in a prison cell or psychiatric facility . Mal's age alone was enough to earn him a significant amount of street cred in our misfit group of teenage boys , yet it was his history of extreme violence that ensured his approval rating was sky high . He was not just an incredibly violent man, but apparently belonged to a group of them . This made him even more attractive . Mal was a member of a then-notorious neo-Nazi organisation with a track record of serious criminal activity . He regularly turned up at whatever suburban park or abandoned house we found ourselves in as we sought to consume drugs and booze away from prying eyes . I didn't find it at all odd that a man pushing 30 was interested in hanging out with a bunch of delinquent teens . The more drunk we became, the more compelling his violent stories seemed . One night Mal invited me to tag along to one of the group's semi-regular gatherings . As I listened to one of the speakers rally his audience against the \"foreign invaders\" , I was immediately hooked . It was not I that had problems, I was told, it was people of another skin colour . The confusion that had been my constant companion, now viewed through this extremist lens, had suddenly become both figuratively and literally black and white . No longer was I to blame for anything . I didn't need to look at my part in my own downward spiral, as teachers, family members and police kept telling me . All life's troubles, it seemed, were the doing of non-whites . It was a relief to no longer feel responsible for my own - and others' - suffering, but better than that, I was now being called upon to be a vital part of \"the solution\" . It is, I imagine, the same sentiment a potential jihadist feels when he or she foolishly believes that they're being righteously called upon to fight for the creation of an Islamic state , as if that might fix what are largely personal troubles . I became part of a group that would drive around in the leader's ageing hatchback, plastering racist posters on walls and telegraph poles calling for action against the \"Asian invasion\" . Too dysfunctional to stage any coordinated sort of attack, our race war consisted of nothing more than starting fights with non-whites who were minding their own business . Since we were always heavily intoxicated, more often than not our victims survived the attacks in far better shape than we did . Unlike today , when a disenfranchised youth has a raft of violent ideologies to be swept up in , it was then my pure fortune that my only real option for extremist activity was this poorly led group . Ongoing action by Asio and the now-defunct special branch of the NSW police and, mostly, the self-implosion of key individuals in the group, meant that by the time I joined it was only a shadow of its former strength . Thanks to strong family support together with professional help, I was able to leave the group and its racist ideology well behind . I was eventually diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a case of long-term bullying at school . While that has helped me understand what drove me to this group , it is clear that all the factors that leave a young person susceptible to extremist ideology- poverty, lack of education, inadequate mental health support services and general social exclusion - still widely exist across western nations . I cringe when I hear our political leadership deliver yet another speech extolling a commitment to fighting extremism, yet in almost the time it takes to draw their next breath, go on to announce cuts to community services groups, the kind of organisations whose roles are vital in addressing the risk factors that leave one vulnerable to extremism . It's not that Orwell was completely off the mark when he said\"people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf\" . It is just that by the time the men with guns are needed, the radicalisation process has already happened . This is a process that cannot be stopped by sending troops to regions where most locals couldn't even spell \"Australia\", let alone have the capacity or even the desire to attack us . The clear and present danger today, as events from Oklahoma City through most recently to Paris have shown, is that the biggest threats are of the home-grown variety . The real frontline in the war on terror is to be found in our education and mental health services . Until such institutions are resourced as freely as our military is , then extremists will be here to stay .", "output": "Brownie points were awarded for any period of incarceration, be it in a prison cell or psychiatric facility Ongoing action by Asio and the now-defunct special branch of the NSW police and, mostly, the self-implosion of key individuals in the group, meant that by the time I joined it was only a shadow of its former strength, It was a relief to no longer feel responsible for my own - and others' - suffering, but better than that, I was now being called upon to be a vital part of \"the solution\" It is, I imagine, the same sentiment a potential jihadist feels when he or she foolishly believes that they're being righteously called upon to fight for the creation of an Islamic state,  accomplishment was measured by something that might actually be achievable: criminal records and the ability to tolerate copious amounts of drugs it is clear that all the factors that leave a young person susceptible to extremist ideology- poverty, lack of education, inadequate mental health support services and general social exclusion - still widely exist across western nations, The clear and present danger today, as events from Oklahoma City through most recently to Paris have shown, is that the biggest threats are of the home-grown variety The real frontline in the war on terror is to be found in our education and mental health services, I became part of a group that would drive around in the leader's ageing hatchback, plastering racist posters on walls and telegraph poles calling for action against the \"Asian invasion\"", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

In its ideological zeal to punish America , the outgoing Democratically- controlled Senate, plans to make public a report that, according to Fox News will examine \"the alleged use of torture by the CIA.\" Although the 6,000 page full report will remain classified , the 500 page summary is expected to be released to the public in coming days . According to press reports from those who are familiar with the study, it is expected to portray the American intelligence community in the worst possible light . The report's release and details about CIA interrogations that took place a decade ago will endanger Americans abroad today, destroy essential relationships with foreign intelligence communities going forward, and cripple American human intelligence gathering networks for a generation . Put bluntly , Democrats in the Senate are behaving like tenants who got evicted and decide to trash the house on their way out the door . There is nothing to be gained by releasing the report . The CIA's actions in the immediate aftermath of September 11 attacks have long since ceased . Although President Obama has approved release of the report's summary , even Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that the report's release will put Americans and U.S  embassies at risk of retaliation . So why do this now? Perhaps Democrats in Congress think that by excoriating our intelligence community before the entire world they will expiate the sins of the previous administration . Yes, it's another chance it's to blame Bush! This is the apology tour on steroids . According to media reports, the report concludes that we tortured terrorists . These are the same terrorists who blew up the World Trade Center, bombed the Pentagon, and tried to level the U.S  Capitol . These are the same terrorists that today have beheaded Christians, Westerners and, just this past weekend, another American citizen . Think back to the days after September 11 . We were blind about Al Qaeda . Most Americans feared another attack was imminent . And the best legal advice in government said CIA actions to get that information were legal . So CIA officers did what they thought necessary to protect Americans . A decade later we're suddenly castigating them for it . Second ,  the report concludes that the intelligence gathered from CIA's actions wasn't effective . Yet that has been disputed by the very people in the Obama administration who used it to track down Usama bin Laden . To quote highly regarded former CIA Director Gen  Michael Hayden,\"it is inconceivable to believe that three different CIA directors, and three different Deputy CIA directors, conspired over a seven year period to lie about the program's effectiveness . Third ,  there is a rule in foreign policy like the one in medicine . First ,  do no harm . Public release of this report will do immeasurable harm . It will encourage terrorists around the world to launch revenge attacks . It will cause foreign intelligence agencies to clam up and no longer cooperate with US intelligence for fear that their sources and method will be blown . It will cause every American intelligence officer to go into the defensive crouch -- don't stick your head out to protect America because years later somebody in government who wants to score political points will chop it off . Finally ,  take a lesson from history . We did this once before, in the 1970's , when presidential-hopeful Senator Frank Church launched a widespread investigation of the CIA . It didn't work , Senator Church's presidential aspirations never got off the ground . But his handiwork crippled American intelligence gathering for a generation . American agents overseas were killed , foreign intelligence agencies stopped sharing intelligence with us , our own human networks collapsed , and CIA officers played it safe and stopped thinking outside the box . This was one of the reasons a generation later we never knew about a bunch of Islamic extremists in a cave in Afghanistan plotting to take down the Twin Towers . Releasing the report to the public will do considerable harm to our efforts to gather essential intelligence about those hoping to do us harm . It will be a self-inflicted wound . The next time we are caught unprepared it won' t just be with 747s flying into buildings it could be with weapons too terrible to contemplate .", "output": "the outgoing Democratically- controlled Senate, plans to make public a report that, according to Fox News will examine \"the alleged use of torture by the CIA.\"", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

Australians turning on their televisions Monday morning to watch breakfast and cooking shows were instead greeted with news channels beaming minute-to-minute fearmongering of the ongoing siege at a chocolate shop in Sydney . When customers and employees were taken hostage by a lone gunman , and a flag with\"There is only one God\" inscription in Arabic was held in the window , it was enough to hold the rest of the country hostage to their fears and TV screens . Should it be that way and what should an appropriate response look like? First ,  consider what this violent thug had designed our reaction to be . The site of the siege was likely no afterthought - located in the heart of the Sydney CBD and directly opposite a major television station, the shop had made it ideal for the media to report on . Streets were cordoned off , public transport diverted , and a strong contingent of police sent to the Opera House . All made for good visuals of the incident and terror in an otherwise peaceful city . Even the most left-leaning and progressive members of parliament, like Greens MP Adam Bandt, who have repeatedly defended the Muslim community from unjust discrimination and generalisation, tweeted to their followers in the first hours of the siege that it was \"terrifying\" . Was it really? Was it at all terrifying for you personally, Adam? If it was , I'd hate to know what the hostages experienced, including the two who were murdered . A strike in the public's dark . For once, Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a more mature response than his colleagues on the opposite side . Such a situation can \"scare people out of being themselves\", he said in his first press briefing, before urging all Australians to go about their business as usual . Although he told the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities , he said so with calm and caution . Vitally, he avoided using the t-word at this early stage, or any formulation thereof . No doubt we have since learnt a lot more about this deranged outsider and his motives , and it is clear he had terrorist intent . His website, which was shut down during the final hours of the siege, had a message dated December 14, which described why Muslims \"fight against the oppression and terrorism\" of the US and its allies, including the UK and Australia . The rampant speculation before this was unnecessary and unhelpful, however , and letting the siege sow fear, enough so to publicly describe it as \"terrifying\", was handing a victory to an extremist . With the hot Australian summer setting in, many people's minds turn to beer, barbeques, family, and Christmas presents, not the possibility of \"politically motivated violence\", as Abbott wisely phrased it . Intriguingly, Australians fear terrorism more than a foreign invasion, despite many believing we'd have no hope of fending off the latter and despite us never directly experiencing the former . Given the opportunity to attribute a complexly motivated act to terrorism , it's no wonder this all-too-easy escape mechanism which avoids rigorous thought or objective analysis was adopted en masse . The most noted incidents in Australia's experience of terrorism have been mostly foreign tragedies, like the Bali bombings in 2002 and 2005, or the 2004 Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta . Although the September raids and arrests of suspected domestic terrorists in Sydney and Brisbane set a new landscape and brought the thought of an attack to our own shores , they merely raised the thought, not the authentic actuality . The raids sparked limited local backlash against peaceful Muslims at the time , and this was both unwarranted and unwanted . Though it only goes to further support my thesis ; Australians just aren't used to this sort of thing and thus are unpractised in their response . That said , it hasn't stopped thousands on social media to show solidarity with minorities through the #IllRideWithYou campaign . When the Abbott government raised the domestic terrorism threat level to high before the September raids , many local commentators criticised what they branded as political theatre (both before and after the arrests) . To consider this is to suggest an even baser type of political animal than is presently expected by even the most cynical of observers . Would any rational actor toy with people's lives for short-term political ends in what was an unimportant political week? What end does that even achieve? Plainly, none, and it is sensationally conspiratorialist to suggest otherwise . To protest against such raids and continue looking at them through a political lens was just as unwarranted and unwanted as the racial-profiling and racial- hatred which events like these have sparked . Terrorism isn't something that we should let foster, anywhere , and the public reactions to the raids were unjustifiably sceptical in comparison to the response to the Sydney siege . Even so ,  the authorities' heed for caution may have come too late for some . Slipshod media reports that the flag held in the shop window was an ISIL flag - when it was not- may have already fuelled the imaginations of too many . Whatever the outcome of the full investigation, one thing remains clear : This was a tragic learning experience for the Australian media, public, and politicians . Keep calm and carry on, though pay a thought or two to how we ought to respond to events like these in the future .", "output": "Even the most left-leaning and progressive members of parliament, like Greens MP Adam Bandt, who have repeatedly defended the Muslim community from unjust discrimination and generalisation, tweeted to their followers in the first hours of the siege that it was \"terrifying\"", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

Today, January 1, 2015 is the very first day of a brand new year . And for many that means renewed efforts at a fresh start . New Year's resolutions, we call them . This is the year . It all starts now . We resolve to turn over a new leaf - and this time we're serious . This time we're really going to try , we're not going to quit . We promise ourselves that we're going to quit bad habits and start good ones . We're going to get in shape, eat better, be more content, more disciplined, more intentional . We're going to be better husbands, wives, fathers, mothers . We're going to work harder, serve more, plan more, give more, read more . We're going to finally be all that we can be . No more messing around . Well ... I say try . Seriously, try . You might make some great strides this year . I'm hoping to . There are a lot of improvements I'm hoping to make over the next 12 months . But don't be surprised a year from now when you realize that you've fallen short... again . For those who try and try, year after year, again and again, to get better and better, only to take three steps forward then two steps back, one step forward then three steps back... I have good news for you : you're in good company! Everybody I have ever talked to sounds just like me over the years . Try and fail . Fail then try . Try and succeed . Succeed then fail . Two steps forward. One step back. One step forward. Three steps back . Every year I get better at some things, worse at others . For example ,  this past year I've become more patient with my children -- more tolerant of their mishaps . Therefore ,  I've been enjoying them more and micromanaging them less (one step forward) . But ,  due to a lack of discipline on my part, I've also allowed myself to be stretched too thin this past year and as a result, those I love most have suffered (one step back) . Furthermore ,  no matter how hard I try--no matter how serious I am about resolving to change-- I still get frustrated by the same things that frustrated me 20 years ago: traffic jams, unexpected interruptions, long lines, feeling misunderstood, and so on and so forth . You get the idea . In some ways we get better . In some ways we get worse . And in other ways we basically stay the same . Whoever told us that the experience of life was one of escalating progress lied to us . Most of the time it feels rather static, doesn't it? New Year's Resolutions are a burdensome attempt to fix ourselves and make ourselves more lovable . But (and here's the good news), God loves us as we are, not as we should be . God's love for me, approval of me, and commitment to me does not ride on my resolve but on God's resolve for me . The good news that gets me through bad times is that God's devotion to me is not dependant on my devotion . Knowing that God always meets my messes with his mercy, my failures with his forgiveness, and my guilt with his grace, helps me survive my daily disappointments with me . The Gospel of Jesus Christ is good news to those who've been crushed by unmet expectations of life -- it announces that because Jesus won for you, you're free to lose ; because Jesus was strong for you, you're free to be weak ; because Jesus was extraordinary, you're free to be ordinary ; because Jesus succeeded for you, you're free to fail . So , as this new year gets under way, I'll still going to try and get better at things , but it's so much more restful to know that I live my life from love rather than for it . Thank God!

It's a masterpiece of short-form tension - a confluence of sound and image so viscerally evocative it feels almost domineering . You cannot resist . You will be stressed out . You will feel . Or , as I believe I put it in a blog about the trailer , \"Clint Eastwood's American Sniper trailer will ruin your pants.\" But however effective it is as a piece of cinema, even a cursory look into the film's backstory - and particularly the public reaction to its release - raises disturbing questions about which stories we choose to codify into truth, and whose, and why, and the messy social costs of transmogrifying real life into entertainment . Chris Kyle, a US navy Seal from Texas, was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and claimed to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career . In his memoir, Kyle reportedly described killing as \"fun\", something he \"loved\" ; he was unwavering in his belief that everyone he shot was a \"bad guy\" . \"I hate the damn savages,\" he wrote . \"I couldn't give a flying fuck about the Iraqis.\" He bragged about murdering looters during Hurricane Katrina , though that was never substantiated . He was murdered in 2013 at a Texas gun range by a 25-year-old veteran reportedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder . However we diverge politically, I have enough faith in Eastwood's artistry and intellect to trust that he is not a black-and-white ideologue - or, at least, that he knows that the limitations of such a worldview would make for an extremely dull movie . But the same can't be said for Eastwood's subject, or, as response to the film has demonstrated, many of his fans . As Laura Miller wrote in Salon:\"In Kyle's version of the Iraq war, the parties consisted of Americans, who are good by virtue of being American, and fanatic Muslims whose 'savage, despicable evil' led them to want to kill Americans simply because they are Christians.\" Adds Scott Foundas at Variety:\"Chris Kyle saw the world in clearly demarcated terms of good and evil, and American Sniper suggests that such dichromatism may have been key to both his success and survival; on the battlefield, doubt is akin to death.\" Eastwood, on the other hand, Foundas says, \"sees only shades of gray\" , and American Sniper is a morally ambiguous, emotionally complex film . But there are a lot of Chris Kyles in the world , and the chasm between Eastwood's intent and his audience's reception touches on the old Chappelle's Show conundrum: a lot of white people laughed at Dave Chappelle's rapier racial satire for the wrong reasons, in ways that may have actually exacerbated stereotypes about black people in the minds of intellectual underachievers . Is that Chappelle's fault? Should he care? Likewise, much of the US right wing appears to have seized upon American Sniper with similarly shallow comprehension - treating it with the same unconsidered, rah-rah reverence that they would the national anthem or the flag itself . Only a few weeks into its release, the film has been flattened into a symbol to serve the interests of an ideology that, arguably, runs counter to the ethos of the film itself . How much, if at all, should Eastwood concern himself with fans who misunderstand and misuse his work? If he, intentionally or not, makes a hero out of Kyle- who, bare minimum, was a racist who took pleasure in dehumanising and killing brown people- is he responsible for validating racism, murder, and dehumanisation? Is he a propagandist if people use his work as propaganda? That question came to the fore last week on Twitter when several liberal journalists drew attention to Kyle's less Oscar-worthy statements . \"Chris Kyle boasted of looting the apartments of Iraqi families in Fallujah,\" wrote author and former Daily Beast writer Max Blumenthal . \"Kill every male you see,\" Rania Khalek quoted, calling Kyle an \"American psycho\" . Retaliation from the rightwing twittersphere was swift and violent, as Khalek documented in an exhaustive (and exhausting) post at Alternet . \"Move your America hating ass to Iraq, let ISIS rape you then cut your cunt head off, fucking media whore muslim,\" wrote a rather unassuming-looking mom named Donna . \"Rania, maybe we to take you ass overthere and give it to ISIS... Dumb bitch,\" offered a bearded man named Ronald , who enjoys either bass fishing or playing the bass (we may never know) . \"Waterboarding is far from torture,\" explained an army pilot named Benjamin, all helpfulness . \"I wouldn't mind giving you two a demonstration.\" The patriots go on, and on and on . They cannot believe what they are reading . They are rushing to the defence of not just Kyle, but their country, what their country means . They call for the rape or death of anyone ungrateful enough to criticise American hero Chris Kyle . Because Chris Kyle is good, and brown people are bad, and America is in danger, and Chris Kyle saved us . The attitude echoes what Miller articulated about Kyle in her Salon piece : \"his steadfast imperviousness to any nuance, subtlety or ambiguity, and his lack of imagination and curiosity, seem particularly notable\" . There is no room for the idea that Kyle might have been a good soldier but a bad guy; or a mediocre guy doing a difficult job badly; or a complex guy in a bad war who convinced himself he loved killing to cope with an impossible situation; or a straight-up serial killer exploiting an oppressive system that, yes, also employs lots of well-meaning, often impoverished, non-serial- killer people to do oppressive things over which they have no control . Or that Iraqis might be fully realised human beings with complex inner lives who find joy in food and sunshine and family, and anguish in the murders of their children . Or that you can support your country while thinking critically about its actions and its citizenry . Or that many truths can be true at once . Always meet your heroes .", "output": "In his memoir, Kyle reportedly described killing as \"fun\", something he \"loved\"", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

Not so for the small community of Christians in Agra, a town in the northern Indian province of Uttar Pradesh . On Christmas Eve, the flock of believers were cowering in fear , because a couple of churches were burnt and there was the looming threat of more skirmishes with the belligerent among their Hindu brethren spiralling into serious communal clashes . More portentous was the grand ghar wapsi (homecoming, or mass-reconversion) programme announced by the Dharam Jagran Samiti (loosely translated into Hindi-Religious Awakening Front) in the neighbouring town of Aligarh , where Christmas was to be \"celebrated\" by bringing 4,000 Christians and 1,000 Muslims back into the folds of Hinduism . This Samiti, a not-so-small wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a militant Hindu organisation, contended that far from propagating religious intolerance, it was only righting historical wrongs and injustice perpetrated by Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics who, in order to bolster the numbers of their respective faiths, had lured and coerced Hindus to stray from their original religion . Attack on secularism . When these turn of events created a furore in parliament , the Narendra Modi- led central government instructed the local administration to thwart the Samiti's grandiose plans, and Christmas day went peacefully . But ,  the solution - a national legislation to ban and criminalise conversions - assertively advocated by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which commands an absolute majority in parliament, and despite repeated disavowals, remains rooted in essentially a chauvinistic, right-wing Hindu ideology, is far more disconcerting, and if implemented , would deal a grievous blow to the constitutional ideal of secularism . It would be downright specious, even dishonest, to claim that missionaries and proselytisers' activities in India had nothing but a salubrious effect . Historical records bear ample testimony to the rigorous implementation of St Caprion's axiom - \"extra ecclessium nulla salus\" (outside the Church, no salvation), even by the proverbial fire and sword, especially by explorer-cum- conquistadors like Vasco da Gama, the tales of whose brutalities in enforcing a harvest of faith in the erstwhile Portuguese-controlled state of Goa are legion . Active proselytisation was an integral part of the colonial project ; indeed , as historian Ranajit Guha states,\"the Bible and the toothbrush were one of the main instruments of the British colonialists\" . This reveals that the missionaries did bring \"material\" gifts to the native population - especially western medicine and hygiene . But these benefits aside, there was another more substantive reason why many Indians, especially the Dalits (Untouchables) and tribals embraced Christianity, and even Islam . Both these religions liberate them, or at least hold out the promise of unshackling them from the pernicious burden of the caste-system which is so deeply entrenched in Hinduism . Though ostensibly secular in objective, the anti-conversion laws in force in various states of India - Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh (all areas with a significantly high population of tribals, Dalits, the depressed castes, and reeling from poverty, illiteracy and abysmal healthcare) in effect gives the government a vast swathe of control over people's choices in matters of faith and religion . Going way beyond , they endow the government with surveillance powers over a constituency of people . Starting from the premise that the freedom of religion and religious chose of \"those who are converted\"(note; the laws never say \"those who convert\") need to be protected from incursions of proselytisers - the various anti-conversion legislations, ironically termed as \"freedom of religion\" laws - make it mandatory for the convertees to inform the head of the district administration . They will then give the go-ahead only once he is satisfied that one is not swapping religions for monetary benefits or other inducements, or by being taken in by fraud, or being swayed by either promises of salvation or threats of incurring divine displeasure, as the case may be . The laws of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh make it incumbent upon neighbours or villagers to inform the administration and the police of any activities of pastors, nuns and clergymen which could give rise to a suspicion of proselytising motives . Without defining what all would, and could, possibly count as \"inducement\" or \"fraud\", these laws impose stringent criminal sanctions on violators . Anyone found guilty is visited with imprisonment extending to three years, and with a financial penalty of 50,000 rupees (approximately $800) . Tellingly, the punishment is doubled if those who convert are women, or members of the lower castes and tribal communities . These laws are invoked and enforced only when a group of people, not individuals, seek to move out of Hinduism . One might well question - in face of such provisions, do the laws even need to use the modifiers \"forcible\" or \"fraudulent\"? Also ,  not a single legislation even addresses, let alone punish, \"reconversion\" which the many Hindu zealots are painstakingly claiming as totally voluntary and a righteous reply to the violation of rights by colonisers and their ilk . Indians look up to the judiciary to uphold the secular values of the republic , and the Supreme Court has, time and again, thwarted onslaughts on people's core fundamental right of religious freedom . But its record in adjudicating the evidently unsecular anti-conversion statutes is dubious . The last time it did was in 1977, in the Reverend Stanislaus case , wherein the Odisha and Madhya Pradesh statutes were upheld . Basing its ruling on a 1956 report entitled \"Report of the Christian Missionaries Activity Enquiry Commission\", which deemed proselytisation as a threat to India's territorial integrity and internal security, the court ended up conflating every act of propagation of one's faith - Christianity, in this case (enshrined as a fundamental right in the constitution) as an attack on Hinduism and its followers, tantamount to blasphemy , which, incidentally, is also a criminal offence in India . A national anti-conversion law, if enacted , would definitely be challenged in the Supreme Court . In that case, the judges could remedy the errors of 1977 by seeking inspiration from the European Court of Human Right's 1993 ruling in the Kokkinakis case , which struck the right balance between keeping out improper proselytism and Christians' right to practise, profess, and propagate their faith .", "output": "Indians look up to the judiciary to uphold the secular values of the republic", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

If you think bullies are teenagers lurking on schoolyard playgrounds , think again . At least one is a grown-up walking the hallowed halls of Harvard University . His name is Ben Edelman . He not only teaches there , but he earned several diplomas including a law degree at that storied institution of higher education . But Edelman seems to have adopted the word \"higher\" as his personal calling card . You see , he's higher than you and me . Or at least he seems anxious to let you know it . A hardworking Chinese immigrant family found that out when the professor ordered a takeout meal of shredded chicken with spicy garlic sauce and three other dishes . Edelman thought he was overcharged by $ 4 bucks ($ 1 dollar more for each dish) , so he launched a relentless war on Ran Duan , who works with his parents at their restaurant, Sichuan Garden in Brookline . You can read the sordid details in a story at Boston.com where the website also published the unbelievable litany of Edelman's intimidating and condescending emails to Duan . The prof's remarks ooze with arrogance and conceit . Edelman's exchange with Duan has become a viral sensation , as it should . A Harvard professor vowing legal action over the sum of $ 4 dollars . Come on . The professor has now apologized for his treatment of Duan and his family , but his emails will leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone so supposedly \"learned\" could be so seemingly insufferable . Maybe that's what a Harvard education gets you these days -a degree in imperiousness . Arrogance aside, the professor's persistent threats of legal action constitute a shameful campaign of bullying . He uses his knowledge of the law --at least his tortured interpretation of it-- for a purpose that can only be described as abusive . It turns out , he has done this before to a different restaurant . Bullies tend to target the weak and vulnerable . For Edelman to use his advantage as a lawyer to berate the Duan family who have come from nothing as immigrants and are trying their best to make a living running a restaurant is, in a word, unconscionable . During one email exchange, Duan asked the professor,\"you seem like a smart man... don't you have better things to do?\" Bullies usually don't . For all I know, Edelman is a pretty good professor . That does not make him a good person . Clinical psychiatrists might find him to be an interesting case study in how living in the Harvard bubble can distort even the most agile of minds . Sometimes intellectuals take themselves too seriously . Sequestered from the experiences of the average man, they can lack common sense, kindness and decency . Edelman seems bereft of them all . There is a reason why places like Harvard are called\"ivory towers\" . All too often, they envelop an artificial atmosphere where intellectuals are disconnected from the practical concerns of everyday life . So, it should be no surprise when guys like Ben Edelman explode like a bomb on some poor immigrant family trying to make a buck with the sweat of their brow . Fortunately, academic elitism is not contagious . Teaching at Harvard may be a lofty achievement in the egg-head world . But professor Edelman seems to lack the one quality which elevates people above all other primates: compassion . He might gain a measure of humility and understanding by getting a real job . Might I suggest washing dishes in a Chinese restaurant? The next time I visit the Boston area, I'll skip Harvard Yard . Instead ,  I plan to drop by the Sichuan Garden to try their sauteed prawns with roasted chili and peanut sauce .

Another horrific tragedy has struck a western capital in the violent murder of French journalists and cartoonists at a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo . The culprits appear to have done so in response to the magazine's publication of cartoons deemed offensive to Muslims , though they were also thought to have been radicalised by the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq . French society - and indeed, the global reaction - has been united in its condemnation of the attack and French authorities mobilised the full strength of the state's law enforcement agencies to track down the assailants , who were killed after a standoff with police on Friday . As with most incidents of violence involving Muslims, however, the ensuing public discussion has revolved largely around resolute vows to uphold a fundamental value of western civilisation - the freedom of expression - and degenerated into recriminations about Islam's purported assault on that very freedom . As a result, the natural expressions of grief and sympathy on behalf of the victims have taken on the added quality of high-minded liberal support for the content of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, irrespective of the publication's history of racism towards Muslims and people of colour . Hegemonic narrative . It is only by uncritically adopting the hegemonic narrative of western liberalism that one could reach the conclusion that the biggest threats to freedom of expression in the world today are Islam and North Korea . To frame these events without accounting for the broader context and power relationships at work inhibits any sensible understanding of the deep conflicts plaguing our world at present . By positing western liberal claims to freedom against Islam's supposedly intolerant attitude towards irreverent or serious critiques of it would be to ignore completely the history underlying the current tensions . The reality is that for as long as there have been liberal ideals staking their claim to the various freedoms western societies have come to sacralise, there have also been societies suffering from exploitation and subjugation at the hands of those professing these lofty principles . Even as they were establishing the very foundations of modern liberal societies, from the tenets of freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion to the basis for democratic forms of governance, Enlightenment thinkers were nearly universal in their expression of support for a world built on racial hierarchies and the expansion of new European empires that depended largely on the use of violence to control colonial subjects . That these philosophers developed their racist outlooks towards Jews, Muslims, and blacks on the basis of \"reason\" and \"rationality\" makes such views more abhorrent than those derived from pre-modern modes of thought . Whether it is the racist expressions of Enlightenment philosophers or the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo , these provocative views cannot be separated from the broader political projects at work . At the same time that western liberalism gave rise to modern states committed to freedom, democracy, and the rule of law , it also saw to the continuation of slavery, the colonisation and subjugation of large segments of Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, and global economic exploitation and environmental degradation . Within Europe, western liberal ideals, whose proponents had never concealed their racist and exclusionary outlooks, could not avert the rise of a fascist movement in the mid-20th century that pursued the extermination of millions of people . Even after the devastation of World War II, European appetites for destruction were seemingly unsatiated , as the next two decades were marked by struggles for independence from European powers by colonised peoples in the global south . Faced with the prospect of supporting the freedom of the Algerian people, many French liberal intellectuals instead offered enthusiastic support for the brutal suppression of the Algerian struggle in a war that featured the widespread use of torture and the death of over 150,000 Algerians . \"They are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and the Germans are born with blond hair. I would not be in the least bit surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race.\" Writing on European Jews, this quote comes not from a propagandist in Nazi Germany, but rather from Voltaire, the 18th century French philosopher whose name has been invoked frequently in recent days as a historic champion of the freedom of expression . Voltaire's views on Islam were no more tempered , as he authored an entire play dedicated to mocking its Prophet Muhammad as \"the founder of a false and barbarous sect\" and \"a sublime and hearty charlatan\" . While one can defend the right of satirists, government officials, and philosophers to espouse such beliefs  - the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie became a popular means of expressing solidarity with the magazine in the hours after the attack- in the face of this history, it should become clear that in the case of cultural production, context always matters . Destructive policies cannot be pursued successfully without the vocabulary and imagery of racism and hatred of the other . One cannot attempt to comprehend the actions of mass murderer Anders Breivik or the recent report on the US government's torture of Muslim prisoners solely against the backdrop of western liberal ideals . However , when one considers the rise of a pervasive Islamophobic atmosphere as seen in prominent discourses across the US and Europe , one can understand the reason such violence becomes possible and, indeed, normalised . The significance of the question of what can be deemed appropriate speech goes far beyond its propensity to offend Muslim minorities, to its potential to have corrosive effects on the broader society . In the same way that western governments take great care to prevent the spread of ideas and messages they consider culpable for radicalising Muslims (all pretensions about freedom of expression be damned) , they should consider the role that anti-Muslim cultural production plays in facilitating their own abuses of human rights, and radicalising their own citizens , as seen in the wave of anti-Muslim terrorism that has witnessed a marked rise in the past decade . Commenting on the recent string of Islamophobic statements by Bill Maher and Sam Harris , religion scholar Karen Armstrong noted,\"this is the sort of talk that led to the concentration camps\" . The current permissibility of dehumanising expressions against Muslims has a legacy in the anti-Semitic tropes of a century earlier . Both stem from the same noxious logic of exclusion . In fact , western countries have had no qualms about setting aside their liberal values to offer full-fledged support to authoritarian regimes in the Middle East that, incidentally, create the repressive climate that has been proven to give rise to militant extremism . Nor have western societies proved unwilling to abandon claims about support for free speech when the question of social cohesion arises . France banned rallies in solidarity with Gaza during last summer's war and the state has consistently prosecuted writers, comics, and even cartoonists whose work was deemed to risk \"disruption to the social order\" . French Prime Minister Manuel Valls commented on the state's robust record of prosecuting artists saying:\"Faced with this creativity of hate, should we do nothing? Certainly not.\" In 2008, Charlie Hebdo fired an artist and writer for a column that the editors found to be anti-Semitic . At this juncture, western Muslims remain excluded from national dialogues regarding the question of social cohesion . The historical continuity of racial discrimination, coupled with a ramped up pursuit of strategic objectives across a number of Muslim countries during the last two decades have seen to it that an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility has permeated the public sphere in the US and revived the legacy of intolerance in Europe . To understand and counteract the violent behaviour of extremists , these tragic events should be examined in light of this context, rather than through the lens of free speech . From Voltaire and the Enlightenment to the present, modern western discourses are replete with critiques of Islam . By contrast, the abhorrent violence by some Muslims is a recent phenomenon, and one that must be confronted by addressing the failure of western liberalism to live up to its stated ideals, not by reflexively continuing to sing its praises .", "output": "As with most incidents of violence involving Muslims, however, the ensuing public discussion has revolved largely around resolute vows to uphold a fundamental value of western civilisation - the freedom of expression - and degenerated into recriminations about Islam's purported assault on that very freedom It is only by uncritically adopting the hegemonic narrative of western liberalism that one could reach the conclusion that the biggest threats to freedom of expression in the world today are Islam and North Korea, As with most incidents of violence involving Muslims, however, the ensuing public discussion has revolved largely around resolute vows to uphold a fundamental value of western civilisation - the freedom of expression - and degenerated into recriminations about Islam's purported assault on that very freedom it is the racist expressions of Enlightenment philosophers or the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo, Another horrific tragedy has struck a western capital in the violent murder of French journalists and cartoonists at a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo The culprits appear to have done so in response to the magazine's publication of cartoons deemed offensive to Muslims, Another horrific tragedy has struck a western capital in the violent murder of French journalists and cartoonists at a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

To make matters worse his ringtone is, according to someone who was there:\"Jazz FM-style comedown music after a heavy night out\" .

So in the middle of some serious conversation about the Charlie Hebdo shootings or the economy or the NHS, while Vince Cable is expressing some \"serious concerns\" and everyone else is trying to make drooping eyelids look like they're concentrating hard , suddenly it's \"Diddle-it-deduh-dede-duh-duh!\" and Gove is jumping and wriggling like George Osborne's Tasered him again . Gove's seated twist having gone on \"for quite a while\", the PM intervened with what one witness described as \"a public bollocking\" .

I also sympathise with those people in West End theatres who are hit by a volley of rage and sarcasm from some knight of the stage when Nokia Tune has crashed in on his soliloquy . I sympathise whenever it happens at meetings, weddings, carol services or when someone's tearfully coming out . I sympathise because one day it will happen to me .

Most of the time, I check it every 30 seconds . But sometimes I just don't . My fastidious self-image deceives me into carelessness . At some point, I'm going to come a cropper .

That's not how it'll be, though . Our attitudes to accidental phone rings are stuck in the 80s .

This is hopelessly out of step with what these machines now mean to us . Research just published by a team at the University of Missouri shows that, when a sample of 40 people were temporarily deprived of their iPhones, their heart rate and blood pressure rose, and their ability to perform tasks suffered . Our mobiles, the paper suggests, are now \"an extension of our physical selves, an umbilical cord, anchoring the information society's digital infrastructure to our very bodies\" . We hate to be parted from them and we don't much like turning them off . Many will lament this , but it's not altogether bad . Our phones reassure us because they make us feel connected  - because if your mobile is turned on, in range and not ringing , it probably means that no work crisis has developed and no disaster has befallen a close friend or loved one . It's a constant everyone-in-your-life-is-more-or-less-OK monitor . Maybe we should learn to live without such reassurance , but it doesn't reflect entirely badly on us that we're comforted by it . People often criticise one another for talking or texting on their phones in preference to live interaction . \"We met for a coffee but she spent the whole time on the phone!\" \"We were having lunch and his mobile rang- and he actually answered it!\" Such critics forget that, in the heyday of the landline, a ringing telephone - the phone in the hall - was always answered . The notion of call screening is entirely modern . It never used to be rude to answer - it was rude not to . The onus of politeness, in those days, was on the caller . Except in an emergency, you didn't telephone someone at a mealtime, during their favourite television programme or after 10 o'clock . When you thought someone might not want to be disturbed, you didn't disturb them unless you had to . It's the passing of that etiquette, rather than the prevalence of mobile phones, that I think is a shame . Of course ,  in the age of the mobile, it's impossible to know whether the person you're calling will find it convenient to chat . You can't know if they're eating or in the cinema or reading the traffic news . So how about this : only call a mobile if you really need to .

Ahmed Merabat was the first of the 12 innocents killed in Wednesday's targeted attack on the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo . The 42-year-old French Muslim policeman was executed on the sidewalk of Paris' 11th borough - the enclave where Charlie Hebdo's headquarters is located . Merabat was shot, point-blank, by one of the three assassins, minutes before they broke into Charlie Hebdo's offices, and slaughtered the magazine's top editor and celebrated cartoonists . The coverage of the \"Paris shootings\" centred almost exclusively on Stephane Charbonnier, Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut and Bernard Verlhac - the prominent and unyieldingly provocative minds behind Charlie Hebdo . The first victim, Ahmed Merabat, was purged from the headlines . The political and representational ramifications that come with highlighting Merabat's victimhood cannot be ignored . First ,  it complicates the broader narrative that rigidly caricatures Muslims as terrorists, outsiders and marginals . And second, refutes the state-sponsored indictment of Muslims in France as perpetrators of subversion, instead of law-abiding citizens . Muslim and French . Apart from the obvious tragedy, the Charlie Hebdo killings manifest the baseline that Muslim identity is only relevant - and indeed newsworthy - when the subject is standing behind the gun. Not in front of it . In most everywhere in the world, but especially France - the architect of modern Islamophobia . Muslims comprise a considerable percentage of the French polity . Islam is the nation's second biggest religion , and figures place the Muslim population at 5 percent to 10 percent of France's 66 million citizens . Islam's size, and demographical rise, has spurred some of the most draconian policies against Muslims in modern times . The headscarf ban in 2004, followed by illegalisation of the niqab, or face covering, in 2010, codified core Islamophobic ideas . This legislation also functioned as a firm and fervent declaration by the state that Muslim and French identities were at odds and irreconcilable . The French laicite model provided the structural underpinnings to carry forward Islamophobic legislation . But more nefariously, guise it under the banner of state-sponsored secularism . Expectedly, the religious expression bans disparately impacted French Muslims . In addition ,  they chilled bodily and verbal expressions of Muslim identity . The state aim of compelling secularisation upon its Muslim citizenry was based upon the civilisational binary, and ultimatum, to choose between \"Islam and the West\", \"Muslim lands or France\" . Despite this ultimatum handed down from the state, the overwhelming majority of French Muslims exercised their faith amid pervasive bigotry . And simultaneously, embraced their national identities as Frenchmen and women . Extreme voices from within the state, and French civil society, looked to the three terrorists as representatives of the nation's 3 to 6 million Frenchmen and women . Collateral indictment of French Muslims, by politicians and media alike, infused with an already fervent culture of Islamophobia on the ground, will surely incite violent backlash against Muslims and Muslim communities in the country . Although unimaginable before Wednesday, French Islamophobia stands to become far more severe and strident . The conflation of the terrorist's acts with France's Muslim population, from the perspective of hatemongers, holds the latter vicariously liable . This connection, that links three deviant actors with an entire faith and millions of disconnected citizens, will fuel rabid backlash against Muslims in France, and more than likely, claim additional victims . Centring Muslim victims, instead of villains, would mitigate the backlash considerably . In addition , focusing on the heroics of Merabat, instead of the evil of the three terrorists, asserts - and inserts - a competing narrative that France's Muslims are everyday citizens : Citizens with jobs, families, and interpretations of Islam that condemn violence, and contradict the malignant caricature of the faith constructed by the state . Ahmed Merabat was more than a victim . He was far more than merely a Muslim . He, in both life and especially in death, stands as an archetype for the overwhelming majority of French Muslims . A law-abiding citizen, Merabat harmonised his religious identity with the responsibilities of being a Frenchman . He was both French and Muslim , an existential integration eviscerated by the longstanding Islamophobic discourse in France, and ignored by the media firestorm following the attack . Although the first victim of the attack, Ahmed Merabat's story was shot down from the news headlines . And his name and face absent from the ongoing stream of reports and narratives emanating from Paris on Wednesday . Inserting him into the story, and countering the barrage of vile Muslim representations with a rebuttal of victimhood and valour, will likely save lives in France . Most importantly, retelling the story from the perspective of Ahmed Merabat will not only reveal that Muslim and French identity are reconcilable, but also resilient .", "output": "The 42-year-old French Muslim policeman was executed on the sidewalk of Paris' 11th borough - the enclave where Charlie Hebdo's headquarters is located, Muslims comprise a considerable percentage of the French polity Islam is the nation's second biggest religion", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

In the face of terrible deaths, at a time when we are so destructively polarised , this must be said bold and up front and repeatedly : No cartoonist deserves to be killed, ever . No innocent person shopping for kosher food deserves to be terrorised and murdered , either . All of those tragic deaths in France last week, including those of a policeman and policewoman, and numbering 17 in total, all of them are horrendous and incomprehensible . In the face of this terrible killing spree in France, at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and then at a kosher supermarket, the overwhelming reaction is revulsion . But at the same time, there's a need to respond in other ways as well, to frame a discussion that can prevent this tragedy leading to even more tragedies, or being spun out to lash out at other innocent people . And here is the trouble with the backlash that has already begun, and the demands that have being made in the name of \"solidarity\" . France today stages a unity march, an attempt to help heal a wounded nation, amidst a much wider discussion of the need to stand together in the face of terror . But within that discussion, there has been a distinct fundamentalism - for example, in the insistence that to support Charlie Hedbo's right to publish, we must reprint and replicate their work . It's an unnecessary conflation of two things: support for the right to do something and actually doing the thing . It should, of course, be possible to express disgust at the murders fully, without having to endorse certain types of offensiveness . And the French magazine, while broad-spectrum in its religious targets, has undeniably focused its gaze on France's Muslim minority in a racist manner, in recent years . There is, for media, a responsibility (the abrogation of which clearly does not invite murder) to not be tone deaf about the environments we live in: about ignored hierarchies of control; about powerless minorities and colonial heritage and migration and foreign policy; about how things feel when you are stigmatised, marginalised and scapegoated; about what it's like when you don't have a voice or much representation in the mainstream ; and when the majority culture insists that equality and liberty await all those who just learn to be more like the majority . If we don't create the space to say these things without casting those that do so as fanatical supporters of murder , then what is this limitless freedom of expression we keep insisting we are firmly on the side of? The demand that we all respond in a mass, uniform way also makes a basic error about how unity works - which is to forget that it can only survive if there are spaces between us ; solidarity and common ground take hold because of the existence of a spectrum in thought and experience, and not despite these things . Deadly terrorism seeks to stamp out the possibility of difference  - which is why, in condemning outright those atrocities in France, we need also to keep insisting on and cherishing our diversity . Meanwhile, equally fundamentalist is the predictable casting of blame at Muslims and their \"backward\" culture, painting this as a \"clash of civilisations\" and insisting that all Muslims repeatedly apologise for the slaughters in France . The now routine insistence that all Muslims apologise for all such atrocities has spawned a spoof Muslim iCondemn phone app for such eventualities - a curious development , since we have been led to believe that Muslims don't actually have a sense of humour . 'Civilised v barbarian' . The ridiculous \"civilised v barbarian\" argument has been skilfully taken apart by others - its false premises, hypocrisy and misguided superiority complex rigorously deconstructed . But there's grave danger in this sort of \"us or them\" thinking - not just in the physical attacks on mosques and Muslims in France , which have already begun and which are obviously bad enough . The danger in blaming Muslims for such atrocities is that we shirk any responsibility . And the harsh reality is that the French killings, just like previous terror atrocities in Britain, just like the European self-proclaimed jihadists that go and fight for the death cult Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant(ISIL), are all homegrown . We - not just Muslim society, but our societies - are accountable . We, not just the fanatics that recruit to and commit mindless terror, are bound up in the causes and the context in a way that makes it not just insulting but actively counterproductive to single out Muslims as bearing sole responsibility both for the crimes and for their prevention . If we don't own this terrible reality collectively , we won't be able to find a way out of it collectively , either - and that means we won't be able to find a way out of it at all .", "output": "All of those tragic deaths in France last week, including those of a policeman and policewoman, and numbering 17 in total, all of them are horrendous and incomprehensible But there's grave danger in this sort of \"us or them\" thinking - not just in the physical attacks on mosques and Muslims in France", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

Following the reports of Iranian aircraft attacking ISIL targets last week, Iranian and US officials issued statements to emphasise that they are not coordinating their air strikes . Despite these denials, there is an ironic element to this strike that both sides cannot deny . The Islamic Republic of Iran used US-produced, Vietnam-era F-4 Phantom aircraft against a common foe, ISIL . Contextualising these Iranian air strikes within the greater history of how these planes ended up in the Iranian air force in the first place demonstrates a geostrategic reality for US foreign policy : Iran's geographical depth means the US has needed Iran during both the Cold War and post-Cold War era, regardless of the government in Tehran . The Islamic Republic's fleet of F-4s and F-14s were inherited from the Royal Iranian Air Force of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi . Iran under the shah was one of the few US allies that could purchase the advanced F-14 Tomcat interceptor of \"Top Gun\" fame, with one of the most sophisticated radars at the time . The shah's shopping list of US-supplied aircraft boosted the economy of the US defence industry, as well as served US geopolitical interests during the Cold War . Iran's advanced military allowed it to emerge as a regional hegemon . Since it shared a long border with the Soviet Union , the shah's armed forces served as a bulwark against Communist penetration in the Middle East and the oil-rich Gulf region, and a deterrent against an anti-western Baathist Iraq . Iran's geostrategic location has not diminished as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union . No US or NATO ally, including Israel, Turkey or Saudi Arabia can cover Iran's geographical depth . Iran's location means it can influence events from Iraq to the Gulf, from the Caucasus and adjoining Caspian and Black Seas to Central Asia, and from Afghanistan to South Asia . Video footage . The video footage released by Al Jazeera of Iranian F-4s attacking ISIL forces in Iraq's Diyala province is reminiscent of another attack when two of the same US-supplied Iranian aircraft bombed Iraq's nuclear facility in Tuwaitha in 1980, during the first year of the Iran-Iraq War . In this first air strike, the US and the Islamic Republic shared the same interests, albeit for different purposes . The Islamic Republic feared Iraq could develop a nuclear option as it fought a two-front war for its survival, including a domestic Iranian Kurdish uprising, and a potential pro-shah counterrevolution launched from within the Iranian air force - the same unit that was needed to target Iraq . The US, despite its tensions with Iran during the hostage crisis, did not want to see Iraq develop a nuclear capability that could threaten its ally Israel during the 1980s . Israel successfully followed up the attack against Iraq's nuclear facility in 1981 , and the US-led air strikes during the 1991 Gulf war were designed to destroy this nuclear infrastructure again , which had been rebuilt despite the Israeli air raid . Thus the air raid Iran conducted against ISIL was not the first time both Washington and the Islamic Republic might have both wished for a successful sortie of Iranian F-4 pilots . Despite this common interest during the Iran-Iraq War, the US titled towards Iraq and directly engaged Iranian naval forces in the Gulf to protect Kuwaiti oil vessels, downing an Iranian civilian aircraft in the process . Iran fought a proxy war against US forces in Iraq following the 2003 Iraq war by supporting Iraqi militias during the insurgency . Both the US and Iran will continue to clash over their respective relationships with Israel . Yet despite these differences both the US and Iran cooperated with each other to remove the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001 . The joint cause against the Taliban in 2001, or ISIL in 2014, demonstrates that despite the decades-long mistrust and proxy conflicts between the two sides, geographical realpolitik can force both states to engage in alliances of convenience . In an AP interview, the new US ambassador in Baghdad, Stuart Jones said,\"Let's face it. Iran is an important neighbour to Iraq. There has to be cooperation between Iran and Iraq.\" Such a statement is significant . The Iranian government has been trying to force the US to concede this geographic fact since 2003 . Indirect evidence . This statement serves as indirect evidence that the US and Iran appear to have worked out a modus vivendi in dealing with ISIL in Iraq . Yet when Al Jazeera released the video of the air strike, the Iranian government initially denied the report, only to confirm it days later, adding the caveat that it was launched at the behest of the central government in Iraq . The initial denial raises the question as to whether Iran did not want to upset this alliance of convenience with US by launching its own air strikes . In this case, rather than upsetting the US, both the Iranian and Iraqi governments probably wanted to keep this air strike quiet for domestic Iraqi politics . The close cooperation between the post-2003 Iraqi government and Iran has been criticised by critics within Iraq over the last decade as a surrender of Baghdad to \"Safavis\", a reference to the 16th century Shia dynasty in Iran that tried to secure what is today Iraq from the Ottomans . This footage, along with pictures of Qassim Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Quds Force, training Iraqi forces on Iranian equipment used by both the Iraqi military and Shia militias, have only alienated Iraq's disenfranchised communities with whom Baghdad needs to ultimately reconcile . This modus vivendi over Iraq will hinge on the future of the ongoing nuclear negotiations and the Syrian civil war . But in both cases, there could be an endgame that resolves the mutual antagonisms between Iran and the US . Media coverage acknowledges that despite Iranian-US cooperation in Iraq, they still support rival sides in the Syrian civil war . However ,  even in that conflict, they do share a mutual desire for that conflict to end with a political solution . Such a solution will save Iran from the huge financial costs of subsidising the Syrian military and end a conflict that the US has been hesitant to engage in since its onset in the summer of 2011 . Al Jazeera's correspondent in Iraq, Imran Khan, in an article in November raised the question: Are the US and Iran on the same side in Iraq? The answer to this question is not only a \"yes\" in Iraq, but could also be a \"yes\" in terms of the long-term stability of Syria and Afghanistan . It is domestic politics in both the US and Iran that prevent any official from saying this publicly .", "output": "Iran's geographical depth means the US has needed Iran during both the Cold War and post-Cold War era, regardless of the government in Tehran Both the US and Iran will continue to clash over their respective relationships with Israel, Iran under the shah was one of the few US allies that could purchase the advanced F-14 Tomcat interceptor of \"Top Gun\" fame, with one of the most sophisticated radars at the time", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}, {"instruction": "Your task is to extract the thesis of an opinionated news article by selecting some of its text segments.

At the time of the last election, David Cameron pronounced that TV debates were \"here to stay\" . It was his confident declaration that:\"We will have them in every election in the future and that is a really good thing for democracy.\" Many others thought so too . More than 20 million people watched some or all of them . They engaged voters in ways that we hadn't seen before in Britain . To many, it was unthinkable that they wouldn't become a permanent feature of the fabric of our elections . It gives me no pleasure to say that I have always had great doubts that this was really the case . For it to be true, you had to trust the Tory leader not to change his mind . TV debates happened in 2010 only because of an unusual set of circumstances . Mr Cameron had demanded them because that is what opposition leaders nearly always do . Nick Clegg wanted to gain exposure that no previous third party leader had enjoyed . In the wake of the expenses scandal, all the parties were anxious to be seen trying to connect with alienated voters . The key was Gordon Brown . Unusually for a prime minister, he agreed to debates . His people thought he had little to lose and, in a typically Gordon Brownish way, he reckoned he would come over as the man of substance while his Tory and Lib Dem rivals would be exposed as lightweights . It didn't work out as Mr Brown expected . But what is most relevant to what is happening now is that it didn't work out as Mr Cameron anticipated either . The Lib Dem leader, an unknown to many voters before the debates, shone in the first one , presenting himself as the true candidate of change to the disadvantage of David Cameron and unleashing the \"Cleggmania\" that now seems so long ago . On election night, I was aboard the boat in the Thames hired by the BBC . Among those also present to comment on the results was Michael Ashcroft, the Tory donor and pollster . As it became clear that his party had failed to secure a majority , he placed the blame on the TV debates . That view has since become orthodoxy in the Conservative party . Whether it is entirely true or not, it has been engraved into the Tory soul . Two people were very badly burnt: Mr Cameron himself and George Osborne , who ran the last Tory election campaign and was widely castigated by his colleagues for agreeing to the debates . The chancellor long ago told friends that he is not going to make the same mistake twice . Lynton Crosby, the prime minister's Australian strategist, is also dead-set against TV debates . Craig Oliver, the Number 10 communications chief who has been leading the Tory side in the debate negotiations, is another key figure who believes it is all downside for them . The first reason that David Cameron and his advisers are against debates is the traditional one . He doesn't want to concede equality of status to his opponents . The experience of the Clegg-Farage debates during the Euro elections hardened the belief in Number 10 that debates are bad for incumbents and a gift to challengers . The view around Mr Cameron is expressed by one close ally:\"If you are the incumbent, debates are heavily weighted in favour of the insurgents. It is a rigged game.\" It is not, as is often assumed, fear of Nigel Farage coming at him from the right that most worries the prime minister . His biggest concern is giving a boost to Ed Miliband . TV debates are the Labour leader's best remaining opportunity to secure mass exposure to voters sceptical that he is up to being prime minister and get them to reconsider their view . So poor are his personal ratings, Mr Miliband might only have to turn up and string together a few half-decent sentences and more people would think better of him . The hope that their man could benefit by exceeding low expectations is why Labour is desperate for debates to happen . Which makes the Tories equally desperate for them not to happen . The Conservatives, as we saw last week with their \"dodgy dossier\" about Labour's spending plans, want to revert to an old-fashioned model of election in which the campaign is dominated by staged leaders' tours in which the prime minister wafts around the country looking presidential and morning news conferences designed, with a bit of help from their friends in the press, to shape the campaign to a Tory agenda . So, from the off, the Conservatives have done everything in their power to prevent TV debates from happening at this election . The broadcasters and the other parties wanted to begin negotiations about the format last spring . The Tories stalled , saying they wouldn't start talking until October . When the negotiations finally got under way, I am told, and by a variety of different sources, that the Conservatives were determined to block any progress toward agreement . \"At every stage, they sought to put obstacles in the way,\" says one source . Another confirms:\"The Tories kept throwing spanners in the works.\" According to a third:\"All the parties, including Ukip, took part in good faith except the Conservatives.\" Last time around, \"a heads of agreement\" about the debates had been written by December . This time around, we have got to mid-January and aren't even close to that . The last meeting was just before Christmas . \"We didn't get anywhere because of the Tories,\" says one source, an account that is again corroborated by others . I have learned that a meeting between the parties and the broadcasters was scheduled for the Thursday just gone . It was cancelled at the last minute by the Conservatives . No new date has been set . The prime minister's latest excuse for nobbling debates is that he won't do it unless the Greens are included . I happen to agree that the Greens ought to be represented in one debate . There is not much logic to Ofcom's recent preliminary recommendation that Ukip and the Lib Dems should be treated as \"major\" parties for the purposes of allocating airtime during the campaign, but not the Greens . They have been nip and tuck with the Lib Dems in the opinion polls and quite often done better . They have had representation in the House of Commons for longer than Ukip . So I agree that it would be fair to include the Greens - and hoot with laughter to hear that argument coming out of the mouth of David Cameron . When did he become obsessed with championing the rights of minority parties? Who knew he had such a passion to debate with Natalie Bennett? In the history of political excuses, this must go down as one of the most terrible . By running away from debates, the Tories are taking some risk with their leader's reputation and sense of himself . Says one senior government figure:\"Cameron doesn't like being called chicken.\" If the Cameron brand is supposed to be the strong and confident leader , why is he frit of debating Ed Miliband, a man the Tories keep telling us is hopelessly weak? Won't it simply look bad to deny TV debates to the voters? Yes, it will , but the Tories are calculating that any fuss will be short- lived, soon forgotten and, in the end, not that many voters will punish them for it, especially if their spinners can successfully sow confusion about who is responsible . The Tories also bargain that the press won't make that big a deal of it . About that, they may be right . There was resentment among newspapers during the last campaign that their capacity to shape the agenda was reduced by the TV debates . There are journalists and editors who will be secretly happy if they don't happen again . As things stand , I think the chances of TV election debates happening are somewhere between zilch and nada . Could anything change that? Some suggest that the broadcasters should call David Cameron's bluff and threaten to stage debates without him - \"empty chair\" him in the jargon . Labour and the Lib Dems hope this will happen . Number 10 is assuming that the BBC wouldn't have the nerve , the other broadcasters will follow its lead , and holding a debate without Mr Cameron might anyway be a breach of the laws about election coverage . A debate between everyone but the prime minister could even suit the Tories when they want to project him as the statesman floating above the fray . A more realistic way to flush him out would be to strip him of the Green figleaf he is using as his pretext for not debating . The broadcasters could redraft their proposal to include Natalie Bennett in one of the debates . Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip could say that they'd be content for her to participate . I think they would . Labour and the Lib Dems aren't keen on including the Greens , who have been taking votes off both of them , but when it comes to the crunch, they'd rather have a debate with the Greens than no debates at all . Even then, the Tories are so determined to avoid TV debates that they'd most likely concoct another pretext for sabotaging them . But at least everyone would then be crystal clear who is to blame .", "output": "At the time of the last election, David Cameron pronounced that TV debates were \"here to stay\" It was his confident declaration that:\"We will have them in every election in the future and that is a really good thing for democracy.\", To many, it was unthinkable that they wouldn't become a permanent feature of the fabric of our elections It gives me no pleasure to say that I have always had great doubts that this was really the case, At the time of the last election, David Cameron pronounced that TV debates were \"here to stay\"", "category": "Summarization 1149.json"}]
