With Donald Trump in the White House and the possibility of  Roy Moore  in the Senate  the nation is watching closely to see whether the GOP is becoming the party of the GOB -- the good old boys.\nWhile some Senate elections are just about the politics of a state   Moore 's victory would leave a huge imprint on the way that voters perceive the Republican Party for years to come. It could easily affect the 2018 and 2020 elections.\nHe has no respect for the separation between church and state.  Moore  was removed as chief justice when  he  refused to dismantle the Ten Commandments monument  he  had installed in the Alabama Judicial Building. Like President Trump   he  was one of the birthers who falsely claimed that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States  and thus his presidency was illegitimate.\nIn 2006   Moore  responded to the election of Keith Ellison  the first Muslim-American elected to Congress  by stating that Ellison shouldn't be able to take his seat.\nDuring his campaign   Moore  has referred to Native Americans and Asian-Americans as \"reds and yellows.\" And when an African-American at a rally asked when America was \"great \"  Moore  responded : \"I think it was great at the time when families were united -- even though we had slavery -- they cared for one another. ... Our families were strong  our country had a direction.\"\n Moore  even said that 9/11 might have happened because Americans were not religious enough; God was unhappy that \"we legitimize sodomy\" and \"legitimize abortion.\"\nWith Trump as President and  Moore  as a senator  Democrats would have a strong case to make about the GOP jumping deep into the world of identity politics: defining itself through one caricature version of the identity of the white  male  non-college educated voter.\nIt will become harder for members of the GOP to argue that the party is best suited to lead a nation that has become more pluralistic  more diverse and culturally liberal than ever before. If the Republicans want any moral high ground on cultural questions  it will be much more difficult to claim it with  Moore  as one of the faces of the party.\nAnd it looks as though  Moore  is very much in the race despite everything that we have learned. Democratic competitor Doug Jones has only a slim lead over  Moore .\nWhy is it that  Moore  might pull this off? Why would the Republican Party be taking this kind of risk? It is easy to blame Jones for running a lackluster campaign  but  in fact  he has offered the kind of candidacy and campaign that political analysts have been calling for. He is a white male  a centrist concerned about a strong middle-class economy  a gun-toting Democrat  and at the same time someone with impeccable credentials on civil rights -- as a US attorney  he successfully prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members for a church bombing in 1963.\nJUST WATCHED How will Alabama vote in  Moore  vs. Jones race? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How will Alabama vote in  Moore  vs. Jones race? 04:44\nThough many prominent Republicans have denounced  Moore 's candidacy -- Sen. Jeff Flake even sent a check to the Jones campaign -- key parts of the Republican Party have fallen behind him. This is essential to why victory is possible. Most importantly  President Trump has now endorsed  Moore  . \"Go get 'em  Roy!\" he reportedly said at the end of their phone conversation on Monday morning.\nTrump  who said he would not campaign for  Moore   held a rally in Florida -- less than 30 miles from the Alabama border -- on Friday. \"The future of the country cannot afford to lose a seat in the very  very close United States Senate \" Trump said during the rally. \"We need somebody in that Senate seat who will vote for our Make America Great Again agenda. So get out and vote for  Roy Moore .\"\nLast Monday  the Republican National Committee rejoined Moore's campaign to move  him  toward victory after cutting ties with  him  because of the sexual assault accusations. Stephen Bannon  the executive chairman of Breitbart News  who now must be considered a power broker in the party as a result of his work on Trump's campaign and in his administration  has aggressively campaigned for  Moore  as one of his \"anti-establishment\" candidates.\nThe fact is that large portions of the Republican leadership are now comfortable with someone like  Moore  standing within their tent. It is fallacious to paint  him  as an outsider  since this campaign proves that the Republican Party has changed and there is sufficient room for these kinds of extremist elements to be welcomed into its ranks.\nIt is not surprising that the  Moore  campaign continues to remind voters  in its advertisements  about  Moore 's strong opposition to abortion -- a key issue for conservatives. The appeal to voters is that all his \"peccadillos \" as they seem to dismiss them as being  are forgivable if they allow Republicans to retain the seat. As Ron Brownstein has perceptively argued  a  Moore  victory would come down to  his  retaining the support of white women who have no college education and who will hold their noses and vote for  Moore  despite  his  record with women.", "output": "Roy Moore", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

The Times article portrays a conflict between the intellectual elites in Madison who \u00e2\u0080\u009cpredictably oppose\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans and the real Wisconsinites \u00e2\u0080\u009caway from Madison\u00e2\u0080\u009d who believe that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic workers needed to share in the sacrifice that their own families have been forced to make.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It quotes six people who work in the private sector who support  Walker \u00e2\u0080\u0099s crackdown on public sector unions  and only two who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it.\nHowever  this three-to-one ratio in support of  Walker  seems slightly peculiar  given the voting patterns in the area. The eight Wisconsinites lived in towns across Rock  Walworth and Jefferson Counties.  Walker  won 55 percent of the vote in the three counties in 2010  and 54 percent in the 2012 recall election. Both times  Walker  actually lost Rock County  where Janesville is located  making up for it in the other two  redder counties.\nAlso notable is  Walker \u00e2\u0080\u0099s excitement that the lede on the story is about a man named Rich Hahn  who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been laid off twice by GM. The reason for Walker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s joy is obvious: The piece originally described Hahn as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca union man from a union town\u00e2\u0080\u009d who nevertheless believed \u00e2\u0080\u009csomething needs to be done \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and quickly\u00e2\u0080\u009d about greedy public unions. However  after the United Auto Workers found no record of Hahn as a member  the Times ran a correction reading that while Hahn \u00e2\u0080\u009cdescribed himself to a reporter as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098union guy \u00e2\u0080\u0099 he now says that he has worked at unionized factories  but was not himself a union member.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "output": "Scott Walker", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Formerly a professor at Harvard Business School and INSEAD (France)  professor Hansen holds a PhD from Stanford Business School  where he was a Fulbright scholar.  Hansen  was also a manager at the Boston Consulting Group  where  he  advised corporate clients worldwide.  He  is the coauthor (with Jim Collins) of the New York Times bestseller Great by Choice and the author of the books Collaboration and Great at Work. We caught up with  him  to discuss the latter book.\nCourtesy of Morten  Hansen \n Morten Hansen : I think it owes  in some part  to ingrained norms  in particular our enduring workplace traditions. Although we live in an age of perpetual \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisruption \u00e2\u0080\u009d so much of how people work today is old  born at the dawn of the industrial revolution. The dreaded performance review  for instance  dates from at least the 1940s and draws intellectually from Frederick Taylor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on scientific management during the early 20th century. Ethical codes and other rules of professional conduct originated in the 19th century  when modern professions were first taking shape. Technology is now upending many of these conventions  and many people are pushing beyond \u00e2\u0080\u009cbusiness as usual\u00e2\u0080\u009d and questioning how work gets done. And yet  change is slow  and much of the traditional edifice of work remains in place.\n Hansen : In Great at Work  I set out four \u00e2\u0080\u009cwork smarter\u00e2\u0080\u009d practices that relate directly to how well individuals get their own work done. In organizing our efforts  for instance  we can choose to restrict the scope of our work and to obsess to excel over the few priorities we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve selected (a practice I call \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo Less  Then Obsess\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Of course  that is not easy to do when people constantly ask for help  request meetings  and when your boss keeps on giving you more to do. The best handle this by becoming good at saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cno.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a key skill to learn to succeed in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hectic workplace.\n Hansen : When I began the research described in this book  I posed a simple question: Why do some people perform better at work than others? As my study progressed  and the answers to this question came into focus  I noticed an interesting pattern: Many of the top performers my research team and I interviewed  the ones who embraced the seven \u00e2\u0080\u009cwork smarter\u00e2\u0080\u009d practices outlined in the book  realized benefits that extended well beyond their work performance.

Fresh clashes broke out between security forces and demonstrators charging vote fraud in Ahmadinejad's recent re-election victory outside a canceled funeral service for another of the dead. Reformist leaders  meanwhile  sought to obtain a permit to hold a massive commemoration for those killed in the violence that has followed the disputed June 12 presidential vote.\n Ahmadinejad's latest personnel moves suggests that neither the burgeoning reformist movement shaking the country nor a week-long effort by conservatives against his pick for vice president have spurred the president to change his confrontational approach. It also highlights rising tensions between the president and fellow conservatives in parliament and elsewhere in Iran's political establishment.\n The controversy marked the second time in recent days that Ahmadinejad has faced off against fellow conservatives but ultimately been forced to back down.\n Conservative news agencies close to the government reported that Ahmadinejad abruptly sacked his ministers of Intelligence and Culture and possibly two others early Sunday in what many considered retribution for the ministers' efforts to scuttle Esfandiar Rahim Mashai's appointment as first in line to succeed the president.\n Hours later  Ahmadinejad changed his mind after he ignited a storm of criticism and was told by conservative senior lawmakers that  according to the nation's constitution  he'd have to submit his entire Cabinet to a new vote of parliament if he changed more than one minister  since he had already replaced so many during his four-year tenure.\n The president's office issued a statement saying that only Minister of Intelligence and Security Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei had been fired. Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Mohammad Hossein Saffar Harandi  a dedicated hard-liner  announced in a blistering note late Sunday that he would resign immediately after receiving \"verbal instructions\" from Ahmadinejad that he was fired.\n Though Ahmadinejad had long announced plans to reshuffle the Cabinet following his inauguration to a new term in less than two weeks  the sudden nature of the dismissals just days before the government was to expire anyway was considered an insulting rejoinder to conservative supporters of Ahmadinejad who had opposed Mashai's appointment.\n After bowing to Khamenei's request to remove Mashai as first vice-president  Ahmadinejad appointed him chief of staff.\n On Sunday  Ahmadinejad also appointed former Interior Minister Ali Kordan  who had resigned his post after admitting he had tried to bolster his resume with a phony Oxford degree  as his special inspector  who monitors the activities of the ministries and government.\n Ahmadinejad's confirmation for a second-term by Khamenei is set for Aug. 4 and his swearing-in ceremony will take place the next day  a lawmaker announced.

The United States is one of the wealthiest countries in the world  but  Alston  wanted to understand how it is that 40 million Americans live in poverty.  He  is the United Nations' special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. And  he 's with us now. Welcome to the show.\n PHILIP ALSTON : Thank you.\n ALSTON : I was looking primarily to see the relationship between the civil rights  which the United States holds so dear  and poverty. In other words  if you live in poverty in this country  can you actually enjoy the civil and political rights which you are supposedly guaranteed?\n ALSTON : To go to Skid Row in Los Angeles  to see the extent of it  the never-ending encampments and tents  the really grim circumstances under which people live. To go to Alabama to meet with people who live in areas that have no sewerage connection  and so their sewage is basically just pumped out into their gardens. Those sorts of things have a pretty big impact.\n ALSTON : So the rich are industrious  entrepreneurial  patriotic and the drivers of economic success. The poor  on the other hand  are wasters  losers and scammers. So as a result  money spent on welfare is money down the drain. Money devoted to the rich is a sound investment. The reality is that the United States now has probably the lowest degree of social mobility among all the rich countries. And if you are born poor  guess where you're going to end up - poor.\n ALSTON : I was very impressed by a lot of the community organizing that's going on in many places. I was very impressed by a voluntary health  dental  even psychological care clinic that I saw called West Virginia Health Right  which has no full-time doctors or dentists but relies on volunteer services from those communities and ends up seeing 21 000 patients a year.\n ALSTON : I have to admit that sometimes I fear that such superb and much-needed initiatives  they are taking the pressure off the state. And the state can sort of sit back and say  well  there's no need in that area. It's being done by these guys.\n ALSTON : Well  I think one of the most striking things is the lack of political will. I don't want to draw a comparison with China  but I did have to say when I was there that what was impressive was that Xi Jinping had made it a priority of his administration to eradicate extreme poverty. And when people said to me  oh  but he's just trying to keep control of the Communist Party  my response was  I think every politician is trying to keep control of government. And if others would dedicate themselves to eliminate poverty  then that would be great.\nMCEVERS:  Philip Alston  is the U.N. special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.

And New Orleans  we're still making history \"  Cantrell  told a cheering crowd in  her  victory speech.\nThe leader in most polls before the runoff election   she  never trailed as votes were counted.\n Her  opponent  former municipal Judge Desiree Charbonnet  conceded the race and congratulated  Cantrell  late Saturday. Later  complete returns showed  Cantrell  with 60 percent of the vote.\nBut  Cantrell  will face lingering problems. Crime is one. Another is dysfunction at the agency overseeing the city's drinking water system and storm drainage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a problem that became evident during serious flash flooding in August.\n Cantrell  faced questions about  her  use of a city credit card. Charbonnet had to fight back against critics who cast her as an insider who would steer city work to cronies.\nKatrina was a theme in the backstory of both candidates.  Cantrell  moved to the city from California.  Her  work as a neighborhood activist in the aftermath of Katrina in the hard-hit Broadmoor neighborhood helped  her  win a seat on council in 2012.\nCharbonnet  from a well-known political family in New Orleans  was the city's elected recorder of mortgages before  she  was a judge. In the campaign  she  made a point of saying  hers  was the first city office to re-open after Katrina  providing critical property records to the displaced.\n Cantrell  entered the race as the perceived front-runner  leading in fundraising and in various polls.  She  had an 11 percentage point lead in a poll released last week by the University of New Orleans. It showed 46 percent of 602 voters surveyed from Nov. 1-8 favored  Cantrell  over Charbonnet  who had 35 percent; 20 percent were undecided.\nUNO political science professor Edward Chervenak said the endorsements appeared to help  Cantrell  overcome revelations that she had used her city-issued credit card for thousands of dollars in purchases without clear indications that they were for public purposes. The money was eventually reimbursed but questions lingered about whether she had improperly used city money for personal or campaign expenditures.", "output": "LaToya Cantrell", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

DeMille has an incredible gift for perfectly capturing a character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice and unique personality. His protagonist in The Cuban Affair is 35-year-old former US Army infantry officer Daniel Graham MacCormick  or Mac for short.\nOriginally from Portland  Maine  we meet  Mac  once  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s become a charter fishing boat captain in Key West  Florida. We never fully hear about  Mac \u00e2\u0080\u0099s tour in Afghanistan except for some traumatic combat memories  but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told  he  has a Silver Star  two Purple Hearts  and shrapnel wounds  so DeMille makes it clear that  Mac  saw heavy action.\nDeMille reintroduces Mac into some abrupt  heart-racing action in The Cuban Affair. The story is told from the first-person point of view and is an action-packed  rollicking tale. After he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approached by a group of mysterious Cuban expats in Key West   Mac  gets talked into a top-secret mission to recover $60 million in U.S. cash and property deeds from a cave in Cuba that were hidden during Castro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violent overthrow of Fulgencio Batista in 1959.\n Mac  feels like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something fishy about the whole operation  but eventually signs on  enticed in part by a beautiful Cuban-American woman  Sara  who will be his partner for the mission. DeMille showcases his humor throughout the book  such as when Sara is talking  Mac  into accepting the mission. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out on  Mac \u00e2\u0080\u0099s charter boat and Sara tries to appeal to his sense of adventure and his sense of right and wrong  with mixed results:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk yourself out of this   Mac . There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a saying\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0098 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather regret the things I did than the things I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Mac   of course  ends up taking on the mission and getting  himself  in hot water after traveling to Cuba under the cover of a Yale educational tour then breaking away to get the hidden money. Things don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go as planned and the book ends up taking a few sharp zigs and zags as it rockets to its conclusion  but this refreshing  zany  and cynical sense of humor is a great recurring feature throughout the book.\nDemille also doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shy away from the hard topics. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncompromising in his look at the sadness of modern Cuba and the empty rhetoric of its socialist revolution.  Mac  doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really care about what happened in Cuba and comes across as basically apolitical: He just wants to get the money and the girl.\nThere are complications  naturally. The money is buried in a rural cave in a heavily armed police state full of citizen informants and the girl has a boyfriend. Nonetheless  despite his focus on the basics and disinterest in politics   even Mac  starts to feel disillusioned after arriving in Havana and looking around at the state of things. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRevolutions usually replace one group of incompetent autocratic assholes with another  and the real losers are everyone else  \u00e2\u0080\u009d Mac  ponders at one point.\nWhen  he  finds out about the food situation in Cuba it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more sobering. Sara explains to  him  that Cuba is basically half starving as they look around an organic farm:\nEven as Sara and Mac traverse Cuba and get into big trouble  DeMille keeps the laughs coming. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite funny that DeMille puts a character called Richard Neville (clearly a humorous stand-in for himself) into the book. Neville is a bestselling adventure author traveling with  Mac \u00e2\u0080\u0099s tour group in Cuba to research a book and Mac notices Neville\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly attractive wife (a real \u00e2\u0080\u009clooker\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Not believing she could really be into the grouchy writer   Mac  surmises she must be attracted to Neville for \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe bulge in his pants \u00e2\u0080\u0093 his wallet  not his crotch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNeville and  Mac  also have a bit of a rivalry for Sara and a competing inside joke about Ernest Hemingway that is hilarious. As Neville takes photos in front of Hemingway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house in Cuba:\nAs  Mac  and Sara work to get the money they run into a citizen informer  or chivato. He tries to buy them off in return for his silence that he suspects they are up to funny business and explains how things really work in the Communist paradise:\nIn another part  Mac  and Sara walk through the nicest neighborhood of Havana and are shocked at what they see  which is outright hypocrisy:\nIn the end  The Cuban Affair manages to combine just the right amount of sassy and sad. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t focus all on doom and gloom  nor does it pretend that everything is merely a joke. At its most profound \u00e2\u0080\u009cteachable moment \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Mac  concludes that life is messy and the truth about humanity lies somewhere in between optimism and blackpill nihilism.  He  concludes that human affairs are complex and paradoxical  alternately bringing out the best and worst in different individuals.\nIn  his  acknowledgements  DeMille mentions that  he  did personally go on a Yale educational tour of Cuba to prepare for the book\u00e2\u0080\u0094Richard Neville  indeed.  He  also thanks various friends  family  and colleagues who helped and advised  him  on the book. One is especially telling  because it shows that this book comes from the source:\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to thank a man who I met in Cuba  and who gave it to  me  straight about contemporary Cuban politics  culture  and life. He wishes to remain anonymous for obvious reasons  but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s given himself the code name \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lola.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Thank you  Lola  wherever you are  and take care.", "output": "Daniel Graham MacCormick", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

( McGowan  alleged in a series of tweets earlier this month that Weinstein raped her).\n\"My reaction was one of shock \" Rodriguez continued. \"I recall clearly what I said next  'My God  why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you say anything? People would have stood up for you! And where was your fianc\u00c3\u00a9 during all this? I would have at least beaten the crap out of Harvey if I had heard that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  Rose  said they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do.  She  confided that a female attorney had told  her  that because  she  had done nudity in movies that no jury would believe  her  and that it would turn into a he said/ she  said case.\"\n McGowan  explained to Rodriguez that  she  had been told to sign a non-disclosure agreement not to talk about the incident. Rodriguez said he then came up with a plan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to cast  McGowan  in an upcoming project he was working on with Quentin Tarantino for Dimension (a division of the Weinstein Company  under Bob Weinstein)  which turned out to be Grindhouse.\n\"Just as I finished telling  Rose  this  I saw Harvey walking around the party! I called Harvey over to our table  and as soon as he got close enough to see that I was sitting with Rose  his face dropped and went ghostly white. I said  'Hey Harvey  this is  Rose McGowan . I think she's amazing and really talented and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to cast her in my next movie '\" the director said. \"Harvey then dribbled all over himself in the most over the top performance I'd ever seen as he gushed  'Oh she's wonderful  oh she's amazing  oh she's fantastic  oh she's so talented\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You two should definitely work together.' And then he skittered off. I knew right then that every word  Rose  told me was true  you could see it all over his face.\"\nOn Friday  however   McGowan  spoke out about  her  alleged rape at the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Convention in Detroit  Michigan  calling on other women to come forward.\n\"I have been silenced for 20 years. I have been slut-shamed. I have been harassed. I have been maligned and you know what? I'm just like you \"  she  said. \"Because what happened to me behind the scenes happens to all of us in society and it cannot stand and it will not stand.\"", "output": "Rose McGowan", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.
