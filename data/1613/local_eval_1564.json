When you cut down a tree, you eliminate it's ability to store carbon in the future, but the products made from those trees still store that carbon ... it's locked up in the wood product. A tree that falls and rots stores some carbon in the soil, but most is released to the atmosphere. When trees operate in a system, forests are great carbon sinks, no doubt, but I think you're overestimating the value of a small patch of trees here that are not part of a larger forest system ... trees that are apparently getting knocked down by storms and probably rotting, based on other comments here. You'll get nearly as much carbon storage cutting and replanting as you will leaving them to rot in such a small clump.", "output": "Non-toxic", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 955.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.
