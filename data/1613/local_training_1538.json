The four trucks, under heavy security, crossed the border from Chaman in Pakistan's Balochistan province.

On Tuesday, Islamabad decided to reopen the crucial supply routes shut down on November 27, a day after coalition forces mistakenly killed 24 Pakistani troops. The incident plunged U.S.-Pakistan relations to an all-time low.
