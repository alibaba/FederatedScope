The brightness is adjustable by just touching the level button, which I can use as the sunshine or lack thereof outside my window changes.

A 2 hour run time is advertised with the correct battery, but with the Ni-Mh I was lucky to see 30 minutes of use. Charging takes an extremely long time, and concerns of an electrical short or excessive heat from the incorrect battery have come up as well. The Roomba itself is great, but a lack of acceptable customer support in replacing the battery ruined the chance I was going to give this product. When I contacted iRobot to seek assistance, the product I received has been used by 6 different customers and has been registered for 3 years. \n Polarity: negative", "output": "True", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 431.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, You are given an amazon review and its polarity (positive or negative).

I wake up and today I see the price has dropped 5 dollars. I hate price fluctuations like that, and I feel every such price change, done with no warning, no ability to predict or prepare for it, and which, in a situation like this, grossly takes advantage of people who made a purchase RIGHT BEFORE such a change, are impetus enough to never purchase a product from a particular company again. I live on a budget. $5 changes in prices in what I buy add up, and quickly. I am absolutely disgusted. If I felt I could do so without the appearance of abusing Amazon return policy, I would demand a full refund and return the product, when it arrives next Friday. This is infuriating. As is, I will use it when it arrives, but no matter how well it works, I will not adjust my ratings. I will only ever purchase, in the future, from a company that I do not feel is taking advantage of it's customers. \n Polarity: negative", "output": "True", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 431.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, You are given an amazon review and its polarity (positive or negative).
