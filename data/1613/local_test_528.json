Tumor-acquired suppression of apoptosis contributes to therapy resistance. Many HR NB tumors depend on the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 for survival, through Bcl-2 sequestration and inhibition of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bim. Bcl-2 dependent xenografts derived from aggressive human NB tumors are cured with a combination of cyclophosphamide and ABT-737, a Bcl-2/Bcl-XL/Bcl-w small molecule antagonist. The oral analogue to ABT-737, Navitoclax (ABT-263), clinically causes an immediate drop in peripheral platelet counts as mature platelets depend on Bcl-xL for survival. This led to the creation of a Bcl-2 selective inhibitor, ABT-199 (Venetoclax). A Phase I trial of ABT-199 in CLL showed remarkable antitumor activity and stable patient platelet counts.

Afterwards, vascular reactivity of epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve and nerve conduction velocity and blood flow was determined.', 'Vascular and neural function was significantly impaired in ZDF rats compared with age-matched lean (control) rats. Treating ZDF rats with AVE7688 improved vascular relaxation to acetylcholine and calcitonin gene-related peptide in epineurial arterioles. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, endoneurial blood flow and thermal nociception end-points were also improved by treatment compared with untreated ZDF rats. Superoxide and expression of NEP were increased in epineurial arterioles from ZDF rats and attenuated by treatment with AVE7688.\\Question: Does treatment of Zucker diabetic fatty rats with AVE7688 improve vascular and neural dysfunction?", "output": "AVE7688 is an effective treatment for microvascular and neural disease in ZDF rats.

In this report, we hypothesize that the administration of a dose less than 129 mg of vitamin A/kg would also be effective in lowering the plasma HDL-C levels in these rats.', 'Changes in the activity and expression of proteins related to RCT were analyzed together with blood parameters in five-month-old male lean and obese rats supplemented with 2.6 (control group), 26, 52 and 129 mg of vitamin A/kg as retinyl palmitate for 20 weeks.', 'Vitamin A supplementation in the obese rats decreased the plasma HDL-C levels with a concomitant increase in the hepatic SR-BI expression and lipase activity compared to that observed in the control diet-fed obese rats treated with 2.6 mg of vitamin A/kg diet. Furthermore, vitamin A supplementation at doses of 52 and 129 mg/kg diet reduced the plasma lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity and increased the hepatic ATP-binding cassette transporter protein A1 expression in the obese rats.

Clonogenic GSC surviving 500\\xa0\u03bcM TMZ (GSC-500\\xa0\u03bcM TMZ), were isolated. Molecular signatures were identified via comparative analysis of expression microarray against parental GSC (GSC-parental). The recombinant protein of top downregulated signature was used as a single agent or in combination with TMZ, for evaluating therapeutic effects of treatment of GSC.', 'The molecular signatures characterized an activation of protective stress responses in GSC-500\\xa0\u03bcM TMZ, mainly including biotransformation/detoxification of xenobiotics, blocked endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and inhibited growth/differentiation. Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) was identified as the top down-regulated gene in GSC-500\\xa0\u03bcM TMZ. Although augmenting BMP7 signaling in GSC by exogenous BMP7 treatment did not effectively stop GSC growth, it markedly sensitized both GSC-500\\xa0\u03bcM TMZ and GSC-parental to 35\\xa0\u03bcM TMZ treatment, leading to loss of self-renewal and migration capacity. BMP7 treatment induced senescence of GSC cultures and suppressed mRNA expression of CD133, MGMT, and ATP-binding cassette drug efflux transporters (ABCB1, ABCG2), as well as reconfigured transcriptional profiles in GSC by downregulating genes associated with EMT/migration/invasion, stemness, inflammation/immune response, and cell proliferation/tumorigenesis.

All of the groups were made up of users who shared similar knowledge in the field of computers, but with different abilities in using computers, from beginners to advanced users. All of the groups were of mixed gender. The first two groups (consisting of 23 test users) graded the usability of the user interface for web-based lecture on demand with the help of the standardized SUMI questionnaire. After that, two groups (20 students from high school and 20 adults) joined in a 45-min informational program on the history of the deaf. Both groups were then divided into two smaller subgroups of 10 participants.

This study was designed to analyze the relationship between condition of patients with colorectal cancer at operation and long-term overall survival.', 'A total of 542 patients survived a radical resection for Stages I, II, or III colorectal cancer. Physiologic POSSUM score at surgery, exclusive of age, was calculated for all patients. Mean physiologic POSSUM score was used as cutoff point to determine low-risk and high-risk group patients. A Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to study the effect of low-risk and high-risk group on overall survival and to identify independent risk factors.', 'Five-year overall survival was significantly higher in low-risk group patients than in high-risk group patients (low-risk group 66.6 percent vs. high-risk group 48.5 percent; P < 0.001). Differences in overall survival also were found when patients in Stages I, II, and III were analyzed separately.

We here consider the exposing scenario of NPs through an environmental route exemplified by the use of hydrophobins, highly adhesive proteins that are secreted into the environment in large quantities by fungi. HFBII of Trichoderma reesei has been used as a model protein and we have shown strong binding to polystyrene NPs of different sizes and surface groups. Hydrophobin coated NPs are shown to strongly increase the stability and the dispersion when exposed to human plasma compared to pristine ones particles. It is also shown that the presence of hydrophobin on the NPs results in an attenuated protein corona formation, in a different corona composition, and we also show that hydrophobin remained strongly associated to the NPs in competition with plasma proteins. As a conclusion we therefore suggest that the route of exposure of nanoparticles strongly affects their surface properties and their possible physiological behavior.\\Question: Does an environmental route of exposure affect the formation of nanoparticle coronas in blood plasma?", "output": "This work shows how a self-assembling protein, class II hydrophobin HFBII, with interesting biocompatible coating properties, strongly adsorbs on polystyrene NPs. HFBII is also shown to reduce aggregation of the NPs in human plasma which can increase their bioavailability with potential use in biomedical applications. The results here are also of significance for understanding possible interactions of NPs with living organisms. Hydrophobins are secreted in large quantities into the environment by fungi and this work shows how the biological environment of NPs determines the surface and colloidal properties of the particles by forming a protein corona, and that the history of the particle environment, here simulated with hydrophobin exposure, affects both plasma protein corona formation and dispersion behavior. This work thus simulates how alternative exposure routes affect nanoparticle properties, important in understanding the biological fate of NPs.", "category": "Question Answering 1473.json"}]
