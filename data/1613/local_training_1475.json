Alas, thank you for coming into the studio. What kind of unusual ability are we talking about here? W: Wow, it's quite easy to describe. Basically, when I read a word or even think of a particular word, such as Tuesday, I see a color connected with it. It's not that I imagine a color. I really see it loading in front of my eyes. M: How interesting! Is it a sort of medical condition? W: Yes. And just recently doctors have begun to understand it more. They call it synesthesia, which means that somewhere in my brain, there are links between sections that should really be separate. Other people have a form of this condition that affects emotions. So they see colors when they feel particular emotions. Apparently, it's generally passed on from parents to their children, which is the case with me. M: Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability? W: Yes, my brother is the same as me. If we start talking about it, people think we are completely mad. When we were younger, we used to have arguments about things like what color the word Tuesday is. It turns out that everyone with this condition sees different colors. M: It sounds as though it could make life quite exhausting. W: I suppose it does. But you see, if you've never known anything different, you don't think of it like that. It does make you aware of your moods. I know when I started to feel depressed, things begin to look grey. M: Are there any other advantages do you find? W: Well, it seems that quite a lot of artists and musicians have this condition. So I guess it can be beneficial if it's combined with some sort of gift or natural talent, which is not the case with me unfortunately. But I do find that it makes reading very interesting, because sometimes a sentence has a very nice range of colors. So you want to read it again just to experience that.

He just seems so depressed. I just can't figure it out. Woman: So, this has been going on like half a year? Man: Yeah, kind of on and off, but I don't know. I ... I just thought it would just kind of go away, and I just thought things would just get, I don't know, get better. Woman: Yeah, that's not, that's pretty worrrisome. Um, I mean, I've noticed he's not hanging out with Jared very much anymore. You know, is he ... what's he doing when he's up? Man: Well, uh, a lot of the time he's not up. He just kind of uh, stays in bed. [ Really? ] I just can't figure it out. I don't know. Woman: Yeah, that's, that's a big problem. I can see why you're really worried about him. Have you considered taken him to see a therapist, or a psychologist, or anybody? Man: Ah, no. I, I ... It's probably just a phase or something. I think some kids were picking on him at school, but I think that's stopped. He doesn't talk about it anymore, so I guess that's over. Woman: So, you're saying that he was like being bullied and stuff? Man: Yes, yeah. But he didn't talk about it a lot. I thought it was just, you know, having some problems, and it just kind of would go away.

Uh, and well, his girlfriend just broke up with him, so I guess maybe that's had an impact on him. Woman: Yeah, it has. Uh, that explains a lot. Um, have you looked at his Facebook page lately? [ What? ] He posted some stuff, well, he was posting some stuff, I think it was last night around midnight, um, yeah, talking about how much life sucks, wishing he could just disappear. [ Oh! ] Um, you know, I can't remember exactly the words he said, but I know that it really, really worried me. Some of the things he wrote are signs of, they might be thinking about suicide. Man: Ah, I, I, I just can't figure that out. I mean, kids sometimes just talk like that. I, I, I thought. I thought that was kind of natural. Woman: Yes, sometimes they do that. That's what makes it hard. Sometimes, kids just talk like that, but some of them are serious, and some of them end up talking their own lives. Some of them really do kill themselves. You know, you need to take this seriously. Six months (of being depressed) isn't normal. Six months isn't just to act like this isn't just a phase. It's, there's something going on. Man: So, any ideas? I mean, what should I do? I'm just kind of at a loss here. Woman: Oh, you know. I was talking to a woman the other day about her daughter. Um, there are crisis numbers you can call. Also, you could go to the hospital; you can do to the emergency room, and they do assessments there. Psychological assessments. [ Okay. ] Um, you know, it might be kind of hard to get him out to the hospital, to get him out to go with you if you can't get him out to go to school, but you need to take this seriously. [ Yeah ... ] You could take him down to the hospital, down to the emergency room, so ... Man: I don't know. Woman: You know, it's really important because you've got to get on top of it. He needs you; he needs to know that you really love him, that you're not just kind of ignoring this. Man: You know, I recently noticed that that I just saw some marks on his arms the other day, and I didn't know. I asked him about it. Kind of looked like some scratches, or something, and ... Woman: I saw those too, and those aren't scratches. They're too deep to be scratches. He's doing self-harm, too. Man: Oh, man. Woman: You know, um, these are really serious things, and he's crying out for help. He doesn't know how to handle what is going on in his life. He's really struggling. Man: You know, about a month ago, there was another boy in school, I think it (he) was about his age that, uh, took his own life, and I am wondering if that's had an impact on him. Woman: Umm, don't you think it would have? Man: Probably. I don't know how well he knew the boy, but uh, I don't know. Woman: Yeah, things like that do have an impact on kids, and you just can't run the risk. He might be mad at you for hauling him down to to the hospital, but you need help to find out what's going on, so that you can support him, and so you can make sure you are getting him all the help that he can have. These things are serious, and you don't want to look back later and say I wish I had done that. Man: Right. Well, yeah, send me that information, and uh, I'll start looking at it.

Alas, thank you for coming into the studio. What kind of unusual ability are we talking about here? W: Wow, it's quite easy to describe. Basically, when I read a word or even think of a particular word, such as Tuesday, I see a color connected with it. It's not that I imagine a color. I really see it loading in front of my eyes. M: How interesting! Is it a sort of medical condition? W: Yes. And just recently doctors have begun to understand it more. They call it synesthesia, which means that somewhere in my brain, there are links between sections that should really be separate. Other people have a form of this condition that affects emotions. So they see colors when they feel particular emotions. Apparently, it's generally passed on from parents to their children, which is the case with me. M: Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability? W: Yes, my brother is the same as me. If we start talking about it, people think we are completely mad. When we were younger, we used to have arguments about things like what color the word Tuesday is. It turns out that everyone with this condition sees different colors. M: It sounds as though it could make life quite exhausting. W: I suppose it does. But you see, if you've never known anything different, you don't think of it like that. It does make you aware of your moods. I know when I started to feel depressed, things begin to look grey. M: Are there any other advantages do you find? W: Well, it seems that quite a lot of artists and musicians have this condition. So I guess it can be beneficial if it's combined with some sort of gift or natural talent, which is not the case with me unfortunately. But I do find that it makes reading very interesting, because sometimes a sentence has a very nice range of colors. So you want to read it again just to experience that. Of course, this makes me quite a slow reader., Question: How does the woman's condition affect her reading? (A) It enables her to read faster than average.

Instead, Harrogate has become a popular town for people to retire to. Its clean air, attractive parks, and the absence of any industry, make this an ideal spot for people looking for a quiet life. Now, to tell us more about Harrogate, I have with me Tom Percival, President of the Chamber of Commerce. Tom, one of the things visitor notices about Harrogate is the large area of open park land right down into the middle of the town. Can you tell us more about it? M: Yes, certainly. The area is called the Stray. W: Why the Stray? M: It's called that because in the old days, people let their cattle stray on the area, which was common land. W: Oh, I see. M: Then, we've changes in farming and in land ownership. The Stray became part of the land owned by Harrogate. W: And is it protected? M: Oh, yes, indeed. As a special law, no one can build anything on the stray. It's protected forever. W: So it will always be park land? M: That's right. As you can see, some of the Stray is used for sports fields.

I've been to many countries such as Britain, Italy and Sweden. So I spend a lot of time at airports. While waiting for my flights, I watch people passing by and start my imagination. For example, the other day, when I was waiting for my flight to Greece, I saw a couple. They were buying magazines at that moment. They were not wearing business clothes, but the man was carrying a suitcase. Every few seconds, the woman looked around. I wondered if someone was following them. Perhaps they were running away, and you know, this reminded me of a story in the newspaper that day: a bank clerk stole one million pounds a week before and disappeared with his wife. There was a picture of them in the paper. The couple really looked like the wiz. Maybe I should stop them. Just then, I saw them say goodbye to each other, and the woman walked away.

Alas, thank you for coming into the studio. What kind of unusual ability are we talking about here? W: Wow, it's quite easy to describe. Basically, when I read a word or even think of a particular word, such as Tuesday, I see a color connected with it. It's not that I imagine a color. I really see it loading in front of my eyes. M: How interesting! Is it a sort of medical condition? W: Yes. And just recently doctors have begun to understand it more. They call it synesthesia, which means that somewhere in my brain, there are links between sections that should really be separate. Other people have a form of this condition that affects emotions. So they see colors when they feel particular emotions. Apparently, it's generally passed on from parents to their children, which is the case with me. M: Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability? W: Yes, my brother is the same as me. If we start talking about it, people think we are completely mad. When we were younger, we used to have arguments about things like what color the word Tuesday is. It turns out that everyone with this condition sees different colors. M: It sounds as though it could make life quite exhausting. W: I suppose it does. But you see, if you've never known anything different, you don't think of it like that. It does make you aware of your moods. I know when I started to feel depressed, things begin to look grey. M: Are there any other advantages do you find? W: Well, it seems that quite a lot of artists and musicians have this condition. So I guess it can be beneficial if it's combined with some sort of gift or natural talent, which is not the case with me unfortunately. But I do find that it makes reading very interesting, because sometimes a sentence has a very nice range of colors. So you want to read it again just to experience that.

W: We hope that it will somehow help people to change their feelings about old age. The problem is that far too many of us believe that most old people are poor, lonely, and unhappy. As a result, we tend to find old people, as a group, unattractive. And this is very dangerous for our society.

But we must also remember that the proportion of such people is no greater among the 60-70 age group than among the 50-60 age group. M: In other words, there is no more mental illness, for example, among the 60s-70s than among the 50s-60s. W: Right! M: Are people's mental abilities affected by old age? W: Certain changes do take place as we grow older, but this happens throughout life. These changes are very gradual and happen at different times with different people, but, in general, if you know a person well in his middle age and have seen how he deals with events and problems, you will easily recognize him in an old age.

Peter: I couldn't agree with you more, Jack. Americans are much more assertive than most foreigners. For example, Americans begin a discussion with a focus on accomplishments and concrete facts. Jack: You're right. America is a rather individualistic society, with less social pressure to conform. So you will need to become more assertive and to speak out on your own behalf. Peter: Another aspect of American behavior is Americans are more guarded about personal space. So when you are talking to an American, don't stay too close. This personal distance is not due to body odor or bad breath, but because closeness lends a sense of intimacy that is out of proportion to the relationship at the moment. Jack: Yes. Also, try to avoid physical contact while you are speaking. Touching is a bit too intimate for casual acquaintances. So don't put your arm around their shoulder, touch their face, or hold their hand. Shaking hands when you initially meet or part is acceptable, but this is only momentary. Peter: In many cultures, eye contact is a sign of disrespect, which is not the ease in America.
