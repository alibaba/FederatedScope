I also like the different events they hold. Fun times are always had at Flight!, Review_2: Cool bar with lots of space and picnic table seating. Went here to play Citizens of Humanity with some friends. Tots and fries were pretty good. I probably wouldn't get the veggie burger again - too soft and fell apart.It's next to Lucky's, so you can go next door if you get bored., Review_3: This is a pretty cool place. Tons of beer on tap. Large stage, Nice beer garden. Open space. The appetizers we did have were good. Bacon wrapped poppers, some fried pickles.. all good. Staff was on their game as well.

Best Rueben I have ever had in my entire life!!! Great place for parties or a date night! I highly recommend this place!!!, Review_5: I'd give zero stars if it were an option. 'Top shelf open bar.' No jack, no Jameson, no Bacardi, no captain Morgan, no Red Bull, no Cuervo. 'That's like top, top shelf.' I've never heard of the rum or whiskey they poured but it came it a plastic bottle. Fucking disappointment., Review_6: I started my night off at this bar and ordered two vodka sodas for me and my friend, and was instead given waters. They still charged me for two vodka sodas and told me I was too intoxicated to serve? I was completely sober and ripped off. Shocked by the inability to fill a simple order and just flat out disappointed. Do not recommend., Review_7: The place to be for a South Carolina game! It's always packed with fans and a great atmosphere. Drink prices are reasonable and the music is great. When there's not a game Flights a good place for a casual beer. The food is pretty good for bar food. Definitely recommend the pretzel or tater tots., Review_8: Food was average.

I would recommend this theatre to anybody., Review_5: Happy to be a Harkins customer. Prices for concessions are steep but that is somewhat expected. I like that they give you a free popcorn if you buy a $25 gift card. Use the gift card to pay for tickets and other goodies. Upgrade to a large popcorn and save the bag for next time.

It's always freezing in there, as a heads up- but the food is worth it! Definitely recommend!, Review_2: Had a good experience at the Wexford location. We both ordered burgers that were tasty with a good bun and the fries were top notch. Friendly and attentive servers as well. The menu selection is nice with lots of sandwiches, wraps, and salads. The beer selection is decent as well. Overall, good experience and we'll go back!, Review_3: Not a good place to take your kids! The spaghetti sauce is to spicy for your kids to eat. Also the grilled cheese was burnt. We had to go to a fast food restaurant after leaving this place to get our kids something to eat., Review_4: So disappointed! This is our standard brunch spot with friends and it's always been great until this visit. Portions were very small, most of our orders were incorrect and the quality of ingredients has gone way down. This place used to be great, not sure what's happened., Review_5: This place is always delicious. The brunch is awesome and they have Mimosas with options for juice. I asked for light orange juice and they added the perfect amount. The sweet potato tots are good but the dipping sauce was even better. They always have great specials and happy hours. The burgers were perfect cooked to order and the staff was friendly, Review_6: Great menu - lots of different menu ideas for the area! Love the Thai salad and homewrecker sandwich! Ruben rolls are awesome for happy hour! Happy hour is super busy so get there earlier or be prepared to wait a hot minute!!, Review_7: Not yo 'stereotypical dive bar with a healthy craft draft list and some unexpected twists on burgers, sammies, and appetizers. The sweet potato tots will satisfy even the sweetest of tooths especially with the cinnamon + brown sugar butter dip that comes with. Surprisingly addictive. Props to the service on a very busy Pens night playoff win!, Review_8: I eat here regularly. It is family favorite. You get better service if you sit at the bar rather than at a table. Tuesday is 1 / 2 off sandwiches and Wednesday is 1 / 2 off basic burgers. If you like micro brews they always have many on tap.", "output": "The menu is the shining star by far! The variety of brunch ideas and craft beers is endless. The wait staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Sometimes has longer waits depending on the time of day. The cooks come up with really creative and delicious options.

The menu has a lot of variety, yet children may find some dishes too spicy for their taste.  The staff is friendly and provide a great happy hour., This is a nice bar with a good draft list and a good selection of items on the menu. The burgers, sandwiches and appetizers are all worth a try. Tuesdays and Wednesdays have good specials but the happy hour and random specials are a good value too. Happy hours do get busy though! Staff is friendly and the place is family friendly as well.

I would recommend coming here for their regular menu, Review_4: Their Magic Hour special can't be beat. Strong, tasty cocktails for $6 between 4p-9p.Another consistency after many visits is the staff almost completely ignore you. Be prepared to wait up to half an hour for a server, or stand at the bar for 5 minutes until someone notices you., Review_5: Dinner here on Saturday, pre-show. Even though I had to send my steak back because it was undercooked I have to compliment the chef as it was very delicious. Also, the charred octopus is fantastic.

This is a big restaurant that's good for events, unique dishes and drinks., The experience actually lived up to its recommendation. knowledgeable staff and a great wine selection.

I have yet to try anything that lived up to this place. The food was delicious and filling, and the service impeccable. Will definitely be back, many many times., Review_3: Ryus owner is Japanese and it shows. I tried other ramen restaurants in Toronto but some others are NOT Japanese. These other restaurants do not serve the Japanese style. Please try Ryus Miso ramen. That is real Japanese ramen!!! I love it!!!, Review_4: One of my favourite ramen places. Broth is so flavourful and when they say spicy, it's spicy. Not the watered down Canadian level of spicy. The service is excellent and free refills on pop, I'll take it., Review_5: I'm glad Ryus reopened after the fire which completely destroyed the Baldwin location. I've always been a loyal follower because of their unique broth and the non traditional toppings they use. Plus their menu is very vegetarian friendly. Service is efficient and attentive. This new locale is across from the Broadview station with lots of street parking., Review_6: Absolutely outstanding Ramen. Pork blaster 'hot' has to be a personal favourite. Very filling and rich broth and the spice was good enough to excite my Indian palate... That's really saying something! Will definitely return although I can't say I'd try much else since I'm sold on this one dish. Patio is highly recommended!, Review_7: I had the vegetarian bowl! Yummy, just right for me.. I prefer it to Kinton's veg. bowl. I really like the atmosphere! Service was very nice and attentive, was a great meal to have with some out of town friends. Ps....... Bathrooms are really cool. Toilet seats are heated. Crazy., Review_8: It's hard to compete with 'Kinton' a few shops down, but with their prices and original / delicious broths, they are in contention.

About 4 stars.The beer choices are limited and the descriptions misleading. Minus 1 / 2 a star for that.The service was definitely 5-star.

I highly recommend Tokyo Joe's!, Review_3: First time here and I was super happy about the food. Everything tastes fresh.
