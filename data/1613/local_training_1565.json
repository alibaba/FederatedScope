Philosophy - from the Greek \"philos' meaning love and \"sophos\" meaning \"Wisdom\", the love of wisdom - is literally the study of how to think straight.\n\nIf you haven't learned philosophy, you will never be able to form a logical thought. No, what people think they are doing isn't logic. Logic is a set of rules. To think logically you have to know those rules, and apply those rules (much like algebra is a set of rules you have to know and apply to get the right answer).\n\nTo think you can be logical without studying philosophy is like claiming you can do algebra without learning to count first. \n\nHere's how it works:\nPhilosophers figure out how to understand things.\nScientists use those techniques to understand a particular thing.\nEngineers use that understanding to solve practical problems.\n\nUnfortunately - because true logic is so often counter-intuitive, those not schooled in it tend to think actual logical arguments are \"stupid\" because their intuition says so.", "output": "Insult", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 956.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

What do they do when the way in which they bring that news doesn't work, when neither the words nor the rituals which should evoke love doesn't work?  ...when huge numbers of \"believers\" don't believe every thing but aren't free to discuss their disagreements?  \n\nI think many of those who aren't participating simply don't find Jesus there, don't believe some of what is taught is really what Jesus would say, don't find spiritual growth.  \n\nPray, pay, obey doesn't work any more.
