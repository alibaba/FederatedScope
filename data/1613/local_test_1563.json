Or else they would move their plants and facilities to somewhere else where taxation wasn't allowed.  The governors and legislators went into emergency sessions to immediately pass the immunities while all other government business takes months and years to pass.  Within 6 months after the gift, Boeing moved 1000 jobs out of Washington to California.  So much for promises.  This was orchestrated by the same management team and board which had outsourced airplane parts manufacturing to Italy.  The defective parts had to be reconfigured in Seattle as none of them fit the plane's schematics.  The management retired with their golden parachutes in millions.
