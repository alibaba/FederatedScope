These results are compared with similar observations in college students with an acute, febrile, noninfluenzal respiratory illness that occurred during the same outbreak. The lymphopenia typical of influenza during acute illness was shown to be due to a reduction in both T and B cells without alteration in the CD4:CD8 ratio. In addition, phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A responses were reduced and NKC activity was increased, while pokeweed mitogen reactivity was unaltered at the time of admission to the study. Patients with noninfluenzal illness showed early polymorphonuclear leukocytosis and a similar lymphopenia. Lymphocyte functions were virtually unchanged during acute illness in noninfluenza patients. The relatively specific alterations in lymphocyte responses to lectin-induced stimulation in influenza patients may indicate that the peripheral T cells are incapable of activation via the CD3 or CD2 activation pathways. In addition, increased NKC activity in the periphery may be reflective of increased NKC activity in the lung. Influenza-infected individuals with higher NKC activity at the time of admission to the study also took longer to recover. Finally, the early lymphopenia and the later neutropenia in the influenza-infected patient may represent migration of these cells from the circulation to the infected respiratory tract as a consequence of infection.", "output": "Influenza virus infection induces functional alterations in peripheral blood lymphocytes.", "category": "Title Generation 1246.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.", "input": "Abstract: The cutaneous application of antiviral agents was studied by iontophoresis, a process that increases penetration of most drugs 20- to 60-fold.

Fourteen healthy men were exposed to three different experimental conditions: arm immersion, body immersion, and control. The men always sat upright while both upper extremities hung vertically at their sides. During arm immersion, one forearm was completely immersed for 30 min in either cold water (28 degrees C, n = 7) or warm water (38 degrees C, n = 7). This cold-warm water protocol was repeated on separate days for exposure to the remaining conditions of body immersion (immersion of 1 forearm and all tissues below the xiphoid process) and control (no immersion). Blood samples were simultaneously drawn from cannulated veins in both antecubital fossae. Hematocrit difference (Hct diff) was measured by subtracting the nonimmersed forearm's hematocrit (Hct dry) from the immersed forearm's hematocrit (Hct wet). Hct diff was approximately zero when the men were exposed to the control condition and body immersion in warm water. In the remaining conditions, Hct wet dropped below Hct dry (P less than 0.01, 3-way analysis of variance).

Although recent studies suggest that variants of TSH deficient in carbohydrate occur naturally, the significance of the carbohydrate moiety of TSH in respect to its thyrotropic function is unclear. The present studies were undertaken, therefore, to examine this question. A highly purified preparation of bovine TSH (bTSH) was deglycosylated by treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Amino acid and carbohydrate analyses of the original and deglycosylated preparations indicated that approximately 85% of the carbohydrate originally present had been removed and that the protein moiety was unaltered. As judged from TSH radioreceptor assays, bTSH and deglycosylated bTSH (dg-bTSH) bound to human thyroid membranes with equal affinity, since both caused a half-maximal inhibition of [125I]bTSH binding at approximately equal concentrations. Nonetheless, dg-bTSH at optimal concentration displayed only about one third the activity of intact TSH in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity in human thyroid membranes. dg-bTSH also antagonized the adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity of intact bTSH in this system, but only weakly, since abolition of the bTSH effect required an approximately 40-fold higher concentration of dg-bTSH. In cultures of FRTL5 cells, a cloned line of follicular cells derived from normal rat thyroid, both intact and dg-bTSH enhanced cell growth, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and stimulated cAMP release in the medium, but the response elicited by dg-bTSH was much less than that caused by equal concentrations of the intact hormone. In accord with the findings in the in vitro assays, dg-bTSH evoked a much smaller response than bTSH did in the in vivo mouse assay. It is concluded that although not required for receptor recognition, the carbohydrate moiety of bTSH is essential for the full expression of its biological activity.", "output": "The carbohydrate moiety of bovine thyrotropin is essential for full bioactivity but not for receptor recognition.", "category": "Title Generation 1246.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.", "input": "Abstract: Thirty adult Wistar rats underwent an extradural clip compression injury of 50 g of force for 1 minute at T-1. After injury, the animals were randomly separated into three groups: the control group received a saline infusion for the 2-hour treatment period; the second group was given a blood transfusion over 2 hours titrated to maintain mean systemic arterial pressure (MSAP) at preinjury levels; and the third group received an intravenous bolus dose of naloxone (10 mg/kg), followed by a 2-hour infusion of intravenous naloxone (2 mg/kg/minute). The rats were observed postoperatively for 15 weeks, during which their clinical recovery was measured weekly by the inclined plane technique. At 15 weeks, the spinal cords were removed and prepared for histological assessment. The blood pressure before, during, and immediately after injury did not differ statistically among the three groups. During the initial 2 hours after injury, blood transfusion produced a significant increase in MSAP (P less than 0.02) and hematocrit (P less than 0.001), but naloxone infusion did not result in a significant change in MSAP. Performance on the inclined plane at 15 weeks was 35.6 +/- 6 degrees, 32.7 +/- 4 degrees, and 36.1 +/- 6 degrees for the control, transfusion, and naloxone groups, respectively, and no significant differences were found (P greater than 0.05). Histological examination confirmed a consistent injury of moderate severity in all three groups with no major differences among groups.

One can map a relatively large region, obtain successive maps to different stimuli in the same cortical area and follow variations in response over time. In the intact mammalian brain this imaging has been accomplished with the aid of voltage sensitive dyes. However, it has been known for many years that some intrinsic changes in the optical properties of the tissue are dependent on electrical or metabolic activity. Here we show that these changes can be used to study the functional architecture of cortex. Optical maps of whisker barrels in the rat and the orientation columns in the cat visual cortex, obtained by reflection measurements of the intrinsic signal, were confirmed with voltage sensitive dyes or by electrophysiological recordings. In addition, we describe an intrinsic signal originating from small arteries which can be used to investigate the communication between local neuronal activity and the microvasculature. One advantage of the method is that it is non-invasive and does not require dyes, a clear benefit for clinical applications.", "output": "Functional architecture of cortex revealed by optical imaging of intrinsic signals.", "category": "Title Generation 1246.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.", "input": "Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine produces images which reflect the chemical composition of the intervertebral disc.

Fourteen patients were studied after single-level chemonucleolysis and the results compared with a control group of 17 discs in six patients who had diagnostic discography without enzyme insertion. A consistent pattern of gradual loss of signal from the nucleus pulposus culminating in complete loss of nuclear signal was seen in all cases after chemonucleolysis. Chymopapain therefore produced MRI changes analogous with premature gross disc degeneration. The rate at which this occurred varied; complete loss of signal took at least six weeks.

To determine whether such FFA concentrations may increase the concentration of free T4 in serum, we added increasing amounts of oleic acid to pooled normal human serum (with known FFA content) and measured free T4 by equilibrium dialysis. Total FFA up to 3 meq/liter in normal serum, representing an FFA to albumin molar ratio of about 5:1, had little or no effect on the free T4 concentration, while higher FFA concentrations progressively increased free T4. This same molar ratio of FFA to albumin had to be exceeded to cause a significant increase in the free T4 concentration in diluted serum and in serum from patients with nonthyroid illness. Serum from which more than 95% of the albumin had been removed by chromatography with Affi-Gel blue was much more sensitive to the effects of FFA on free T4. This enhanced sensitivity was reversed by readdition of albumin to the serum, and the addition of albumin to normal serum resulted in diminished effects of FFA on free T4. These results indicate the following: physiological concentrations of FFA do not significantly increase the free T4 concentration in normal human serum; when FFA reach supraphysiological concentrations in serum (in vitro) and the higher affinity FFA-binding sites on albumin become saturated (apparently at an FFA to albumin molar ratio of approximately 5:1), the excess FFA interact with other serum proteins, including thyroid hormone-binding globulin, and thereby increase the free T4 concentration; the concentration of albumin (or other FFA binders) must be considered when evaluating the observed effects of FFA. To explore the relevance of these findings to the hypothesis that FFA may inhibit the binding of T4 to plasma proteins in patients with nonthyroid illness, we measured plasma FFA concentrations in 11 severely ill patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit. We found a mean plasma FFA concentration of 0.45 +/- 0.11 (+/- SEM) mEq/liter and a mean serum albumin concentration of 2.39 +/- 0.29 g/dl in these patients. Their mean plasma FFA to albumin molar ratio was 1.53 +/- 0.41. Since the FFA to albumin molar ratio must exceed about approximately 5:1 before a significant increase in the serum free T4 concentration occurs, these results suggest that FFA do not commonly influence the circulating free T4 concentration in vivo, even in severely ill patients.", "output": "Effect of free fatty acids on the concentration of free thyroxine in human serum: the role of albumin.", "category": "Title Generation 1246.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.", "input": "Abstract: Studies in patients on dialysis have shown that aluminum (Al) accumulation in bone plays a major role in the pathogenesis of osteomalacia.

The groups were: 1) uremic control 2) aluminum (0.75 to 1.0 mg/rat i.p., five times a week for twelve weeks): 3) aluminum + DFO, after twelve weeks Al was discontinued and the rats received DFO (75 mg/rat two times a week for nine weeks); 4) aluminum + time, after twelve weeks Al was discontinued and the rats were sacrificed after nine weeks. High levels of Al in serum and bone and low levels of PTH were seen in rats receiving Al. Bone histology revealed Al at the mineralization front, abnormal tetracycline uptake, and an increase in osteoid. DFO treatment did not significantly change the level of Al in bone, however both DFO treatment and discontinuation of Al reversed towards normal the above described lesions.

The effect of LH/hCG on luteal blood flow, however, is unknown. This work studies the effect of hCG on both luteal and ovarian blood flows at different stages of pseudopregnancy in adult female rats. Pseudopregnancy was induced by mating with sterile male rats. The length of pseudopregnancy was 13 +/- 1 days and, during this time, blood flow was measured by the injection of radioactive microspheres during anesthesia. At autopsy, the corpora lutea were identified and extirpated under a stereomicroscope. These, and the remaining ovary, were then counted for radioactivity and the blood flow was calculated. Progesterone levels were determined in plasma and ovarian tissues. Furthermore, the responsiveness of adenylate cyclase was tested in ovarian tissues at day 6 of pseudopregnancy. An intraarterial injection of hCG (50 IU) or vehicle (saline) was given 20 min before the blood flow determinations in anesthetized rats. The luteal blood flow was not changed by hCG on days 2, 6, and 11 of pseudopregnancy, whereas in the remaining ovary the blood flow increased more than 2-fold, thereby resulting in redistribution of the blood flow. Ten micrograms of NIH-LH-B9, tested at day 6 of pseudopregnancy, mimicked the effect of hCG. At day 6 of pseudopregnancy, hCG (50 IU) was given ip to conscious rats 200 min and 24 h before blood flow determinations. At 200 min after hCG there was a more pronounced redistribution of ovarian blood flow with a 45% reduction in luteal blood flow and a 4-fold increase in flow through the remaining ovary. LH as well as hCG doubled the progesterone content of the remaining ovary. In the corpora lutea an increased progesterone content was seen after 200 min of hCG exposure. At 24 h after hCG injection, all parameters had returned to control levels except that adenylate cyclase was nonresponsive. The increase in the total ovarian blood flow coincides with the increased steroidogenesis and these effects are likely due to release of metabolites and/or vasoactive substances. Despite this increase, the blood flow of the corpus luteum was not increased rendering vascular mechanisms unlikely as a part of the acute LH/hCG effects on corpus luteum of pseudopregnancy.", "output": "Redistribution of ovarian blood flow after injection of human chorionic gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone in the adult pseudopregnant rat.", "category": "Title Generation 1246.json"}]
