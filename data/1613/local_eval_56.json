In late November  Apollo loaned $184 million to Kushner Companies to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper.\nCitigroup lent the firm and one of its partners $325 million to help finance a group of office buildings in Brooklyn. The Times  citing people briefed on the meeting  reported the loan was made in spring 2017  shortly after  Kushner  met in the White House with Corbat. The newspaper quoted one unidentified source as saying the two men discussed financial and trade policy and not  Kushner 's family business.\nThe report comes amid  Kushner 's loss of  his  top-secret security clearance because of a longstanding holdup of a background review.

Trump ? It was a gamble  but polling suggested it might be working. His opponent  Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam  saw his lead over Gillespie erode over the past few weeks.  Trump  weighed in for Gillespie in a series of tweets and with automated Election Day phone calls encouraging turnout.\n.@EdWGillespie will totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of VA. MS-13 and crime will be gone. Vote today  ASAP! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7  2017\n Trump  wasted no time in distancing  himself  from Gillespie  enjoying the spaciousness of  his  now-280-character tweets.\nEd Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don\u2019t forget  Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats  and with the economy doing record numbers  we will continue to win  even bigger than before! \u2014  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8   2017\nWe\u2019ve noted before that  Trump  has an insurance premium against any calls for  his  impeachment.  His  popularity with Republicans has slipped since the beginning of  his  presidency  but  he \u2019s still very popular with them  particularly more conservative members of  his  party. (Per Gallup  more than 9 in 10 conservative Republicans approve of  Trump .) Because Republican Party primaries see an overrepresentation of conservatives  that meant that Republicans eager to win reelection to Congress were less likely to turn on the president.\n Trump\u2019s  tweet distancing  himself  from Gillespie sugarcoats the election in a way that may make  Trump  feel better but probably isn\u2019t fooling anyone on Capitol Hill.  His  claim that the GOP won four of four federal races misses a few important points. The first is that those races were in Republican-held districts. The second is that the Democrats saw big gains in most of those races relative to past elections. The third is that the figure is actually four of five;  Trump  likes to ignore a race in California won by the Democrats.\nBut it also does something very dangerous for  Trump  right now. It shows  yet again  that  he  isn\u2019t loyal to  his  political partners.\nWe\u2019ve seen this before. When  Trump  backed the House effort to repeal and replace Obamacare (having no plan of  his  own)   he  responded to  its  passage by declaring the bill to be \u201cmean\u201d \u2014 as though  he  hadn\u2019t previously claimed it was nearly without flaws. (It was health care  not immigration  that was the big issue in Virginia  according to exit polls. Northam won among voters concerned about health care by a more than 3-to-1 margin.) Even before Election Day in Alabama earlier this year   Trump  began to distance  himself  from  his  preferred candidate Republican Senate primary  Luther Strange  hinting that  he  had perhaps made a mistake \u2014 a shift that was certainly informed by polls showing a likely Strange loss. When that happened   Trump  deleted some of  his  tweets of endorsement.\nStrange\u2019s campaign  unlike Gillespie\u2019s  didn\u2019t embrace Trumpist politics such as the threat of the gang MS-13.  He  tried to win as a more typical establishment conservative  to no avail. Gillespie tried to more directly embrace  Trump  politics \u2014 and lost badly. And then saw  Trump  turn on him.\nThink of the message that  Trump  has sent to Republicans. Stand with him on policy and have him bad-mouth what you passed. Embrace his endorsement and see a loss followed by  Trump  playing down his support. Embrace his endorsement and his politics  and see a loss followed by actual criticism. These are all one-offs \u2014 but politics generally suffers from a small sample size from which to draw conclusions  and no one spends more time trying to draw conclusions than politicians.\nBannon\u2019s track record in electoral politics? He helped  Trump  lose the popular vote and win the electoral college in 2016. He embraced Luther Strange\u2019s opponent after Strange was trailing. And now he watched the \u201cTrump-Stewart talking points\u201d lead nowhere.\nOn its home page  Breitbart also championed  Trump \u2019s argument that Gillespie should have embraced him more robustly. That\u2019s a flawed theory.  Trump  is very unpopular in Virginia  and Northam won among those who disapprove of  Trump  by a 7-to-1 margin  according to preliminary exit polls. A third of voters said their vote in the race was meant to send a message of opposition to  Trump  \u2014 twice as many as said it was a message of support.\nWhat\u2019s more   Trump  made  his  feelings clear. Those who wanted to vote for  Trump\u2019s  candidate knew who that candidate was. As in Alabama  voters went in another direction.\nIt\u2019s critical to remember that Democrats were supposed to win this race  albeit not necessarily by as wide a margin as they did. Democrats hold the governor\u2019s mansion and Hillary Clinton won by five points last year.  Trump  could have congratulated Gillespie on a hard-fought race and noted the uphill battle. Instead   he  decided to try to spin the loss to  his  advantage.\nIt\u2019s unlikely that many Republicans worried about next November will be convinced by  Trump \u2019s argument. Instead  they\u2019re likely to take another lesson:  Trump  can\u2019t deliver a victory for you when you\u2019re trailing  and neither can Trumpism. (In fact  there\u2019s every reason to think that  Trump  was the liability that  his  poll numbers would suggest  with Gillespie doing fine in western Virginia but getting beaten badly in more-Democratic Northern Virginia.) Nor will  Trump  stand with you should things go south.\nIf  next summer  the question of  Trump \u2019s fate as president is raised  how might Republicans in center-right districts be expected to evaluate that decision?", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

His  term was not set to end until June 2018.\n\"The Fed and the international monetary system will be weaker for  his  departure from official responsibility \" Summers wrote in a blog post.\n\" Stan 's has been a singular career \"  he  said. \"As an MIT professor he coauthored  with  his  close friend Rudi Dornbusch  the macro textbook that defined the basics of the field for a generation. With Olivier Blanchard \" the former IMF chief economist  \"he wrote the treatise that defined the state of the art for graduate students. His lectures were models of lucid exposition and balanced judgment. My view of monetary economics was shaped by my experience auditing his class in the Fall of 1978.\"\nNot everyone is complimentary about the arc of  Fischer 's career. To some  he represents the kind of establishment economics that led to financial instability and income inequality in many parts of the world.\nDuring his time at the IMF   Fischer  became the face of austerity measures gone wrong. Many of his and the IMF's recommendations for drastic spending cuts during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s have since been widely discredited as having made matters worse.\n\"I see  Fischer  as to a large extent the embodiment of the conventional wisdom among macroeconomists and central bankers \" said Dean Baker  the director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research  a liberal Washington think tank. \" He  also  in the pre-crisis days  was very much associated with the deregulation of finance gang  although I think  he  has developed an appreciation of the need for regulation since the crisis.\"\nIndeed   Fischer  has spoken out rather strongly against efforts by Trump and Republicans to unwind most of the key regulations imposed on Wall Street after the crisis with the aim of preventing a repeat performance.\n\"We seem to have forgotten that we had a financial crisis  which was caused by behavior in the banking and other parts of the financial system  and it did enormous damage to this economy \"  Fischer  told CNBC in April  just as the president was signing an executive order aimed at what  he  said was \"reviewing\" Dodd-Frank.\n\"Millions of people lost their jobs  millions of people lost their houses \"  Fischer  said. \"This was not a small-time  regular recession. This was huge  and it affected the rest of the world  and it affected  to some extent  our standing in the world as well. We should not forget that.\"\nBaker says  Fischer  did a good job in Israel  where  he  managed the central bank from 2005 to 2013.\n\" He  pushed down the value of the shekel  giving the country a large trade surplus  which allowed it to get through the Great Recession with little damage \" Baker said.\nAs for US monetary policy   his  tenure did not include much action on the part of the Fed  but  Fischer  has been erroneously worried about the threat of looming inflation since the start of  his  tenure.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

And late-payment penalties run 0.5% of your unpaid tax for each month your tax payment is late. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just at the federal level  and it excludes interest.

March that every medical precaution was being taken.\nA year earlier   Wilson  had outlined in  his  famous 14-point speech a blueprint to keep the world safe from future wars.  He  called for an end to secret treaties and proposed a plan that would consider the rights of native people who lived in colonial territories  require reduction in world armaments and guarantee freedom of the seas.  He  also proposed the League of Nations  an international organization empowered to ensure \u201cpolitical independence and territorial integrity [of] great and small states alike.\u201d\n Wilson  arrived in Paris for the peace talks prepared to battle with Georges Clemenceau  the 77-year-old \u201cTiger\u201d of France  who wanted Germany to pay heavily for waging war.\nThe talks dragged on and turned so bitter that  Wilson  threatened to head home without an agreement.

After leaving the band at seventeen  Martin considered quitting show business. But a role in a Mexico City musical led to soap opera work there  and then to a part on General Hospital and a stint on Broadway in Les Mis\u00e9rables in 1996. In 1991   he  began releasing a string of four solo albums  which sold a total of 15 million copies worldwide.\n He  did not work alone. \"When  Ricky  called me  about 1993  saying  he  wanted to do a Latin album  I was surprised \" says Rosa  whom  Martin  calls  his  \"Latin soul\" \u2014 a bit of a dark one  at that. \" Ricky  and I are as much alike as Julio Iglesias and Sid Vicious \" Rosa says with a laugh. A little Sid Vicious is clearly what  Martin  knew  he  needed; it was a song Rosa co-wrote  \"Maria \" that broke  Martin  in Spain and the rest of Europe.\nBut it wasn't until February that America heard the beat itself.  Martin 's hip-popping rendition of \"The Cup of Life\" at the Grammys brought even that jaded audience to its Manolo Blahnik-shod feet.

He then blacked out. Hours later  police found  Edmonds  on the ground with a cut lip and a gunshot wound to the back. Halfway down the block  an officer discovered his hat  lighter  and watch in a pool of blood.\n Edmonds   35  awoke from a coma several weeks later to find he was paralyzed from the waist down.

Thirteen steps led to the front porch. Then two more flights to reach his bedroom. Now reliant on a wheelchair   Edmonds  wondered  How am I going to do this?\nAt the physical rehabilitation center   Edmonds  heard there was financial assistance for crime victims like  him .  He  searched online and found a phone number for New Jersey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Victims of Crime Compensation Office. In  his  state  eligible victims may receive up to $2 500 in relocation expenses  and up to 104 weeks of lost earnings  among other benefits.\n Edmonds  says  he  would use the money to pay for  his  own place and make up for lost income. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI need it so much \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt could help me getting into a wheelchair-accessible apartment.

He  now has to make a$766.25 disability check last the whole month.\nDemetrius Freeman for The Trace A shooting in 2015 left  Ernest Edmonds   Jr.  paralyzed and isolated. He misses attending family gatherings and picking his sons up from school. He's now staying in the living room of his mother's apartment  but hopes to move into a wheelchair-accessible home of his own soon.\nAfter talking to New Jersey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compensation office   Edmonds  received a blank application and started to fill it out. The application asks crime victims to include supporting documentation  including copies of itemized receipts  bills  insurance information  and work pay stubs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a list of 15 things that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re asking for  and I was only able to obtain  like  six of them  \u00e2\u0080\u009d Edmonds  recalled. Stuck   he  set the form aside.\nOne morning last November   Edmonds  shifted on a special mattress prescribed to help prevent bedsores.  His  makeshift bedroom had taken over the dining room of  his  cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house  where swathes of fabric covered the windows.  He  used a claw-grabber to lift a bottle of Sprite from a nearby table. Cloying incense mixed with smoke from Edmonds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cigarettes  which  he  chain-smoked; talking about what had changed since the shooting made  him  feel stressed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's like a prison in here.  He  can't get out   he  can't move around \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nicole   Edmonds \u00e2\u0080\u0099 younger sister. \u00e2\u0080\u009c He  might as well board up the windows and soak away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe shooting transformed  Edmonds \u00e2\u0080\u0099 life.

While living in  his  cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house   he  rarely left except for doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appointments  and then  he  needed two or three people to bump  him  in  his  wheelchair down the front steps. To get something from  his  old room   his  cousin would have to FaceTime  him  from the third floor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing dependent on so many people  I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hardest thing \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout my family  my sister  seeing my children  I really might have given up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nLast spring  a former roommate saw  Edmonds  struggling and encouraged  him  to restart the victim compensation process. They filled out the application together and enlisted the help of a local lawyer. Still  there were roadblocks \u00e2\u0080\u0094  Edmonds  could not easily go down to the police department to get the incident report  so  he  had to wait months for the detective to bring it to  him . At one point someone stole his phone and he lost all his contacts  including the number for the lawyer.\nDecember marked the two-year anniversary of  his  shooting. That month  he  moved to  his  mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment  where there are no steps to get in the front door.  He  can move around more easily there  but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still hard to take a shower on  his  own; the counters and cabinets are not built for someone in a wheelchair. On Christmas Day   he  stayed home and watched basketball while  his  family celebrated at  his  grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. Afterward   his  sister brought  him  a plate of food.\nAs of this article\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publication   his  application had not yet been submitted.", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

Volkan Oezdemir  had a quick rise up the ranks of the UFC light heavyweight division. Originally signed as a late injury replacement for the injured Jan Blachowicz   Oezdemir  earned a split decision win over Ovince Saint Preux in February.  Oezdemir  followed that victory with first-round knockouts of Misha Cirkunov and Jimi Manuwa.  He  disposed of those fighters in a combined 70 seconds.\nOn January 20   Oezdemir  will face UFC light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier in the co-main event of UFC 220.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI once said that if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hanging around and fighting guys like  Volkan Oezdemir  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done something terribly wrong with my money and my time. \u00e2\u0080\u009d Cormier said at the recent UFC 220 press conference. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just never expected him to do what he did so fast. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s put himself in this position because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been impressive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to fight for the belt as fast as I can because I know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m capable of anything \u00e2\u0080\u009d said  Oezdemir . \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m there to win. In the UFC I wanted to fight the top (fighters) right away. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the place for the top guys in the world. I fought my first fight against the No. 6 in the world on two weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 notice and I just kept on going. I fought two months later and six weeks after that I was fighting for the third time. Always against a ranked opponent and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ready for the champion now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhile  Oezdemir  is confident he can pull off the upset victory over Cormier  the champion had some words of warning for his younger opponent.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey turn over  they present their neck  and they tap out. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about to happen to  Volkan Oezdemir .\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Oezdemir  doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think  he  will become the seventh submission win on Cormier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI got a heart  man. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be that easy \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Oezdemir  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou saw my fight  you saw everything I did. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen everything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m capable of.
