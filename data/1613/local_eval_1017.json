My interest in this device was to evaluate its capability for use within a private high school that serves the bottom socio-economic quartile.   Our goal is to increase the quantity and quality of reading done by students in an environment where we cannot afford up to date textbooks and fiction.    The product met or exceeded every technology requirement without exception.   This product received our highest value, ease of use, design, networking, and durability ratings.   Instead of buying books and placing them on shelves, we are purchasing this portable hand held digital library for students to check-out and use.  (We lack the funding to simply give each student their own unit).    Objections to the device: Old style 20th century vintage English Language Arts (ELA) teachers could not overcome the lack of physically turning pages when reading.  Apparently old style paradigms die hard for the veteran teachers.  Students embraced this digital library with energy and full enthusiasm.  (When inflexible Teachers fail to recognize the abilities of students, you can stop wondering why we have education problems in this country).    This product is superior in every way save one: Color.  For graphics, maps, illustrations, etc. the device needs color display capabilities.", "output": "Utility, Value, Fun", "category": "Title Generation 462.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon customer review, write a title for the review.

I often have to make a meeting where a coffee shop helps me kill time between stops. I have a large over the shoulder laptop bag which holds the kitchen sink and perhaps even the dish rack too. There is a pocket for the laptop, but I throw so much stuff in all the various pockets when I am in a hurry, I risk placing something that will shift position and end up in the laptop pocket.  The Dell has a beautiful glass-like outer shell and I don't want it scratched by my iPod, cordless mouse, pens, and all the other junk I toss in the bag.    This bag in a bag allows me to easily slip the laptop into it and then place the entire bag in the pocket in my big bag. It never shifts and it is incredibly protective. The bag is a 'perfect' fit for a 15.4\\\\\" laptop.  The only extras that will fit in the bag is a few USB memory sticks, or a mouse pad, but NOT the power cord or anything else too thick or too large.  If you're looking for a perfect bag, this is it.    Oh, often, when I go to a meeting, the only thing I need is the laptop.  It is so convenient to simply pull this bag out of my big bag and then see my client. When I enter with my laptop in this sleeve, it is impressive, thin, and ultra convenient.

Received the case last night, returned it this morning.  It's a good looking case, and it does hold the iPad very securely, but it had some key flaws that made it unworkable for me:    *Keyboard case does not hold the Apple keyboard securely, so it slips out each time you open the case.  A simply restraining strap would have solved that problem.    *It's difficult to put it into landscape mode, and once it's in there, the bottom tends to round so it rocks back and forth slightly -- irritating when you're trying to watch a movie!      *I did like the pouch at the top; finally, someplace to put the stylus!  Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to make up for the disappoitnments.    *Finally, in order to fit the keyboard, the case is about 1 - 1 1/2 inches longer than the iPad, which made it not fit in my netbook case... I should have seen that one coming, though.    Overall, I had really high hopes for this one, but it didn't live up to it.  My search continues!
