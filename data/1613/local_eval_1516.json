Woman: I got an application in the mail. Man: Well, why did you get one in the first place? Woman: Listen. Times are changing, and having a credit card helps you build a credit rating, control spending, and even buy things that you can't pay with cash ... like the plane ticket I got recently. Man: What plane ticket? Woman: Oh yeah, my roommate and I are going to Hawaii over the school break, and course, I needed some new clothes for that so ... Man: I don't want to hear it. How does having a student credit card control spending? It sounds you've spent yourself in a hole. Anyway, student credit cards just lead to impulse spending ... as I can see here. And the interest rates of student credit cards are usually sky-high, and if you miss a payment, the rates, well, just jump! Woman: Ah. The credit card has a credit limit ... Man: ... of $20,000?

We've only got four days in Hong Kong, remember. A: Oh right, well, in that case, I'd advise you to get there early. It opens at 10 o'clock in the morning on weekdays. Look, I think I've got a plan of the place somewhere. Let me see.., yes, here we are. You can have this. B: Thanks. A: OK I'll show you. Let's start with the lower level. See? Here? You arrive by taxi or bus or whatever here, on the right, can you see? That's the bus terminal. And you go in through the main entrance. You could go to Water World first but I think you'd better miss that out as you're short of time, you said. You see the cable cars? Well, those long lines are the wires and the little circles are the cars going up and down to the next level. Well, walk past the cable car terminal, at the bottom of the plan, and bear right past the Waterfall Gardens. Actually, have a look in, there are ducks and other birds in the pool there-it's very pretty. Then you'll see some steps up on the left. Follow that path and you'll come to the Centenary Garden which is a good place to stop and take pictures if you've got your camera. Then carry on until you're almost at the Children's Zoo. Right. I wouldn't bother to visit the zoo if I were you, it takes quite a long time to walk round. But I do recommend the \"Touch and Feed\" section opposite, as I said. It's great fun for small children. B: Ok, so we'll pay a visit there, and then what? A: You could come back a different way past the Chinese rock garden. Oh, that's lovely-do wander around if there's time. Then go down the steps to the Otter Pool-you can have a sit down there for a little while and watch the otters messing around in the water. Then back to the cable car terminal where you can catch a car to the upper level. The journey takes about ten minutes, I suppose, it's quite a long way. Now if you look at the other plan, the one for the upper level, you'll see where you arrive. B: Is this the terminal here in the bottom left hand comer? A: Yes, that's right. The fun fair is in the top left hand corner. Can you see? With \"The Dragon\" I was telling you about, and \"The Octopus\" and \"The Spider\". Do you think you'll want to go to that? B: Um, well, I think the children are a bit too young really, but they might enjoy watching other people. A: OK. Well, if you're feeling quite hungry by the time you arrive, which you probably will be, why not have a snack in the Chinese Restaurant next to the terminal? When you've finished your lunch, I would go to the Coral Reef first. It's that little building on the left hand side. \"That's where you can see fish and other underwater creatures in a kind of natural habitat. B: Right. That sounds interesting. A: It's lovely. After that, walk up to \"The Dragon\" and watch people being really scared! Then you could come down to the Ocean Theater, which is just to the left of the center of the plan- and see a performance of dolphins or maybe the killer whale. You'll have to check the times for that. There's one at two o'clock, I think. I'm not sure about the high diving, but you may be able to see that as well. If there's time, you could also carry on to the fight and have a look at Wave Cove. And finally, if you're not too exhausted by then you could return to the lower level by using the famous escalator. You'd be finished by 3:30 or 4 at the latest. B: Right, well, thanks for all your advice. Urn, we'll send you a postcard!

W: Yeah, in a way, although the curse itself isn't really that bad, a lot of it is pretty good, in fact, and the lecturer is fine, as to me, I suppose, you see, I want to do philosophy rather than English, but my parents took me out of it. M: So the courses are OK as such, it's just that had if been left to you, you would choose a different one.

Tutor: No-right-they've got some powerful packages in the computer graphics and CAD offices-you'll enjoy that. So... that leaves English. It's mostly English lit. I know your English is very good, but did you know you can take English as a foreign language as one of the modules in the foundation year? Anna Maria: No... no, I didn't. That's great - if they've got classes at my level. I don't have any problem speaking-but my writing is terrible. Tutor: Oh, I'm sure they have-go and talk to them in the EAP department-oh, and I suggest you join the study-skill classes, too. They will have sessions on report and so on.

Tutor: Well, you could do it as an option next year-you do know that? Anna Maria: No, I don't-I mean, I didn't cheek.
