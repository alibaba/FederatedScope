Various factors put a patient at high risk for readmission. Return to the operating room, wound infection, amputation, deep venous thrombosis, and major reintervention on bypass are independent risk factors for hospital readmission. Return to the operating room is associated with a 5.95-fold increase in hospital readmission.", "output": "yes", "category": "Answer Verification 1470.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a question and an answer to that question, classify if the answer actually answers the question into 'yes' or 'no'.

From the investigated filling variables, RAP was most sensitive in predicting the hemodynamic response, followed by PAOP and right ventricular EDVI. Patients with RAP < or =10 mm Hg, if subjected to aggressive positive pressure ventilation, are at risk of hemodynamic deterioration and organ hypoperfusion.", "output": "yes", "category": "Answer Verification 1470.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a question and an answer to that question, classify if the answer actually answers the question into 'yes' or 'no'.
