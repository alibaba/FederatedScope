In this article, we describe application of an infectious clone system for DENV serotype 1 (DENV1). Similar to previous clones in both flaviviruses and coronaviruses, the approach constructs a panel of contiguous cDNAs that span the DENV genome and can be systematically and directionally assembled to produce viable, full-length viruses. Comparison of the virus derived from the infectious clone with the original viral isolate reveals identical sequence, comparable endpoint titers, and similar focus staining. Both focus-forming assays and percent infection by flow cytometry revealed overlapping replication levels in two different cell types. Moreover, serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) bound similarly to infectious clone and the natural isolate. Using the clone, we were able to insert a DENV4 type-specific epitope recognized by primate MAb 5H2 into envelope (E) protein domain I (EDI) of DENV1 and recover a viable chimeric recombinant virus. The recombinant DENV1 virus was recognized and neutralized by the DENV4 type-specific 5H2 MAb. The introduction of the 5H2 epitope ablated two epitopes on DENV1 EDI recognized by human MAbs (1F4 and 14C10) that strongly neutralize DENV1. Together, the work demonstrates the utility of the infectious clone and provides a resource to rapidly manipulate the DENV1 serotype for generation of recombinant and mutant viruses.", "output": "Epitope Addition and Ablation via Manipulation of a Dengue Virus Serotype 1 Infectious Clone", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

The sizes of deletion varied between 582 nt (194 aa) and 648 nt (216 aa) at positions 28-714 (10-238) on the S gene (protein). Among 17 PEDV samples isolated from individual pigs, all of them contained at least two distinct genotypes with large genomic deletions, and 94.1% of them were found to consist of strains with an intact S gene. These variants were found in eight primary and nine recurrent outbreaks, and they might be associated with persistent PEDV infection in the farms. Full-length S and ORF3 genes of eight variants derived from 2 samples were characterized.

Moreover, the greater incidences of cross contamination and overuse of drugs has contributed towards the development of drug resistant microbial strains making conditions even worse. Hospital acquired infections pose one of the leading complications associated with implantation of any biomaterial after surgery and critical care. In this regard, developing non-conventional antimicrobial agents which would prevent the aforementioned causes is under the quest. The rapid development in nanoscience and nanotechnology has shown promising potential for developing novel biocidal agents that would integrate with a biomaterial to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. Metals with inherent antimicrobial properties such as silver, copper, zinc at nano scale constitute a special class of antimicrobials which have broad spectrum antimicrobial nature and pose minimum toxicity to humans. Hence, novel biomaterials that inhibit microbial growth would be of great significance to eliminate medical device/instruments associated infections. This chapter comprises the state-of-art advancements in the development of nano-antimicrobial biomaterials for biomedical applications. Several strategies have been targeted to satisfy few important concern such as enhanced long term antimicrobial activity and stability, minimize leaching of antimicrobial material and promote reuse.

After obtaining informed consent, we enrolled 30 EV71 cases including 7 cases with brainstem encephalitis plus pulmonary edema, 12 cases of CNS (CNS) involvement and 11 uncomplicated cases. We measured antibodies specific to EV71, lymphocyte proliferation response and EV71-stimulated cellular response of Th1/Th2 cytokines and chemokines. The 7 EV71 cases involving brainstem encephalitis plus pulmonary edema had a significantly lower phytohemagglutinin stimulation index than other cases (p \u03ed 0.04). After EV71 stimulation of peripheral mononuclear cells, there was a significant increase in cellular Th1 cytokine (\u2425interferon) and proinflammatroy cytokines. However, cases with pulmonary edema had significantly lower cellular \u2425-interferon (p \u03ed 0.04), lower cellular IL-1\u2424 (p \u03ed 0.04), lower cellular IL-6 (p \u03ed 0.04), lower cellular tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 response (p \u03ed 0.04), and lower cellular macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u2423 (p \u03ed 0.04) response compared with other cases.

We describe the epidemiology and public health response to the first known outbreak of 2009 H1N1 in a train, which occurred in June 2009 in China. Methods: After 2 provinces provided initial reports of 2009 H1N1 infection in 2 persons who had travelled on the same train, we conducted a retrospective epidemiologic investigation to collect information from the passengers, crew members, contacts, and health care providers. We explored the source of infection and possible routes of transmission in the train. All cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Results: Train #1223 traveled 40 hours, made 28 stops in 4 Chinese provinces, and boarded 2555 passengers, who logged a total of 59 144 person-hours of travel time. Nineteen confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases were identified. Of these, 13 were infected and developed symptoms on the train and 6 occurred among contacts who developed illness during medical monitoring. In addition, 3 asymptomatic cases were identified based on RT-PCR testing of respiratory swabs from contacts. The attack rate among contacts of confirmed cases in the same car was higher than that among contacts in other cars (3.15% vs. 0%, P < 0.001). Attack rates increased with exposure time.

In this study, affinity chromatography was conducted by coupling periplocoside E-semi-succinic acid ester with epoxy amino hexyl (EAH) sepharose 4B. Sodium dodecyl sulfonate-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed to analyze the fraction eluted by periplocoside E.

Fluorescence localization analysis indicated that periplocoside NW (PSNW) can bind to the midgut cells of Mythimna separata larvae [9] . Ultrastructural observations showed that microvilli, organelle, and cytomembrane are destructed in the midgut cells of M. separata larvae [10] . Research on histopathological effects indicated that brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) from the midgut epithelium cells of M. separata larvae are the initial action site; one or more binding sites may also exist in the larvae [11] . However, the specific binding sites and insecticidal mechanism of periplocosides in M. separata larval midgut cells remain unclear. The cellular targets of bioactive compounds can be identified using several approaches. Affinity purification is a classic and commonly used technique to identify receptors of insecticidal active substances [12] . In contrast to other approaches, affinity-based approaches are employed to identify directly small-molecule binding proteins. In this research, although periplocoside E has relatively low insecticidal activity or is inactive compared with periplocoside P and T [13], periplocoside E was selected based on the structure and high consumption of experimental materials to determine the binding protein of periplocosides compounds. The chemical structure of periplocoside E is similar to those of periplocoside P and T in terms of the common features except for one or two substituents ( Figure 1 ).

However, comprehensive studies of the viral aetiology of ALRI have not been conducted in PNG for almost 30 years. Objectives: To determine the viruses associated with ALRI among children living in the PNG highlands using sensitive molecular detection techniques. Study design: Pernasal swabs were collected routinely between 1 week and 18 months of age and also during episodes of ALRI, as part of a neonatal pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial. A tandem multiplex real-time PCR assay was used to test for a comprehensive range of respiratory viruses in samples collected from 221 young children. Picornavirus typing was supported by DNA sequence analysis. Results: Recognized pathogenic respiratory viruses were detected in 198/273 (73%) samples collected from children with no evidence of ALRI and 69/80 (86%) samples collected during ALRI episodes. Human rhinoviruses (HRV) species A, B and C were detected in 152 (56%) samples from non-ALRI children and 50 (63%) samples collected during ALRI episodes. Partial structural region sequences for two new species C rhinoviruses were added to the GenBank database. ALRI was associated with detection of adenovirus species B (p < 0.01) or C (p < 0.05), influenza A (p < 0.0001) or respiratory syncytial virus (p < 0.0001).

Understanding trends in disability and longevity among the oldest-old-that is, whether successive generations are living longer and with less disability-is of great importance for policy and planning purposes. We utilized data from successive birth cohorts (n = 20,520) of the Chinese oldest-old born 10 years apart (the earlier cohort was interviewed in 1998 and the later cohort in 2008). Disability was defined as needing personal assistance in performing one or more of five essential activities (bathing, transferring, dressing, eating, and toileting) or being incontinent. Participants were followed for age-specific disability transitions and mortality (in 2000 and 2002 for the earlier cohort and 2011 and 2014 for the later cohort), which were then used to generate microsimulation-based multistate life tables to estimate partial life expectancy (LE) and disability-free LE (DFLE), stratified by sex and age groups (octogenarians, nonagenarians, and centenarians). We additionally explored sociodemographic heterogeneity in LE and DFLE by urban/rural residence and educational attainment. Results: More recently born Chinese octogenarians (born 1919-1928) had a longer partial LE between ages 80 and 89 than octogenarians born 1909-1918, and octogenarian women experienced an increase in partial DFLE of 0.32 years (P = 0.004) across the two birth cohorts.

Methods: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), \"Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\" (CMhm) and \"Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\" (CMt) in blood samples from 456 client-owned and 138 stray cats from Madrid. In order to assess associations between these hemoplasma infections and epidemiological parameters, data regarding signalment, environment, prophylaxis measures, retrovirus status, clinical signs and laboratory findings were compiled, whenever possible. Results: DNA of feline hemoplasmas was detected from the blood of 63 out of 594 cats (10.6%), with a prevalence of 3.7% (22/594) for Mhf, 8.1% (48/594) for CMhm and 0.5% (3/594) for CMt. Stray cats had statistically higher prevalences of feline hemoplasmas (15.9%) and, specifically, of Mhf (8.7%) than client-owned cats (9 and 2.2%, respectively). A total of seven cats (1.17%) were co-infected with \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" and M. haemofelis, two (0.33%) with \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" and \"Candidatus M. turicensis\" and another one (0. 17%) with M. haemofelis and Candidatus \"M. turicensis\".

Laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases may be asymptomatic, have mild disease, or have a life-threatening infection with a high case fatality rate. There are three patterns of transmission: sporadic community cases from presumed non-human exposure, family clusters arising from contact with an infected family index case, and healthcareacquired infections among patients and from patients to healthcare workers. Healthcareacquired MERS infection has become a well-known characteristic of the disease and a leading means of spread. The main factors contributing to healthcare-associated outbreaks include delayed recognition, inadequate infection control measures, inadequate triaging and isolation of suspected MERS or other respiratory illness patients, crowding, and patients remaining in the emergency department for many days. A review of the literature suggests that effective control of hospital outbreaks was accomplished in most instances by the application of proper infection control procedures. Prompt recognition, isolation and management of suspected cases are key factors for prevention of the spread of MERS.

A complex set of age-related changes in the immune system is believed to be largely responsible for these defects. These changes, collectively termed immune senescence, encompass alterations in both the innate and adaptive immune systems, in the microenvironments where immune cells develop or reside, and in soluble factors that guide immune homeostasis and function. While age-related changes in primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow, and, in particular, the thymus, which involutes in the first third of life) have been long appreciated, changes affecting aging secondary lymphoid organs, and, in particular, aging lymph nodes (LNs) have been less well characterized. Over the last 20 years, LN stromal cells have emerged as key players in maintaining LN morphology and immune homeostasis, as well as in coordinating immune responses to pathogens. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the contributions of LN stromal cells to immune senescence.

All group 1b coronaviruses encode a single accessory protein between the spike and envelope genes, except for human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E. The prototype virus has a split gene, encoding the putative ORF4a and ORF4b proteins. To determine whether primary HCoV-229E isolates exhibit this unusual genome organization, we analyzed the ORF4a/b region of five current clinical isolates from The Netherlands and three early isolates collected at the Common Cold Unit (CCU) in Salisbury, UK. Results: All Dutch isolates were identical in the ORF4a/b region at amino acid level. All CCU isolates are only 98% identical to the Dutch isolates at the nucleotide level, but more closely related to the prototype HCoV-229E (>98%). Remarkably, our analyses revealed that the laboratory adapted, prototype HCoV-229E has a 2-nucleotide deletion in the ORF4a/b region, whereas all clinical isolates carry a single ORF, 660 nt in size, encoding a single protein of 219 amino acids, which is a homologue of the ORF3 proteins encoded by HCoV-NL63 and PEDV. Conclusion: Thus, the genome organization of the group 1b coronaviruses HCoV-NL63, PEDV and HCoV-229E is identical. It is possible that extensive culturing of the HCoV-229E laboratory strain resulted in truncation of ORF4. This may indicate that the protein is not essential in cell culture, but the highly conserved amino acid sequence of the ORF4 protein among clinical isolates suggests that the protein plays an important role in vivo.", "output": "Virology Journal Human coronavirus 229E encodes a single ORF4 protein between the spike and the envelope genes", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

However, in a number of European countries (including Italy) data on reasons for sickness absence are not routinely collected within current HCW worker sickness reporting systems, because of concerns about privacy. To help plan for the implementation of the proposed alert system in Italy, we aimed to determine the minimum number of alert cases defining a cluster. Patients and Methods: Sickness absences longer than 7 days in HCW employed in three hospitals in 2003, were identified by checking the hospitals' administrative databases. HCW with onset of illness in the same 10-day period were contacted and asked whether they have been diagnosed with pneumonia. Results: Overall, 273 absences > 7 days were recorded and 36 clusters of at least two absences > 7 days were identified; a total of 94 HCW were involved in these clusters. Only two HCW involved in different clusters, reported pneumonia. Conclusion: The occurrence of clusters of two or more cases of pneumonia in HCW in the same hospital unit appears to be an uncommon event, and thus the alert system proposed is not likely to result in large numbers of false positive alerts.

Composting sites, biomethanization facilities, and dairy farms, all affected by the presence of fungi, were visited to collect air samples. The amplicon-based HTS approach is a target enrichment method that relies on the amplification of a specific target using particular primers before sequencing. Thus, the results are highly dependent on the quality of amplification. For this reason, the authors of this paper used a shotgun metagenomic approach to compare its outcome with the amplicon-based method. Indeed, shotgun metagenomic does not rely on any amplification prior to sequencing, because all genes are sequenced without a specific target. In addition, culture methods were added to the analyses in biomethanization and dairy farms samples to validate their contribution to fungal diversity of aerosols. The results obtained are unequivocal towards ITS1 outperformance to ITS2 in terms of richness, and taxonomic coverage. The differential abundance analysis did demonstrate that some taxa were exclusively detected only by ITS2, and vice-versa for ITS1. However, the shotgun metagenomic approach showed a taxonomic profile more resembling to ITS1 than ITS2. Based on these results, neither of the barcodes evaluated is perfect in terms of distinguishing all species. Using both barcodes offers a broader view of the fungal aerosol population. However, with the actual knowledge, the authors strongly recommend using ITS1 as a universal fungal barcode for quick general analyses of diversity and when limited financial resources are available, primarily due its ability to capture taxonomic profiles similar to those obtained using the shotgun metagenomic.

Here, we characterized PEDV infection on commercial Thai swine farms by screening 769 samples of feces and small intestinal contents from pigs with diarrhea between 2011 and 2016.

Phylogenetic analyses suggest that although some Thai strains changed little from years past, others resembled more closely to the recent strains reported in China. Interestingly, eight Thai PEDV strains possessed amino acid deletions in the N protein.

To assess the strategic importance of the recoding pseudoknots, we have carried out a large scale genome-wide analysis in which we used an in-house developed program to detect all possible H-type pseudoknots within the genomic mRNAs of 81 animal viruses.

Epidemiological surveillance of HIV infection in Japan involves two technical problems for directly applying a classical backcalculation method, i.e., (i) all AIDS cases are not counted over time and (ii) people diagnosed with HIV have received antiretroviral therapy, extending the incubation period. The present study aimed to address these issues and estimate the HIV incidence and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections, using a simple statistical model. Methods. From among Japanese nationals, yearly incidence data of HIV diagnoses and patients with AIDS who had not previously been diagnosed as HIV positive, from 1985 to 2017, were analyzed. Using the McKendrick partial differential equation, general convolution-like equations were derived, allowing estimation of the HIV incidence and the time-dependent rate of diagnosis. A likelihood-based approach was used to obtain parameter estimates. Results. Assuming that the median incubation period was 10.0 years, the cumulative number of HIV infections was estimated to be 29,613 (95% confidence interval (CI): 29,059, 30,167) by the end of 2017, and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections was estimated at 80.3% (95% CI [78.7%-82.0%]). Allowing the median incubation period to range from 7.5 to 12.3 years, the estimate of the proportion diagnosed can vary from 77% to 84%. Discussion. The proportion of diagnosed HIV infections appears to have not yet reached 90% among Japanese nationals. Compared with the peak incidence from 2005-2008, new HIV infections have clearly been in a declining trend; however, there are still more than 1,000 new HIV infections per year in Japan. To increase the diagnosed proportion of HIV infections, it is critical to identify people who have difficulty accessing consultation, testing, and care, and to explore heterogeneous patterns of infection. .

Results-HMPV was present in 273/3168 (8.6%) of children presenting with ARTI. HMPV A2, B1, and B2, but not A1, were detected during the 3-year period. HMPV-infected children were older and more likely to be diagnosed with bronchopneumonia than HMPV-negative children. HMPV-infected children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) had higher rates of cough and shortness of breath than children with LRTI infected with other or no identifiable viruses.

Here, we demonstrate for classical swine fever virus, a member of the Flaviviridae, that this process is much more efficient in terms of interferon-alpha induction when compared to direct stimulation by virus particles. By employment of virus replicon particles or infectious RNA which can replicate but not form de novo virions, we exclude a transfer of virus from the donor cell to the pDC. pDC activation by infected cells was mediated by a contact-dependent RNA transfer to pDC, which was sensitive to a TLR7 inhibitor. This was inhibited by drugs affecting the cytoskeleton and membrane cholesterol. We further demonstrate that a unique viral protein with ribonuclease activity, the viral E rns protein of pestiviruses, efficiently prevented this process. This required intact ribonuclease function in intracellular compartments. We propose that this pathway of activation could be of particular importance for viruses which tend to be mostly cell-associated, cause persistent infection, and are non-cytopathogenic.", "output": "Efficient Sensing of Infected Cells in Absence of Virus Particles by Blasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Is Blocked by the Viral Ribonuclease E rns", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Pattern formation in activator-inhibitor systems has been studied in networks, revealing differences from the classical continuous media. Here we study pattern formation in a new framework, namely multiplex networks. These are systems where activator and inhibitor species occupy separate nodes in different layers. Species react across layers but diffuse only within their own layer of distinct network topology. This multiplicity generates heterogeneous patterns with significant differences from those observed in single-layer networks. Remarkably, diffusion-induced instability can occur even if the two species have the same mobility rates; condition which can never destabilize single-layer networks. The instability condition is revealed using perturbation theory and expressed by a combination of degrees in the different layers. Our theory demonstrates that the existence of such topology-driven instabilities is generic in multiplex networks, providing a new mechanism of pattern formation. Distributed active media support a variety of self-organized patterns, such as stationary and oscillatory structures, spiral waves, and turbulence 1-3 . Such media are often described by reaction-diffusion systems and consist of elements obeying an activator-inhibitor dynamics with local coupling. In his pioneering paper 1 , Turing showed that a uniform steady state can be spontaneously destabilized, leading to a spontaneous formation of a periodic spatial pattern, when reacting species diffuse with different mobilities. It was later proposed by Gierer and Meinhardt 4 that an activator-inhibitor chemical reaction is a typical example achieving Turing's scenario. Turing instability is a classical mechanism of self-organization far from equilibrium, and plays an important role in biological morphogenesis. It has been extensively studied in biological 4-6 and chemical 7 systems, as well as real ecosystems 8, 9 . The active elements can also be coupled in more complicated ways, forming complex networks 10,11 . Complex networks are ubiquitous in nature 12 ; two typical examples are epidemics spreading over transportation systems 13 and ecological systems where distinct habitats communicate through dispersal connections [14] [15] [16] [17] . Theoretical studies of reaction-diffusion processes on complex networks have recently attracted much attention 12,18-21 . Othmer and Scriven 22,23 developed the general mathematical framework to describe Turing instability in networks, and provided several examples of small regular lattices. Afterwards, Turing patterns were explored in small networks of chemical reactors 24,25 . More recent work in this area includes detailed studies of Turing bifurcation and related hysteresis phenomena in large complex networks 26, 27 , and oscillatory Turing patterns in multi-species ecological networks 28 . In nature, the active elements of a system can communicate through different types of pathways with different architecture. Such a system with multiple types of links can be represented as a special type of complex network called a multiplex network 29 . Recent theoretical studies have shown that the spectral properties of multiplex networks are significantly different from those of single-layer networks 29-33 , and that these differences affect the diffusion processes occurring on the network 30,31 . Consequently, the emergent dynamics can exhibit new kinds of patterns.

Probability density functions for generation intervals have been an important input for epidemic models and epidemic data analysis. In this paper, we specify a general stochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval decreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from multiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person has multiple potential infectors, there is a \"race\" to infect him or her in which only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the mean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We call this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid transmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can be caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global prevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors. Using simulations, we illustrate both types of competition. Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of generation intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive number in an epidemic. This approach leads naturally to partial likelihoods for epidemic data that are very similar to those that arise in survival analysis, opening a promising avenue of methodological research in infectious disease epidemiology.", "output": "Generation interval contraction and epidemic data analysis", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Here we use a SARS-CoV infection-reinfection ferret model and a functional genomics approach to gain insight into SARS immunopathogenesis and to identify correlates of immune protection during SARS-CoV-challenge in ferrets previously infected with SARS-CoV or immunized with a SARS virus vaccine. We identified gene expression signatures in the lungs of ferrets associated with primary immune responses to SARS-CoV infection and in ferrets that received an identical second inoculum. Acute SARS-CoV infection prompted coordinated innate immune responses that were dominated by antiviral IFN response gene (IRG) expression. Reinfected ferrets, however, lacked the integrated expression of IRGs that was prevalent during acute infection. The expression of specific IRGs was also absent upon challenge in ferrets immunized with an inactivated, Al(OH) 3 -adjuvanted whole virus SARS vaccine candidate that protected them against SARS-CoV infection in the lungs. Lack of IFN-mediated immune enhancement in infected ferrets that were previously inoculated with, or vaccinated against, SARS-CoV revealed 9 IRG correlates of protective immunity.

We previously demonstrated that PRV infection induces a specific and lethal inflammatory response, contributing to severe neuropathy in mice. So far, the mechanisms that initiate this neuroinflammation remain unknown. Using a mouse footpad inoculation model, we found that PRV infection rapidly and simultaneously induces high G-CSF and IL-6 levels in several mouse tissues, including the footpad, PNS and central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Interestingly, this global increase occurred before PRV had replicated in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) neurons and also was independent of systemic inflammation. These high G-CSF and IL-6 levels were not caused by neutrophil infiltration in PRV infected tissues, as we did not detect any neutrophils. Efficient PRV replication and spread in the footpad was sufficient to activate DRGs to produce cytokines. Finally, by using knockout mice, we demonstrated that TLR2 and IFN type I play crucial roles in modulating the early neuroinflammatory response and clinical outcome of PRV infection in mice. Overall, these results give new insights into the initiation of virus-induced neuroinflammation during herpesvirus infections. Herpesviruses are major pathogens worldwide. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus related to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). The natural host is the pig, but PRV can infect most mammals. In these non-natural hosts, the virus causes a severe pruritus called the 'mad itch'. Interestingly, PRV infects the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and induces a specific and lethal inflammatory response in mice, yet little is know about how this neuroinflammatory response is initiated. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time how PNS neurons tightly regulate the inflammatory response during PRV infection and contribute to severe clinical outcome in mice.

One major action is their ability to trigger production of massive amounts of interferon-a (IFN-a) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), also referred to as natural IFN-a/b producing cells (NIPC). The present study using porcine PBMC activated by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA revealed a considerable variation in the IFN-a production in response to various CpG-ODN constructs. Several phosphodiester ODNs, such as 5 0 TTTTCAATTCGAAGATGAAT 3 0 (ODN H), and the plasmid pcDNA3 all required pre-incubation with lipofectin in order to induce IFN-a. Intact unmethylated CpGs were also important, because methylation or substitution of the cytosines and CpG-inversion strongly reduced the IFN-a induction by single-or double-stranded forms of ODN H. Certain CpG-ODNs that contained flanking phosphorothioate or phosphodiester poly-G sequences were potent inducers of IFN-a without pre-incubation with lipofectin, for instance the ODN 2216 (5 0 GGGGGACGATCGTCGGGGGG 3 0 ). While poly-G sequences have been suggested to increase uptake of ODNs by cells, they did not obviate the need for lipofectin when added to the ODN H. However, they resulted in up to five-fold increases of the IFN-a levels caused by ODN H upon lipofection, indicating other enhancing effects of poly-G sequences on the induction of IFN-a. The identity of the IFN-a producing cells (IPC) stimulated by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA was studied by means of flow cytometry using combined staining for intracellular IFN-a and surface markers. Approximately 1-3 IPC/10 3 PBMC were detected, compared to only 3 IPC/10 4 PBMC stimulated by Aujeszky's disease virus. The IPC frequencies were confirmed by detection of IFN-a mRNA positive cells by in situ hybridisation.

The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), under the auspices of its WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza, is one of the major public health agencies which provides support globally to build national capacity for influenza surveillance. Our main objective was to determine if laboratory assessments supported capacity building efforts for improved global influenza surveillance. Methods: In 2010, 35 national influenza laboratories were assessed in 34 countries, using a standardized tool. Post-assessment, each laboratory received a report with a list of recommendations for improvement. Uptake of recommendations were reviewed 3.2 mean years after the initial assessments and categorized as complete, in-progress, no action or no update. This was a retrospective study; follow-up took place through routine project management rather than at a set time-point post-assessment. WHO data on National Influenza Centre (NIC) designation, External Quality Assessment Project (EQAP) participation and FluNet reporting was used to measure laboratory capacity longitudinally and independently of the assessments. All data was further stratified by World Bank country income category. Results: At follow-up, 81 % of 614 recommendations were either complete (350) or in-progress (145) for 32 laboratories (91 % response rate). The number of countries reporting to FluNet and the number of specimens they reported annually increased between 2005, when they were first funded by CDC, and 2010, the assessment year (p < 0.01). Improvements were also seen in EQAP participation and NIC designation over time and more so for low and lower-middle income countries. Conclusions: Assessments using a standardized tool have been beneficial to improving laboratory-based influenza surveillance. Specific recommendations helped countries identify and prioritize areas for improvement. Data from assessments helped CDC focus its technical assistance by country and region. Low and lower-middle income countries made greater improvements in their laboratories compared with upper-middle income countries. Future research could include an analysis of annual funding and technical assistance by country.

Then, receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to identify optimal cut points for each of the data sources. Multivariate logistic regression and the areas under curve (AUC) will be used to identify the optimal combination of data sources that maximize the accuracy of adverse event detection. The most accurate algorithms will then be validated on a second random sample of MUHC patients (cohort 1, validation set), and accuracy will be measured using chart review as the reference standard. The most accurate algorithms validated at the MUHC will then be applied to TOH data (cohort 2), and their accuracy will be assessed using a reference standard assessment of the medical chart.

Here, we report the crystal structures of a bacterial DPP IV (PmDAP IV) in its free form and in complexes with two kinds of dipeptides as well as with a non-peptidyl inhibitor at 1.90 to 2.47 \u00c5 resolution. Acyl-enzyme intermediates were observed for the dipeptide complexes of PmDAP IV, whereas tetrahedral intermediates were reported for the oligopeptide complexes of mammalian DPP IVs. This variation reflects the different structural environments of the active site Arg residues, which are involved in the recognition of a substrate carbonyl group, of mammalian and bacterial enzymes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that PmDAP IV is a closer relative of dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8 and DPP9, DPP IV-family enzymes) than DPP IV. These results provide new insights into the substrate recognition mechanism of bacterial DAP IVs and may assist in the development of selective inhibitors for DAP IVs from pathogenic asaccharolytic bacteria, which utilise proteins or peptides as an energy source. Peptidases catalyse the hydrolysis of peptide bonds. These enzymes are widely distributed in nature and are involved in a wide variety of biological functions 1 . Peptidases can be grouped according to the pattern of proteolysis as either endo-or exo-peptidases. Exopeptidases catalyse the removal of amino acids (or short peptides) from the end of a polypeptide chain, whereas endopeptidases cleave a peptide bond between nonterminal amino acids.

Since the spread of an infectious disease is related to the intensity of contacts between individuals, fragmentation destabilizes the way the parasites circulate in their host population. Recently, Zinkernagel has proposed that a reduction in the frequency of infections by a parasite could lead to the emergence of severe forms of the disease, previously avoided because the disease was contracted early in life and attenuated by maternal antibodies. However, it is still unclear whether this change in disease expression increases the global mortality it induces because the disease becomes more severe and also less frequent. Here, we use a mathematical model to link population fragmentation with the hypothesis of Zinkernagel. Firstly, we show that there is a change in the severity of the disease during the fragmentation process, especially at a local scale, suggesting that host population fragmentation could be a widespread mechanism of disease emergence. Secondly, we show that the emergence of the severe form of the disease can lead to a significant increase in its induced mortality.

The PEDV isolate was 28,033 nucleotides (nt) in length without the polyadenylated sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome sequence of JSCZ1601 grouped it with the pandemic variants determined post-2010 into group 2 (G2). However, the S gene of JSCZ1601 formed a new subgroup separated from the subgroups containing the other G2 strains. Comparative analysis of the amino acids encoded by the S genes revealed the N-terminal of the deduced JSCZ1601 S protein had a novel two-amino-acid deletion (N58 and S59) compared with all identified genogroups. Further, compared with the reference strains, a 'G' insertion was detected in the 5\u2032 terminal of the 5\u2032UTR of the JSCZ1601. The animal experiment revealed that this strain was high pathogenic to neonatal pigs. Taken together, a PEDV strain with the new molecular characterizations and phylogenies was found in mainland China. It is necessary to strengthen the monitoring of PEDV variations. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is characterised by severe watery diarrhoea, leading to dehydration and high mortality among piglets. The disease is caused by the PED virus (PEDV), which belongs to family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus, and has an envelope surrounding a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome 1,2 . The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb nucleotides (nt) long and contains a 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR), a 3\u2032 UTR with a polyadenylated tail, and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) arranged in the following order: ORF1a, ORF1b, spike (S) glycoprotein gene, ORF3 hypothetical protein gene, envelope (E) gene, membrane (M) gene and nucleocapsid (N) gene 3,4 . The 5\u2032 UTR is about 291-296 nt long and the 3\u2032 UTR is about 334 nt long. Two long ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, occupy two-thirds of the genome and encode two nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b) that direct genome replication and transcription 5 . PED was first reported in feeding and fattening pigs in England in 1971 2 . In China, PED was identified as a sporadic viral enteric disease in pig herds before 2010 6-8 . However, outbreaks of PED with increased severity of diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration have occurred in China since 2010. The disease approached a mobility rate as high as 100% and a mortality rate of 80-100% in piglets less than 10 days old, and has been recognised as a devastating illness causing death in neonatal piglets 9,10 . New outbreaks associated with a novel PEDV strain that is genetically distant from the prototype PEDV strain, CV777, have been reported in China 8,11,12 .

VIP performs the following steps to achieve its goal: (i) map and filter out background-related reads, (ii) extensive classification of reads on the basis of nucleotide and remote amino acid homology, (iii) multiple k-mer based de novo assembly and phylogenetic analysis to provide evolutionary insight. We validated the feasibility and veracity of this pipeline with sequencing results of various types of clinical samples and public datasets. VIP has also contributed to timely virus diagnosis (~10 min) in acutely ill patients, demonstrating its potential in the performance of unbiased NGS-based clinical studies with demand of short turnaround time. VIP is released under GPLv3 and is available for free download at: https://github.com/keylabivdc/VIP. The world contains a high diversity of human viral pathogens. There are approximately 300 recognized viral pathogen species, and additional species continue to be discovered. The identification of viral pathogens has a tremendous impact on infectious diseases, virology and public health. Nearly all of the outbreaks of public health issues over the last decade have been caused by viruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 1 , 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 2 , H7N9 avian influenza viruses 3 and the recently described Ebola virus in West Africa 4 . Traditional diagnostic methods for viruses, such as cell culture, serodiagnosis, or nucleic acid-based testing are narrow in scope and require a priori knowledge of the potential infectious agents 5,6 . Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment for the infection dramatically reduced the risk of continued transmission and mortality in hospitalized patients 7 . Wild interest in comprehensive detection of these newly emerging and re-emerging viruses from clinical samples highlight the need for rapid, broad-spectrum diagnostic assays. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of clinical samples for viral pathogen identification provides a promising alternative solution. Although metagenomics is typically applied to understanding genomic diversity from environment samples, this methodology has also revolutionized virology with comprehensive applications, including viral pathogen identification of infectious disease in clinical laboratories 8 and virus discovery in acute and chronic illnesses of unknown origin 9 . Many novel viruses have been discovered using popular next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms such as pyrosequencing (454 Roche), semiconductor sequencing (Life Technology) and illumina dye sequencing (Illumina) 10-12 . Achievements obtained by viral metagenomics show significant advantages over traditional methods of identifying a viral pathogen, including no need of sequence information for that pathogen, identifying multiple pathogens in a single assay and eliminating the need for time-consuming culturing or antibody laboratory tests.

Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MBP) is employed as an N-terminal tag to increase the yield and solubility of its fusion partners. The MBP moiety is then removed by rhinovirus 3C protease, prior to purification, to yield an N-terminally His 6 -tagged protein. Proteins that are only temporarily rendered soluble by fusing them to MBP are readily identified at this stage because they will precipitate after the MBP tag is removed by 3C protease. The remaining soluble His 6 -tagged protein, if any, is subsequently purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Finally, the N-terminal His 6 tag is removed by His 6 -tagged tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease to yield the native recombinant protein, and the His 6 -tagged contaminants are removed by adsorption during a second round of IMAC, leaving only the untagged recombinant protein in the column effluent. The generic strategy described here saves time and effort by removing insoluble aggregates at an early stage in the process while also reducing the tendency of MBP to \"stick\" to its fusion partners during affinity purification.", "output": "A Dual Protease Approach for Expression and Affinity Purification of Recombinant Proteins", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

We also predicted ATP6V0C as a broad-spectrum essential host factor and validated its essentiality for EV71 infection in vitro. EIPs and their interacting proteins were more likely to be targets of anti-inflammatory and neurological drugs, indicating their potential to serve as host-oriented antiviral targets. Thus, we used a connectivity map to find drugs that inhibited EIP expression. We predicted tanespimycin as a candidate and demonstrated its antiviral efficiency in vitro. These findings provide the first systematic identification of EV71-host protein interactions, an analysis of EIP protein characteristics and a demonstration of their value in developing host-oriented antiviral therapies. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) of the Picornaviridae family is one of the predominant causes of human hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), especially across the Asia-Pacific region 1 . Although HFMD caused by EV71 infection mostly leads to mild symptoms, the disease may be complicated by serious symptoms, such as poliomyelitis-like paralysis, encephalomyelitis, myocarditis and neonatal sepsis, resulting in severe and even fatal consequences in infections of children under 5 years of age 2-5 . In the absence of efficacious therapy for severe infections and preventive vaccines, outbreaks and recurrent EV71 epidemics are major threats to public health and cause widespread panic during epidemics 1-6 . The EV71 genome is a single-stranded positive RNA that is approximately 7.4 kb in size and contains three encoding regions: P1, P2, and P3. The P1 region encodes the four structural proteins (external VP1, VP2, and VP3 and internalized VP4), whereas the P2 and P3 regions encode the other seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, and 2C encoded by the P2 region, and 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D encoded by the P3 region) 1 . Phylogenetic analysis of EV71 based on the VP1 gene divided this virus into three independent lineages designated A, B and C, of which genotypes B and C still circulate worldwide 7 . Here, we focused on EV71 genotype C, which continues to circulate throughout China. The rapid progress of systematic host-virus interaction research has provided new data for clinical applications and network-based models for virus infections 8 . To date, little progress has been made in virus infection therapies, such as Tamiflu, which is an influenza A virus self-protein neuraminidase-targeted drug. This limited progress has been attributed to the rapid mutation of viral genomes, which leads to virus-targeted drugs to lose effectiveness against new variants. Concomitant with the rapid progress in systematic attempts to collect host-virus physical interaction data, protein annotation with RNA interference (RNAi) data and other functional data, recently we have witnessed changes in the perspective of antiviral drug research 9 . Drugs targeting essential host factors for viruses may be broad-spectrum and mutant-insensitive. The common method to identify essential host factors for viruses is to knock down host genes and determine whether virus infection is controlled. However, this approach is not practical for every virus due to its low repeat rate and high cost. The virus-host protein-protein interactome also provides potential host targets for antiviral research. The yeast two-hybrid(Y2H) system was introduced twenty-five years ago and has been widely used to investigate protein-protein networks of model organisms and pathogens and hosts, such as bacteria, yeast, fruit flies, tumor viruses and hosts, and herpes viruses and hosts 10-12 . The huge interactome datasets obtained from genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screening have greatly facilitated the identification of crucial proteins that are considered druggable. But the wide distribution of host proteins that interact with viruses makes the selection of drugs targeting multiple host targets difficult. For enterovirus 71, neither genome-wide RNAi screening nor virus-host protein-protein interaction identification has been explored. Here, we constructed an EV71 protein interaction network, and by integrating public protein and drug databases, we verified the protein functions, explored their potentials in serving as drug targets and predicted anti-viral drugs (Fig. 1) . We identified interactions between EV71 proteins and host cellular proteins using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen to provide a network view of EV71 infection. A viral ORFeome was generated that included ORFs encoding all full-length mature proteins and several protein domains of EV71 BrCr. These bait sequences were cloned into fusion vectors with a GAL4 DNA binding domain. The bait constructs were screened against a human brain cDNA library using a highly stringent Y2H assay. Twenty-nine EV71-human protein interactions were identified. Analysis of the integrated EV71-human protein interaction network revealed the topological features of the EV71-interacting human proteins (EIPs) and the functional pathways related to EV71 infection. Through overlap analysis of EIPs and proteins with interactions or functional associations with other viruses, we found that ATP6V0C might be a broad-spectrum essential host factor and further validated its essentiality for EV71 infection in vitro. We then mapped EIPs to known drug targets; the related drug indications mainly covered EV71 infection-related symptoms, indicating the potential of EIPs to serve as host-directed antiviral targets. We used connectivity map resources to find drugs that inhibited EIPs and to help validate the value of EIPs as antiviral targets.

Thus, at the household level, the effects resulting from individual-level factors, such as vaccination, may be confounded or modified in some way.

To investigate the prevalence and genetic evolution of diarrhea-associated viruses responsible for the outbreaks, a total of 2987 field diarrheal samples collected from 168 pig farms in five provinces in Southern China during 2012-2018 were tested. Results: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was most frequently detected virus with prevalence rates between 50.21 and 62.10% in samples, and 96.43% (162/168) in premises, respectively. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was the second prevalent virus with prevalence rates ranging from 19.62 to 29.19% in samples, and 70.24% (118/168) in premises, respectively. Both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) were detected at low prevalence rates of < 3% in samples and 10.12% in premises. In this study, we identified a newly emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) in diarrheal samples of piglets from Fujian province in Southern China, and the prevalence rate of SADS-CoV was 10.29% (7/68). Co-infections of these diarrhea-associated viruses were common. The most frequent co-infection was PEDV with PDCoV, with an average detection rate of 12.72% (380/2987, ranging from 8.26-17.33%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PEDVs circulating in Southern China during the last 7 years were clustered with the variant strains of PEDV in genotype IIa. The most frequent mutations were present in the collagenase equivalent (COE) and epitope regions of the spike gene of the PEDVs currently circulating in the field. Genetic relationships of PDCoVs were closely related with Chinese strains, other than those present in the USA, South Korea, Thailand and Lao's public. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicated that variant PEDV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea, and either mono-infections or co-infections of pathogenic enteric CoVs were common in pigs in Southern China during 2012-2018.

While nonliving virus vaccines have clear advantages in being safe and stable, they may cause side effects and be less efficacious compared to live-attenuated virus vaccines. In most cases, the latter induce longlasting immunity but they may require special safety measures to prevent reversion to highly virulent viruses following vaccination. The chapter summarizes the recent progress in the development of coronavirus (CoV) vaccines, focusing on two zoonotic CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, both of which cause deadly disease and epidemics in humans. The development of attenuated virus vaccines to combat infections caused by highly pathogenic CoVs was largely based on the identification and characterization of viral virulence proteins that, for example, interfere with the innate and adaptive immune response or are involved in interactions with specific cell types, such as macrophages, dendritic and epithelial cells, and T lymphocytes, thereby modulating antiviral host responses and viral pathogenesis and potentially resulting in deleterious side effects following vaccination.", "output": "Molecular Basis of Coronavirus Virulence and Vaccine Development", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

ORF3 protein can be detected in PEDV-infected cells and it functions as an ion channel in both Xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast. Mutation analysis showed that Tyr170 in TM4 is important for potassium channel activity. Furthermore, viral production is reduced in infected Vero cells when ORF3 gene is silenced by siRNA.

In recent years, it has expanded geographically, changing from an endemic mosquito-borne disease across equatorial Asia and Africa, to an epidemic disease causing large outbreaks in several areas of the world. With the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks in the Americas, the disease has become a focus of attention of public health agencies and of the international research community, especially due to an association with neurological disorders in adults and to the severe neurological and ophthalmological abnormalities found in fetuses and newborns of mothers exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy. A large number of studies have been published in the last 3 years, revealing the structure of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it affects human cells. Many different animal models have been developed, which recapitulate several features of ZIKV disease and its neurological consequences. Moreover, several vaccine candidates are now in active preclinical development, and three of them have already entered phase I clinical trials. Likewise, many different compounds targeting viral and cellular components are being tested in in vitro and in experimental animal models.

The UV spectrum of solar radiation is by convention divided into three parts: UV-A: 310-400 nm, UV-B: 280-310 nm and UV-C: less than 280 nm. UV-B is the most energetic component reaching Earth surface because the stratospheric ozone layer effectively absorbs completely wavelengths below 290 nm. UV-B is an increasing threat due to increasing UV-B levels on Earth surface as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric O 3 . In general, the effects of atmospheric UV-B radiation are negative for biological life. Enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can indeed negatively change plant physiological processes, growth and productivity. However, while studying UV-B effects on medicinal plants, some interesting phenomena have been discovered. For example, basil plants respond positively to UV-B radiation by increasing oil yield (Chang et al. J Horticult For 1:27-31, 2009). In other studies medicinal plants show bene fi cial aspects in term of increase in volatile oil yield and secondary metabolite production (Kumari et al. Ecotoxicol Environ Safety ). Medicinal herbs have great market value in India and worldwide. The medicinal value of plants depends upon phenolics, antioxidants and volatile yield. Therefore further UV-B experiments increasing the levels of these compounds are needed.

In this report, we have investigated the molecular basis for the binding between the CD66 and Opa protein families by mapping amino acids in CD66 receptors that determine Opa protein binding. We performed homologue scanning mutagenesis between CD66e, which binds multiple Opa variants, and CD66b, which binds none, and tested both loss-offunction by CD66e and gain-of-function by CD66b in solution assays and in assays involving full-length receptors expressed by epithelial cells. We found that three residues in the CD66e N-domain are required for maximal Opa protein receptor activity.

Nonetheless, it has long been known that normal speech also yields large quantities of particles that are too small to see by eye, but are large enough to carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens. Here we show that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm 3 ) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (english, spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic). Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as \"speech superemitters,\" consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers. our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech. these results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease. It has long been recognized that particles expelled during human expiratory events, such as sneezing, coughing, talking, and breathing, serve as vehicles for respiratory pathogen transmission 1-6 . The relative contribution of each expiratory activity in transmitting infectious microorganisms, however, remains unclear 4 . Much previous research has focused on coughing 7-12 and sneezing 11,13,14 activities that yield relatively large droplets (approximately 50 \u03bcm or larger) easily visible to the naked eye. Less noticeable, but arguably more infectious for some diseases, are the smaller particles emitted during sneezing and coughing as well as during breathing 15-17 and talking 16, 18, 19 . These small particles are believed to be generated during breathing and talking from the mucosal layers coating the respiratory tract via a combination of a \"fluid-film burst\" mechanism within the bronchioles and from vocal folds adduction and vibration within the larynx 6,20,21 . The particles emitted during breathing and typical speech predominantly average only 1 \u03bcm in diameter 15-17 and are thus too small to see without specialized equipment; most people outside of the community of bioaerosol researchers are less aware of them. Despite their small size, however, these micron-scale particles are sufficiently large to carry a variety of respiratory pathogens such as measles virus (50-500 nm) 22 , influenza virus (100 nm-1 \u00b5m) 23 , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1-3 \u00b5m) 24 . Indeed, recent work by Yan et al. has confirmed that significant amounts of influenza viral RNA are present in small particles (<5 \u03bcm) emitted by influenza-infected individuals during natural breathing, without coughing or sneezing 25 .

Moreover, it was found that PA was an independent protective factor for CAP in children based on multivariate analysis (odds ratio: 0.974; 95% confidence interval: 0.956-0.993; P = 0.008). PA level in severe CAP group was significantly lower than in mild CAP group (P = 0.001). With a cutoff value of 125 mg/L, the sensitivity and specificity of PA for the severity assessment of CAP were 0.703 and 0.714, respectively. Combined with traditional inflammatory markers, PA may improve the diagnostic efficacy of CAP in children. PA can be used as a reference marker to complement the chest X-rays for severity assessment of children CAP.

However, the presence of a nucleocapsid core is not required for assembly of infectious particles. To determine the role of the nucleocapsid core, we develop a coarse-grained computational model with which we investigate budding dynamics as a function of glycoprotein and nucleocapsid interactions, as well as budding in the absence of a nucleocapsid. We find that there is a transition between glycoprotein-directed budding and nucleocapsid-directed budding that occurs above a threshold strength of nucleocapsid interactions. The simulations predict that glycoprotein-directed budding leads to significantly increased size polydispersity and particle polymorphism. This polydispersity can be explained by a theoretical model accounting for the competition between bending energy of the membrane and the glycoprotein shell. The simulations also show that the geometry of a budding particle leads to a barrier to subunit diffusion, which can result in a stalled, partially budded state. We present a phase diagram for this and other morphologies of budded particles. Comparison of these structures against experiments could establish bounds on whether budding is directed by glycoprotein or nucleocapsid interactions.

We used serological methods and quantitative real-time PCR to test free-ranging and captive Namibian cheetahs for the presence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), a gammaretrovirus that can be highly aggressive in populations with low genetic diversity, such as cheetahs. We also assessed the presence of antibodies to other gammaretroviruses and the responses to a FeLV vaccine developed for domestic cats. Up to 19% of the free-ranging cheetahs, 27% of the captive nonvaccinated cheetahs, and 86% of the captive vaccinated cheetahs tested positive for FeLV antibodies. FeLV-antibody-positive freeranging cheetahs also tested positive for Rauscher murine leukemia virus antibodies. Nevertheless, FeLV was not detectable by quantitative real-time PCR and no reverse transcriptase activity was detectable by product-enhanced reverse transcriptase assay in the plasma of cheetahs or the supernatants from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presence of antibodies to gammaretroviruses in clinically healthy specimens may be caused either by infection with a low-pathogenic retrovirus or by the expression of endogenous retroviral sequences.

Their secondary structures are crucial for the RNA functionality, and the prediction of the secondary structures is widely studied. Our previous research shows that cutting long sequences into shorter chunks, predicting secondary structures of the chunks independently using thermodynamic methods, and reconstructing the entire secondary structure from the predicted chunk structures can yield better accuracy than predicting the secondary structure using the RNA sequence as a whole. The chunking, prediction, and reconstruction processes can use different methods and parameters, some of which produce more accurate predictions than others. In this paper, we study the prediction accuracy and efficiency of three different chunking methods using seven popular secondary structure prediction programs that apply to two datasets of RNA with known secondary structures, which include both pseudoknotted and non-pseudoknotted sequences, as well as a family of viral genome RNAs whose structures have not been predicted before. Our modularized MapReduce framework based on Hadoop allows us to study the problem in a parallel and robust environment. Results: On average, the maximum accuracy retention values are larger than one for our chunking methods and the seven prediction programs over 50 non-pseudoknotted sequences, meaning that the secondary structure predicted using chunking is more similar to the real structure than the secondary structure predicted by using the whole sequence. We observe similar results for the 23 pseudoknotted sequences, except for the NUPACK program using the centered chunking method. The performance analysis for 14 long RNA sequences from the Nodaviridae virus family outlines how the coarse-grained mapping of chunking and predictions in the MapReduce framework exhibits shorter turnaround times for short RNA sequences. However, as the lengths of the RNA sequences increase, the fine-grained mapping can surpass the coarse-grained mapping in performance. Conclusions: By using our MapReduce framework together with statistical analysis on the accuracy retention results, we observe how the inversion-based chunking methods can outperform predictions using the whole sequence. Our chunk-based approach also enables us to predict secondary structures for very long RNA sequences, which is not feasible with traditional methods alone.

Reports in the literature have indicated that to infect cells the incoming viruses either fuse their envelope directly with the plasma membrane or exploit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To study the entry process in human tissue culture cells (HeLa, A549), we used fluorescence microscopy and developed quantitative, FACS-based assays to follow virus binding to cells, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, membrane fusion, and infection. A variety of perturbants were employed to characterize the cellular processes involved. We found that immediately after binding to cells RSV activated a signaling cascade involving the EGF receptor, Cdc42, PAK1, and downstream effectors. This led to a series of dramatic actin rearrangements; the cells rounded up, plasma membrane blebs were formed, and there was a significant increase in fluid uptake. If these effects were inhibited using compounds targeting Na + /H + exchangers, myosin II, PAK1, and other factors, no infection was observed. The RSV was rapidly and efficiently internalized by an actin-dependent process that had all hallmarks of macropinocytosis. Rather than fusing with the plasma membrane, the viruses thus entered Rab5-positive, fluidfilled macropinosomes, and fused with the membranes of these on the average 50 min after internalization. Rab5 was required for infection. To find an explanation for the endocytosis requirement, which is unusual among paramyxoviruses, we analyzed the fusion protein, F, and could show that, although already cleaved by a furin family protease once, it underwent a second, critical proteolytic cleavage after internalization. This cleavage by a furin-like protease removed a small peptide from the F1 subunits, and made the virus infectious.", "output": "Host Cell Entry of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Involves Macropinocytosis Followed by Proteolytic Activation of the F Protein", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Through analysis of the viperin-interactome, we identified the Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) as the cellular protein targeted by viperin. Viperin-induced antiviral activity, as well as C-particle release, was stimulated by GBF1 inhibition and knockdown and reduced by elevated levels of GBF1.

Previous studies have shown significant variation in the incidence of viral, bacterial and mixed infections, with conflicting risk associations for mortality. We aimed to determine the risk association of microbial aetiologies with hospital mortality in severe CAP, utilising a diagnostic strategy incorporating molecular testing. Our primary hypothesis was that respiratory viruses were important causative pathogens in severe CAP and was associated with increased mortality when present with bacterial pathogens in mixed viral-bacterial co-infections. Methods: A retrospective cohort study from January 2014 to July 2015 was conducted in a tertiary hospital medical intensive care unit in eastern Singapore, which has a tropical climate. All patients diagnosed with severe community-acquired pneumonia were included. Results: A total of 117 patients were in the study. Microbial pathogens were identified in 84 (71.8%) patients. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections occurred in 18 (15.4%) of patients. Isolated viral infections were present in 32 patients (27.4%); isolated bacterial infections were detected in 34 patients (29.1%). Hospital mortality occurred in 16 (13.7%) patients. The most common bacteria isolated was Streptococcus pneumoniae and the most common virus isolated was Influenza A. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that serum procalcitonin, APACHE II severity score and mixed viral-bacterial infection were associated with increased risk of hospital mortality. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections were associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.99 (95% CI 1.30-151.05, p = 0.03) for hospital mortality. Conclusions: Respiratory viruses are common organisms isolated in severe community-acquired pneumonia.

Several species of pathogenic bacteria secrete IgA1 proteases at mucosal sites of infection to destroy the structure and function of human IgA1 thereby eliminating an important aspect of host defence. IgA1 proteases are known as autotransporter proteins as their gene structure encodes the information to direct their own secretion out of the bacterial cell. The iga gene structure is also thought to contribute to the antigenic heterogeneity demonstrated by the IgA1 proteases during infections and the cleavage specificity of the IgA1 proteases for human IgA1. The IgA1 proteases have therefore been implicated as important virulence factors that contribute to bacterial infection and colonisation.

The negative binomial distribution is used commonly throughout biology as a model for overdispersed count data, with attention focused on the negative binomial dispersion parameter, k. A substantial literature exists on the estimation of k, but most attention has focused on datasets that are not highly overdispersed (i.e., those with k$1), and the accuracy of confidence intervals estimated for k is typically not explored. Methodology. This article presents a simulation study exploring the bias, precision, and confidence interval coverage of maximum-likelihood estimates of k from highly overdispersed distributions. In addition to exploring small-sample bias on negative binomial estimates, the study addresses estimation from datasets influenced by two types of event under-counting, and from disease transmission data subject to selection bias for successful outbreaks. Conclusions. Results show that maximum likelihood estimates of k can be biased upward by small sample size or under-reporting of zero-class events, but are not biased downward by any of the factors considered. Confidence intervals estimated from the asymptotic sampling variance tend to exhibit coverage below the nominal level, with overestimates of k comprising the great majority of coverage errors. Estimation from outbreak datasets does not increase the bias of k estimates, but can add significant upward bias to estimates of the mean. Because k varies inversely with the degree of overdispersion, these findings show that overestimation of the degree of overdispersion is very rare for these datasets.", "output": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Negative Binomial Dispersion Parameter for Highly Overdispersed Data, with Applications to Infectious Diseases", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

B cell associated protein 31 (BAP31) is overexpressed in most MMs and might be a promising target for immunotherapy of this disease. Experimental design: Firstly, we investigated the expression profiles of human BAP31 (hBAP31) and mouse BAP31 (mBAP31) in human and mouse normal tissues, respectively. The expression level of hBAP31 in human MMs and mBAP31 in B16 melanoma cells was also analyzed. Then we constructed novel mBAP31 DNA vaccines and tested there ability to stimulate mBAP31-specific immune responses and antitumor immunity in B16 melanoma-bearing mice. Results: For the first time, we found that protein expression of hBAP31 were dramatically upregulated in human MMs when compared with human normal tissues. Predominant protein expression of mBAP31 was found in mouse B16 melanoma cells but not in mouse important organs. When mice were immunized with mBAP31 DNA vaccines, strong cellular response to mBAP31 was observed in the vaccinated mice. CTLs isolated from immunized mice could effectively kill mBAP31-positive target mouse B16 melanoma tumor cells in vitro and vaccination with mBAP31 DNA vaccines had potent anti-tumor activity in therapeutic model using B16 melanoma cells.

In this study, we sought to use this signal transduction conduit against them by inhibiting multiple kinases that influence translation.

Furthermore, inhibiting p70 S6K through treatment with the FDA approved drug rapamycin prevents RVFV pathogenesis in a mouse model of infection. We hypothesized that inhibiting either p70 S6K, p90RSK, or p90RSK's upstream kinases, ERK and p38 MAPK, would decrease translation and subsequent viral replication. Treatment with the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 resulted in decreased phosphorylation of translational proteins and reduced RVFV titers. In contrast, treatment with the p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870, p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580, or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 alone had minimal influence on RVFV titers. The combination of PF-4708671 and BI-D1870 treatment resulted in robust inhibition of RVFV replication.

Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) employs a photosensitizer, light, and oxygen to create a local burst of reactive oxygen species that inactivate microorganisms. The botanical plant extract Orthoquin TM is a powerful photosensitizer with antimicrobial properties. Here we report that Orthoquin also has antiviral properties. Photoactivated Orthoquin inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection of target cells in a dose-dependent manner across a broad range of sub-cytotoxic concentrations. HSV inactivation required direct contact between Orthoquin and the inoculum, whereas pre-treatment of target cells had no effect. Orthoquin did not cause appreciable damage to viral capsids or premature release of viral genomes, as measured by qPCR for the HSV-1 genome. By contrast, immunoblotting for HSV-1 antigens in purified virion preparations suggested that higher doses of Orthoquin had a physical impact on certain HSV-1 proteins that altered protein mobility or antigen detection. Orthoquin PDI also inhibited the non-enveloped adenovirus (AdV) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Orthoquin-mediated inhibition of the enveloped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was light-independent. Together, these findings suggest that the broad antiviral effects of Orthoquin-mediated PDI may stem from damage to viral attachment proteins. facilitate attachment and entry into host cells. While HSV-1 and HSV-2 are similar, they share onl\u1ef9 55% nucleotide identity. Lytic HSV infection of a cell begins with initial attachment to negatively charged cell surface heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans, followed by stable attachment of viral glycoproteins to cell surface receptors and fusion of the viral envelope to the plasma membrane or internal membranes [2] . Fusion of viral and host membranes enables delivery of the viral nucleocapsid and tegument proteins to the cytoplasm. After the HSV nucleocapsid arrives at the nucleus and delivers the viral genome, HSV genes are expressed in an ordered temporal cascade. Viral egress requires primary envelopment of the genome-containing capsid at the inner nuclear membrane, fusion with the outer nuclear membrane and final envelopment at the trans-Golgi network. Mature virions then exit through the cellular secretory system. All stages of the HSV replication cycle offer potential targets for direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. However, DAAs can be undermined by the emergence of drug resistant mutant viruses. Anti-HSV DAAs acyclovir and foscarnet offer examples of the hazards of drug resistance. These drugs interrupt HSV genome replication by different mechanisms of action. Acyclovir is a nucleoside analogue prodrug that selectively targets HSV infected cells through the action of the HSV thymidine kinase (TK) enzyme, which efficiently phosphorylates acyclovir and facilitates incorporation into nascent viral DNA genomes by the HSV DNA polymerase enzyme; incorporation of acyclovir into viral DNA terminates genome replication [3] . By contrast, the pyrophosphate analogue foscarnet blocks viral genome replication by directly inhibiting HSV DNA polymerase activity [4] . Though resistance to acyclovir occurs at a low prevalence (\u22641%) in immunocompetent patients [5], immunocompromised patients experience much higher rates (4-10%) [6] . Unsurprisingly, resistance to acyclovir, and its derivatives, and to foscarnet, has been mapped to mutations in the viral thymidine kinase and the DNA polymerase catalytic subunit, respectively [7] . Currently, Abreva (n-docosanol) is the only over-the-counter topical antiviral for herpes labialis. Abreva is incorporated into the cellular plasma membrane and prevents fusion steps essential for HSV-1 entry into epithelial cells [8] . However, it must be applied repeatedly throughout the day due to rapid plasma membrane turnover and the subsequent loss of n-docosanol [9] . This host-targeted antiviral mechanism prevents development of viral resistance, but Abreva is only approved for perioral lesions, so there is a still a gap in treatment for lesions in other areas of the body. Like Abreva, there is potential for more broadly-acting antiviral drugs that exploit the physical structure of the HSV virion and block early stages of infection, such as attachment and penetration. In this study, we explored the potential of the plant-derived photosensitizing agent Orthoquin TM to mediate photodynamic inactivation (PDI) [10] of virions. The clinical utility of Orthoquin PDI of oral biofilms is an area of active investigation and there is clear potential for wider range of clinical applications. The basis of PDI is the photodynamic effect, which has been exploited in photodynamic therapy (PDT) [11, 12] for treatment of cancers [13] and age-related macular degeneration [14] . In PDT, photosensitizer compounds when exposed to visible light react with oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that include singlet oxygen [15] . ROS damage proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, which can lead to cell death. Some of the most well-known photosensitizing molecules for PDT are based on a tetrapyrrolic core and are found in naturally occurring pigments, such as heme, chlorophyll, and bacteriochlorophyll [16] . The accepted phototoxic mechanism for these types of photosensitizers involves the formation of an excited triplet state upon light absorption that can participate in electron (Type 1) or energy (Type 2) transfer processes. Type 1 electron transfer reactions typically lead to the formation of radical species like superoxide or hydroxyl radicals, whereas Type 2 energy transfer produces cytotoxic singlet oxygen. It is possible for a photosensitizer to initiate both Type 1 and 2 photoprocesses simultaneously, depending on the specific chemistry of the photosensitizing agent and its environment [16] . Due to the high reactivities and short lifetimes of oxidizing molecules, it is expected that only viral structures in close proximity to activated photosensitizing compounds will be affected.", "output": "Photodynamic Inactivation of Herpes Simplex Viruses", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

In this study, we showed that the overexpression of nsp11 of PRRSV induced a strong suppression of IFN production. Nsp11 suppressed both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB activities when stimulated with a dsRNA analogue and TNF-\u03b1, respectively. This suppression was RLR dependent, since the transcripts and proteins of MAVS and RIG-I, two critical factors in RLR-mediated pathway, were both found to be reduced in the presence of overexpressed nsp11. Since nsp11 is an endoribonuclease (EndoU), the structure function relationship was examined using a series of nsp11 EndoU mutant plasmids. The mutants that impaired the EndoU activity failed to suppress IFN and led to the normal expression of MAVS. Seven single amino acid substitutions (4 in subdomain A and 3 in subdomain B) plus one insertion (frame-shift in nsp11) were then introduced into PRRSV infectious cDNA clones to generate nsp11 mutant viruses. Unfortunately, all EndoU knock-out nsp11 mutant viruses appeared replication-defective and no progenies were produced. Three mutations in EndoU subdomain A expressed the N and nsp2/3 proteins but their infectivity diminished after 2 passages. Taken together, our data show that PRRSV nsp11 endoribonuclease activity is critical for both viral replication and IFN antagonism. More importantly, the endoribonuclease activity of nsp11 demonstrates the substrate specificity towards MAVS and RIG-I (transcripts and proteins) over p65 and IRF3 in the context of gene transfection and overexpression.

Despite advances in vaccine and antiviral drug technology, each year over three million people die from a range of viral infections. Predominant viruses include human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis viruses, and gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses. Now more than ever, robust, easily mobilised and cost-effective antiviral strategies are needed to combat both known and emerging disease threats. RNA interference and small interfering (si)RNAs were initially hailed as a ''magic bullet'', due to their ability to inhibit the synthesis of any protein via the degradation of its complementary messenger RNA sequence. Of particular interest was the potential for attenuating viral mRNAs contributing to the pathogenesis of disease that were not able to be targeted by vaccines or antiviral drugs. However, it was soon discovered that delivery of active siRNA molecules to the infection site in vivo was considerably more difficult than anticipated, due to a number of physiological barriers in the body. This spurred a new wave of investigation into nucleic acid delivery vehicles which could facilitate safe, targeted and effective administration of the siRNA as therapy. Amongst these, cationic polymer delivery vehicles have emerged as a promising candidate as they are low-cost and easy to produce at an industrial scale, and bind to the siRNA by nonspecific electrostatic interactions.

Reasons as to why kudus appear to be exceptionally susceptible to the disease still remain speculative at best. Because the Namibian economy relies heavily on trophy hunting, game meat hunting, and ecotourism, the current severe spread of rabies among kudus calls for effective measures to protect these antelopes. Oral vaccination of kudus may offer a possibility provided efficacious oral rabies vaccines are available.

Individual cysteine clusters were altered via cysteine-to-alanine amino acid replacement and the modified S glycoproteins were tested for their transport to cell-surfaces and ability to cause cell fusion in transient transfection assays. Mutagenesis of the cysteine cluster I, located immediately proximal to the predicted transmembrane, domain did not appreciably reduce cell-surface expression, although S-mediated cell fusion was reduced by more than 50% in comparison to the wild-type S. Similarly, mutagenesis of the cysteine cluster II located adjacent to cluster I reduced S-mediated cell fusion by more than 60% compared to the wild-type S, while cellsurface expression was reduced by less than 20%. Mutagenesis of cysteine clusters III and IV did not appreciably affect S cell-surface expression or S-mediated cell fusion.

HIV-1 can prompt metabolic encephalopathy with the addition of neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis. Recently, we reported that HIV-1 enhances the expression and secretion of bioactive cathepsin B in monocyte-derived macrophages, ultimately contributing to neuronal apoptosis. In this research, we request if microglia respond to HIV infection similarly by modifying the expression, secretion, neurotoxic potential of cathepsin B and the in vivo relevance of these findings. METHODS-HIV-ADA infected human primary microglia and CHME-5 were assessed for expression and activity of cathepsin B, its inhibitors, cystatins B and C, and neurotoxicity associated with these changes. Human primary neurons were exposed to supernatants from HIVinfected and uninfected microglia in the presence of cathepsin B inhibitors and apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL. Microglial expression of cathepsin B was validated in brain tissue from HIVE patients. microglia secreted significantly greater levels of cathepsin B, cystatin B, and cystatin C compared to uninfected cells. Increased apoptosis was observed in neurons exposed to supernatants from HIV-1 infected microglia at days 12 post-infection. The cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 and cathepsin B antibody prevented neuronal apoptosis. Increased microgliaderived cathepsin B, cystatin B, and cystatin C and caspase-3+ neurons were detected in HIVE brains compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS-Our results suggest that HIV-1-induced cathepsin B production in microglia contributes to neuronal apoptosis and may be an important factor in neuronal death associated with HIVE.

Fetal brain tissue (gestational age 16-18 weeks) was obtained from elective abortion procedures performed in full compliance with National Institutes of Health and Temple University ethical guidelines. The tissue was washed with cold Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and meninges and blood vessels were removed as previously described [Huang et al, 2011; Ghorpade et al, 1998].. For microglia, brain tissue was supplemented with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ and then digested with 0.25% trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Trypsin was neutralized with fetal bovine serum (FBS), and the tissue was further dissociated to obtain single-cell suspensions. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma), supplemented with a mixture containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1,000 U of purified recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) per ml, penicillin and streptomycin (50 mg/ ml), and 100 mg/ml of neomycin. The mixed culture was maintained under 5% CO 2 for 7 days, and the medium was fully replaced to remove any cell debris. The microglia cells released with further incubation were collected and purified by preferential adhesion. Microglia were seeded as an adherent monolayer at a density of 3 \u00d7 10 6 cells/well in a 6well plate and floating cells were removed after 4h. For neurons, tissue in HBSS was digested with papain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Tissue was then dissociated to obtain single-cell suspensions by repeated pipetting with small bore fire polished glass Pasteur pipettes. Cells were plated in poly-D lysine-coated dishes at a density of ~ 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 cells/60mm dish in neurobasal media with B27 supplement, horse serum, and gentamicin (Invitrogen). After 2hr of attachment, media was replaced with fresh complete neurobasal media. Twenty-four hours later, cultures were replaced with neurobasal media without horse serum. Four days later, one fourth of the media was removed and replaced with neurobasal media supplemented with fluorodeoxyuridine (FDU) and uridine.

We compared these signatures by their capacity to segregate biological conditions by pathogenicity and predict pathogenicity in a test data set. The highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples, suggesting a direct, analog relationship between expression and pathogenicity. This signature comprised 57 genes including a subnetwork of chemokines, implicating dysregulated cell recruitment in injury.

Using locus-specific, PCR-based genotyping, we amplified 33 FLAI-E, -H, and -K alleles from 12 cats of various breeds, identifying, for the first time, alleles across 3 distinct loci in a feline species. Alleles shared the expected polymorphic and invariant sites in the 1/ 2 domains, and full-length cDNA clones possessed all characteristic class Ia exons. Alleles could be assigned to a specific locus with reasonable confidence, although there was evidence of potentially confounding interlocus recombination between FLAI-E and -K.

We also defined hypervariable regions across these genes, which permitted the assignment of names to both novel and established alleles.

At the initial URI visit seen by the study personnel (median day=4 from symptoms onset), nasopharyngeal samples were obtained for bacterial cultures and viral studies. Results-Of 1295 documented URI episodes, 103 (8%) episodes (in 73 children) were complicated by ABS, 32 of which were concurrent with acute otitis media. The majority (72%) of ABS episodes were diagnosed based on persistent symptoms or a biphasic course. Average age at ABS diagnosis was 18.8\u00b17.2 months; white children were more likely to have ABS episodes than blacks (p=0.01). Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (p<0.0001) was negatively associated, and adequate PCV-7 immunization status (p=0.001) appeared to increase the risk of ABS. Girls had more ABS episodes than boys (0.5\u00b10.8 vs 0.3\u00b10.6 episodes/year, respectively, p=0.03). Viruses were detected in 63% during the initial URI visit; rhinovirus detection was positively correlated with ABS risk (p=0.01). Bacterial cultures were positive in 82/83 (99%) available samples obtained at the initial URI visit; polymicrobial (56%), Moraxella catarrhalis (20%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%) were the most common cultures.

Since then, MALDI MS technologies have been evolving, and successfully used in genome, proteome, metabolome, and clinical diagnostic research. These technologies are highthroughput and sensitive. Emerging evidence has shown that they are not only useful in qualitative and quantitative analyses of proteins, but also of other types of biomolecules, such as DNA, glycans, and metabolites. Recently, parallel fragmentation monitoring (PFM), which is a method comparable to selected reaction monitoring, has been reported. This highlights the potentials of MALDI-TOF/ TOF tandem MS in quantification of metabolites. Here we critically review the applications of the major MALDI MS technologies, including MALDI-TOF MS, MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, SALDI-TOF MS, MALDI-QqQ MS, and SELDI-TOF MS, to the discovery and quantification of disease biomarkers in biological specimens, especially those in plasma/serum specimens. Using SELDI-TOF MS as an example, the presence of systemic bias in biomarker discovery studies employing MALDI-TOF MS and its possible solutions are also discussed in this chapter. The concepts of MALDI, SALDI, SELDI, and PFM are complementary to each other. Theoretically, all these technologies can be combined, leading to the next generation of the MALDI MS technologies.

Although coughing and sneezing have garnered much attention as potential, explosive sources of infectious aerosols, these are relatively rare events during daily life, whereas breathing is necessary for life and is performed continuously. Real-time shadowgraph imaging was used to visualise and capture high-speed images of healthy volunteers sneezing and breathing (through the nose -nasally, and through the mouth -orally). Six volunteers, who were able to respond to the pepper sneeze stimulus, were recruited for the sneezing experiments (2 women: 27.566.36 years; 4 men: 29.25610.53 years). The maximum visible distance over which the sneeze plumes (or puffs) travelled was 0.6 m, the maximum sneeze velocity derived from these measured distances was 4.5 m/s. The maximum 2-dimensional (2-D) area of dissemination of these sneezes was 0.2 m 2 . The corresponding derived parameter, the maximum 2-D area expansion rate of these sneezes was 2 m 2 /s. For nasal breathing, the maximum propagation distance and derived velocity were 0.6 m and 1.4 m/s, respectively. The maximum 2-D area of dissemination and derived expansion rate were 0.11 m 2 and 0.16 m 2 /s, respectively. Similarly, for mouth breathing, the maximum propagation distance and derived velocity were 0.8 m and 1.3 m/ s, respectively. The maximum 2-D area of dissemination and derived expansion rate were 0.18 m 2 and 0.17 m 2 /s, respectively.

The encoded polypeptide, 468 aa in length, has three tetratricopeptide repeat motifs. pIFIT2 gene was unevenly distributed in all eleven tissues studied with the most abundance in spleen. Poly(I:C) treatment notably strongly upregulated the mRNA level and promoter activity of pIFIT2 gene.

Best examples of viral infections that have been proposed to modulate the induction and development of autoimmune diseases are the infections with enteric viruses such as Coxsackie B virus (CVB) and rotavirus, as well as influenza A viruses (IAV), and herpesviruses. Other viruses that have been studied in this context include, measles, mumps, and rubella. Epidemiological studies in humans and experimental studies in animal have shown that viral infections can induce or protect from autoimmunopathologies depending on several factors including genetic background, host-elicited immune responses, type of virus strain, viral load, and the onset time of infection. Still, data delineating the clear mechanistic interaction between the virus and the immune system to induce autoreactivity are scarce. Available data indicate that viral-induced autoimmunity can be activated through multiple mechanisms including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, bystander activation, and immortalization of infected B cells. Contrarily, the protective effects can be achieved via regulatory immune responses which lead to the suppression of autoimmune phenomena. Therefore, a better understanding of the immune-related molecular processes in virus-induced autoimmunity is warranted. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of viral-induced autoimmunity and the mechanisms that are associated with this phenomenon. Viruses 2019, 11, 762 2 of 18 , and several others [9] . Another hypothesized mechanism is the \"bystander activation\", whereby a non-specific and an over-reactive antiviral immune response creates a localized pro-inflammatory environment along with the release of self-antigens from the damaged tissue. These self-antigens are subsequently taken up and presented by antigen presenting cells (APC) to stimulate the previously non-responsive, yet autoreactive T cells in the vicinity triggering autoimmunity [10] . A related mechanism is called \"epitope spreading\", in which a viral infection triggers the release of more self-antigens and the de novo activation of autoreactive cells, which consequently spread to target additional self-epitopes [9] . Both molecular mimicry and bystander activation have been observed in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis (MS) [11], West Nile virus (WNV)-mediated myasthenia gravis (MG) [12] , TMEV-IDD [13] , and other disorders [9] . Moreover, viruses may immortalize autoreactive effector cells as observed in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells [14] . While several hypotheses have been proposed to understand the mechanisms underlying virus-induced autoimmunity, the precise contribution of these mechanisms are not yet fully understood.

Self-administered, anonymous surveys were performed by hard copy questionnaires in public hospitals, and by an on-line platform available to all healthcare professionals, from April 1st to May 31st, 2015. A total of 1290 healthcare professionals completed the questionnaires, including doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals working in both the public and private systems. Only 31.8% of participating respondents expressed an intention to receive the additional vaccine, despite that the majority of them agreed or strongly agreed that it would bring benefit to the community (88.9%), save lives (86.7%), reduce medical expenses (76.3%), satisfy public expectation (82.8%), and increase awareness of vaccination (86.1%). However, a significant proportion expressed concern that the vaccine could disturb the normal immunization schedule (45.5%); felt uncertain what to do in the next vaccination round (66.0%); perceived that the summer peak might not occur (48.2%); and believed that the summer peak might not be of the same virus (83.5%). Furthermore, 27.8% of all respondents expected that the additional vaccination could weaken the efficacy of previous vaccinations; 51.3% was concerned about side effects; and 61.3% estimated that there would be a low uptake rate. If the supply of vaccine was limited, higher priority groups were considered to include the elderly aged !65 years with chronic medical conditions (89.2%), the elderly living in residential care homes (87.4%), and longstay residents of institutions for the disabled (80.7%). The strongest factors associated with accepting the additional vaccine included immunization with influenza vaccines in the past 3 years, higher perceived risk of contracting influenza, and higher perceived severity of the disease impact. The acceptability to an additional ad hoc influenza vaccination was low among healthcare professionals. This could have a negative impact on such additional vaccination campaigns since healthcare professionals are a key driver for vaccine acceptance.

Currently no potent and selective CBS inhibitors are available. Using a composite collection of 8871 clinically used drugs and well-annotated pharmacological compounds (including the LOPAC library, the FDA Approved Drug Library, the NIH Clinical Collection, the New Prestwick Chemical Library, the US Drug Collection, the International Drug Collection, the `Killer Plates' collection and a small custom collection of PLP-dependent enzyme inhibitors), we conducted an in vitro screen in order to identify inhibitors for CBS using a primary 7-azido-4methylcoumarin (AzMc) screen to detect CBS-derived hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) production. Initial hits were subjected to counterscreens using the methylene blue assay (a secondary assay to measure H 2 S production) and were assessed for their ability to quench the H 2 S signal produced by the H 2 S donor compound GYY4137. Four compounds, hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid and benserazide showed concentration-dependent CBS inhibitory actions without scavenging H 2 S released from GYY4137, identifying them as direct CBS inhibitors. Hexachlorophene (IC 50 : ~60 \u03bcM), tannic acid (IC 50 : ~40 \u03bcM) and benserazide (IC 50 : ~30 \u03bcM) were less potent CBS inhibitors than the two reference compounds AOAA (IC 50 : ~3 \u03bcM) and NSC67078 (IC 50 : ~1 \u03bcM), while aurintricarboxylic acid (IC 50 : ~3 \u03bcM) was equipotent with AOAA. The second reference compound NSC67078 not only inhibited the CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence signal (IC 50 : ~1 \u03bcM), but also inhibited with the GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence signal with (IC 50 of ~6 \u03bcM) indicative of scavenging/non-specific effects. Hexachlorophene (IC 50 : ~6 \u03bcM), tannic acid (IC 50 : ~20 \u03bcM), benserazide (IC 50 : ~20 \u03bcM), and NSC67078 (IC 50 : ~0.3 \u03bcM) inhibited HCT116 colon cancer cells proliferation with greater potency than AOAA (IC 50 : ~300 \u03bcM). In contrast, although a CBS inhibitor in the cell-free assay, aurintricarboxylic acid failed to inhibit HCT116 proliferation at lower concentrations, and stimulated cell proliferation at 300 \u03bcM. Copper-containing compounds present in the libraries, were also found to be potent inhibitors of recombinant CBS; however this activity was due to the CBS inhibitory effect of copper ions themselves. However, copper ions, up to 300 \u03bcM, did not inhibit HCT116 cell proliferation. Benserazide was only a weak inhibitor of the activity of the other H 2 S-generating enzymes CSE and 3-MST activity (16% and 35% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM, respectively) in vitro. Benserazide suppressed HCT116 mitochondrial function and inhibited proliferation of the high CBS-expressing colon cancer cell line HT29, but not the low CBSexpressing line, LoVo. The major benserazide metabolite 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine also inhibited CBS activity and suppressed HCT116 cell proliferation in vitro. In an in vivo study of nude mice bearing human colon cancer cell xenografts, benserazide (50 mg/kg/day s.q.) prevented tumor growth. In silico docking simulations showed that benserazide binds in the active site of the enzyme and reacts with the PLP cofactor by forming reversible but kinetically stable Schiff baselike adducts with the formyl moiety of pyridoxal. We conclude that benserazide inhibits CBS activity and suppresses colon cancer cell proliferation and bioenergetics in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo.

Here we investigated the IFN-ab response to human adenoviruses (Ads) in mice. By comparing the responses of normal, myeloid (m)DC-and plasmacytoid (p)DC-depleted mice and by measuring IFN-ab mRNA expression in different organs and cells types, we show that in vivo, Ads elicit strong and rapid IFN-ab production, almost exclusively in splenic mDCs. Using knockout mice, various strains of Ads (wild type, mutant and UV-inactivated) and MAP kinase inhibitors, we demonstrate that the Ad-induced IFN-ab response does not require Toll-like receptors (TLR), known cytosolic sensors of RNA (RIG-I/MDA-5) and DNA (DAI) recognition and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, but is dependent on viral endosomal escape, signaling via the MAP kinase SAPK/JNK and IRF-7. Furthermore, we show that Ads induce IFN-ab and IL-6 in vivo by distinct pathways and confirm that IFN-ab positively regulates the IL-6 response. Finally, by measuring TNF-a responses to LPS in Ad-infected wild type and IFN-abR 2/2 mice, we show that IFN-ab is the key mediator of Ad-induced hypersensitivity to LPS. These findings indicate that, like endosomal TLR signaling in pDCs, TLR-independent virus recognition in splenic mDCs can also produce a robust early IFN-ab response, which is responsible for the bulk of IFN-ab production induced by adenovirus in vivo. The signaling requirements are different from known TLR-dependent or cytosolic IFN-ab induction mechanisms and suggest a novel cytosolic viral induction pathway.

Acyclovir is effective against herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus; ribavirin, recently introduced, is effective against respiratory syncytial virus; amantadine is effective against the influenza type A viruses. Anticytomegalovirus agents, antihuman immunodeficiency virus agents, and immunomodulators such as the interferons are under investigation. Older agents such as adenosine arabinoside and idoxuridine are being replaced by newer, more effective agents. It has taken us a long time to reach this point because rendering a virus inactive is a more formidable feat than killing a bacteria. Bacteria reproduce outside of human cells and have several unique features that distinguish them from human cells.

Specially, establishing whether invasive species operate within the constraint of conservative ecological niches, or if niche shifts occur at all commonly as part of the invasion process, is indispensable to identifying and anticipating potential areas of invasion. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) has been used to address such questions, but improvements and debate in study design, model evaluation, and methods are still needed to mature this field. We reanalyze data for Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), native to North America, but invasive in Europe. Our main finding was that, when the analysis extent is established carefully based on analogous sets of environmental conditions, all evidence of niche shifts disappears, suggesting that previous reports of niche shifts for this species are artifacts of methods and interpretation, rather than biological reality. Niche conservatism should be tested only within appropriate, similar, environmental spaces that are accessible to both species or populations being compared, thus avoiding model extrapolation related to model transfers. Testing for environmental similarity between native and invaded areas is critical to identifying niche shifts during species invasion robustly, but also in applications of ENM to understanding temporal dimensions of niche dynamics.

Control of its spread is typically attempted through biosecurity measures and extensive vaccination. However, the remarkable genetic and antigenic variability of the virus, which originate from both mutations and recombination events, represents an unsolved challenge for this disease. The present study reports on the emergence and spread of recombinant clusters detected in Italy and Spain between 2012 and 2014. A total of 36 Spanish and Italian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) field strains were investigated and genetically characterized using phylogenetic, molecular, recombination and selection pressure analyses of the complete S1 gene. Based on the partial S1 sequencing, 27 IBV strains originating from Spain and nine from Italy were initially classified as being closely related to the Guandong/Xindadi (XDN) genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene revealed that the XDN strains formed a homogeneous clade with the Spanish IBV isolates within the QX genotype, whereas there was higher variability within the Italian strains. Recombination analysis determined that these strains belonged to four groups, which originated from independent recombination events between the QX and 793B IBV genotypes. Our data support the hypothesis of two different scenarios: firstly, in Spain, the large and homogeneous clade probably originated from a single offspring of the recombinant founder, which became dominant and spread throughout the country. Secondly, the nine Italian recombinants, which are characterized by three different recombination patterns, probably represent less fitted strains, because they were less viable with respect to their recombinant parents.

In 2015, a multi-disciplinary team launched a community-wide intervention in the city of Curitiba to evaluate the acceptability, uptake and cost-effectiveness of multiple HIV testing services (HTS). The current study aims to evaluate HIV testing coverage among MSM after 6 months of intervention. Methods: A probabilistic sample of 3,272 men was selected in Curitiba. The sample was stratified by place of residence with higher selection probabilities in areas with greater MSM concentration. Questions about history of HIV testing, frequency of testing in the last 12 months, place and result of last test, as well as knowledge and acceptability of expanding HTS were made. Results: The proportion of MSM was 4.7%. In the total sample, HIV testing coverage at least once in lifetime was 46.0%; 22.9% in the last 6 months; and 15.6% between 7 and 12 months prior to the interview. Among MSM, the proportions were much higher: 79%; 43.1%; and 19.3% respectively. Approximately one third of MSM had already had an oral fluid test at 4 times higher proportion greater than the total sample (8.1%). However, most MSM (41.3%) tested for the last time in primary care services; 40.4% in private services; and only 8.3% used the other testing services provided by the project. The HIV prevalence among men who tested at least once in lifetime was 0.6% and among MSM was 3.8%, with a prevalence ratio greater than 6. The results indicate that the intervention to increase HIV diagnosis has substantially expanded MSM access to HIV testing after only 6 months of implementation. The target of testing 90% MSM in Curitiba is likely to be exceeded in less than 2 years. Follow-up of MSM testing via the web platform, and other service evaluations will inform program improvements for Curitiba and will facilitate expansion to larger Brazilian cities. Introduction: Though the percentage of HIV positive MSM is low among the registered cases in Armenia, taking into account the behavioral characteristics of MSM, the prevention of HIV among this group of population is a priority in Armenia. Prevention programs for MSM are delivered in four cities in Armenia, and MSM receive the full package of services: information on HIV, provision of condoms and lubricants, counseling and testing on HIV. Aim: To identify key behavioral characteristics due to which MSM acquire HIV, the level of knowledge on HIV and the prevalence of HIV. Methods: The study was done using RDS method in 2012 and 2014 among MSM in the capitol of Armenia-Yerevan. Behavioral and biological surveillance was conducted. 300 MSM answered to the questionnaire each year and the blood test on HIV antibodies was done. The knowledge was measured by the answers to the five key questions according to the WHO guidelines. Data were analyzed by RDSAT method. The study was conducted by National Center for AIDS Prevention according to the national guideline approved by the MoH of Armenia in 2010. : The prevalence of HIV among MSM was 2.6% in 2012 and 0.4% in 2014. Knowledge on HIV was 54.3% in 2012 and 78.9% in 2014. Indicator of condom use in last anal sex was 71.6% in 2012 and 65.3% in 2014. The percentage of MSM used condoms in the last sex with casual partners was 73.1% in 2012 and 87.4% in 2014. The percentage of MSM used condoms in the last one year was 36.7% in 2012 and 35.4% in 2014. Conclusion: The prevalence of HIV decreased in 2012-2014, there is an increase in knowledge on HIV, MSM still practice risky behavior. There is a need to continue the prevention programs focusing on transforming safe sexual behavior, increasing their self-esteem, helping them to change their attitude towards their health and making healthy, non-stigmatized environment, where MSM will feel free to express their problems and receive adequate solutions to them.", "output": "Poster presentations Risky behavior among MSM in Armenia Intensified case findings: a retrospective analysis among adult PLHIV TB results in Eggon LGA of Nasarawa state, Nigeria", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

For other virus families like the picornaviruses it is known that pathology is related to proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by viral proteinases. Furthermore, several studies indicate that virus proliferation can be arrested using specific proteinase inhibitors supporting the belief that proteinases are indeed important during infection. Prompted by this, we set out to analyse and predict cleavage by the coronavirus main proteinase using computational methods. We retrieved sequence data on seven fully sequenced coronaviruses and identified the main 3CL proteinase cleavage sites in polyproteins using alignments. A neural network was trained to recognise the cleavage sites in the genomes obtaining a sensitivity of 87.0% and a specificity of 99.0%. Several proteins known to be cleaved by other viruses were submitted to prediction as well as proteins suspected relevant in coronavirus pathology. Cleavage sites were predicted in proteins such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), transcription factors CREB-RP and OCT-1, and components of the ubiquitin pathway. Our prediction method NetCorona predicts coronavirus cleavage sites with high specificity and several potential cleavage candidates were identified which might be important to elucidate coronavirus pathology.

A total of 8696 parturients were enrolled, of whom 113 with prenatal positive HBeAg were invited back. The prevalence of HBsAg decreased over the study period, particularly in the vaccinated cohort, while there was no change in the prevalence of HBeAg. Foreign parturients had a higher HBeAg-positive rate and delayed HBeAg clearance, and those with a higher body mass index (>24 kg/m 2 ) had earlier HBeAg clearance (51.9% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.005). Only 30% of the subjects who were positive for HBeAg before birth became negative 5 years after delivery. In conclusion, the downward trend in HB infection with more significance among vaccinated parturients reflects effective prevention and the impact of universal HB immunization. Nonetheless, aggressive follow-up is necessary for parturients who are persistently positive for HBeAg postpartum, as well as developing different public health policies for foreign parturients from endemic areas.

To elucidate the evolution of MERS-CoV-related viruses and their interspecies transmission pathway, samples were collected from different mammals in China. A novel coronavirus related to MERS-CoV, Erinaceus amurensis hedgehog coronavirus HKU31 (Ea-HedCoV HKU31), was identified from two Amur hedgehogs. Genome analysis supported that Ea-HedCoV HKU31 represents a novel species under Merbecovirus, being most closely related to Erinaceus CoV from European hedgehogs in Germany, with 79.6% genome sequence identity. Compared to other members of Merbecovirus, Ea-HedCoV HKU31 possessed unique non-structural proteins and putative cleavage sites at ORF1ab. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Ea-HedCoV HKU31 and BetaCoV Erinaceus/VMC/DEU/2012 were closely related to NeoCoV and BatCoV PREDICT from African bats in the spike region, suggesting that the latter bat viruses have arisen from recombination between CoVs from hedgehogs and bats. The predicted HKU31 receptor-binding domain (RBD) possessed only one out of 12 critical amino acid residues for binding to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor. The structural modeling of the HKU31-RBD-hDPP4 binding interphase compared to that of MERS-CoV and Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) suggested that HKU31-RBD is unlikely to bind to hDPP4.

Swine influenza virus (SIV) may predispose to secondary infection. Haemophilus parasuis (Hps) can be a primary pathogen or be associated with other pathogens such as SIV. To date, little is known about the effect of coinfection with SIV and Hps on the disease severity and inflammatory response and the role of Hps in the induction of pneumonia in the absence of other respiratory pathogens. In the study we investigated the influence of SIV and Hps coinfection on clinical course, inflammatory response, pathogens shedding and load at various time points following intranasal inoculation. The correlation between local concentration of cytokines and severity of disease as well as serum acute phase proteins (APP) concentration has been also studied. Results: All co-infected pigs had fever, while in single inoculated pigs fever was observed only in part of animals. Necropsy revealed lesions in the lungs all SIV-inoculated and co-inoculated pigs, while in Hps-single inoculated animals only 1 out of 11 pigs revealed gross lung lesions. The SIV shedding was the highest in co-inoculated pigs. There were no differences between Hps-single inoculated and co-inoculated groups with regard to Hps shedding. The significant increase in Hps titre in the lung has been found only in co-inoculated group. All APP increased after co-infection. In single-inoculated animals various kinetics of APP response has been observed. The lung concentrations of cytokines were induced mostly in SIV + Hps pigs in the apical and middle lobe. These results correlated well with localization of gross lung lesions. Conclusions: The results revealed that SIV increased the severity of lung lesions and facilitated Hps (PIWetHps192/ 2015) replication in the porcine lung. Furthermore, Hps influenced the SIV nasal shedding. Enhanced Hps and SIV replication, together with stronger systemic and local inflammatory response contributed to a more severe clinical signs and stronger, earlier immune response in co-inoculated animals.

To examine whether receptor-ligand interactions can occur intracellularly, we have constructed fusion proteins that anchor v-sis to specific intracellular membranes. Fusion of a cis-Golgi retention signal from a coronavirus E1 glycoprotein to v-sis protein completely abolished its transforming ability when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Fusion proteins incorporating mutations in this retention signal were not retained within the Golgi complex but instead were transported to the cell surface, resulting in efficient transformation. All chimeric proteins were shown to dimerize properly. Derivatives of some of these constructs were also constructed bearing the cytoplasmic tail from the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). These constructs allowed examination of subcellular localization by double-label immunofluorescence, using antibodies that distinguish between the extraceUular PDGF-related domain and the VSV-G cytoplasmic tail. Colocalization of sis-E1-G with Golgi markers confirmed its targeting to the early Golgi complex. The sis-E1 constructs, targeted to the early Golgi complex, exhibited no proteo-lyric processing whereas the mutant forms of sis-E1 exhibited normal proteolytic processing. Treatment with suramin, a polyanionic compound that disrupts ligand/receptor interactions at the cell surface, was able to revert the transformed phenotype induced by the mutant sis-E1 constructs described here.

Its health status is threatened by numerous 44 factors including habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and high parasite and pathogen loads [2-45 4]. Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota of adult honey bees plays a 46 critical role for bee health [5]. The bee microbiota converts dietary compounds [6, 7] and 47 produces short chain fatty acids [8] in the gut, enhances sucrose responsiveness of the host 48 [8], and stimulates the immune system [9, 10]. Moreover, disruption of the gut microbiota 49 composition by antibiotic treatment, pesticide exposure, or dietary manipulations has 50 been associated with increased pathogen loads resulting in increased host mortality [11-51 14]. 52 A striking feature of the honey bee gut microbiota is its low taxonomic complexity. In 53 worker bees, the community is dominated by less than ten phylotypes (i.e. clusters of 54 strains sharing \u226597% sequence identity in the 16S rRNA gene), which typically make up 55 >95% of the bacterial cells in the gut [5, 15-18]. These phylotypes have been consistently 56 detected in honey bees, regardless of geographic location, life stage, or season [16, 19, 20], 57 and are acquired horizontally through contact with nest mates and hive components [21]. 58 They include five core phylotypes (Gilliamella, Snodgrassella, Lactobacillus Firm-4 and 59 Firm-5, and Bifidobacterium), which are typically present in every adult worker bee, and a 60 number of non-core phylotypes, e.g. Frischella, Bartonella, Commensalibacter, or 61 Bombella, which are prevalent across colonies, but not necessarily present in every bee 62 [22]. Additional phylotypes have been detected, including Lactobacillus kunkeii, Serratia Page 4 of 44 marcescens and other Enterobacteriaceae, or Apibacter, but they typically account for a 64 relatively small proportion of the bee gut microbiota [23]. 65 While many of these phylotypes are consistently present in adult worker bees, their 66 abundance can vary across bees, and may differentially impact the host physiology. 67 Particularly, the type and amount of nutrients (i.e. pollen and nectar) available during the 68 foraging season can have profound effects on the composition of the gut microbiota and 69 may alter its metabolic activity [24]. Likewise, distinct dietary habits or variation in lifespan 70 of worker bees during summer and winter may influence gut microbiota composition. From 71 spring to autumn, young worker bees (nurses) stay inside the hive to take care of larvae, 72 and feed on nutrient-rich pollen, whereas older worker bees become foragers that feed on 73 nectar and honey to fuel their energy-expensive flights [25]. In late autumn, newly emerged 74 adult worker bees become winter bees (also called 'diutinus') that have an extended 75 lifespan (~6 months) and that ensure the colony survival during the cold winter season in 76 the absence of brood [26]. These bees form a tight cluster for thermoregulation inside the 77 hive, feed strictly on food stores (pollen, beebread, and honey) and retain their feces all 78 winter [27], which is likely to impact the ecology of their gut microbiota. 79 A number of studies have looked at the gut microbiota composition of different worker bee 80 types or throughout seasons, with the overall conclusion that the community composition 81 is relatively stable [19, 28-31]. However, previous studies were mostly based on 82 comparative analyses of relative community member abundance using 16S rRNA amplicon 83 sequencing. Such analysis cannot provide insights about the extent or directionality of 84 changes in taxa abundance, especially if microbial loads vary substantially between 85 samples [32].

The synthesis of genomic RNA and all eight subgenomic mRNAs was faithfully reproduced by the RTC in this in vitro system. Mainly positive-strand RNAs were synthesized and protein synthesis was not required for RTC activity in vitro. All RTC activity, enzymatic and putative membrane-spanning nsps, and viral RNA cosedimented with heavy membrane structures. Furthermore, the pelleted RTC required the addition of a cytoplasmic host factor for reconstitution of its in vitro activity. Newly synthesized subgenomic RNA appeared to be released, while genomic RNA remained predominantly associated with the RTC-containing fraction. RTC activity was destroyed by detergent treatment, suggesting an important role for membranes. The RTC appeared to be protected by membranes, as newly synthesized viral RNA and several replicase/transcriptase subunits were protease-and nucleaseresistant and became susceptible to degradation only upon addition of a non-ionic detergent.

There are still many unknowns on the implication of cellular factors that regulate the entry process. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using as bait the carboxy-terminal endodomain of S, which faces the cytosol during and after opening of the fusion pore at early stages of the virus life cycle. Here we show that the ezrin membrane-actin linker interacts with S endodomain through the F1 lobe of its FERM domain and that both the eight carboxy-terminal amino-acids and a membrane-proximal cysteine cluster of S endodomain are important for this interaction in vitro. Interestingly, we found that ezrin is present at the site of entry of S-pseudotyped lentiviral particles in Vero E6 cells. Targeting ezrin function by small interfering RNA increased S-mediated entry of pseudotyped particles in epithelial cells. Furthermore, deletion of the eight carboxy-terminal amino acids of S enhanced S-pseudotyped particles infection. Expression of the ezrin dominant negative FERM domain enhanced cell susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV and S-pseudotyped particles and potentiated S-dependent membrane fusion. Conclusions/Significance: Ezrin interacts with SARS-CoV S endodomain and limits virus entry and fusion.

Moreover, ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs effectively self-replicated in rhabdomyosarcoma/muscle, glioblastoma/astrocytoma, and retinal pigmented epithelial cells, displaying unique cell susceptibility with differential attachment activity.

ED management is largely empiric, often occurring without reliable diagnostics needed for targeted therapies, safe outpatient discharge, or hospital admissions. Objective: To evaluate the impact of the influenza diagnosis on physician decision making during ED visits using the Cobas Liat \u00ae influenza A + B assay. Study design: Prospective study assessing the impact of rapid (< 30 min), reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) influenza testing on physician decision making in the ED. Physician responses established preand post-diagnosis management courses which required confirmation via secondary documentation in the medical record. Changes in physician decision making were analyzed across four clinical touchpoints: (i) admission/discharge status, (ii) medical procedures, (iii) antiviral and antibiotic prescribing, and (iv) laboratory studies. Results: An influenza diagnosis changed patient management courses, relative to empiric, pre-diagnosis plans, in in 61% of the cases resulting in cost savings of $49,420-to-$42,270 over 143 patients and 104 days during influenza season resulting in a cost savings of $200.40/ED visit. Evaluation over 2000 ED patient visits projects cost savings > $578,000 due to deferred admissions, and reduction in antiviral prescribing. Sensitivity of EDbased influenza testing using the Cobas Liat \u00ae assay was equivalent to centralized lab testing at 98.8% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity respectively.

To determine the localization of virus-specific RNA, serial sections of brains from infected and uninfected mice were annealed with a %-labeled antisense RNA probe and analyzed by film autoradiography. In the mice with acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA was present in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and thalamus. Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain.

Since 2012, the victims have mainly come from the Middle East countries or sporadically from some other geographical regions seeded by the travelers who visited the Middle East. Such an introduction through travelling led to the emergence of a MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea in May 2015, which caused more than 140 confirmed human cases in less than a month. Using 70 complete genome sequences of MERS-CoV isolates, including the most recent sequences for the Korean and Chinese isolates, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the complete genome and the individual protein coding regions. The Korean MERS-CoV strain clustered in the previously established Hafr-Al-Batin-1_2013 clade together with two Saudi Arabian and one Chinese strain sampled in 2015. Although these four strains remained monophyletic in the entire protein-coding region, this clade showed different phylogenetic relationships across the genome, indicating a shared unique recombination pattern that is different from previously reported putative recombination strains. Our findings suggest that the recent ancestor of the Korean and its related MERS-CoV strains is characterized by unique mosaic genome pattern that is different from other putative recombinants.

To further elucidate specific interactions between human respiratory viruses and important host factors in the airway epithelium, it is important to make hAEC cultures amenable to genetic modification.

In the current study, we show that the incorporation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632) during cell propagation extends the life span of primary human cells in vitro and thereby facilitates the incorporation of lentivirus-based expression systems. Using fluorescent reporters for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based sorting, we generated homogenously fluorescent hAEC cultures that differentiate normally after lentiviral transduction.

Two of the tested compounds showed dose-dependent inhibition of dengue virus serotype 2 in the low and sub micromolar range. The compounds 1 and 2 were also able to impair the accumulation of the viral envelope glycoprotein in infected cells, while showing no sign of direct virucidal activity and acting possibly through a mechanism involving the early stages of the infection.

Quinolines are heterocyclic molecules composed of fused benzene and pyridine rings. The quinolines and their derivatives have shown a wide range of biological activities, including antiproliferative [8], antiviral [9], antibacterial [10], antifungal [11], anti-inflammatory [12], and antiparasitic [13]. Members of the quinoline family, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have shown antiviral activity against several viruses, such as coronaviruses [9], human immunodeficiency virus [14], and respiratory syncytial virus [15]. Concerning Flavivirus, quinoline derivatives have proved active against the Hepatitis C virus [16], West Nile virus [17,18], Japanese Encephalitis virus [19], Zika virus [20], and dengue virus [21]. Since the quinoline scaffold has shown high potential for the development of new molecules with antiviral activity, we decided to synthesize and test several quinoline derivatives and related compounds. Here we describe the synthesis, screening, and characterization of antiviral activity of two novel quinoline derivatives against the dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) in vitro. Quinoline compounds have shown potential as new scaffolds for the development of drugs with pharmacological activities against various human pathogens, including viruses. In order to investigate the possible antiviral potential of several new quinoline derivatives, we synthesized a number of derivative compounds and tested their ability to impair infection by DENV2 in a medium-throughput assay based on cellular ATP detection.

Using the TMEDA-catalyzed reaction, 2-alkylated quinolines 4 and 5 were isolated in 54 and 79% yields, respectively.

ARFs have several important functions, including the recruitment of coat proteins that promote sorting of cargo into vesicles, the recruitment and activation of enzymes, such as the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) kinases, that alter membrane lipid composition, and interaction with cytoskeletal factors (TABLE 1) . There are six mammalian ARF proteins that can be divided into three classes based on sequence homology: Class I (ARF1, ARF2 and ARF3), Class II (ARF4 and ARF5) and Class III (ARF6) (FIG. 1) . The Class II ARFs arose late in animal cell evolution, possibly in metazoans, but Class I ARFs are highly conserved and are present in all eukaryotes examined to date. Hence, in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, each class has a single ARF orthologue, but yeast lacks the Class II ARFs. Plants have Class I ARFs, and potentiall y also Class III ARFs (BOX 1). In addition, there are over 20 ARF-like (ARL) proteins, which seem to have broader roles than ARFs. Some ARL proteins, including ARL1, ARL2 and ARF-related protein 1 (ARFRP1), are ancient and have homologues in plants, yeast and metazoans, whereas others, such as ARL11, arose later in evolution and are present only in vertebrates 2 . SAR1, which is present in all eukaryotes examined to date, is also considered to be a member of the ARF family, owing to the presence of an aminotermina l amphipathic helix and the functional similarit y of this protein to ARF1 in recruiting a coat complex durin g vesicle budding. The study of ARF protein function was aided greatly by the early discovery of the regulators of ARF GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis. The ARF guanine nucleotid e exchange factors (GEFs) contain a conserved SEC7 domain that catalyses GDP release from, and GTP binding to, their substrate ARFs. The GTPase -activating proteins (GAPs) catalyse the hydrolysis of GTP-bound ARFs and are critically important because ARFs have negligible intrinsic GTP-hydrolysis activity. ARF GAPs contain a conserved zinc-finger GAP catalytic domain. The conserved, signature catalytic domains in the GEFs and GAPs are what facilitated the identification of these ARF regulators in all organisms from yeast to man. However, the ARF substrate specificity for these GEFs and GAPs remains unclear, and whether they also work on ARL proteins has yet to be determined. In the past, G protein activity was viewed as a linear signalling pathway, with the GDP-bound form being inactive and the GTP-bound form initiating effector functions until it returned to the inactive, GDP-bound state. The GEFs and GAPs were thought of as 'activators' and 'in activators' , respectively, that controlled this on-off switch (FIG. 1c) . However, work on ARF and ARL proteins over the past decade has revealed that their Abstract | Members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of guanine-nucleotidebindin g (G) proteins, including the ARF-like (ARL) proteins and SAR1, regulate membrane traffic and organelle structure by recruiting cargo-sorting coat proteins, modulating membrane lipid composition, and interacting with regulators of other G proteins. New roles of ARF and ARL proteins are emerging, including novel functions at the Golgi complex and in cilia formation. Their function is under tight spatial control, which is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that catalyse GTP exchange and hydrolysis, respectively. Important advances are being gained in our understanding of the functional networks that are formed not only by the GEFs and GAPs themselves but also by the inactive forms of the ARF proteins. www.nature.com/reviews/molcellbio", "output": "ARF family G proteins and their regulators: roles in membrane transport, development and disease", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Among more than 43 AKAP isoforms, AKAP7 appears to be unique in its homology to viral 2=,5=-PDEs. Here we show that mouse AKAP7 rapidly degrades 2-5A with kinetics similar to that of murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]) strain A59 ns2 and human rotavirus strain WA VP3 proteins. To determine whether AKAP7 could substitute for a viral 2=,5=-PDE, we inserted AKAP7 cDNA into an MHV genome with an inactivated ns2 gene. The AKAP7 PDE domain or N-terminally truncated AKAP7 (both lacking a nuclear localization motif), but not full-length AKAP7 or a mutant, AKAP7 H185R , PDE domain restored the infectivity of ns2 mutant MHV in bone marrow macrophages and in livers of infected mice. Interestingly, the AKAP7 PDE domain and N-terminally deleted AKAP7 were present in the cytoplasm (the site of MHV replication), whereas full-length AKAP7 was observed only in nuclei. We suggest the possibility that viral acquisition of the host AKAP7 PDE domain might have occurred during evolution, allowing diverse RNA viruses to antagonize the RNase L pathway. We also reported that the rotavirus VP3 C-terminal domain (VP3-CTD) cleaves 2-5A and that it may rescue ns2 mutant MHV. Here we report that a cellular protein, AKAP7, has an analogous 2=,5=-phosphodiesterase (2=,5=-PDE) domain that is able to restore the growth of chimeric MHV expressing inactive ns2.

A feline calicivirus (FCV) titre was 1:320 and the initial clinical signs and laboratory findings were attributed to a coinfection with FPV and FCV. The cat was treated with interferon omega.

Eliminating Sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation leads to persistent Cdc12 clustering, which prevents CR assembly in the absence of anillin-like Mid1 and causes CRs to collapse when cytokinesis is delayed.

In contrast, the epidemiology of \u03b4-CoVs in wild birds in the US is largely unknown. Our aim was to comparatively assess the prevalence of \u03b4and \u03b3-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin. A total of 1236 cloacal/fecal swabs collected during the period 2015-2018 were tested for \u03b3and \u03b4-CoVs using genus-specific reverse transcription-PCR assays. A total of 61 (4.99%) samples were \u03b3-CoV positive, with up to 29 positive samples per state. In contrast, only 14 samples were positive for \u03b4-CoV (1.14%) with only 1-4 originating from the same state. Thus, unlike previous reports from Asia, \u03b3-CoVs are more prevalent than \u03b4-CoVs in the US, suggesting that \u03b4-CoVs may spread in birds with lower efficiency. This may indicate \u03b4-CoV emerging status and incomplete adaptation to new host species limiting its spread. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial N gene revealed that the newly identified \u03b4-CoV strains were most closely related to the HKU20 (wigeon) strain. Further studies are necessary to investigate the role of aquatic bird \u03b4-CoVs in the epidemiology of \u03b4-CoVs in swine and terrestrial birds. Viruses 2019, 11, 897 2 of 11 and mammals including pigs [4] . Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) emerged in the US in 2014 as a new enteropathogenic CoV causing diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in economic losses to the swine industry [4, 5] . Its origin is unknown, but it is hypothesized that it may have spilled over from an avian host. \u03b4-CoV and \u03b3-CoV are co-circulating in wild avian species, but their epidemiology (prevalence and diversity) differ [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In a screening study of 918 wild Australian birds, 141 of them tested positive for CoVs. After sequencing, \u03b4-CoV was detected in pacific black ducks, curlew sandpiper, red-necked stints, ruddy turnstones, and pied herons [6] . However, \u03b3-CoV (80% of sequenced samples) was identified more frequently than \u03b4-CoV (20% of sequenced samples) [6] . \u03b3-CoV was also detected in quails and pheasants in Italy [7] . RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) analyses found that quail were also infected with \u03b4-CoV [7]. Wild birds harbor genetically diverse \u03b4-CoV with some of them potentially transmittable to pigs [8] . A previous report from Brazil showed that \u03b4-CoVs were detected in two species of wild terrestrial birds, purple-breasted-parrot and plain parakeet. These avian CoVs were monophyletically related to CoVs from Sparrow (SPaCoV HKU19) and swine (PorCoV HKU15), which were also found to be \u03b4-CoV. This information supports the hypothesis that \u03b4-CoV can cross inter-species barriers, with the potential to transmit from birds to swine [8] . Previous studies of CoVs in Hong Kong reported three novel CoVs in bulbuls (BuCoV HKU11), thrushes (ThCoV HKU12) and munias (MuCoV HKU13), which were hypothesized to belong to the novel genus \u03b4-CoV [9]. These three novel \u03b4-CoVs clustered with a \u03b4-CoV detected in Asian leopard cats [10]; however, further studies are necessary to understand interspecies transmission from birds [9]. In a surveillance study in Hong Kong and Cambodia, \u03b4-CoVs were found in different wild aquatic birds: gray herons, pond herons, great cormorants, black-faced spoonbills, and several duck species [11] . \u03b4-CoVs do not cause severe illness in birds, leading to their endemic nature in the avian population [11] . In a screening study for \u03b4-CoVs in China, none were found in Asian leopard cats, bats, domestic cats, cattle, chickens, dogs, humans, monkeys, and rodents [12] . The investigators discovered seven novel \u03b4-CoVs in pigs and wild birds (white-eye, sparrow, magpie robin, night heron, wigeon, and common moorhen) [12] . Genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis showed that avian and swine \u03b4-CoVs had similar genome characteristics and structures [12] . Similarly, a recent study in the US described a novel sparrow \u03b4-CoV that clustered together with PDCoV [13] and other terrestrial, but aquatic bird \u03b4-CoVs. In Brazil, screening revealed the presence of CoVs in vinaceous-breasted amazon and plain parakeet, that were closely related to \u03b4-CoVs from birds (SpaCoV HKU17) and swine (PorCoV). This emphasizes the increased risk for direct interspecies transmission and that in contrast to waterfowl, terrestrial birds may act as intermediate hosts and are commonly found in the sites of bird-swine co-mingling [8]. In Finland, two different avian \u03b4-CoV strains from lesser black-backed gull and black-headed gull were detected which shared 83% and 85% nucleotide identity with avian and mammalian \u03b4-CoVs, respectively [14] . In summary, recently identified \u03b4-CoVs are emerging globally that possess high genetic and antigenic plasticity. Porcine \u03b4-CoV is being studied extensively in the US and elsewhere [4, 5] . In contrast, the diversity and epidemiology of \u03b4-CoVs in wild birds in the US are largely unknown. The association of porcine \u03b4-CoV with enteric disease in pigs and its continuous spread underscore an urgent need to further investigate the mechanisms of its persistence and spread. Extensive epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate \u03b4-CoV prevalence in avian species, swine farms, pig-bird comingling sites and high pig-traffic sites such as abattoirs, assembly yards and truck washes. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of \u03b4and \u03b3-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.

This is an important topic given the key role of the housing sector in tackling both air pollution and climate change. Although the methods used are relatively simplistic, they are appropriate for analyses performed at the scale presented in the paper. The findings and conclusions are well supported by the results. I would therefore support publication. However, I believe the manuscript would benefit from a stronger statement of the aims of the work and some clarifications regarding the methods (see below). My main concern relates to the assumption made by the authors that indoor-generated PM2.5 is equally as harmful to health as outdoor-generated PM2.5. There is little evidence to support this (though it is quite a commonly made assumption). I would like to see some form of sensitivity analysis in relation to this assumption, since it may have an impact on the final results (though probably not on the ultimate conclusions). More detailed comments can be found below. I consider the suggested revisions to be relatively minor. 1. Is the question posed original, important and well defined? The research question posed by the paper is important and I believe the methods used are appropriate to answer it. However, the aims of the paper are not currently well stated (in both the main text and in the abstract). The main statement of the aims comes towards the end of page 5, which states \"This work aims to summarize the current understanding of the sources of health risks in indoor environments and their relationship to ventilation requirements\". This doesn't really capture what the authors have actually done. There is a slightly better statement of the aims hidden in the Methods (top of page 7) but even this doesn't quite feel sufficient. 2. Are the data sound and well controlled? Yes, although the source of some of the input data can be made clearer in the text, especially in relation to Table 2 (see below) . 3. Is the interpretation (discussion and conclusion) well balanced and supported by the data? Yes. 4. Are the methods appropriate and well described, and are sufficient details provided to allow others to evaluate and/or replicate the work? The methods are generally well described. However, I have a few specific issues (see the additional comments below). The methods are based on relatively simplistic tools (both the mass-balance exposure model and the risk/health impact model). However, I think they are appropriate for the type of analysis presented in the paper. My main concern relates to the assumption of equal health risk associated with both outdoor-and indoor-generated PM2.5. The authors discuss this briefly in the Discussion section but this assumption is highly uncertain since almost all of the published epidemiology is based on outdoor PM2.5. The paper would benefit from greater emphasis on the sensitivity of the results to this assumption. Perhaps, the analysis (or part of it) could be repeated without the effects of indoorgenerated PM2.5 or with a reduced exposure-response coefficient? 6. Can the writing, organization, tables and figures be improved? Although the manuscript is generally well written, there are reoccurring problems, most importantly missing articles throughout the paper (e.g. a, the). For instance, in the abstract, \"Based on measurements of the European Environment Agency (EEA),\u2026\" and \"A framework for developing European health-based ventilation guidelines\u2026\" would be preferable.

I don't think this is too much of a problem but I do think a clear statement of what the authors mean by optimization would be helpful (e.g. in the Methods).

This analysis is very popular in the domains of urban governance, transportation engineering, logistics and geospatial information services for individuals or industrials. Importantly, data models of moving objects are one of the most crucial approaches to support the analysis for dynamic relative motion between moving objects, even in the age of big data and cloud computing. Traditional geographic information systems (GIS) usually organize moving objects as point objects in absolute coordinated space. The derivation of relative motions among moving objects is not efficient because of the additional geo-computation of transformation between absolute space and relative space. Therefore, current GISs require an innovative approach to directly store, analyze and interpret the relative relationships of moving objects to support their efficient analysis. This paper proposes a relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects (RSMO) to construct, operate and analyze moving objects' relationships and introduces two algorithms (relationship querying and relative relationship dynamic pattern matching) to derive and analyze the dynamic relationships of moving objects. Three scenarios (epidemic spreading, tracker finding, and motion-trend derivation of nearby crowds) are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model. The experimental results indicates the execution times of the proposed model are approximately 5-50% those of the absolute GIS method for the same function of these three scenarios. It's better computational performance of the proposed model when analyzing the relative relationships of moving objects than the absolute methods in a famous commercial GIS software based on this experimental results. The proposed approach fills the gap of traditional GIS and shows promise for relative space-based geo-computation, analysis and service.", "output": "ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Relative space-based GIS data model to analyze the group dynamics of moving objects", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Pathological and neuroimaging studies have confirmed that brain atrophy in alcoholics is mainly due to widespread white matter (WM) loss with neuronal loss restricted to specific regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies of cigarette smokers also suggest that chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke leads to brain atrophy, although the neurotoxic component is unknown. As a high proportion of chronic alcoholics also smoke cigarettes it has been hypothesized that at least some alcohol-related brain damage is due to tobacco smoke exposure. Methods: 39 Long Evans rats were subjected to 8 weeks exposure to alcohol and/or 5 weeks coexposure to nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK), a proxy for tobacco smoke. Their frontal WM was then assayed with transmission electron microscopy. Results: NNK and ethanol co-exposure had a synergistic effect in decreasing myelinated fibre density. Furthermore, NNK treatment led to a greater reduction in myelin sheath thickness than ethanol whereas only the ethanol-treated animals showed a decrease in unmyelinated fibre density. Conclusion: These data suggest that NNK causes WM degeneration, an effect that is exacerbated by alcohol, but unlike alcohol, it has little impact on the neuronal components of the brain.", "output": "The Differential Effects of Alcohol and Nicotine- Specific Nitrosamine Ketone on White Matter Ultrastructure", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Treatment with binase was shown to improve survival of laboratory animals infected with different RNA viruses. Although binase reduced IAV titer in vitro and in vivo, the mode of action (MOA) of binase against IAV at the molecular level has yet not been studied in depth and remains elusive. Methods: To analyze whether binase impairs virus replication by direct interaction with the viral particle we applied a hemagglutination inhibition assay and monitored the integrity of the viral RNA within the virus particle by RT-PCR. Furthermore, we used Western blot and confocal microscopy analysis to study whether binase can internalize into MDCK-II cells. By primer extension we examined the effect of binase on the integrity of viral RNAs within the cells and using a mini-genome system we explored the effect of binase on the viral expression. Results: We show that (i) binase does not to attack IAV particle-protected viral RNA, (ii) internalized binase could be detected within the cytosol of MDCK-II cells and that (iii) binase impairs IAV replication by specifically degrading viral RNA species within the infected MDCK-II cells without obvious effect on cellular mRNAs.

Although the initial step of CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus was determined to involve an A226V amino acid substitution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein that first arose in 2005, little attention has been paid to subsequent CHIKV evolution after this adaptive mutation was convergently selected in several geographic locations. To determine whether selection of second-step adaptive mutations in CHIKV or other arthropod-borne viruses occurs in nature, we tested the effect of an additional envelope glycoprotein amino acid change identified in Kerala, India in 2009. This substitution, E2-L210Q, caused a significant increase in the ability of CHIKV to develop a disseminated infection in A. albopictus, but had no effect on CHIKV fitness in the alternative mosquito vector, A. aegypti, or in vertebrate cell lines. Using infectious viruses or virus-like replicon particles expressing the E2-210Q and E2-210L residues, we determined that E2-L210Q acts primarily at the level of infection of A. albopictus midgut epithelial cells. In addition, we observed that the initial adaptive substitution, E1-A226V, had a significantly stronger effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus than E2-L210Q, thus explaining the observed time differences required for selective sweeps of these mutations in nature. These results indicate that the continuous CHIKV circulation in an A. albopictus-human cycle since 2005 has resulted in the selection of an additional, second-step mutation that may facilitate even more efficient virus circulation and persistence in endemic areas, further increasing the risk of more severe and expanded CHIK epidemics.", "output": "Sequential Adaptive Mutations Enhance Efficient Vector Switching by Chikungunya Virus and Its Epidemic Emergence", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

As history helps to demonstrate, this catastrophe and its reverberations could in today's world create a scene not unlike that depicted in the Book of Revelation, when the pale horse and its rider Death sow destruction \"with sword and with famine and with pestilence.\" To protect our own interests and security, it is imperative that the United States take preventive actions against a potential pandemic. This article argues that one important area for mitigation is climate change interacting with the growing urbanization of the world's population. These two factors combined promise massive shocks to global security, and because of the destructive potential, it is critical that U.S. national-security professionals consider this worst-case future when developing policies and strategies. If a large-scale pandemic does occur, as many scientists believe possible, are we prepared to handle it? Have we taken the actions necessary to mitigate the worst-case outcome? This article also argues that a lead actor in prevention efforts should be the U.S. military, which has the reach and resources that others do not.

However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Dia gnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

Objectives: To assess the proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) attributable to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and picornavirus infection during the winter season. To compare the influenza PCR data with serology of paired blood samples. Study design: Combined nose and throat swabs, from patients with ILI attending 15 general practices across Scotland, were submitted to the laboratory in virus PCR sample solution (VPSS). The extracted nucleic acid was tested using a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Serological analysis was performed on paired serum samples using complement fixation assays. The rate of influenza virus positivity was compared with reports of ILI obtained from the SSGP network. Results: Of 240 samples received at the laboratory, 132 (55%) were PCR positive for influenza A virus. There were nine (3.8%) picornavirus and three (1.2%) RSV PCR positives, two (0.8%) were dual influenza A/picornavirus infections. Ninety four (39.2%) were negative for all viruses tested. Results on paired sera from 89 patients showed a rising titre to influenza A in 48 of the 57 PCR positive samples (84.2%). One PCR negative patient displayed a significant rising titre to influenza A. Virological data paralleled the SSGP data but was available at least a week earlier. Conclusions: Influenza A infection was detected in the majority of patients with ILI; picornavirus infection was also shown to be an important cause of illness. PCR is a rapid and sensitive method for respiratory virus surveillance.

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is characterized by cervical lymphadenopathy occurring in young adults. Neurologic involvement is rare, and testitis directly caused by Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease has not yet been reported. Case presentation: A 19-year-old man was brought to our clinic with complaints of fever, headache, fatigue, and left lower quadrant pain that had persisted for 3 weeks. On physical examination, painful cervical lymphadenopathies were observed. Meningitis was suspected based on a cerebrospinal fluid examination, and leftsided orchitis was diagnosed based on findings from magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography. However, neither antibiotics nor antiviral drugs were effective in treating the patient's symptoms. On the 20 th day of hospitalization, the patient experienced a loss of consciousness, and brain T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed asymmetrical, high-signal intensities in both basal nuclei and the left temporal lobe. Encephalitis was suspected, and the patient was treated with intravenous prednisolone pulse therapy (1 g/day) for 3 days and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for 5 days. A left cervical lymph node biopsy showed apoptotic necrosis in paracortical and cortical areas with an abundance of macrophages and large lymphoid cells, which had irregular nuclei suggestive of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease; the pathological findings from a brain biopsy were the same as those of the cervical lymph node biopsy. The encephalitis and cervical lymphadenopathies followed a benign course, as did the testitis.

However, subjective sensation of nasal patency may be more associated with activation of cold receptors by inspired air than with respiratory effort. Objective-To investigate whether subjective nasal patency correlates with nasal mucosal temperature in healthy subjects. Design, Setting, and Participants-Twenty-two healthy adults were recruited for this study. Subjects first completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and a unilateral visual analog scale (VAS) to quantify subjective nasal patency. A miniaturized thermocouple sensor was then used to record nasal mucosal temperature bilaterally in two locations along the nasal septum: at the vestibule and across from the inferior turbinate head. Results-The range of temperature oscillations during the breathing cycle, defined as the difference between end-expiratory and end-inspiratory temperatures, was greater during deep breaths (\u0394T exp-insp = 6.2 \u00b1 2.6\u00b0C) than during resting breathing (\u0394T exp-insp = 4.2 \u00b1 2.3\u00b0C) in both locations (p < 10 \u221213 ). Mucosal temperature measured at the right vestibule had a statistically significant correlation with both right-side VAS score (Pearson r = \u22120.55, p=0.0076) and NOSE score (Pearson r = \u22120.47, p=0.028). No other statistically significant correlations were found between mucosal temperature and subjective nasal patency scores. Nasal mucosal temperature was lower in the first cavity to be measured, which was the right cavity in all subjects. Conclusions and Relevance-The greater mucosal temperature oscillations during deep breathing is consistent with the common experience that airflow sensation is enhanced during deep breaths, thus supporting the hypothesis that mucosal cooling plays a central role in nasal airflow sensation. A possible correlation was found between subjective nasal patency scores and nasal mucosal temperature, but our results were inconsistent. The higher temperature in the left cavity suggests that the sensor irritated the nasal mucosa, affecting the correlation between patency scores and mucosal temperature. Future studies should consider non-contact temperature sensors to prevent mucosa irritation.

Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are more susceptible to get severe forms of VRI due to their altered lung mechanics, leading to several complications, such as increased hospital stay, longer mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. This study aimed to identify the frequency of VRI in children with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery, and to compare the major outcomes according to the presence or absence of a VRI. Methods: This was a longitudinal, observational cohort study. Nasopharyngeal secretion samples were collected pre-and postoperatively for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, from May 2013 to May 2014. Respiratory viruses were detected using CLART Pneumovir\u00ae. Results: Forty-eight patients were enrolled.

The purpose of this study was to determine the infective aetiology in patients who presented to primary care doctors with acute respiratory symptoms. Methods. A prospective study was carried out in all nine primary care clinics belonging to the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGPs) in Singapore. The subjects comprised 594 consecutive patients (318 males, 276 females) aged \u044321 years who presented with complaints of any one of cough, nasal or throat symptoms of \u03fd7 days duration. Data collection was through interview using structured questionnaire, physical examination, throat swabs for bacterial culture and nasal swabs for virus identification by immunofluorescence (IF) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Additional PCR was performed on a subsample of 100 patients. Patients were followed-up until resolution of symptoms. Results. The aetiological diagnosis by infective agent is as follows: 150 patients (25.2%) had virus infections, of which 90.7% (136/150) were by rhinovirus. Fourteen patients (2.4%) had bacterial infections, of which 10 were due to group G streptococcus. Group A streptococcus was not detected. Nineteen patients with new pathogens were identified by further PCR. These included parainfluenza 4, human coronavirus OC43, adenovirus, enterovirus and Chlamydia pneumoniae. No pathogen could be identified in 49% of patients. There were no differences in clinical presentation and socio-demographic variables between patients who had viral infections and those in whom no pathogen could be identified.

RI panels are popular because of their long-term genetic stability, which enhances reproducibility and integration of data collected across time and conditions. Characterization of their genomes can be a community effort, reducing the burden on individual users. Here we present the genomes of the CC strains using two complementary approaches as a resource to improve power and interpretation of genetic experiments. Our study also provides a cautionary tale regarding the limitations imposed by such basic biological processes as mutation and selection. A distinct advantage of inbred panels is that genotyping only needs to be performed on the panel, not on each individual mouse. The initial CC genome data were haplotype reconstructions based on dense genotyping of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of each strain followed by imputation from the genome sequence of the corresponding founder inbred strain. The MRCA resource captured segregating regions in strains that were not fully inbred, but it had limited resolution in the transition regions between founder haplotypes, and there was uncertainty about founder assignment in regions of limited diversity. Here we report the whole genome sequence of 69 CC strains generated by paired-end short reads at 303 coverage of a single male per strain. Sequencing leads to a substantial improvement in the fine structure and completeness of the genomes of the CC. Both MRCAs and sequenced samples show a significant reduction in the genome-wide haplotype frequencies from two wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ. In addition, analysis of the evolution of the patterns of heterozygosity indicates that selection against three wild-derived founder strains played a significant role in shaping the genomes of the CC. The sequencing resource provides the first description of tens of thousands of new genetic variants introduced by mutation and drift in the CC genomes. We estimate that new SNP mutations are accumulating in each CC strain at a rate of 2.4 6 0.4 per gigabase per generation. The fixation of new mutations by genetic drift has introduced thousands of new variants into the CC strains. The majority of these mutations are novel compared to currently sequenced laboratory stocks and wild mice, and some are predicted to alter gene function. Approximately one-third of the CC inbred strains have acquired large deletions (.10 kb) many of which overlap known coding genes and functional elements.

Protein histochemistry showed that both S1 N -M41 and S1 N -SCZJ3 could bind to lung and kidney, and that recombinant S1 N -SCZJ3 displayed a distinctive staining pattern in the proventriculus. Recombinant S1 N -SCZJ3 was then employed to purify binding-associated proteins in lung, kidney, and proventriculus. Using an affinity chromatography assay, two common bands of about 60 kDa and 70 kDa were obtained from the total tissue proteins. These protein bands were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Finally, infection of chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells by SCZJ3 was found to be inhibited by anti-HSP70 but not anti-PDI polyclonal antibody.

We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize existing evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of LUS for pneumonia in adults. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of published studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of LUS against a referent CXR or chest CT scan and/or clinical criteria for pneumonia in adults aged \u226518 years. Eligible studies were required to have a CXR and/or chest CT scan at the time of evaluation. We manually extracted descriptive and quantitative information from eligible studies, and calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity using the Mantel-Haenszel method and pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR) using the DerSimonian-Laird method. We assessed for heterogeneity using the Q and I 2 statistics. Results: Our initial search strategy yielded 2726 articles, of which 45 (1.7%) were manually selected for review and 10 (0.4%) were eligible for analyses. These 10 studies provided a combined sample size of 1172 participants. Six studies enrolled adult patients who were either hospitalized or admitted to Emergency Departments with suspicion of pneumonia and 4 studies enrolled critically-ill adult patients. LUS was performed by highly-skilled sonographers in seven studies, by trained physicians in two, and one did not mention level of training. All studies were conducted in high-income settings. LUS took a maximum of 13 minutes to conduct. Nine studies used a 3.5-5 MHz microconvex transducer and one used a 5-9 MHz convex probe. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pneumonia using LUS were 94% (95% CI, 92%-96%) and 96% (94%-97%), respectively; pooled positive and negative LRs were 16.8 (7.7-37.0) and 0.07 (0.05-0.10), respectively; and, the area-under-the-ROC curve was 0.99 (0.98-0.99).

LBW newborns are at greater risk to acquire recurrent bacterial and viral infections during their first few weeks of life possibly as an outcome of compromised innate immune functions. As adaptive immunity is in a naive state, increased risk of infection of LBW as compared to NBW newborns may reflect impairments in innate immunity. Methodology: To characterize the increased susceptibility to infections in LBW newborns we used microarray technology to identify differences in gene expression in LBW newborns (n = 8) compared to NBW newborns (n = 4) using cord blood. The results obtained from the microarray study were validated on a larger number of samples using real time RT-PCR (LBW = 22, NBW = 18) and western blotting (LBW = 12, NBW = 12). The Interferome database was used to identify interferon (IFN) signature genes and ingenuity pathway analysis identified canonical pathways and biological functions associated with the differentially expressed genes in LBW newborns. ELISAs for IFNs and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein were performed in both LBW and NBW newborns and in adults (LBW = 18, NBW = 18, Adults = 8). Principal Findings: Upon microarray analysis, we identified 1,391 differentially expressed genes, of which, 1,065 genes were down-regulated and 326 genes were up-regulated in the LBW compared to NBW newborns. Of note, 70 IFN-signature genes were found to be significantly down-regulated in LBW compared to NBW newborns. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed pattern recognition receptors signaling including Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) -1, -5, and -8 genes and IFN signaling as the most significantly impacted pathways.

While virus-host interactions are promising targets for antivirals, there is only limited knowledge regarding the interactions of EBOV with cellular host factors. Recently, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen that identified the nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) as an important host factor for the EBOV life cycle. NXF1 is a major component of the nuclear mRNA export pathway that is usurped by many viruses whose life cycles include nuclear stages. However, the role of NXF1 in the life cycle of EBOV, a virus replicating in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, remains unknown. In order to better understand the role of NXF1 in the EBOV life cycle, we performed a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescence assays to characterize the interactions of NXF1 with viral proteins and RNAs. Additionally, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of NXF1 together with functional assays, we analyzed the role of NXF1 in individual aspects of the virus life cycle. With this approach we identified the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) as a viral interaction partner of NXF1. Further studies revealed that NP interacts with the RNA-binding domain of NXF1 and competes with RNA for this interaction. Co-localization studies showed that RNA binding-deficient, but not wildtype NXF1, accumulates in NP-derived inclusion bodies, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that NXF1 is necessary for viral protein expression, but not for viral RNA synthesis. Finally, our results showed that NXF1 interacts with viral mRNAs, but not with viral genomic RNAs. Based on these results we suggest a model whereby NXF1 is recruited into inclusion bodies to promote the export of viral mRNA:NXF1 complexes from these sites. This would represent a novel function for NXF1 in the life cycle of cytoplasmically replicating viruses, and may provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches against EBOV, and possibly other emerging viruses.", "output": "The Ebola Virus Nucleoprotein Recruits the Nuclear RNA Export Factor NXF1 into Inclusion Bodies to Facilitate Viral Protein Expression", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Although its etiology is as yet unknown current evidence suggests that tissue damage is mediated by autoimmune T cells. The examination of an experimental animal model for MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), has demonstrated that myelin basic protein (MBP)-or proteolipid protein (PLP)-specific T cells mediate the destruction of CNS myelin. In recent years, elegant studies in EAE have shown that encephalitogenic T cells recognize short peptides of MBP or PLP in the context of MHC/HLA-class II molecules, express a restricted number of T cell receptor (TCR) molecules and secrete interferon-~, and tumor necrosis factor-c@3. Understanding the pathogenetic steps in lesion development at the molecular level led to highly specific immunotherapies for EAE targeting each individual molecule. It has been the hope of many investigators that immunological events resembling those in EAE can be found in patients with MS and that the specific immunotherapies effective in EAE could also be applied to MS. However, to date, the evidence for a unique immunological abnormality in MS is not strong. Although MBP-and PLP-specific T cells with properties similar to those that are encephalitogenic in animals can be isolated from patients, they are not specific for MS and occur with similar frequency in controls. In addition, the variability in specificity and TCR usage has raised questions regarding the relevance of these cells in patients. The importance of the T cell responses to myelin antigens in MS may not be established until the effects of abrogating their activity through specific therapies targeting the trimolecular complex (TMC) have been demonstrated. Consequently, attention has begun to focus on modifying the biology of the MS lesion rather than targeting the initiating event at the level of the TMC, and the success of this approach is reflected by the effect of interferon-/3 on lesion development in MS. The recent approval for the use of interferon-/3 for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS has raised great interest in examining novel strategies for immunotherapies in MS.

Here, we report the identification of Sec16A and p115, two proteins of the ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport system, as novel components of the TRAF3 interactome network. Notably, in non-infected cells, TRAF3 was found associated with markers of the ER-Exit-Sites (ERES), ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis-Golgi apparatus. Upon dsRNA and dsDNA sensing however, the Golgi apparatus fragmented into cytoplasmic punctated structures containing TRAF3 allowing its colocalization and interaction with Mitochondrial AntiViral Signaling (MAVS), the essential mitochondria-bound RIG-I-like Helicase (RLH) adaptor. In contrast, retention of TRAF3 at the ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport system blunted the ability of TRAF3 to interact with MAVS upon viral infection and consequently decreased type I IFN response. Moreover, depletion of Sec16A and p115 led to a drastic disorganization of the Golgi paralleled by the relocalization of TRAF3, which under these conditions was unable to associate with MAVS. Consequently, upon dsRNA and dsDNA sensing, ablation of Sec16A and p115 was found to inhibit IRF3 activation and anti-viral gene expression. Reciprocally, mild overexpression of Sec16A or p115 in Hec1B cells increased the activation of IFNb, ISG56 and NF-kB -dependent promoters following viral infection and ectopic expression of MAVS and Tank-binding kinase-1 (TBK1). In line with these results, TRAF3 was found enriched in immunocomplexes composed of p115, Sec16A and TBK1 upon infection.

Over time, quarantine has become a classic public health intervention and has been used repeatedly when newly emerging infectious diseases have threatened to spread throughout a population. Here, we weigh the economic costs and benefits associated with implementing widespread quarantine in Toronto during the SARS outbreaks of 2003. Methods. We compared the costs of two outbreak scenarios: in Scenario A, SARS is able to transmit itself throughout a population without any significant public health interventions. In Scenario B, quarantine is implemented early on in an attempt to contain the virus. By evaluating these situations, we can investigate whether or not the use of quarantine is justified by being either cost-saving, life saving, or both. Results. Our results indicate that quarantine is effective in containing newly emerging infectious diseases, and also cost saving when compared to not implementing a widespread containment mechanism.

The results show that the genome of QY16 consists of 27,670 nucleotides, excluding poly (A) tail, and that its genome organization is 5' UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3' UTR-poly (A) tail. Sequence comparison among QY16 and other IBV strains was conducted and its results demonstrate that the S1 gene of QY16 has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with that of 4/91, and the other part of its genome is highly similar to that of YX10. The results of the phylogenic analysis show that the entire genome of QY16 and most of the QY16 genes are located in the same cluster as those of YX10, except for the S1 gene which is located in the same cluster with that of 4/91. It has been further confirmed by the RDP and SimPlot analysis that QY16 is a recombinant strain deriving from YX10 (as the major parental sequence) and 4/91 (as the minor parental sequence), and that the recombination occurs in a region which includes the 3'-terminal 1b sequence (85 nt) and the 5'-terminal S1 protein gene sequence (1,466 nt). The results of the vaccination-challenge test suggest that QY16 is a nephropathogenic strain of IBV and that the vaccine strains-H120 and 4/91-cannot provide effective protection against it.

Constant evolution of circulating influenza virus strains and the emergence of new strains diminishes the effectiveness of annual vaccines that rely on a match with circulating influenza strains. Thus, there is a continued need for new, efficacious vaccines conferring cross-clade protection to avoid the need for biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines. Recombinant virus-vectored vaccines are an appealing alternative to classical inactivated vaccines because virus vectors enable native expression of influenza antigens, even from virulent influenza viruses, while expressed in the context of the vector that can improve immunogenicity. In addition, a vectored vaccine often enables delivery of the vaccine to sites of inductive immunity such as the respiratory tract enabling protection from influenza virus infection. Moreover, the ability to readily manipulate virus vectors to produce novel influenza vaccines may provide the quickest path toward a universal vaccine protecting against all influenza viruses.

We report the changing epidemiology of travel-related illnesses over a 12-year period. Methods: A single site GeoSentinel surveillance analysis was undertaken for 3460 ill returned travellers presenting to two public hospitals in Marseille, France from March 2003 to October 2015, with travel-related illnesses. Demographic characteristics, travel history, presenting symptoms and information on pre-travel consultations were collected. Results: There was a predominance of travel to sub-Saharan Africa, in particular to Comoros archipelago. Tourism was the main reason for travel (1591/3460, 46%), followed by visiting friends or relatives (VFR) (895/3460, 26%), with a mean duration of 29 days; 35% (1212/3460) of travellers reported a pre-travel health consultation. The most common syndromic diagnoses were febrile systemic illness (1343, 39%), dermatologic (716, 21%), gastrointestinal (340, 10%) and respiratory/ear-nose-throat (331, ENT) (10%). Hospitalization rates were highest amongst travellers from sub-Saharan Africa (858/ 1632, 53%), and VFR (573/ 895, 64%, P < 0.001). Frequent diagnoses included malaria (797, 23%), dengue (96, 2.77%) and chikungunya (75, 2.17%), reflecting global trends. Comparison of two periods (2003-10 to 2011-15) demonstrated an increase in chikungunya and decrease in malaria and influenza-like illness. We report an increase in ill travellers from the Caribbean, Middle East and South-East Asia.

In this study, we focused on highly conserved nonstructural protein 16 (NSP16), a viral 2=Omethyltransferase (2=O-MTase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection. Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif in the conserved KDKE motif of Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogenesis. While the absence of 2=O-MTase activity had only a marginal impact on propagation and replication in Vero cells, dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV demonstrated significant attenuation relative to the control both in primary human airway cell cultures and in vivo. Further examination indicated that dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV had a type I interferon (IFN)-based attenuation and was partially restored in the absence of molecules of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats. Importantly, the robust attenuation permitted the use of dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from a challenge with a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain.

The identity of both protein variants was further confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). We then compared bioactivities of these two recombinant proteins. Although both recombinant protein variants exhibited comparable activities in antiproliferation of PK-15 cells and in nitric oxide (NO) induction of porcine peripheral monocytes, antiviral activity of rPoIFN-\u2425-W protein was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that of rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein in a plaque inhibition assay using pseudorabies virus (PRV).

A study team collected data through a survey and in-depth interviews during Results: Of 2,830 families included in the final analysis, 23% could recognize cholera as acute watery diarrhea and 16% had ever heard of oral cholera vaccine. About 54% of the respondents had poor knowledge about cholerarelated issues while 97% had a positive attitude toward cholera and oral cholera vaccine. One-third showed poor practice relating to the prevention of cholera. The findings showed a significant (p < 0.05) association between the respondents' knowledge and sex, education, occupation, monthly overall household expenditure, attitudes and practice. In the adjusted model, male sex, having a lower monthly overall household expenditure, and having a less positive attitude toward cholera were the significant predictors to having poor knowledge. Conclusions: The findings suggest the strengthening of health education activities to improve knowledge on cholera, its prevention and treatment and information on cholera vaccination among high-risk populations. The data also underscore the potential of mass cholera vaccination to prevent and control cholera.", "output": "Knowledge of, attitudes toward, and preventive practices relating to cholera and oral cholera vaccine among urban high-risk groups: findings of a cross-sectional study in Dhaka, Bangladesh", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

The present study investigates outcomes with respect to cardiopulmonary arrest rates in institutions with and without rapid response systems (RRSs) and the current level of cardiopulmonary arrest rate in tertiary hospitals. Methods: This was a retrospective study based on data from 14 tertiary hospitals. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate reports were obtained from each hospital to include the number of cardiopulmonary arrest events in adult patients in the general ward, the annual adult admission statistics, and the structure of the RRS if present. Results: Hospitals with RRSs showed a statistically significant reduction of the CPR rate between 2013 and 2015 (odds ratio [OR], 0.731; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.577 to 0.927; P = 0.009). Nevertheless, CPR rates of 2013 and 2015 did not change in hospitals without RRS (OR, 0.988; 95% CI, 0.868 to 1.124; P = 0.854). National university-affiliated hospitals showed less cardiopulmonary arrest rate than private university-affiliated in 2015 (1.92 vs. 2.40; OR, 0.800; 95% CI, 0.702 to 0.912; P = 0.001). High-volume hospitals showed lower cardiopulmonary arrest rates compared with medium-volume hospitals in 2013 (1.76 vs. 2.63; OR, 0.667; 95% CI, 0.577 to 0.772; P < 0.001) and in 2015 (1.55 vs. 3.20; OR, 0.485; 95% CI, 0.428 to 0.550; P < 0.001).

We have found a novel anti-inflammatory pathway that is initiated by the acute phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), interacting with Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R) on monocytes. This pathway is protective in animal models of endotoxin shock. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in the Fc\u03b3R might contribute to monocyte responses and susceptibility to infectious complications after severe trauma. Methods-We conducted an observational study on a prospectively identified cohort of adult patients with convenience enrollment admitted after severe trauma. We enrolled 66 patients and collected blood samples at enrollment and again at 48 and 72 hrs. Patients were followed through their hospital stay and any septic events before 14 days were recorded. Cytokine and CRP levels were determined in the plasma from all three blood draws. Additionally, DNA was extracted from blood and analyzed for the 131 H/R Fc\u03b3RIIa polymorphism that strongly affects the binding of IgG and CRP to this receptor. Results-Elevated levels of IL-8, IL-6, IL-10 MCP-1 as well as CRP were associated with reduced time to post-traumatic sepsis in Cox regression analysis. Expression of monocyte HLA-DR below 45% on patient monocytes was also associated with sepsis (HR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.45-6.93). Genetic analysis found that individuals with the polymorphism of the Fc\u03b3RIIa receptor that binds CRP poorly were also more likely to have decreased monocyte HLA-DR and posttraumatic sepsis. In vitro studies showed that CRP could attenuate monocyte deactivation in volunteers with the polymorphism of the Fc\u03b3RIIa receptor that binds CRP. Conclusions-Our findings suggest that a common genetic variation in the Fc\u03b3RIIa receptor may contribute to infectious susceptibility in trauma patients. In vitro experiments suggest that this association is related to the inability of CRP to bind to this Fc\u03b3RIIa receptor variant.

Before an outbreak of airborne diseases within a city, how to determine an appropriate containment area for effective vaccination strategies is unknown. This research treats airborne disease spreads as geo-social interaction patterns, because viruses transmit among different groups of people over geographical locations through human interactions and population movement. Previous research argued that an appropriate scale identified through human geo-social interaction patterns can provide great potential for effective vaccination. However, little work has been done to examine the effectiveness of such vaccination at large scales (e.g., city) that are characterized by spatially heterogeneous population distribution and movement. This article therefore aims to understand the impact of geo-social interaction patterns on effective vaccination in the urbanized area of Portland, Oregon. To achieve this goal, we simulate influenza transmission on a large-scale location-based social network to 1) identify human geo-social interaction patterns for designing effective vaccination strategies, and 2) and evaluate the efficacy of different vaccination strategies according to the identified geo-social patterns. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of vaccination strategies based on geosocial interaction patterns in containing the epidemic outbreak at the source.

Ad12 replicates in human cells but undergoes a completely abortive cycle in Syrian hamster cells. Ad12 induces neuro-ectodermal tumors in newborn hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Each tumor cell or Ad12-transformed hamster cell carries multiple copies of integrated Ad12 DNA. Ad12 DNA usually integrates at one chromosomal site which is not specific since Ad12 DNA can integrate at many different locations in the hamster genome. Epigenetic research occupies a prominent role in tumor biology. We have been using the human Ad12 Syrian hamster cell system for the analysis of epigenetic alterations in Ad12infected cells and in Ad12-induced hamster tumors. Virion or free intracellular Ad12 DNA remains unmethylated at CpG sites, whereas the integrated viral genomes become de novo methylated in specific patterns. Inverse correlations between promoter methylation and activity were described for the first time in this system and initiated active research in the field of DNA methylation and epigenetics. Today, promoter methylation has been recognized as an important factor in long-term genome silencing. We have also discovered that the insertion of foreign (Ad12, bacteriophage lambda, plasmid) DNA into mammalian genomes can lead to genome-wide alterations in methylation and transcription patterns in the recipient genomes. This concept has been verified recently in a pilot study with human cells which had been rendered transgenomic for a 5.6 kbp bacterial plasmid.

Although the licensing of botanical drug Veregen approved by FDA has indicated the importance of quantitative analysis in quality control of herbal medicines, quantitative evaluation of a Chinese patent drug like SHL remains a challenge due to the complex chemical profile. In this study, 15 small molecular components of SHL (four flavonoids, six quinic acid derivatives, three saponins and two phenylethanoid glycosides) were simultaneously determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The contents of the three major saccharides, namely fructose, glucose and sucrose were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detector on an amino column (HPLC-ELSD).

PKR inactivates the translation initiation factor eIF2a via phosphorylation, while OAS induces the endonuclease RNase L to degrade RNA. We show that poxvirus decapping enzymes D9 and D10, which remove caps from mRNAs, inhibit these antiviral responses by preventing dsRNA accumulation. Catalytic site mutations of D9 and D10, but not of either enzyme alone, halt vaccinia virus late protein synthesis and inhibit virus replication. Infection with the D9-D10 mutant was accompanied by massive mRNA reduction, cleavage of ribosomal RNA, and phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a that correlated with a 15-fold increase in dsRNA compared to wild-type virus. Additionally, mouse studies show extreme attenuation of the mutant virus. Thus, vaccinia virus decapping, in addition to targeting mRNAs for degradation, prevents dsRNA accumulation and anti-viral responses.", "output": "Poxvirus Decapping Enzymes Enhance Virulence by Preventing the Accumulation of dsRNA and the Induction of Innate Antiviral Responses Article Poxvirus Decapping Enzymes Enhance Virulence by Preventing the Accumulation of dsRNA and the Induction of Innate Antiviral Responses", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

The attractive features of brazzein as a potential commercial sweetener include its small size (53 amino acid residues), its stability over wide ranges of temperature and pH, and the similarity of its sweetness to sucrose. Heterologous production of brazzein is complicated by the fact that the protein contains four disulfide bridges and requires a specific N-terminal sequence. Our previous protocol for producing the protein from Escherichia coli involved several steps with low overall yield: expression as a fusion protein, denaturation and renaturation, oxidation of the cysteines, and cleavage by cyanogen bromide at an engineered methionine adjacent to the desired N-terminus. The new protocol described here, which is much faster and leads to a higher yield of native protein, involves the production of brazzein in E. coli as a fusion with SUMO. The isolated protein product contains the brazzein domain folded with correct disulfide bonds formed and is then cleaved with a specific SUMO protease to liberate native brazzein. This protocol represents an important advancement that will enable more efficient research into the interaction between brazzein and the receptor as well as investigations to test the potential of brazzein as a commercially viable natural low calorie sweetener.", "output": "Efficient and rapid protein expression and purification of small high disulfide containing sweet protein brazzein in E. coli", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

One important way to help combat a pandemic of viral infectious diseases is early detection before large-scale outbreaks occur. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) have been used to identify precisely different strains of some very closely related pathogens. However, isolation and detection of viral RNA in the field are difficult due to the unstable nature of viral RNA molecules. Consequently, performing in-the-field nucleic acid analysis to monitor the spread of viruses is financially and technologically challenging in remote and underdeveloped regions that are high-risk areas for outbreaks. A simplified rapid viral RNA extraction method is reported to meet the requirements for in-the-field viral RNA extraction and detection. The ability of this device to perform viral RNA extraction with subsequent RT-PCR detection of retrovirus is demonstrated.

Increased resilience to stress via increased biodiversity has been described in a number of natural systems. Diversity in food production can be considered on the following three levels: (a) genetic diversity as reflected in the range of cultivars which can be selected for production; (b) species diversity, captured through production of a wide range of crops on each farm; and (c) broad ecosystem diversity, described by the diversity of production between farms and within the broader food system. A network of locally based food producers and entrepreneurs provides opportunity for high diversity at each network stage, with increased adaptive capacity and the ability for rapid response to disturbance. We argue that production techniques that use carefully planned diverse plantings, such as biointensive cultivation, increase resilience by increased water use efficiency, yield and nutrient retention while reducing pressure from pests and pathogens. We present a model for a diverse, distributed food system in the North Carolina Piedmont and analyze an existing distributed network by a food hub in South Carolina. Through these models, we argue that a shift in the food network has the potential to increase local food security by having food more reliably available where it is needed and by contributing to local resilience through community economic development. The shift in food production and distribution systems serves multiple goals: When crop loss occurs, other crops still contribute to overall harvest, reducing net loss. Diverse on-farm production can support a more distributed network of food aggregators, processors, and markets than the current approach of large-scale consolidation. Finally, a distributed food supply network supported with diverse agricultural products can increase resilience by providing access to diversified markets for producers and improved food access to consumers with more food choices, while expanding the need for skilled jobs supporting the regionally based food industry.", "output": "Toward resilient food systems through increased agricultural diversity and local sourcing in the Carolinas", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

There were no significant differences observed among these BCoVs in direct immunofluorescence tests. However, antigenic differences were observed between BCoVs in the neutralization tests, although there was no clear indication of a distinct serotype.

Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined. Results: We compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results. Comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p = 0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups: all controls (N = 6120), non-influenza positive controls (N = 2880), and pan-negative controls (N = 3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much (range: 0.46-0.51). Conclusions: Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results.

It poses a serious and growing worldwide public health problem that will only be partially addressed with the introduction of new antiviral therapies.

The introduction of a HCV vaccine has been predicted, using simulation models in a high risk population, to have a significant effect on reducing the incidence of HCV. A vaccine with 50 to 80% efficacy targeted to high-risk intravenous drug users could dramatically reduce HCV incidence in this population. Virus like particles (VLPs) are composed of viral structural proteins which self-assemble into non-infectious particles that lack genetic material and resemble native viruses. Thus, VLPs represent a safe and highly immunogenic vaccine delivery platform able to induce potent adaptive immune responses. Currently, many VLP-based vaccines have entered clinical trials, while licensed VLP vaccines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) have been in use for many years. The HCV core, E1 and E2 proteins can self-assemble into immunogenic VLPs while inclusion of HCV antigens into heterogenous (chimeric) VLPs is also a promising approach.

Their replication complexes are commonly associated with modified host cell membranes. Membrane structures supporting viral RNA synthesis range from distinct spherular membrane invaginations to more elaborate webs of packed membranes and vesicles. Generally, their ultrastructure, morphogenesis, and exact role in viral replication remain to be defined. Poorly characterized double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) were previously implicated in SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. We have now applied electron tomography of cryofixed infected cells for the three-dimensional imaging of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution. Our analysis defines a unique reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that integrates convoluted membranes, numerous interconnected DMVs (diameter 200-300 nm), and ''vesicle packets'' apparently arising from DMV merger. The convoluted membranes were most abundantly immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits. However, double-stranded RNA, presumably revealing the site of viral RNA synthesis, mainly localized to the DMV interior. Since we could not discern a connection between DMV interior and cytosol, our analysis raises several questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. Our data document the extensive virusinduced reorganization of host cell membranes into a network that is used to organize viral replication and possibly hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms. Together with biochemical studies of the viral enzyme complex, our ultrastructural description of this ''replication network'' will aid to further dissect the early stages of the coronavirus life cycle and its virus-host interactions.

The analysis resolved structural aspects of the protein and identified important features of relevance to ISAV HE activity. By recombinant expression and purification of secretory HE (recHE) proteins, receptorbinding and quantitative analyses of enzymatic activities displayed by ISAV HE molecules are presented for the first time.

The three amino acid differences between the high and low virulent variants, of which two localized to the putative receptor-binding domain and one in the esterase domain, had no impact on receptor-binding or -release activities. In contrast, the Ser 32 amino acid substitution totally abolished enzymatic activity while receptor binding increased, as observed by agglutination of Atlantic salmon red blood cells.

The two types of AR STAT1 defect give rise to a broad infectious phenotype with susceptibility to intramacrophagic bacteria (mostly mycobacteria) and viruses (herpes viruses at least), due principally to the impairment of IFN-\u03b3-mediated and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-mediated immunity, respectively.

AD STAT1 deficiency selectively predisposes individuals to mycobacterial disease, owing to the impairment of IFN-\u03b3-mediated immunity, as IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-mediated immunity is maintained. Finally, AD gain of STAT1 activity is associated with autoimmunity, probably owing to an enhancement of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-mediated immunity.

Based on measurements of the European Environment Agency (EEA), approximately 90 % of EU citizens live in areas where the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for air quality of particulate matter sized < 2.5 mm (PM 2.5 ) are not met. Since sources of pollution reside in both indoor and outdoor air, selecting the most appropriate ventilation strategy is not a simple and straightforward task. Methods: A framework for developing European health-based ventilation guidelines was created in 2010-2013 in the EU-funded HEALTHVENT project. As a part of the project, the potential efficiency of control policies to health effects caused by residential indoor exposures of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), outdoor bioaerosols, volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon oxide (CO) radon and dampness was estimated. The analysis was based on scenario comparison, using an outdoor-indoor mass-balance model and varying the ventilation rates. Health effects were estimated with burden of diseases (BoD) calculations taking into account asthma, cardiovascular (CV) diseases, acute toxication, respiratory infections, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Results: The quantitative comparison of three main policy approaches, (i) optimising ventilation rates only; (ii) filtration of outdoor air; and (iii) indoor source control, showed that all three approaches are able to provide substantial reductions in the health risks, varying from approximately 20 % to 44 %, corresponding to 400 000 and 900 000 saved healthy life years in EU-26.

Conclusions: The present modelling shows, that combination of controlling the indoor air sources and selecting appropriate ventilation rate was the most effective to reduce health risks.

In this study, efficiency of several PCR assays designed for CFPHV detection is explored and compared to a method published previously. The results show that adoption of a triplet set of singleplex PCR assays outperforms other methods, with an approximately 3-fold increase in detection success in comparison to the standard assay.

Furthermore, the study explores the putative protective action exerted by Tri-iodothyronine (T3; 10 27 M). At the end of culture, morphological analyses and follicle counts showed that DOC negatively impacts on early growing follicles, decreasing primary follicle number and severely affecting health at the transitional and primary stages. Poor follicle health was mainly due to effects on granulosa cells, indicating that the effects of DOC on oocytes were likely to be secondary to granulosa cell damage. DOC damages growing follicles specifically, with no direct effect on the primordial follicle reserve. Immunostaining and western blotting showed that DOC induces activation of intrinsic, type II apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells; increasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, while also inducing movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol.

Besides extensive screening for HCV-specific compounds, some wellestablished medicinal drugs have recently demonstrated anti-HCV effect in HCV replicon cells. One of these drugs is arbidol (ARB), a Russian-made broad spectrum antiviral agent, which we have previously shown to inhibit acute and chronic HCV infection. Here we show that ARB inhibits the cell entry of HCV pseudoparticles of genotypes 1a, 1b and 2a in a dose-dependent fashion. ARB also displayed a dose-dependent inhibition of HCV membrane fusion, as assayed by using HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) and fluorescent liposomes. ARB inhibition of HCVpp fusion was found more effective on genotype 1a than on genotypes 1b and 2a. In vitro biochemical studies revealed ARB association with membrane-like environments such as detergents, and with lipid membranes. This association was particularly prominent at acidic pH which is optimal for HCV-mediated fusion. Our results suggest that the affinity of ARB for lipid membranes could account for its anti-HCV actions, together with a differential level of interaction with key motifs in HCV glycoproteins of different genotypes. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects an estimated 3% or 170 million of the world's population, and hepatitis C is now the most frequent indication for liver transplantation.

Recent findings on the mechanisms that underlie the increased frequency of severe pulmonary bacterial infections following respiratory virus infection are also discussed. Viruses are highly evolved and ubiquitous pathogens. Although infection with many viruses results in a mild, self-limited disease, other viruses can produce severe and frequently fatal infections. The respiratory tract is a major portal through which viruses enter to initiate infection. Whereas some viruses can initiate infection in the respiratory tract and then disseminate to other sites in the body, other viruses typically remain localized to the respiratory tract, where they replicate and induce tissue injury (see Supplementary information S1 (table)). Various defence mechanisms have evolved in the respiratory tract to prevent and control infection by viruses and other pathogens. The respiratory tract can be divided anatomically into the upper respiratory tract (including the nose, mouth and pharynx) and the lower respiratory tract (which consists of the trachea, bronchi and lungs), with the lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer's ring (including the pharyngeal and palatine tonsils) representing the line of demarcation.

The nature and severity of disease can vary between clinical cases. Genetic determinants of virulence are likely to contribute to differences in the in vivo phenotype of FHV-1 isolates, but to date there have been limited studies investigating FHV-1 genetic diversity. This study used next generation sequencing to compare the genomes of contemporary Australian clinical isolates of FHV-1, vaccine isolates and historical clinical isolates, including isolates that predated the introduction of live attenuated vaccines into Australia. Analysis of the genome sequences aimed to assess the level of genetic diversity, identify potential genetic markers that could influence the in vivo phenotype of the isolates and examine the sequences for evidence of recombination. Results: The full genome sequences of 26 isolates of FHV-1 were determined, including two vaccine isolates and 24 clinical isolates that were collected over a period of approximately 40 years. Analysis of the genome sequences revealed a remarkably low level of diversity (0.0-0.01 %) between the isolates. No potential genetic determinants of virulence were identified, but unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the UL28 and UL44 genes were detected in the vaccine isolates that were not present in the clinical isolates. No evidence of FHV-1 recombination was detected using multiple methods of recombination detection, even though many of the isolates originated from cats housed in a shelter environment where high infective pressures were likely to exist. Evidence of displacement of dominant FHV-1 isolates with other (genetically distinct) FHV-1 isolates over time was observed amongst the isolates obtained from the shelter-housed animals. The results show that FHV-1 genomes are highly conserved. The lack of recombination detected in the FHV-1 genomes suggests that the risk of attenuated vaccines recombining to generate virulent field viruses is lower than has been suggested for some other herpesviruses. The SNPs detected only in the vaccine isolates offer the potential to develop PCR-based methods of differentiating vaccine and clinical isolates of FHV-1 in order to facilitate future epidemiological studies.", "output": "Low genetic diversity among historical and contemporary clinical isolates of felid herpesvirus 1", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

The control and command center of Saudi Ministry of Health issues a daily report on MERS-CoV infection cases. The infection with MERS-CoV can lead to fatal complications, however little information is known about this novel virus. In this paper, we apply two data mining techniques in order to better understand the stability and the possibility of recovery from MERS-CoV infections. Method: The Naive Bayes classifier and J48 decision tree algorithm were used to build our models. The dataset used consists of 1082 records of cases reported between 2013 and 2015. In order to build our prediction models, we split the dataset into two groups. The first group combined recovery and death records. A new attribute was created to indicate the record type, such that the dataset can be used to predict the recovery from MERS-CoV. The second group contained the new case records to be used to predict the stability of the infection based on the current status attribute. Results: The resulting recovery models indicate that healthcare workers are more likely to survive. This could be due to the vaccinations that healthcare workers are required to get on regular basis. As for the stability models using J48, two attributes were found to be important for predicting stability: symptomatic and age. Old patients are at high risk of developing MERS-CoV complications. Finally, the performance of all the models was evaluated using three measures: accuracy, precision, and recall. In general, the accuracy of the models is between 53.6% and 71.58%.

Charonia species have large salivary glands (SGs) that are suspected to produce either a venom and/or sulphuric acid which can immobilize their prey and neutralize the intrinsic toxic properties of COTS. To date, there is little information on the types of toxins produced by tritons. In this paper, the predatory behaviour of the C. tritonis is described. Then, the C. tritonis SG, which itself is made up of an anterior lobe (AL) and posterior lobe (PL), was analyzed using an integrated transcriptomics and proteomics approach, to identify putative toxin-and feeding-related proteins. A de novo transcriptome database and in silico protein analysis predicts that ~3800 proteins have features consistent with being secreted. A gland-specific proteomics analysis confirmed the presence of numerous SG-AL and SG-PL proteins, including those with similarity to cysteine-rich venom proteins. Sulfuric acid biosynthesis enzymes were identified, specific to the SG-PL. Our analysis of the C. tritonis SG (AL and PL) has provided a deeper insight into the biomolecular toolkit used for predation and feeding by C. tritonis. If a generalist predator evolves to a more a specialist diet, it is assumed that it would be accompanied by modifications of characters that permit greater efficiency in capturing specific prey species. These likely include foraging behaviors and search strategies with fine-tuned chemosensory systems, physiological processes associated with digestion and waste removal, and other features involved with prey capture 1 . Among predatory taxa the evolution of a specialized diet is likely to be strongly linked to the evolution of venoms used to subdue prey. Although the evolution of many of these characters may be difficult to trace for a species that has evolved a restricted diet, the evolution of venoms can be inferred from analyses of expression of genes encoding venom and digestion components 2, 3 . Marine organisms from a broad range of phyla, from bacteria and algae to invertebrates and vertebrates, are known to produce toxins with high chemical diversity, divergence of which is likely driven by speciation and diet 4-6 . Some examples include tetrodotoxins produced by bacteria found in the saliva of the blue-ringed octopus and puffer fish 7, 8 , potent pore-forming toxins produced by cnidarians 9 , okadaic acid produced by bacteria in marine sponges 10 , and saponins (steroidal and triterpenoid) that are produced by echinoderms 11 . Venoms, and in particular specific toxins, play multiple roles from foraging to defense and intraspecific conflict 12 . Although there are many species of predatory marine snails, studies of venom toxins have been restricted to species within the superfamily Conoidea 13 . These venomous marine cone snails synthesize a remarkable diversity of pharmacologically active small peptides (conotoxins) to enable prey capture, self-defense and intra-specific competition 14-16 . The potency and selective profiles of the conotoxins vary depending on species targets that may include various subtypes of voltage-and ligand-gated ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors and neurotransmitter transporters 17 . Gastropods of the superfamily Tonnoidea are effective predators and thought to capture prey through envenomation 18 . Within the Tonnoidea, several species in the Cassidae family of snails are specialist predators of echinoderms. The large paired and mono-lobed salivary gland (SG) of Cassidae family snails are known to be toxic and inject a strong acid or venomous saliva into their prey to paralyse them before consumption [19] [20] [21] .

Accordingly, purified haemolytic pneumolysin but not serotype 1-associated non-haemolytic toxin activates strong IL-1\u03b2 production in human lungs.

The predicted common structural elements occur in the 3' end of a segment that is critical for internal ribosome binding, termed \"ribosome landing pad\" (RLP), of polioviruses. Base pairings between highly conserved 17-nucleotide (nt) and 21 -nt sequences in the 5' UTR of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses constitute a predicted pseudoknot that is significantly more stable than those that can be formed from a large set of randomly shuffled sequences. A conserved singlestranded polypyrimidine tract is located between two conserved tertiary elements. R. Nicholson, J. Pelletier, S.-Y. Le, and N. Sonenberg (1991, J. l&o/. 65, 5886-5894) demonstrated that the point mutations of 3-nt UUU out of an essential 4-nt pyrimidine stretch sequence UUUC abolished translation. Structural analysis of the mutant sequence indicates that small point mutations within the short polypyrimidine sequence would destroy the tertiary interaction in the predicted, highly ordered structure. The proposed common tertiary structure can offer experimentalists a model upon which to extend the interpretations for currently available data.

Immune response plays a key role in driving the course of L. infantum infection in other host species; however, the feline cell-mediated immune response to L. infantum infection has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the cell-mediated immune response specific to L. infantum by means of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 release in whole blood assay from cats living in endemic areas (66 in Sicily and 113 in Catalonia) and to compare with antibody levels to L. infantum [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)], blood parasite load and retroviral infections. Results: Most cats (n = 140) were L. infantum antibody negative and only 22% (n = 39) were positive. Only 9 and 2% of tested cats had a feline immunodeficency virus (FIV) infection or a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, respectively. Thirty-two cats out of 179 (18%) produced IFN-\u03b3 after stimulation with L. infantum soluble antigen (LSA) while the majority of cats (93%) produced IFN-\u03b3 after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA). Six LSA-IFN-\u03b3-producer cats were seropositive (three to ELISA and five to IFAT) but they were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative, while only one cat was antibody-and PCR-positive. Significant positive correlations were found between IFN-\u03b3 concentrations after stimulation with LSA and ConA, and between serology and PCR testing. No association was found between FIV status and LSA or ConA-IFN-\u03b3 production. Combining PCR, serology and specific IFN-\u03b3 concentration results, we found that 36% of cats studied were exposed to L. infantum. As expected, cats from endemic areas produce IFN-\u03b3 after ex vivo blood stimulation with LSA and therefore are able to activate a cell-mediated adaptive immune response against the parasite that is variably associated with antibody or blood PCR positivity.

Additionally, spans of asymptomatic persistence in recovering survivors is possible, during which transmission of the virus may occur. In acute infection, substantial cytokine storm and bystander lymphocyte apoptosis take place, resulting in uncontrolled, systemic inflammation in affected individuals. Recently, studies have demonstrated the presence of EBOV proteins VP40, glycoprotein (GP), and nucleoprotein (NP) packaged into extracellular vesicles (EVs) during infection. EVs containing EBOV proteins have been shown to induce apoptosis in recipient immune cells, as well as contain pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this manuscript, we review the current field of knowledge on EBOV EVs including the mechanisms of their biogenesis, their cargo and their effects in recipient cells. Furthermore, we discuss some of the effects that may be induced by EBOV EVs that have not yet been characterized and highlight the remaining questions and future directions. It is estimated that only approximately 20%-25% of GP products are the membrane-anchored GP 1,2 form, while the remaining 75%-80% are of the secreted type, with~70% sGP and~5% ssGP [7] [8] [9] [10] . During early infection, EBOV targets mainly monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). It is thought that these migrating cells aid in systemic dissemination of the virus throughout the host, especially into secondary lymphoid organs and the liver. Intense replication of the virus then takes place in other host cell types, including endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts and hepatocytes [11] [12] [13] [14] . Fatal filovirus infections often involve severely dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses, defective coagulation, and are typified by systemic cytokine storm and multi-organ failure. Immune system damage includes type-I and type-II interferon (IFN) antagonism by VP35 and VP24, respectively, NK and T-cell depletion known as bystander lymphocyte apoptosis, and impaired DC maturation [15] . Severe presentations of disease are accompanied by viral replication within and necrosis of the spleen, liver, kidneys, gonads, gastrointestinal tract and endocardium [13, 16] . In those who are fortunate enough to survive acute Ebola virus disease (EVD), the virus becomes undetectable in the blood, depicting a typical phenotype of viral clearance. However, either entire virus or viral components may remain detectable in patients relatively long after recovery, particularly in immune-privileged sites [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Notably, recent studies have shown that over 1 in 4 male survivors from the 2016 outbreak contained virus within their semen up to 7-9 months past the disappearance of EVD symptoms. Furthermore, virus has still been detectable up to 16-18 months later [17] . This type of \"clinical latency\" or persistent infection has significance for public health in the following ways: (1) viral reservoirs within immune privileged sites have implications for reemergence and persistence of the virus within the infected individual, potentially allowing for resurgence of infection, morbidity, and mortality [25]; (2) these reservoirs may allow for the transmission of the virus to additional individuals long after initial infection, hindering efforts to control the spread of outbreaks by public health infrastructures [25]; and (3) significant political, socio-economic, and social stigma considerations must be taken into account for policies to support the normal life and travel of EVD survivors [26] [27] [28] [29] . Spread of the virus by this route is of particular concern, as several cases of sexual transmission from male to female have already been documented. One of the first such cases involved transmission from a man 6 months past his recovery to a woman in Liberia [30, 31] . To date, three additional \"flare-ups\" of EBOV by sexual contact have been determined, together accounting for approximately half of the eight mini-outbreaks caused by persistently infected survivors documented since 2016 [32] [33] [34] [35] . The most concerning of these cases occurred over 480 days (nearly 17 months) past the initial recovery of the patient [35] . To further complicate the matter, there have been multiple reports addressing potential asymptomatic or undiagnosed portions of the population. Previous studies have put the number of seropositive but undiagnosed/asymptomatic individuals anywhere between 0%-47% [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . This of course implies that such individuals may represent an invisible source of viral transmission and future outbreaks. Exemplifying this is a case involving an asymptomatic mother who likely transmitted EBOV to her 9-month-old infant (as determined by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis) through breast milk, ultimately resulting in the fatality of the child [19] . Interestingly, the asymptomatic father's semen was also EBOV-positive, but was distantly related to the strains found in the mother and child. Currently, the mechanism of this viral persistence is not well characterized, although new studies have hinted as several possibilities, which will be discussed later. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small, membrane-bound vesicles that are released from numerous cell types and are involved in cell-to-cell communication. The intercellular communication is mediated by EV cargo, consisting of nucleic acids and proteins, which can be transferred between cells to elicit a phenotypic change in the recipient cell [45] [46] [47] . EVs are heterogeneous; as such, the current literature separates EVs into several different categories based mainly on differences in size and cellular origin, including subtypes such as exosomes and microvesicles [48] . Microvesicles bud directly from the plasma membrane and are generally larger than exosomes with diameters ranging from Viruses 2019, 11, 410 3 of 25", "output": "viruses Extracellular Vesicles and Ebola Virus: A New Mechanism of Immune Evasion", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

The need to develop new vaccines for infectious diseases, increase vaccine accessibility, reduce health costs, and simplify overloaded immunization schedules has driven the idea to combine antigens from the same or various pathogens. To protect effectively, some vaccines require multiple antigens of one pathogen or different pathogen serotypes/serogroups in combination (multivalent or polyvalent vaccines).

Primers P3, P5 specific for CDV wild-type strain or vaccine strain, were used as the forward primer together with the common reverse primer P4+P6 in the second round of nested PCR. A fragment of 177 bp was amplified from vaccine strain genomic RNA, and a fragment of 247 bp from wild-type strain genomic RNA in the RT-nPCR, and two fragments of 247 bp and 177 bp were amplified from the mixed samples of vaccine and wild-type strains. No amplification was achieved for uninfected cells, or cells infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), rabies virus (RV), or canine adenovirus (CAV). The RT-nPCR method was used to detect 30 field samples suspected of canine distemper from Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces, and 51 samples in Shandong province. As a result of 30 samples, were found to be wild-type-like, and 5 to be vaccine-strain-like. The RT-nPCR method can be used to effectively detect and differentiate wild-type CDV-infected dogs from dogs vaccinated with CDV vaccine, and thus can be used in clinical detection and epidemiological surveillance.", "output": "Open Access SHORT REPORT A multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction for detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes. Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are also discussed.

The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics and outcomes of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses. Methods: Clinical data of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with respiratory viruses January 2014-June 2018 were reviewed. Respiratory viral infection was identified by multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Among 126 patients who underwent multiplex RT-PCR, respiratory viral infection was identified in 46% (58/126): 28 patients with influenza and 30 patients with other respiratory viruses. There was no significant difference in baseline and clinical characteristics between patients with influenza and those with other respiratory viruses. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was more frequent in patients with influenza than in those with other respiratory viruses (32.1% vs 3.3%, p=0.006). Co-bacterial pathogens were more frequently isolated from respiratory samples of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza virus than those with other respiratory viruses.

Though extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) provides a noninvasive treatment option, controversial subjects still exist about its effectiveness, indications, and mechanism of action. Methods: An electronic databases search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to collect clinical trials, case reports, and cases series on this topic and then useful data were extracted and appraised by experienced clinicians. We evaluated the quality of included evidences by using the Oxford Centre for evidence-based medicine (EBM) Levels of Evidence. Results: A total of 17 articles including 2 case reports, 9 open label trials, 2 cohorts, and 6 randomized controlled trials were considered to be eligible for this systematic review. Visual analog scale (VAS), Harris hip scores, and the imaging results were the frequently-used outcome estimates of included studies. Conclusion: By systematically analyzing these evidences, we could conclude that ESWT could act as a safe and effective method to improve the motor function and relieve the pain of patients with osteonecrosis of femoral hip, especially those at early stage. Imaging revealed that bone marrow edema was significantly relieved, but the necrotic bone could not be reversed after ESWT. This technique could slow or even block the progression of ONFH and therefore reduce the demand for surgery.

Numerous preclinical studies with rVSV vectors expressing antigens from a variety of human pathogens have demonstrated the versatility, flexibility, and potential efficacy of the rVSV vaccine platform. When administered to nonhuman primates (NHPs), rVSV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag and Env elicited robust HIV-1specific cellular and humoral immune responses, and animals immunized with rVSV vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag and HIV Env were protected from AIDS after challenge with a pathogenic SIV/HIV recombinant. However, results from an exploratory neurovirulence study in NHPs indicated that these prototypic rVSV vectors might not be adequately attenuated for widespread use in human populations. To address this safety concern, a variety of different attenuation strategies, designed to produce a range of further attenuated rVSV vectors, are currently under investigation.

The objective of this study was to determine whether pet owners noticed and retained the message of a poster with an antimicrobial stewardship message placed in veterinary clinic exam rooms. A total of 111 pet owners from five veterinary clinics (three general practices, two low-cost clinics) in the greater Philadelphia area participated in the study. Participants completed a survey asking whether they noticed the poster and if they could paraphrase its message. In a follow-up survey, an antibiotic knowledge score was calculated from answers to questions assessing their knowledge of the poster message. Baseline knowledge was assessed by asking participants to define antibiotic resistance. At the end of the study, veterinarians at participating clinics were interviewed about their experiences with the poster. Only 51 (46.4%) participants noticed the poster, and only 11 (9.9%) could partially or completely reproduce its message.

In this study, evidence is provided that immunity induced by natural exposure to enteric CCoV is not fully protective against strain CB/05. Twenty-two, 10-week-old beagles with a recent natural infection by enteric CCoV were randomly distributed in two experimental groups of eight (groups A and B) and one control group of six (group C) dogs. Dogs in groups A and B were inoculated oronasally with different doses (4 \u00d7 10 5 or 4 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 ) of the pantropic strain CB/05, whereas dogs in group C were used as negative controls. Clinical, post-mortem and virological investigations showed that, despite the high serum antibody titres induced by the prior natural infection with enteric CCoV, dogs were susceptible to experimental infection with strain CB/05. This was shown by the occurrence of faecal shedding, and dogs displaying moderate clinical signs, mainly vomiting and diarrhoea. Involvement of the lymphoid tissues was evident as demonstrated by the acute lymphopenia (below 70% of the initial counts), gross lesions in spleen and lymph nodes and detection of CB/05 RNA in thymus, spleen and lymph nodes of some infected dogs. The presence of viral RNA in lymphoid tissues was observed only in dogs euthanised in the early stages of infection and the clinical course of the infection was unrelated to the viral dose administered.

Contrary to this hypothesis, C57BL/6J mice fed a 45% high fat diet exhibited weight gain that was inhibited by increased dietary sodium content. This suppressive effect of dietary sodium upon weight gain was mediated specifically through a reduction in digestive efficiency, with no effects on food intake behavior, physical activity, or resting metabolism. Replacement of circulating angiotensin II levels reversed the effects of high dietary sodium to suppress digestive efficiency. While the AT 1 receptor antagonist losartan had no effect in mice fed low sodium, the AT 2 receptor antagonist PD-123,319 suppressed digestive efficiency. Correspondingly, genetic deletion of the AT 2 receptor in FVB/NCrl mice resulted in suppressed digestive efficiency even on a standard chow diet. Together these data underscore the importance of digestive efficiency in the pathogenesis of obesity, and implicate dietary sodium, the reninangiotensin system, and the AT 2 receptor in the control of digestive efficiency regardless of mouse strain or macronutrient composition of the diet.

Material and methods: This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. Interleukin-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real time quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of 2 months of treatment. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate. Results: Of all 16 studied patients, significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and p = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and p = 0.001).

We performed a comprehensive analysis to identify the MERS transmission route and the ability of our routine infection-prevention policy to control this outbreak. Methods: This is a case-cohort study of retrospectively analysed data from medical charts, closed-circuit television, personal interviews and a national database. We analysed data of people at risk of MERS transmission including 228 in the emergency department (ED) and 218 in general wards (GW). Data of personnel location and movement, personal protection equipment and hand hygiene was recorded. Transmission risk was determined as the extent of exposure to the index patient: 1) high risk: staying within 2 m; 2) intermediate risk: staying in the same room at same time; and 3) low risk: only staying in the same department without contact. Results: The index patient was an old patient admitted to our hospital. 11 transmissions from the index patient were identified; 4 were infected in our hospital. Personnel in the ED exhibited higher rates of compliance with routine infection-prevention methods as observed objectively: 93% wore a surgical mask and 95.6% washed their hands. Only 1.8% of personnel were observed to wear a surgical mask in the GW. ED had a higher percentage of high-risk individuals compared with the GW (14.5% vs. 2.8%), but the attack rate was higher in the GW (16.7%; l/6) than in the ED (3%; 1/33). There were no transmissions in the intermediate-and low-risk groups in the ED. Otherwise 2 patients were infected in the GW among the low-risk group.

They were evaluated as NMDA receptor antagonists and several of them were more active than amantadine, but none was more potent than memantine. None of the tested compounds displayed antiviral activity. Two of the derivatives showed a significant level of trypanocidal activity. Based on the interesting and widely observed biological activity of amantadine, memantine, and NGP1-01, we therefore sought to explore the biological profile of (2-oxaadamant-1yl)amine derivatives. In this paper, we report the synthesis of several (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amines and related compounds and their pharmacological evaluation as NMDA receptor antagonists, and antivirals and trypanocidals agents. Results and discussion Starting from the known diketone 1, 7 we have prepared amines 2-4, 7, 8, and 10-15 using classical methods in amine chemistry (see Scheme 1). Secondary amines 2a and 2b were obtained in high yields following a known general procedure that involves reductive amination of diketone 1. 8 Thus, reaction of 1 with benzylamine followed by reduction with LiAlH 4 led to amine 2a in 58% yield. Similarly, reductive amination of 1 with phenethylamine furnished amine 2b in 51% yield. Reductive alkylation of amines 2a,b with formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride afforded tertiary amines 3a,b in high yields. Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl group of amines 2a and 3a led to 7 and 4, respectively. Finally, alkylation of 2a with benzyl chloride led to 8 in 85% yield. Alcohols of general structure 5 were prepared using a general method developed some time ago by our group. 9 Several attempts to carry out the substitution of the hydroxyl group of 5 by a wide range of amines led to the recovery of the starting material. Moreover, the attempted Ritter reaction of 5c with acetonitrile in acidic medium led to the known enone 6 in high yield. 9c However, reaction of 5a-c with aqueous hydrazine led to hydrazines 9a-c in high yields, probably due to the \u03b1-effect ensuring a higher nucleophilicity of hydrazine. Even though the reaction failed in the case of 5d. Catalytic hydrogenation of 9a,b furnished amines 10a,b in high yields. Surprisingly, 9c led to a mixture of the expected amine 10c and the cyclohexyl derivative 10d in the ratio of 3:4. Both products were separated by column chromatography. Reductive methylation of amines 10a and 10b with formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride afforded tertiary amines 11a and 11b, respectively. In a similar way, reductive alkylation of 10b with acetaldehyde or benzaldehyde led to amines 12 and 13, respectively. Finally, secondary amine 15 was synthesized from benzylamine 13 by reductive alkylation followed by catalytic debenzylation in good overall yield. The structure of all new compounds was confirmed by elemental analysis or by accurate mass measurement, IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and mass spectral data. In the last years there has been an intensive research on the development of new NMDA receptor antagonists, since this subtype of receptors has been involved in the apoptotic process that develops during neurodegenerative diseases. Memantine is a non-competitive and low affinity blocker that acts selectively on NMDA receptors that is being used in Alzheimer's disease to slow down its progression. 10", "output": "Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of (2-oxaadamant-1- yl)amines", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Daily application of a 0.1% solution of RA to the shaved skin of UM-HET3 mice on an AL diet produced a severe irritation that was evident by day 4, maximal at day 7-8 and still detectable at day 14. Skin irritation was characterized by redness, dryness, Xaking and failure of the hair to grow at the treated site. In CR mice, the same treatment produced little detectable irritation. Animals were sacri-Wced at the end of the retinoid-treatment period (day 7 or day 14) and skin from these animals was examined histologically. In both AL and CR mice, a similar degree of epidermal hyperplasia was observed. Numerous inXammatory cells (mononuclear cells and granulocytes) were present in the skin of both groups.

Here we report a detailed analysis of the regulation of Amphiregulin expression by human T cell subsets. Signaling through the T cell receptor induced Amphiregulin expression by most or all T cell subsets in human peripheral blood, including naive and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, Th1 and Th2 in vitro T cell lines, and subsets of memory CD4 T cells expressing several different chemokine receptors and cytokines. In these different T cell types, Amphiregulin synthesis was inhibited by an antagonist of protein kinase A, a downstream component of the cAMP signaling pathway, and enhanced by ligands that increased cAMP or directly activated protein kinase A. Prostaglandin E2 and adenosine, natural ligands that stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, also enhanced Amphiregulin synthesis while reducing synthesis of most other cytokines. Thus, in contrast to mouse T cells, Amphiregulin synthesis by human T cells is regulated more by acute signals than precommitment of T cells to a particular cytokine pattern.

In this review, we report recent advances and strategies of plant molecular pharming while focusing on the choice of plant hosts and the role of some molecular pharming elements and approaches: promoters, codon optimization, signal sequences, and peptides used for upstream design, purification and downstream processing.

Pre-infection with PRRSV leads to exacerbated disease caused by S. suis infection. Very few studies have assessed the immunological mechanisms underlying this higher susceptibility. Since antigen presenting cells play a major role in the initiation of the immune response, the in vitro transcriptional response of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and monocytes in the context of PRRSV and S. suis co-infection was investigated. BMDCs were found to be more permissive than monocytes to PRRSV infection; S. suis phagocytosis by PRRSV-infected BMDCs was found to be impaired, whereas no effect was found on bacterial intracellular survival. Transcription profile analysis, with a major focus on inflammatory genes, following S. suis infection, with and without pre-infection with PRRSV, was then performed. While PRRSV pre-infection had little effect on monocytes response to S. suis infection, a significant expression of several pro-inflammatory molecules was observed in BMDCs pre-infected with PRRSV after a subsequent infection with S. suis. While an additive effect could be observed for CCL4, CCL14, CCL20, and IL-15, a distinct synergistic up-regulatory effect was observed for IL-6, CCL5 and TNF-\u03b1 after co-infection. This increased pro-inflammatory response by DCs could participate in the exacerbation of the disease observed during PRRSV and S. suis co-infection.", "output": "Transcriptional Analysis of PRRSV-Infected Porcine Dendritic Cell Response to Streptococcus suis Infection Reveals Up- Regulation of Inflammatory-Related Genes Expression", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Methods: ITIS was used to measure cutaneous temperature in 1275 airline travellers who had agreed to tympanic temperature measurement and respiratory sampling. The prediction by ITIS of tympanic temperature (37.8uC and 37.5uC) and of influenza infection was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and estimated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). Findings: Using front of face ITIS for prediction of tympanic temperature $37.8uC, the area under the ROC curve was 0.86 (95%CI 0.75-0.97) and setting sensitivity at 86% gave specificity of 71%. The PPV in this population of travellers, of whom 0.5% were febrile using this definition, was 1.5%. We identified influenza virus infection in 30 travellers (3 Type A and 27 Type B). For ITIS prediction of influenza infection the area under the ROC curve was 0.66 (0.56-0.75), a sensitivity of 87% gave specificity of 39%, and PPV of 2.8%. None of the 30 influenza-positive travellers had tympanic temperature $37.8uC at screening (95%CI 0% to 12%); three had no influenza symptoms. Conclusion: ITIS performed moderately well in detecting fever but in this study, during a seasonal epidemic of predominantly influenza type B, the proportion of influenza-infected travellers who were febrile was low and ITIS were not much better than chance at identifying travellers likely to be influenza-infected. Although febrile illness is more common in influenza A infections than influenza B infections, many influenza A infections are afebrile.

Under 100 words is a good title length.", "input": "The host antiviral response involves the induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, including apoptosis, to limit viral replication and spreading. This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSVinfected cells. Collectively, our data unveils a previously unrecognized selective role of DUSP1 in the regulation of tissue damage and repair during infections by RSV and SeV. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to the Pneumoviridae family of large enveloped negative-sense ssRNA viruses that includes important human pathogens 1,2 . RSV is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections associated with morbidity and mortality in infants, children and elderly, but also adults of all-age with a compromised immune system, cardiopulmonary diseases or following transplantation 3,4 . The capacity of the host to mount an appropriate antiviral defense aimed at limiting virus replication and spreading is critical to determine the outcome of the infection. As a consequence, the inability of the host to sustain an antiviral response leads to failure in eradicating the infection. Conversely, uncontrolled duration or intensity of the response is harmful to the host and is associated with the development of virus-associated pathogenesis, chronic inflammatory diseases and various autoimmune diseases 5,6 . Therefore, these responses need to reach the ideal intensity and duration for efficient fighting of the infection while limiting tissue damage and promote tissue repair 7 . To this aim, the various components of the host antiviral defense, including the transcriptional induction of interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, such as apoptosis, are subjected to stringent regulation by both positive and negative mechanisms 8,9 . Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | 7: 17388 | Upon virus entry and sensing by the cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5), the mitochondrial membrane-associated adaptor (MAVS) coordinates multiple signalling pathways ultimately leading to the activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factors (IRF) 3/7, Nuclear Factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) 10-12 . Activation of IRF3 relies on a complex set of phosphorylations mainly mediated by the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/ I\u03baB kinase epsilon (IKK\u03b5) kinases 13-17 . NF-\u03baB, mainly p65/p50, activation during SeV and RSV infections occurs through I\u03baB kinase (IKK)-dependent phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor protein I\u03baB\u03b1 and of the p65 subunit 18, 19 . The signaling cascade leading to AP-1 activation is more elusive, but ultimately results in the phosphorylation of the nuclear Activating Transcription Factor 2 (ATF-2) and c-Jun subunits by JNK and p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) 10,20,21 . The activation of these transcription factors promotes the transcription of early antiviral genes, type I/III IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines 12, 22, 23 . In response to IFNs, hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are induced to limit virus replication through enhancement of virus detection and innate immune signaling, cytoskeleton remodelling, inhibition of protein translation, induction of apoptosis, amongst other antiviral functions 24-26 . These same PRRs have also been shown to activate IFN-independent cell death pathways, including apoptosis 8 . Post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and acetylation, of signal transduction proteins involved in the pathways engaged downstream of virus sensing are crucial to reach a fine-tuned regulation of the innate immune response 27 . In light of the very well documented importance of phosphorylation PTMs in the regulation of the antiviral response, the protein phosphatases negatively regulating the signaling events have started to be identified. The exact role of the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in the antiviral response remains elusive as PP1\u03b1 and PP1\u03b3 were found to dephosphorylate MDA-5 and RIG-I leading to their activation 28 , while they were also described to be responsible for the dephosphorylation of key C-terminal phosphoresidues of IRF3 leading to its inhibition 29 . Most likely reflecting the complexity of IRF3 regulation through phosphorylation at multiple C-terminal phosphoacceptor sites, two other phosphatases, the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) and MAPK phosphatase (MKP) 5, dephosphorylate IRF3 to terminate its activation 30-32 . The Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, Mg 2+ /Mn 2+ -dependent (PPM) 1B acts as a TBK1 phosphatase to inhibit IRF3 activation, while PPM1A targets both TBK1/IKK\u03b5 and MAVS for dephosphorylation to negatively regulate the antiviral response 33,34 . In the present study, we sought to address the role of the MKP-1/DUSP1 dual phosphatase (referred to thereafter as DUSP1) in the regulation of the host-defense against RSV and Sendai virus (SeV), a model paramyxovirus that is currently evaluated as a replication-competent backbone for the development of an RSV vaccine 3 . We demonstrate that DUSP1 is a negative regulator of RSV-and SeV-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. However, this function is neither linked to the inhibition of the antiviral response nor to the induction of a cytokine and chemokine response elicited during virus infection. Interestingly, we found that interaction of JNK by the JNK interacting protein (JIP) 1 scaffold protein, previously shown to be critical for AP-1 and downstream cytokine production specifically, protects JNK from dephosphorylation by DUSP1. Although we confirmed that a JNK/p38 signalling module is involved in the induction of virus-induced apoptosis, our data suggests that DUSP1 has a pro-apoptotic function independently of JNK and p38 during SeV infection. Finally, we found that DUSP1 dampens cell migration during RSV infection. Altogether, these findings point to a previously unrecognized role of DUSP1 in functions that have an impact on virus-associated tissue damage and repair.", "output": "DUSP1 regulates apoptosis and cell migration, but not the JIP1- protected cytokine response, during Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Sendai Virus infection OPEN", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Disease can result in poor feed conversion, reduced weight gain, and can lead to the development of necrotic enteritis. For prevention of coccidiosis, poultry are commonly vaccinated with a live, sporulated oocysts mass applied with a vaccination cabinet in the hatchery. Traditionally, coccidia vaccines have been applied by coarse spray in a water based diluent, however, new technology using gel diluents has entered the US market. Gel diluents can have variable viscosities and are \"dropped\" onto chicks with an applicator bar. It is thought that gel droplets remain intact on the birds for longer than water based droplets, allowing more time for preening and ingestion of oocysts. In this experiment, the efficacy of a commercial coccidia vaccine applied with a water based diluent, a more viscous gel diluent, and a less viscous gel diluent was compared. Fecal samples were collected at multiple time points post-vaccination to quantify vaccine oocyst shedding. Shedding in the first cycle (days 5 to 8 post-vaccination) was related to the number of oocysts received from each application method, where the groups receiving higher doses shed more oocysts. However, a decrease in shedding was seen for the more viscous gel group in the second cycle (days 12 to 15 post-vaccination). Chickens were challenged with Eimeria maxima oocysts and 7 days post-challenge body weight gains and gross and microscopic lesions were recorded to evaluate protection levels for the different vaccine applications. All vaccinated groups appeared to be protected based on body weight gain and lesion scoring.

Materials and methods: Plasma samples were extracted via solid-phase extraction (SPE), separated on a Zorbax SB-C18 column, detected by single quadruple mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization interface, and quantified using selected ion monitoring mode. The current SPE-HPLC-MS assay was validated for linearity, intra-day and inter-day precisions, accuracy, extraction recovery and stability. The method was applied to a comparative pharmacokinetic study after administration of Yu Ping Feng San to rats at different doses (10, 20 and 40 g/kg). Results: The calibration curves were linear over the ranges 0.50-50 ng/mL and 17.36-1736 ng/mL. Intra-and inter-day precisions (relative standard deviations) were from 0.45% to 10.95%, and accuracy (relative recovery) from 95% to 115%. The extraction recoveries were greater than 88.42% for all analytes. Dose-dependence was shown for some constituents in the drug concentration-time profiles.

However, factors that affect NDV replication in host cells are poorly understood. NDV generates long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules during transcription of single-stranded genomic RNA. Protein kinase R (PKR) is activated by dsRNA. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of PKR in NDV infection. Results: NDV infection led to the activation of dsRNA-dependent PKR and phosphorylation of its substrate, translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, in a dose-dependent manner by either the lentogenic strain LaSota or a velogenic strain Herts/33. PKR activation coincided with the accumulation of dsRNA induced by NDV infection. PKR knockdown remarkably decreased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation as well as IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels, leading to the augmentation of extracellular virus titer. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown or phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 or okadaic acid treatment significantly impaired NDV replication, indicating the critical role of the PKR/eIF2\u03b1 signaling cascade in NDV infection.

Despite its crucial role in the liver and HCV life cycle, little is known about the molecular mechanism of miR-122 expression regulation by HCV infection. Here, we show that the HCV core protein downregulates the abundance of miR-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression resulted in the dysregulation of the known functions of miR-122, including its proviral activity for HCV. By high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies, we found that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3 0 end by 3 0 -terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. Remarkably, the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. We found that these single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability over the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and that the 3 0 -terminal extension is catalyzed by the unique terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity of GLD-2, which is capable of adding any single ribonucleotide without preference of adenylate to the miR-122 3 0 end. The HCV core protein specifically inhibited GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm was found to be responsible for miR-122 downregulation. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 stability modulation. Viruses may benefit from altering the host cell's normal miRNA milieu, by either lowering or increasing antiviral or proviral miRNA levels. Our results reveal a mechanism by which virus infection can regulate miRNA abundance by modulating the activity of cellular enzymes responsible for miRNA 3 0 -terminal modifications.

The model includes immunization of susceptible people (S), quarantine (Q) of exposed people (E), isolation (J) of infectious people (I), a recovered population (R), and variation in population size due to natural births and deaths and deaths of infected people. It is shown analytically that the model has a disease-free equilibrium state which always exists and an endemic equilibrium state which exists if and only if the disease-free state is unstable. A simple formula is obtained for a generalized reproduction number R g where, for any given initial population, R g < 1 means that the initial population is locally asymptotically stable and R g > 1 means that the initial population is unstable. As special cases, simple formulas are given for the basic reproduction number R 0 , a disease-free reproduction number R d f , and an endemic reproduction number R en . Formulas are derived for the sensitivity indices for variations in model parameters of the disease-free reproduction number R d f and for the infected populations in the endemic equilibrium state.

A major reason for its continued dominance is its existence as many serotypes, determined by the surface spike protein (S), cross-protection being poor. Although controlled to some degree by live and inactivated vaccines, a new generation of IB vaccines is called for. Reverse genetic or 'infectious clone' systems, which allow the manipulation of the IBV genome, are key to this development. New vaccines would ideally be: genetically stable (i.e. maintain a stable attenuated phenotype); administered in ovo; and be flexible with respect to the source of the spike protein gene. Rational attenuation of IBV requires the identification of genes that are simultaneously not essential for replication and whose absence would reduce pathogenicity. Being able to modify a 'core' vaccine strain to make it applicable to a prevailing serotype requires a procedure for doing so, and the demonstration that 'spike-swapping' is sufficient to induce good immunity. We have demonstrated that four small IBV proteins, encoded by genes 3 and 5, are not essential for replication; failure to produce these proteins had little detrimental affect on the titre of virus produced. Our current molecularly cloned IBV, strain Beaudette, is non-pathogenic, so we do not know what effect the absence of these proteins would have on pathogenicity. That said, plaque size and composition of various gene 3/5 recombinant IBVs in cell culture, and reduced output and ciliostasis in tracheal organ cultures, shows that they are less aggressive than the wild-type Beaudette. Consequently these genes remain targets for rational attenuation. We have recently obtained evidence that one or more of the 15 proteins encoded by gene 1 are also determinants of pathogenicity. Hence gene 1 is also a target for rational attenuation. Replacing the S protein gene of Beaudette with that from the pathogenic M41 strain resulted in a recombinant virus that was still nonpathogenic but which did induce protection against challenge with M41. We have since made other 'spike-swapped' recombinants, including ones with chimaera S genes. Uniquely, our molecular clone of Beaudette is benign when administered to 18-day-old embryos, even at high doses, and induces immunity after this route of vaccination. Taken together, our results point to the creation of a new generation of IB vaccines, based on rational modification of the genome, as being a realisable objective.", "output": "Manipulation of the infectious bronchitis coronavirus genome for vaccine development and analysis of the accessory proteins \u0b1d", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that affects the entire brachial tree, and was one of the commonest underlying medical conditions among patients hospitalized with the 2009 pandemic influenza virus infection. Although respiratory virus infections are the major causes of asthma exacerbation, the mechanism by which influenza exacerbates asthma is poorly understood. Animal models of disease comorbidity are crucial to understanding host-pathogen interactions and elucidating complex pathologies. Existing murine models of influenza virus infection in asthmatics show that asthmatic mice are highly resistant to influenza virus infection, which contradicts clinical observations in humans. Here, we developed a murine model of influenza virus/asthma comorbidity using NC/Nga mice, which are highly sensitive to allergic reactions such as atopic dermatitis and allergic airway inflammation. This model was then used to examine the impact of allergic airway inflammation on lung pathology in the 2009 pandemic influenza virus infected mice. The results showed that induction of acute allergic airway inflammation in pre-existing influenza virus infection had additive effects on exacerbation of lung pathology, which mirrors findings in human epidemiological studies. In contrast, pre-existing allergic airway inflammation protected from subsequent influenza virus infection, which was compatible with those of previous murine models of influenza virus infection in asthmatic mice. These variable outcomes of this murine model indicate that the temporal relation between allergic airway inflammation and influenza virus infection might play a critical role in asthma and influenza comorbidity.

Most travellers, including one of the two patients (Case 1), visited local markets, where six of them consumed fruits. Two travellers, including Case 1, were exposed to coughing patients when visiting a hospital in Medina. Four travellers, including Case 1, visited two hospitals in Mecca. All travellers had been in contact with Case 1 while he was sick, with initially non-respiratory complaints. The cases were found to be older than the other travellers and both had co-morbidities. Conclusions: This epidemiological study revealed the complexity of MERS-CoV outbreak investigations with multiple potential exposures to MERS-CoV reported such as healthcare visits, camel exposure, and exposure to untreated food products. Exposure to MERS-CoV during a hospital visit is considered a likely source of infection for Case 1 but not for Case 2. For Case 2, the most likely source could not be determined. Exposure to MERS-CoV via direct contact with animals or dairy products seems unlikely for the two Dutch cases. Furthermore, exposure to a common but still unidentified source cannot be ruled out. More comprehensive research into sources of infection in the Arabian Peninsula is needed to strengthen and specify the prevention of MERS-CoV infections.", "output": "Travel-related MERS-CoV cases: an assessment of exposures and risk factors in a group of Dutch travellers returning from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, May 2014", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

With enhanced cellular uptake, the constructed AL/CS/DNA nanoparticles can deliver the anti-caries DNA vaccine pGJA-P/VAX into nasal mucosa. TEM results showed the AL/CS/DNA had a spherical structure. High DNA loading ability and effective DNA protection against nuclease were proved by gel electrophoresis. The surface charge of the AL/CS/DNA depended strongly on pH environment, enabling the intracellular release of loaded DNA via a pH-mediated manner. In comparison to the traditional CS/DNA system, our new design rendered a higher transfection efficiency and longer residence time of the AL/CS/DNA at nasal mucosal surface. These outstanding features enable the AL/CS/DNA to induce a significantly (p,0.01) higher level of secretory IgA (SIgA) than the CS/DNA in animal study, and a longer-term mucosal immunity. On the other hand, the AL/CS/DNA exhibited minimal cytotoxicity.

The spike glycoprotein of IBV is essential for host cell attachment, neutralization, and is involved in the induction of protective immunity. Previously obtained sequence data of the spike gene of IBV QX-like and Massachusetts strains were subjected to bioinformatics analysis. Findings: On analysis of potential phosphorylation sites, the Ser542 and Ser563 sites were not present in Massachusetts strains, while QX-like isolates did not have the Ser534 site. Massachusetts and QX-like strains showed different cleavage site motifs. The N-glycosylation sites ASN-XAA-SER/THR-55, 147, 200 and 545 were additionally present in QX-like strains. The leucine-rich repeat regions in Massachusetts strains consisted of stretches of 63 to 69 amino acids, while in the QX-like strains they contained 59 amino acids in length. An additional palmitoylation site was observed in CK/SWE/082066/2010 a QX-like strain. Primary structure data showed difference in the physical properties and hydrophobic nature of both genotypes. The comparison of secondary structures revealed no new structural domains in the genotypic variants. The phylogenetic analyses based on avian and mammalian coronaviruses showed the analysed IBV as closely related to turkey coronaviruses and distantly related to thrush and munia coronaviruses.

A significant number of people chronically infected with HCV develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of hepatocyte damage associated with chronic HCV infection are not fully understood yet, mainly due to the lack of an in vitro system able to recapitulate the stages of infection in vivo. Several studies underline that HCV virus replication depends on redox-sensitive cellular pathways; in addition, it is known that virus itself induces alterations of the cellular redox state. However, the exact interplay between HCV replication and oxidative stress has not been elucidated. In particular, the role of reduced glutathione (GSH) in HCV replication and infection is still not clear. We set up an in vitro system, based on low m.o.i. of Huh7.5 cell line with a HCV infectious clone (J6/JFH1), that reproduced the acute and persistent phases of HCV infection up to 76 days of culture. We demonstrated that the acute phase of HCV infection is characterized by the elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated in part with an increase of NADPH-oxidase transcripts and activity and a depletion of GSH accompanied by high rates of viral replication and apoptotic cell death. Conversely, the chronic phase is characterized by a reestablishment of reduced environment due to a decreased ROS production and increased GSH content in infected cells that might concur to the establishment of viral persistence. Treatment with the prooxidant auranofin of the persistently infected cultures induced the increase of viral RNA titer, suggesting that a prooxidant state could favor the reactivation of HCV viral replication that in turn caused cell damage and death. Our results suggest that targeting the redox-sensitive host-cells pathways essential for viral replication and/or persistence may represent a promising option for contrasting HCV infection.", "output": "Counteraction of HCV-Induced Oxidative Stress Concurs to Establish Chronic Infection in Liver Cell Cultures", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

CD147 is a unique protein in that it can function both at the cell membrane and after being released from cells where it continues to retain activity. Thus, the CD147 receptor functions through at least two mechanisms that include both cyclophilin-independent and cyclophilin-dependent modes of action. In regard to CD147 cyclophilin-independent activity, CD147 homophilic interactions are thought to underlie its activity. In regard to CD147 cyclophilin-dependent activity, cyclophilin/ CD147 interactions may represent a novel means of signaling since cyclophilins are also peptidylprolyl isomerases. However, direct evidence of catalysis has not been shown within the cyclophilin/ CD147 complex. In this report, we have characterized the solution behavior of the two most prevalent CD147 extracellular isoforms through biochemical methods that include gel-filtration and native gel analysis as well as directly through multiple NMR methods.

Differences in news frequency, framing and information source can impact the public's interpretation of risk messages and subsequent attitudes and behaviors about a particular threat. The media's framing of an outbreak is important, as it may affect both perception of risk and the ability to process important health information. Methods: To understand how risk communication by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the 2014 Ebola outbreak was framed and delivered and to what extent primetime broadcast news media mirrored CDC's framing and authoritative voice, 209 CDC communications and primetime broadcast transcripts issued between July 24 and December 29, 2014 were analyzed and coded by thematic frame and authoritative voice.

Although the pharmacological properties of these compounds include anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities, the antiviral effects of these compounds against human coronavirus (HCoV) remain unclear. Hence, the aims of the current study were to assess the antiviral activities of TET, FAN, and CEP and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in HCoV-OC43-infected MRC-5 human lung cells. These compounds significantly inhibited virus-induced cell death at the early stage of virus infection. TET, FAN, and CEP treatment dramatically suppressed the replication of HCoV-OC43 as well as inhibited viral S and N protein expression. The virus-induced host response was reduced by compound treatment as compared with the vehicle control.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of animal species and cause multiple respiratory outcomes of varying severity, including the common cold, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [13] . CoVs are subdivided into four genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-) [14] . Among the six CoVs isolated from humans [15], the World Health Organization declared that accelerated research and the development of antivirals for the treatment of emerging zoonotic viruses, including \u03b2-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), are urgently needed [16]. Since the mid-1960s, human coronavirus strains OC43 (HCoV-OC43; \u03b2-CoV) and 229E (\u03b1-CoV) have been considered as mostly responsible for the common cold [17, 18] . Notably, HCoV-OC43, which is the most prevalent subtype of HCoV [19] , is responsible for up to 30% of respiratory infections and can cause repeated reinfections throughout life [20, 21] . Moreover, HCoV-OC43 is most closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and shares several functional properties with both [22, 23] . Due to the similarities with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 has been used as an alternative model for research of these emerging viral strains to avoid the limitation of the requirement for a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antiviral activities of TET, as a herb-derived, small-molecule compound, in HCoV-OC43-infected MRC-5 fibroblasts derived from human lung tissue. The results showed that TET inhibited HCoV-OC43 infection of MRC-5 cells in a dose-dependent manner.

In vitro experiments using Pull-down assay and Co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) assay showed that GRFT binds to the JEV glycosylated viral proteins, specifically the enveloped (E) and premature (prM) glycoproteins. The binding of GRFT to the JEV was competitively inhibited by increasing concentrations of mannose; in turns abolished anti-JEV activity of GRFT. We suggested that, the binding of GRFT to the glycosylated viral proteins may contribute to its anti-JEV activity. Collectively, our data indicated a possible mechanism by which GRFT exerted its anti-JEV activity.

These parasites are transmitted by hippoboscid flies of the genus Olfersia; strong specificity has been suggested between the vector and its vertebrate host. We investigated the prevalence of Haemoproteus infection in Suliformes and hippoboscid flies in two oceanic islands of the Western Indian Ocean: Europa and Tromelin. In total, 209 blood samples were collected from great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) and red-footed boobies (Sula sula). Fortyone hippoboscid flies were also collected from birds. Seventeen frigatebirds and one fly collected on Europa tested positive for the presence of Haemoproteus parasites by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial sequences of the Cytochrome b gene showed that parasites were closely related to Haemoproteus iwa reported from frigatebirds in the Pacific Ocean and in the Caribbean. Plasmodium was also detected in a frigatebird on Europa; however, its placement on the phylogenetic tree could not be resolved. We provide strong support for transmission of blood parasites in seabirds in the Western Indian Ocean and suggest that migrations between the Pacific and the Indian oceans could favor the large-scale distribution of Haemoproteus iwa in frigatebird populations.

The GG genotype of rs2070788, a higher-expression variant of TMPRSS2, was a risk variant (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.77; P = .01) to severe A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza. A potentially functional single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs383510, accommodated in a putative regulatory region was identified to tag rs2070788. Luciferase assay results showed the putative regulatory region was a functional element, in which rs383510 regulated TMPRSS2 expression in a genotype-specific manner. Notably, rs2070788 and rs383510 were significantly associated with the susceptibility to A(H7N9) influenza in 102 patients with A(H7N9) influenza and 106 healthy controls.

The initial total protein concentration in blood did not differ between classifications. Cumulative milk replacer dry matter intake (DMI) and water consumed from milk replacer were significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves, because DIA calves were more likely to refuse milk replacer. Cumulative starter DMI was decreased for DIA versus HEA calves. As a result, cumulative total DMI was significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves. Cumulative free water intake did not differ between classifications. The DIA calves were more likely to receive electrolyte solution and have more days given electrolyte solution than HEA calves.

Initial BW did not differ between classifications; however, a classification \u00d7 time interaction for BW indicated that HEA calves were heavier than DIA calves and had greater ADG. Significant classification \u00d7 time interactions for hip height and heart girth revealed that HEA calves had a larger frame size.

Here we report the cryo-EM 24 structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 \u00c5 and 2.83 \u00c5 25 resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural 26 similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 27 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding.

Eventhough China achieved universal health insurance coverage in 2011, representing the largest expansion of insurance coverage in human history achieved; health inequality remains endemic in China. Lessons from the effect of market crisis on health equity in Europe and other places has reignited interest in exploring the potential healthcare market aberrations that can trigger distributive injustice in healthcare resource allocation among China's provinces. Recently, many healthcare investors in China have become more concerned about capital preservation, and are responding by abandoning long term investments strategies in healthcare. This investment withdrawal en mass is perceived to be influenced by herding tendencies and can trigger or consolidate endemic health inequality. Methods: Our study simultaneously employs four testing models (two state spaced models and two return dispersion models) to establish the existence of procyclical (herding) behavior among the stocks and its health equity implications. These are applied to a large set of data to compare and contrast results of herd formation among investors in fourteen healthcare sectors in China. Results: The study reveals that apart from the cross sectional standard deviation (CSSD) model, the remaining two models and our augmented state space model yields significant evidence of herding in all subsectors of the healthcare market. We also find that the herding effect is more prominent during down movements of the market. Conclusion: Herding behavior may lead to contemporaneous loss of investor confidence and capital withdrawal and thereby deprive the healthcare sector of the much needed capital for expansion. Thus there may be obvious delay in efforts to bridge the gap in access to healthcare facilities, medical support services, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, diagnostic substances, medical laboratory and advanced medical equipment across China. Moreover, a potential crash in the healthcare market is possible in the healthcare sector as a result of persistent herding tendencies among investors and that may have more damaging consequences for health inequality in China.", "output": "The effect of herd formation among healthcare investors on health sector growth in China", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Apoptosis is an effective means to sacrifice virus-infected host cells and therefore restrict the spread of pathogens. However, the underlying mechanisms of this process are still poorly understood.

MAVS specifically activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) but not other MAP kinases. Jnk22/2 cells, but not Jnk12/2 cells, are unable to initiate virus-induced apoptosis and SeV further fails to trigger apoptosis in MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7) knockout (Mkk72/2) cells. Mechanistically, MAVS recruits MKK7 onto mitochondria via its 3D domain, which subsequently phosphorylates JNK2 and thus activates the apoptosis pathway. Consistently, Jnk22/2 mice, but not Jnk12/2 mice, display marked inflammatory injury in lung and liver after viral challenge.

Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection. Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly up-regulated. Taken together, stimulated innate resistance appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens.

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg given twice daily for 1 day, followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 more days is recommended to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Abstract Background. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods. The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile. Results. Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 \u03bcM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 \u03bcM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance. Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to 4 / 25 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.", "output": "In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Despite the importance of ND to the poultry industry, little is known about PMV1 strain emergence events and the subsequent dispersal and evolution of new strains. The genotype VI-PMV1 was first identified in the 1980s and has been named pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV1) because of unusual host specificity with Columbiformes (Collins et al., 1996); it has been responsible for panzootics in both chickens and pigeons during that time. Here, we used evolutionary analyses to characterize the emergence of this contemporary PMV1 lineage. We demonstrate that GVI-PMV1 arose through cross-species transmission events from Galliformes (i.e. chicken) to Columbiformes, and quickly established in pigeon populations. Our studies revealed a close association between the time of viral emergence and panzootic events of this virus. The virus appeared first in Southeastern Europe and quickly spread across the European continent, which became the epicenter for global virus dissemination. With new viral gene sequences, we show that GVI-PMV1 viruses currently circulating in North America resulted from multiple invasion events from Europe, one associated with an exotic European Columbiformes species, and that extant lineages have diversified locally. This study extends our understanding of successful viral emergence subsequent to cross-species transmission and dispersal patterns of newly emerged avian viruses, which may improve surveillance awareness and disease control of this and other important avian pathogens.", "output": "Successful establishment and global dispersal of genotype VI avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 after cross species transmission", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a type I interferon induced ubiquitin-like modifier. In addition to conjugating to potentially hundreds of target proteins, ISG15 can be found in an unconjugated form both inside of the cell and released from interferon stimulated cells into the extracellular environment.

It begins by outlining an expanded understanding of security, describing the concept of health security, including the dual aspects of societal health security and individual, or personal, health security. The political context is also described. Key issues in societal health security are then outlined, including signi fi cant threats and current responses. Threats covered include the emergence of infectious diseases that cross the species barrier from animals to humans, climate change, the deliberate use of disease-causing agents and the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. Current approaches to addressing threats to societal health security are discussed, along with the role to be played by international affairs. The chapter then describes key issues in individual health security, including reliable access to medicines and other health-related products and services; and the politically and economically sensitive determinants of access. The chapter then discusses how to ensure stronger global health security in the future. Security can no longer be narrowly de fi ned as the absence of military threat from another state, as it was in the days when Adam Smith wrote his treatise on the duties of a government (Smith 1776 ) . Health security -protection from threats to healthis now recognized as an important non-traditional security issue. The global impacts of pandemic s, the rise in counterfeit medicines, the role of health provision in postcon fl ict environments and the centrality of improving universal access to effective health care to economic development are all examples of the growing intersection between global health issues and other dimensions of human security . Health security as broadly de fi ned has both a societal and an individual aspect. At the societal level, global health security means reducing collective vulnerability to global public health threats, both immediate and gradual. These threats often go beyond or transcend borders and may be caused by infectious agents that emerge naturally at the human/animal interface, but they may also be caused by chemicals, toxins and radiation, or be deliberately caused by acts of terrorism. The steady and increasing rise in non-communicable diseases also constitutes a threat to societal health security . Moreover, reducing vulnerability means, not only combating the disease threats themselves but also addressing their determinants, some of which may also transcend borders, such as international trade and other economic policies that in fl uence the emergence and spread of disease. Health security-protection from threats to health-is an important \u2022 human security issue. A series of emerging infectious diseases have challenged global \u2022 health security and economic stability. Stronger \u2022 health security requires an understanding of the determinants of infectious and non-communicable diseases and how and where intervention can decrease risks. Access to health care depends on a variety of factors ranging from effec-\u2022 tiveness of health systems and the cost of medicines to the role of governments providing health care. The \u2022 Oslo Ministerial Declaration stresses the convergence between foreign policy concerns for security and economic stability and global health issues. 127 9 Diplomacy and Global Health Security At the individual level, health security must include protection and provision measures such as access to safe and effective medicines, vaccines and medical care. Increasing personal health security thus means providing individuals with more sustained-and therefore secure-access to quality medical goods and services. Policies and strategies that are developed to address health security issues arise within a broad political context. Governance and policies in sectors outside health, such as agriculture, trade, fi nance, national security or defence, can have signi fi cant effects on health outcomes. Likewise, action aimed at improving health security can affect other sectors. For these reasons, when health security issues involve trans-border events and become international, they can encounter serious dif fi culties in bilateral relations, at international organizations and in diplomatic negotiations because of a divergence of political, economic or social interests among states, and between states and non-state actors. As examples: efforts to combat counterfeit, falsi fi ed and substandard medicines-which pose a signi fi cant danger to healthhave been hampered by the lack of a consensus de fi nition of counterfeit as it pertains to medicines. This in turn risks becoming embroiled in controversy over which institutions should have how much authority over the problem because issues other than health protection, such as trade, intellectual property and the fi ght against organized crime, are also at stake. To enable medicines and vaccines to reach those who need them, it is often necessary to address barriers such as trade, regulations and intellectual property rights. Responses to the threat or consequences of chemical and biological terrorism must involve not only public health but also national and international security and crime prevention agencies. Health security is an important foreign policy and diplomatic concern that is both in fl uenced by and affects decisions on national security, economic well-being, international development strategies and the protection of human dignity. Finding sustainable solutions to global needs in health security thus requires better understanding and collaboration between the international affairs and global health communities to achieve effective policies.", "output": "Diplomacy and Global Health Security Introduction: What Is Global Health Security and the Role of Diplomacy?", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

In addition to a role in development, recent evidence suggests that TBX2 and TBX3 are overexpressed in a number of cancers, including melanoma, breast, liver, lung, pancreas, ovarian, and cervical cancers. However, there is little information about the mechanisms for how these T-box genes contribute to tumorigenesis.

In this paper we describe the first real-time syndromic surveillance system that conducts integrated spatio-temporal analysis of data from a national network of veterinary premises for the early detection of disease outbreaks in small animals. We illustrate the system's performance using data relating to gastrointestinal disease in dogs and cats. the data consist of approximately one million electronic health records for dogs and cats, collected from 458 UK veterinary premises between March 2014 and 2016. For this illustration, the system predicts the relative reporting rate of gastrointestinal disease amongst all presentations, and updates its predictions as new data accrue. The system was able to detect simulated outbreaks of varying spatial geometry, extent and severity. The system is flexible: it generates outcomes that are easily interpretable; the user can set their own outbreak detection thresholds. the system provides the foundation for prompt detection and control of health threats in companion animals. Surveillance systems have been developed globally for animal and/or public health purposes, facilitating the prevention and control of disease or infection nationally and regionally. During the past decade, the emergence of new diseases 1 and the increasing threat of bio-terrorism have motivated the development of syndromic surveillance systems in public health focused on the early detection of health threats that require effective public health action 2,3 . Syndromic surveillance uses health-related data that precedes diagnosis. Although data of this kind are less specific than data from confirmed diagnoses they are typically more timely, which is an important consideration for real-time or near-real-time analysis and interpretation 4 . In veterinary medicine the development of systems for early health-event detection has followed a similar path to that previously taken in public health 5 . A recent inventory of current and planned European veterinary syndromic surveillance systems showed wide interest in European countries for syndromic surveillance, but also highlighted the novelty of this field 6 . Small companion animal populations largely lack co-ordinated national and international disease surveillance. This has produced a deficit in our understanding of the dynamics and burden of the full range of endemic/ emerging diseases in companion animals and leaves these populations susceptible to the emergence of health threats. Lack of disease surveillance also has implications for human health, as approximately 75 percent of new and emerging diseases are zoonotic 7 . However, as health records become digitised in veterinary practices they become more available for research 8 , providing an opportunity to improve companion animal syndromic surveillance in clinical settings and the possibility of linking this with human syndromic surveillance. Recently, electronic syndromic surveillance data on companion animals has become available in real-time on a national scale www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ without adjustment, on the grounds that multiple visits occurring within a short time period (e.g. within a few days) would likely indicate a more serious illness episode. Data summary. Of the 1,211,326 consultations collected between 1 st March 2014 and 29 th February 2016, 72.3% were for dogs and 27.7% for cats. In 80.7% of all consultations a valid age, breed-status (purebred or crossbred) and owner's full postcode were recorded; this subset of data is used for model selection and the basis for simulations. Gastrointestinal disease accounted for 4.0% of all presentations, amongst which 91.5% were recorded between Monday and Friday. Amongst animals presenting for GI disease, there was not a notable gender bias; 48.5% of dog consultations and 50.6% of cat consultations with a recorded sex were female. Where the breed-status was identified, 84.9% of dog GI disease consultations and 17.2% of cat GI disease consultations were purebreds. In animals with a date of birth recorded within the range 0 to 25 years, 65.4% of dog GI disease consultations and 47.4% of cat GI disease consultations were under eight years. The age profile of dogs and cats presenting for GI disease at SAVSNET veterinary premises stratified by sex and breed-status is shown in Table 1 . Data for the two species were analysed separately. We used the pet owner's home postcode to assign a measure of deprivation to each owner using the most recent English 17 , Scottish 18 and Welsh 19 Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) produced by their respective governments. A detailed description of how each government has developed their own measure of deprivation can be found elsewhere [20] [21] [22] . The three country-specific IMD measures are not directly comparable. We therefore included country as a three-level factor and rescaled the ranks of each country's set of IMD scores to the range 0 to 1. For example, if for England the maximum rank was 32,000 and a location had rank 100 then the owner IMD explanatory variable would be assigned a value of 100/32,000. \u2022 Scheme 1: The outbreak only affects the central premise of each set. For each, we simulate outbreaks of different severities, in which the probability of a case is 0.1, 0.15 or 0.2. This gives a total of 9 scenarios. \u2022 Scheme 2: The outbreak affects the central premise and all of its neighbouring premises. This leads to another 6 separate scenarios, as Schemes 1 and 2 are identical for the sparse set.

Macrophages play a central role in the pathogenesis of MHV-3-induced hepatitis. In the present study we have shown that MHV-3 infection of macrophages induces these cells to undergo apoptosis. Three methods to detect apoptosis were applied: flow cytometry analysis of nuclear DNA content, fluorescence microscopic visualization of apoptotic cells labeled by the TUNEL assay, and gel electrophoresis to detect DNA laddering. Apoptosis in A/J and BALB/c macrophages was first detected at 8 h postinfection (p.i.) and reached a maximum by 12 h p.i. The degree of MHV-3-induced apoptosis was much greater in A/J-derived macrophages than in BALB/c-derived cells. Apoptosis was inversely correlated with the development of typical MHV cytopathology, namely syncytia formation. Infected macrophages from A/J mice did not form synctia in contrast to the extensive synctia formation observed in BALB/c-derived macrophages. In MHV-3-infected BALB/c macrophage cultures, apoptotic cells were not incorporated into syncytia. Apoptosis was also inversely correlated with the expression of MHV-3-induced fgl2 prothrombinase in macrophages.

GLA loaded PLGA nanoparticles were prepared with different drug to polymer ratios, acetone contents and sonication times and the antibacterial activity of the developed nanoparticles was examined against different gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The antibacterial effect was studied using serial dilution technique to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of nanoparticles. Results demonstrated that physicochemical properties of nanoparticles were affected by the above mentioned parameters where nanoscale size particles ranging from 175 to 212 nm were achieved. The highest encapsulation efficiency (53.2 \u00b1 2.4%) was obtained when the ratio of drug to polymer was 1:4. Zeta potential of the developed nanoparticles was fairly negative (-11\u00b11.5). In-vitro release profile of nanoparticles showed two phases: an initial phase of burst release for 10 h followed by a slow release pattern up to the end. The antimicrobial results revealed that the nanoparticles were more effective than pure GLA against P. aeuroginosa, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. This improvement in antibacterial activity of GLA loaded nanoparticles when compared to pure GLA may be related to higher nanoparticles penetration into infected cells and a higher amount of GLA delivery in its site of action.

Therefore, the understanding of viral strategies to manipulate cell function disrupting plant defenses and enhancing viral infection cycles is fundamental to the production of virus-resistant plant lines. After invading susceptible plants, viruses create conditions that favor local and systemic infections by suppressing multiple layers of innate host defenses while use cellular machinery to own benefit. Viral interference in interlinked essential cellular functions results in phenotypic changes and disease symptoms, which debilitates plants favoring infection establishment. Herein in this review, the novelty it will be the discussion about the strategies used by (+) single strand RNA viruses to affect cellular processes and components to improve viral replication, in parallel to overcome plant defenses, favoring disease establishment by applying in one action using the same viral protein to coordinate viral replication and breaking down plant defense.

Autophagy has significant associations with neurodegenerative diseases, cardiomyopathies, cancer, programmed cell death, and bacterial and viral infections. During autophagy, a cup-shaped structure, the preautophagosome, engulfs cytosolic components, including organelles, and closes, forming an autophagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome, leading to the proteolytic degradation of internal components of the autophagosome by lysosomal lytic enzymes. During the formation of mammalian autophagosomes, two ubiquitylation-like modifications are required, Atg12-conjugation and LC3-modification. LC3 is an autophagosomal ortholog of yeast Atg8. A lipidated form of LC3, LC3-II, has been shown to be an autophagosomal marker in mammals, and has been used to study autophagy in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases, tumorigenesis, and bacterial and viral infections. The other Atg8 homologues, GABARAP and GATE-16, are also modified by the same mechanism. In non-starved rats, the tissue distribution of LC3-II differs from those of the lipidated forms of GABARAP and GATE-16, GABARAP-II and GATE-16-II, suggesting that there is a functional divergence among these three modified proteins. Delipidation of LC3-II and GABARAP-II is mediated by hAtg4B. We review the molecular mechanism of LC3-modification, the crosstalk between LC3-modification and mammalian Atg12-conjugation, and the cycle of LC3-lipidation and delipidation mediated by hAtg4B, as well as recent findings concerning the other two Atg8 homologues, GABARAP and GATE-16.

Moreover, we found that mouse hybridomas secreting IgG antibodies also have membrane form IgG expression without Ig\u03b1. Based on this surface IgG, we used flow cytometry to isolate rare \u03b32a isotype switched variants from a \u03b32b antibody secreting hybridoma cell line. Also, we used fluorescent antigen to single cell sort antigen binding hybridoma cells from bulk mixture of fused hybridoma cells instead of the traditional multi-microwell plate screening and limiting dilution sub-cloning thus saving time and labor. The IgG monoclonal antibodies specific for the native antigen identified with these methods are suitable for in vivo therapeutic uses, but also for sandwich ELISA assays, histology, flow cytometry, immune precipitation and x-ray crystallography.

Recent studies demonstrate that miRNAs can also strongly affect the replication of pathogenic viruses. For example, cellular miRNAs can target and repress the expression of viral mRNAs, but there is also at least one example of a cellular miRNA that stimulates virus replication. Furthermore, viruses can encode their own miRNAs, trigger changes in cellular miRNA expression or encode RNA silencing suppressor factors that inhibit cellular miRNAs. These interactions together form a complex regulatory network that controls both viral and host gene expression, which ultimately determines the outcome of viral infection at the cellular level and disease progression in the host. Here, we summarize the literature data on such virus-cell interactions in mammals and discuss how miRNAs can be used as research tools or targets in the development of novel antiviral therapeutics. Early studies in plants showed that small RNA-induced gene silencing is a potent antiviral mechanism that plants need to survive viral infection (1). Since then, it has become clear that there are many more aspects to the interaction between the RNA silencing mechanism -in plants, insects and mammals -and viral infection. Since RNA silencing is a central regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic cell biology, it is involved in many different cellular processes. These processes not only include cell development, differentiation and proliferation, but also cell death, metabolism, transposon silencing and antiviral defences (2).

It occurs in biological systems such as spherical viruses, which utilize icosahedral symmetry as a guiding principle for the assembly of coat proteins into a capsid shell. In this study, we characterize the self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) system, which was inspired by such viruses. To facilitate self-assembly, monomeric building blocks have been designed to contain two oligomerization domains. An N-terminal pentameric coiled-coil domain is linked to a C-terminal coiled-coil trimer by two glycine residues. By combining monomers with inherent propensity to form five-and threefold symmetries in higher order agglomerates, the supposition is that nanoparticles will form that exhibit local and global symmetry axes of order 3 and 5. This article explores the principles that govern the assembly of such a system. Specifically, we show that the system predominantly forms according to a spherical core-shell morphology using a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering. We introduce a mathematical toolkit to provide a specific description of the possible SAPN morphologies, and we apply it to characterize all particles with maximal symmetry. In particular, we present schematics that define the relative positions of all individual chains in the symmetric SAPN particles, and provide a guide of how this approach can be generalized to nonspherical morphologies, hence providing unprecedented insights into their geometries that can be exploited in future applications.", "output": "Article Principles Governing the Self-Assembly of Coiled-Coil Protein Nanoparticles", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

These morphologies are intricately related to cellular functions, enabling and regulating fundamental membrane processes. However, the biophysical mechanisms at the origin of these complex geometries are not fully understood from the standpoint of membrane-protein coupling. In this work, we focused on a minimal model of helicoidal ramps representative of specialized endoplasmic reticulum compartments. Given a helicoidal membrane geometry, we asked what is the distribution of spontaneous curvature required to maintain this shape at mechanical equilibrium? Based on the Helfrich energy of elastic membranes with spontaneous curvature, we derived the shape equation for minimal surfaces, and applied it to helicoids. We showed the existence of switches in the sign of the spontaneous curvature associated with geometric variations of the membrane structures. Furthermore, for a prescribed gradient of spontaneous curvature along the exterior boundaries, we identified configurations of the helicoidal ramps that are confined between two infinitely large energy barriers.

Proteins have kept or gained their functions during molecular evolution. Their functions seem to be flexible, and a few amino acid substitutions sometimes cause drastic changes in function. In order to monitor and predict such drastic changes in the early stages in target populations, we need to identify patterns of structural changes during molecular evolution causing decreases or increases in the binding affinity of protein complexes. In previous work, we developed a likelihood-based index to quantify the degree to which a sequence fits a given structure. This index was named the sequence-structure fitness (SSF) and is calculated empirically based on amino acid preferences and pairwise interactions in the structural environment present in template structures. In the present work, we used the SSF to develop an index to measure the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes defined as the log likelihood ratio, contrasting the fitness of the sequences to the structure of the complex and that of the uncomplexed proteins. We applied the developed index to the complexes formed between influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) and four antibodies. The antibody-antigen binding region of HA is under strong selection pressure by the host immune system. Hence, examination of the long-term adaptation of HA to the four antibodies could reveal the strategy of the molecular evolution of HA. Two antibodies cover the HA receptor-binding region, while the other two bind away from the receptor-binding region. By focusing on branches with a significant decline in binding ability, we could detect key amino acid replacements and investigate the mechanism via conditional probabilities. The contrast between the adaptations to the two types of antibodies suggests that the virus adapts to the immune system at the cost of structural change.", "output": "A Likelihood-based Index of Protein-Protein Binding Affinities with Application to Influenza HA Escape from Antibodies", "category": "Title Generation 275.json"}]
