We ordered escargot and artichoke to start. Escargot was covered in a bitter green sauce- butter and garlic would have really helped. The artichoke wasn't cooked properly and was minimally seasoned. It was also small portions, about a fourth of an artichoke in size. Even after sending back the artichoke it still was tough and not fully cooked. We ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected. For $35 we received two lamb chops with a tasty mustard sauce but the accompanying vegetables were tasteless and again, disappointing. The ambiance and service was great and we had a yummy creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e brought to our table for the birthday we were celebrating but we wished the rest of the meal had lived up to the hype.", "output": "negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

First of all, I love the name of this place. I had never been here before but my friend recommended it as she lived in the area. The cafe is on the smaller side in terms of available seating, but the kitchen space is much bigger, as they not only serve bubble tea, but breakfast and snacks too. I didn't check out the food menu, but the drinks menu is quite extensive. I really liked that they offered two different sizes for the bubble tea. There are just some days where a full size is too much, but the smaller size (500mL at $3.50) was very reasonable, and still more than enough to get your fix. I'm a bubble tea purist at heart so I ordered the milk tea with pearls, half sweet. I loved it. The bubbles were soft and chewy, the perfect consistency. The milk tea was also nice and refreshing, and tasted like actual black tea rather than the powdery milk tea drinks I'm usually accustomed to. Although I had ordered it half sweet, it still had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I've had bubble teas in the past where my teeth literally ached from all the sugar, but this one was just right. They also have daily $2 specials which is practically unheard of in this day and age.

We narrowed our choice on a specific car. We got an offer from a different dealership but decided to go to HC, since they were closer, and to offer them to sell the same car to us for a comparable price. We call them and ask them if they have this car on the lot. They say: yes, several of them. We go there. The guy we talk to (Keith?) has the sleaziest demeanor. His entire desk is full of pictures of his family (and by full I mean like 20) and awards saying 'master of excellence'. Im sure he has a Ph.D. in Awesomeness, too, but he doesnt have physical space to display that.He tells us we want a good car, which everybody wants , but the trouble is (wait for it!) no dealer in New England has it. He is able to check that. No, really. Since we had an offer we told him we would check that other place first... unless he wants to give us an offer. He says that other dealer is lying to us that he has a car and that he needs to go and check if they will be able to get that very rare car for us and THEN well talk price.Lets pause for a minute. Suppose youre a Honda dealer and you honestly dont have a relatively popular car. Wouldnt you start your day by calling whomever and find out when the next arrivals will be? I mean, you do expect customers inquiring, dont you? Of course, you would. Either he didnt have a car or he knew he didnt want to sell it to us at the price that we wanted. Either way he was lying to us.So he left the desk, and we checked our emails for a while and then we simply got up and left. I know they think if they waste enough of our time we will feel like we owe them for the big trouble that they went through on our behalf. Like I said... I guess its working on some people. Why else would they try it on us? As we were walking to the door the receptionist tipped the salesman that we were leaving and he ran after us but we didnt stop. He called me like 8 times and I didnt answer.We went to that other place the same day and bought the car. In summary: do research online, BID ONLINE. Dont ever go to the dealership without a firm price promised and a VIN of the vehicle that they say they have. Never trust a car dealer to tell the truth. Doesnt mean you should fight them. But if the only way you know something is through them telling you then you simply dont know it. Always, ALWAYS, be prepared to walk out at any stage. Some people say, signing should take hours. FALSE! Tell them you will walk out if they do one wrong move AND MEAN IT. They will do ALL paperwork in less than an hour. Most of us want cars that are in abundance. Understand that and you will immediately understand that you should be the one in charge during the whole process.Heres a more detailed account of our buying process: http://www.yelp.com/biz/silko-honda-raynham#hrid:k-v7aipcorfBAbBVzwWKcw", "output": "negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. So I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing.

The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting.

I would have brought it up, but the server was too busy talking to her friend to ever come back to check in on us.The server was talking to her friend/customer/acquaintance the entire time even so much that she took my plate of food and threw it away without even asking if I wanted a to-go box - which I wanted to take home with me. When confronted, she asked me why I didn't say anything - then apologized and offered me more eggs to take home with me. Cooking up more eggs for me to take home just didn't make sense to me. She then offered me potatoes with salsa, when I just would have preferred for them to have done the right thing and comped my meal.. (I had eaten only a 1/4 of my food.) ALL WHILE TALKING TO HER FRIEND at another table.She was nice enough, though her behavior was extremely unprofessional.This was my sixth visit and I will not eat here ever again. It was just a waste of money. I work in the service industry and wasting my money on a terrible experience is ridiculous.

I ordered a laffa shawarma and it's solid. The one star is for their horribly rude service. I was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night (Mar 17), walked in close to 8:30p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened. The lights were still on at Yalla, three behind the counter, with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier. There was no sign of closing down/wrapping up/adding up receipts, etc. I asked if they were still open and she said yes. When ordering, I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it's not specified on the menu, she was curt and said chicken. I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there's no one waiting behind me. The second server (woman) gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one (now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers). There's no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering (that I can see). It was my first time at Yalla so I wasn't familiar with what they have. KSM is an open space so when it's not packed, there's echo. The girl was very soft-spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions. She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away. I actually wasn't the last customer, they took orders from two other after me.Point of the story is, I understand that it's end of the day and you were supposed to close at 8:30p, that was why I asked if you guys were still open. The second you said yes, you had committed to deliver. If you were going to be rude and act annoyed (i'm actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it's end of day and it's not because of their personalities), then don't say yes; apologize and said you were closing, I would have come back next time I am at KSM.

I once had lunch here three weekdays in a row. (And Im not ashamed to admit that that was just last week.)Dua is admittedly not the most 'ethnic' restaurant out there -- you wont find an expansive menu with all sorts of obscure Vietnamese eats. But then again, this is downtown Atlanta, not Buford Highway. What you will find is a simple menu that appeals to most, if not all, palates, offering up many varieties of pho (a noodle soup), bun (a cold noodle dish), com (a rice dish), mi xao (a stir fried noodle dish), and salad.Ive had the opportunity to try quite a few of the dishes here, and theyre all quite good:- #1 Beef Pho (regular $6.25, large $6.95): A good-sized portion, though not the largest Ive seen. The flavor tends to be consistently spot on. Garnishes, however, are limited to a small plate of sprouts and basil leaves.- C3 Grilled Shredded Pork & Eggs ($6.95): One of my favorite dishes here. The pork is juicy, tender, and flavorful. But its the runny fried egg on top that brings everything together. Note that this dish ought to be pretty inoffensive, even to those completely unfamiliar with Vietnamese cuisine.- B1 Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio ($6.95): I cant get enough of the grilled pork here. Here, its served over cold vermicelli, very lightly dressed with, among other things, fish sauce (I think). Served with a crispy, chopped egg roll.- M1 Pork Mi Xao ($6.95): Stir fried noodles. Given the nature of this dish, its a bit blander and a bit less satisfying than the rest, but its still quite good.While Dua, like most casual downtown eateries, is only open for lunch, it gets absolutely slammed at that hour. The result is that their operation has grown to become pretty efficient -- stand in line against the wall, on which multiple copies of the menu are plastered; order at one of the two registers, where you pay and pick up a number; get your drink, silverware, and napkins; find a seat on the main level, outside, or downstairs; and wait for your food to be delivered. All very business. Note that most of the tables are designed for one or two diners, so  you might have to go outside, go downstairs, or move around some furniture for larger parties.Ill definitely be back -- maybe next week, Ill try for four.", "output": "positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

Sweet mother of Jesus, I bet they were serving avocados and guacamole during the inflation crisis of the Seventies. Even the sour cream was runny. The al pastor in my enchiladas tasted like charred bark dust after it had been shoveled from a closed down elementary school on a dreary and drizzly November day. Oh, and enchilada sauce? Must have been an afterthought, or was that it wasn't there because you burnt it all to hell and had a hard time scraping it off the bottom of the pot with a knife? Seriously, to hell with this place, and I'm talking at least Dante's third level.", "output": "negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

The visit was quick, painless and professional for my little sister (13 at the time). I've seen my mom deal with too many dentists who overcharge or provide a poor service, treating it more like a car repair than an operation... Dr. Brandon's is different, and I can tell she couldn't be happier. Plus, if my little sister gave a thumbs up, I know it's the place to go. I'd definitely recommend them for any visit :)", "output": "positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

I like the decor a lot, it's very warm and feels very nostalgic. They have alcoholic coffee drinks for $7, but they were running a special on one that was $5. I believe the slice of pie was $4.75. I had the chocolate, which was so rich I couldn't finish it. They seemed to be quite busy, with a mixed crowd of old & young.

I just went yesterday and stayed for four hours on a date. Time of my life! It was Monday so they were running the $10.95 unlimited bowling, pool, laser tag plus a game card per person. Talk about a good deal. My date and I played bowling til our thumbs hurt, I whipped him in pool and we even did the gravity ropes. It was kinda scary for me but fun nonetheless. This is a such a nice date spot! Afterwards we had food and OMG the wings were sooooo good! If you're into wings try the sweet baby rays flavor. You won't be able to stop eating. Also...don't get me started about the cinnamon sugar donut holes. I was in heaven the whole time I was eating them lol. I didn't expect the food to be so good at an entertainment center of this size but they did not disappoint!I will most definitely be back.
