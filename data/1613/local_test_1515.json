I did try to talk to him through December because I heard his father passed away and I guess I just haven't gotten over him. He has a girlfriend now and he knows I still have feelings for him, but he keeps doing little things like send stuff over to my house or say good things about me when I'm not around and even asks people stuff about me. It really does make me happy, but I know it's not healthy and I want to completely change my life, hence the school change. But he is putting his relationship in the pits and I understand why he could feel like I've been leading him on since everyone knows I never stopped loving him. In fact, it is so hard for me to not fall into his arms right now, but I want to grow and start afresh. His current girlfriend has stopped talking to him and I think they're on the verge of a break up and I can't help but think it's because he thought he could be with me. I've never stopped hurting from how we left things two years ago but I don't believe any good can come of this.

Looking back on it now it was something I jumped into too soon as I really didn\u2019t know her all that much. Things went smoothly for the first year and then things started to go downhill.\n\nThis girl had some pretty bad social and mental issues (social anxiety, depression of some degree, and even lived in a not so supporting household). This led to her being a girl who kept to herself mostly, even from her boyfriend. It would be a journey just to find her in the morning, as she didn\u2019t have a phone.\n\nThen her problems got worse, to the point of her cutting herself. This is when she completely separated herself from everyone, including me. She would barely talk to me and seeing her so broken and hurt made me as a boyfriend feel useless and pathetic. \n\nI felt horrible that I couldn\u2019t help her. She was very much in a bad place and there was nothing I could do.  I wanted her to be able to find someone who could help her with her issues.\n\nWith us being so separated, I started losing the feelings for her I used to have and started getting feelings for another girl who shared feelings back. It was a feeling I missed. \n\nAfter a month of this, I told my current girlfriend that I wanted to end our relationship and told her that I was losing feelings and that I felt that she needed to find someone who could actually help her with her problems. This went over like a car on bricks.\n\nImmediately, word went round that I left her for another girl and that I broke up with her because of her mental issues. People HATED me. They didn\u2019t know my side of the story and didn\u2019t bother to find out. The took the word of the innocent, shy girl.\n\nThree months later and that girl is more social than she ever was. She\u2019s actually talking to people in our school. So i don\u2019t know if I was holding her back or if she just randomly became social. \n\nSo the question is Am I The Asshole that everyone thinks I still am?", "output": "HISTORICAL", "category": "Text Categorization 910.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote.

This will be long, very long, I apologize. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nMy dad has always had terrible anxiety that he never bothered to treat for a variety of reasons. He is terrified of public transit, high winds, pit bulls, crowded spaces, so many things, and it's a very legitimate fear to him. Sometimes he seems to know his fears are irrational, but that doesn't stop them. This has shaped my childhood in many ways, for example I wasn't allowed to get my driver's license until I was 20 but also not allowed to ride my bike anywhere farther then a mile away, take the bus, or ride with any but a few friends of mine he trusted. Growing up with these restrictions and fears turned me into a bit of a nervous shut-in. At 22 I started to get very sick, we later found out I have multiple sclerosis. This ramped his anxiety up to a new level and also ensured I would be living at home with him for much longer. During this time my parents took care of everything I needed, even though I could barely move. Medical care cost them more then I can ever pay back and they don't even want me to pay them back. I am very grateful. \n\nMy boyfriend of the time understood I needed extensive care but was also going crazy living at my parents' home, so he invited me to live with him. My dad didn't allow it but I left anyway. After a few months he understood and accepted it. It helps that my then-boyfriend now husband is a wonderful person and my dad loves him.\n\nA few years later he had his first heart attack. This ramped his anxiety up again but also prompted him to finally accept treatment. Sadly, he stuck with the first medication he was given and it only works a little bit and he left his first counseling session in the middle and refuses to return. Still, his anxiety went down for a while and our relationship started to flourish. I even managed to have a few conversations with him about his overzealous restrictions. \n\nWhen I was 29 four major things happened: I got unexpectedly pregnant (surprise! You're not infertile!), something horrible that is a different story left my fiance and I effectively homeless, my dad had a second and much worse heart attack, followed by open heart surgery, and my MS went into remission. All of these things sent my dad's anxiety spiraling out of control. He can't sleep, he has lost way too much weight, he doesn't eat much, and he is well on his way to a third heart attack from anxiety alone! But he will not have the doctor look at his anxiety medication or return to counseling. \n\nMy husband and I frantically searched for a place we could afford to rent that we could move into right now and would allow our pets and actually found the perfect place... directly across the street from my parents' house. It won't be so bad, right? Plus, it's not like we could find another place like that on such short notice. We knew we were wrong when my parents cornered our new landlord and managed to convince him to give them our keys. Naturally, they made copies of every single one. We very excitedly prepared for our baby, and I started moving around and getting out more, realizing how hard life can be when you are unable to get out at all. We learned that I was capable of caring for a child with a few accommodations in our home but still not able to hold a regular job and I became a stay at home mom. It didn't take long before it was glaringly obvious I could not raise a healthy child shut in the house, so I learned how to use public transit. \n\nNow, I am 33 and married with a healthy, very active, and not remotely anxious four year old son and another son due in March. I am mostly blind and my MS has returned, but it's not as bad as it was. I am very familiar with the public transit system in our city, and it's not a bad one. My dad is retired and spends most of his time watching our house from his kitchen window. He calls me to ask where I am going and ask me not to go there every single time he sees me heading anywhere, even the grocery store he wants to come with. Everywhere non-essential he tells me not go. If he had his way, his grandson would never go to the park or public pool. He regularly goes through my mail and even more regularly lets himself in my house, where he proceeds to fiddle with my thermostat and simultaneously lecture me over a mess that usually doesn't even exist and also lecture me for \"pushing myself too far.\" My son thinks his grandfather is the best thing since ice cream and I don't want to separate him but he is starting to avoid some of his favorite activities, such as digging in the dirt, because his grandfather told him it is too dangerous and this is infuriating me and potentially harming my boy. \n\nFor a while I would compromise by staying home about half the time he asked me or asking him to drive us instead if it bothered him, but this only made my dad more upset and he started to do things such as hide my stroller or \"borrow\" my cane to make sure it was very hard for me to get anywhere. Keep in mind that I may now be a grown and married adult who takes care of myself and my own with an involved and loving husband, but the idea of telling my parents \"no\" terrifies me and I just can't bring myself to do things that will probably burn bridges with them, such as changing our locks or reporting my dad for tinkering with our mail. So now I just take the longer path out of our neighborhood, trying to stay in the blind spot I know my parents' kitchen window has, pretend my phone is broken and sometimes doesn't ring when he calls, and go wherever. I guarantee my son has benefited from seeing more places and getting out to play more often, and I have benefited as well. My dad however, gets nearly apoplectic. I have tried to talk about it, but he asks me to \"compromise\" each time for his sake, but there is never anything for me in his supposed compromise. I know this is making him nervous and paranoid and putting his heart at risk, but frankly he would be nervous and paranoid anyway. \n\nTL;DR: Life makes my dad nervous and he wants me to never do anything ever, he watches me to make sure I never do anything. I recently realized I am an adult and can ignore him so I do stuff anyway. Turns out I like doing stuff.\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for ignoring my dad's anxiety and not staying home with a rambunctious preschooler, even though it could possibly help him avoid a third heart attack?", "output": "HISTORICAL", "category": "Text Categorization 910.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote.

I wouldn't invite any of my 16 (8 by blood, the other 8 married in) aunts and uncles, any of their children, and not my even my sibling. My sibling hasn't made an effort to keep in contact with me since they moved to the other side of the country.

I love my grandparents and stop by all the time to see them, and it breaks my heart that the have about 50 grandkids and great grand kids (ages range from almost 40 to 3), and none of them stop by or even call.
