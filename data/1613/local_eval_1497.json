A list is shown by two brackets and comma-separated numbers and characters inside, like ['1', '12', 'l']. You need to concatenate all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element, and then reverse the resulting string. 'i' and 'j' will be non-negative, and will always have a value less than the length of A. 'i' will always be less than 'j'. Perform the operations in order, i.e., do not reverse first and then concatenate.", "input": "5, 6, ['5261', '2559', '9753', 'C', 'G', '3537', 'e', 'X', '1617', 'C']", "output": "7353G", "category": "Program Execution 895.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given inputs 'i', 'j', and A, where 'i' and 'j' are integers and A is a list.
