Given the type of news coverage he gets, it may surprise you to learn that John Mayer is also a musician. His major-label debut, Room for Squares, came out in 2001, and within two years he was rewarded with his first Grammy win, followed by praise from every corner of the music industry, from blues masters (B.B. King and Eric Clapton) to rap stars (Kanye West and Jay-Z) to Nashville standouts (the Dixie Chicks and Brad Paisley). His gentle voice and introspective lyrics looked back to 1970s songwriters like James Taylor, and his guitar playing was versatile and masterful. \n  \n  \n  \n There hadn\u2019t been a new solo male rock star in the music business since Lenny Kravitz, and Mayer fit the bill. He wrote hit songs\u2014the ballads \u201cDaughters,\u201d which went to number one, \u201cYour Body Is a Wonderland\u201d and \u201cSay,\u201d the peppy and clever \u201cNo Such Thing,\u201d the bluesy \u201cGravity\u201d and the soulful \u201cWaiting on the World to Change\u201d\u2014that were solidly constructed from warm sentiments and sophisticated music detail. He wrote \u201csome of the most women\u2014friendly anthems this side of Eve Ensler,\u201d one journalist swooned. Not since Sting had a male singer been both so popular and so respected. \n  \n  \n  \n And so handsome, too. Mayer, a taut six-foot-three, was soon dating the kind of beauties who populate magazine covers: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Cameron Diaz and Minka Kelly, most recently seen on the arm of Derek Jeter. In 2006 he surprised some fans by dating Jessica Simpson, who seemed (musically at least) the antithesis of what he stood for. Alongside his music career he\u2019s lately had a parallel life as a tabloid topic, due to his romance with actress Jennifer Aniston. They were together from April 2008 to March 2009, including a two-month breakup during their summer together. After he and Aniston split, Mayer released Battle Studies, the best record of his career, a set of related songs in which he mourns lost love, rejoices in his independence and castigates himself for romantic failure. \n  \n  \n  \n Mayer grew up in Fairfield, Connecticut, the second of three boys raised by Margaret, an English teacher, and Richard, a high school principal 19 years older than his wife. John\u2019s guitar prowess led him to the Berklee College of Music, which he left after two semesters to begin a career in Atlanta.

Cantor (R-Va.) and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in 2011. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) \n  \n The 99-page plan is Ryan's last budget as head of the Budget Committee and amounts to a personal manifesto on government austerity from a man who has emerged as the GOP\u2019s leading light on fiscal policy. Term-limited as head of the budget panel, Ryan is vying to become chairman of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee next year, while still mulling a bid for president in 2016. \n  \n Ryan uses his final budget to distance himself from a tax overhaul advocated by the outgoing Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), who on Monday announced plans to retire. The Ryan budget does not contain a counterproposal to Camp's, except to reassert the goal of a top individual tax rate of 25 percent, collapsing the current seven individual income-tax brackets into two brackets and calling for consideration of several ideas to overhaul the tax system. \n  \n Ryan also proposes no increase in defense spending, instead adhering to the discretionary spending caps he negotiated with Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) in December. \n  \n The House Budget Committee is expected to debate and pass the spending plan Wednesday, and GOP leaders have said they will hold a vote on Ryan's proposal. It is uncertain whether the proposal will be acceptable to a majority of House Republicans, a group often sharply divided on spending matters, and to the broader GOP establishment, which is carefully tracking policy proposals from potential presidential candidates. \n  \n The White House rejected Ryan's plan and said in a statement that it \"would slow the economy, stack the deck against the middle class and threaten the guaranteed benefits seniors have paid for and earned.\" \n  \n Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) slammed the proposal as \"Kochtopia,\" or fulfilling the requests of conservative businessmen Charles and David Koch, who are financing tens of millions of dollars in advertisements this year to discredit Democratic congressional candidates. And House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters that the proposal is \"an unserious partisan budget\" and \"as unrealistic as previous budgets \u2014 and some would argue even more so.\" \n  \n But any fighting between Democrats and Republicans on spending will not result in the deadline-driven battles of recent years. That's because the House and Senate agreed this year to a spending plan that runs through the end of fiscal 2015. While the GOP-controlled House is expected to debate and pass Ryan's plan, it will serve only as a political show vote since Democrats controlling the Senate do not plan to propose or vote on a budget plan. \n  \n Ryan's plan recycles several proposals from previous years that remain popular with GOP lawmakers, including repealing the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. But he keeps the taxes and cuts to Medicare mandated by the law. He calls for privatizing Medicare by changing it from an entitlement program into a voucher-style program. Democrats have previously opposed this proposal and used it as the centerpiece of their arguments against Ryan\u2019s spending proposals. He also proposes cuts to other domestic agencies, reductions in the size of the federal workforce and cuts in retirement benefits for federal workers. And he once again fails to provide a plan to overhaul Social Security. \n  \n Ryan released a stinging critique of the government's anti-poverty policies last month and billed it as a prelude to his budget plan. But the proposal lacks a full welfare reform plan and provides few ideas on overhauling the nation\u2019s social programs, instead advocating smaller steps that would \"encourage work\" and seek to boost economic growth. \n  \n Ryan does propose turning the federal food stamp program, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), into a block grant program \"tailored for each state\u2019s low-income population.\" Reforms would include stiffer work requirements and new education and job training requirements. The proposal builds on changes pushed by Republicans in the most recent farm bill, which authorizes SNAP funding. None of Ryan's proposed changes to the program would begin until the next farm bill is authorized in 2019 and would save nearly $125 billion over a decade. \n  \n Overall, Ryan would cut about $5.1 trillion from projected spending over the next decade, with nearly $3 trillion coming from repealing the health-care law and revamping Medicaid. Still, Ryan's proposals fall short of balancing the budget, forcing him to resort to a vague promise of new revenue from \"economic growth\" to meet his goal of wiping out deficits by 2024. \n  \n The new budget plan is dramatically different in structure from any of Ryan's previous proposals, which were mostly sweeping vision statements. The proposal unveiled Tuesday plods function-by-function through the dozens of appropriations categories, with the aim apparently of recommending savings in each category. That bodes well for plans to conduct a full appropriations process in the House and Senate this year, but it results in more modest proposals than in years past. \n  \n Lori A. Montgomery contributed to this report. \n  \n Read the full Ryan proposal here. ||||| Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Tuesday unveiled a budget that proposes to cut $5.1 trillion over a decade in a bid to erase the federal deficit, while calling once again for dramatic changes to Medicare, Medicaid and the tax code. \n  \n Ryan fiscal year 2015 budget resolution \n  \n Read more from The Hill: \n  \n Ryan's final $5.1T cut ||||| WASHINGTON \u2014 The unveiling Tuesday of Representative Paul D. Ryan\u2019s newest Republican budget may have redrawn the battle lines for the 2014 election, detailing what his party could do with complete control of Congress and allowing Democrats to broaden the political terrain beyond health care and the narrower issues of the minimum wage and unemployment benefits. \n  \n Mr. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman and a possible White House contender in 2016, laid out a budget plan that cuts $5 trillion in spending over the next decade. He said it would bring federal spending and taxes into balance by 2024, through steep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, and the total repeal of the Affordable Care Act just as millions are reaping the benefits of the law. \n  \n Defense spending would increase. Domestic programs would be reduced to the lowest levels since modern government accounting. And Medicare would be converted into a \u201cpremium support\u201d system, where people 65 and older could buy private insurance with federal subsidies instead of government-paid health care. \n  \n \u201cWe need to be a proposition party, not just an opposition party,\u201d said Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. \u201cWe believe we owe it to the country to offer an alternative to the status quo. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201d \n  \n Even with those tough political choices, the budget would balance in 2024 only because Mr. Ryan is assuming his cuts would prompt a burst of economic growth to raise tax revenues above what independent economists forecast. He also does not adjust the government\u2019s revenue ledger to reflect the cost of repealing the health care law\u2019s tax increases and Medicare cuts, which could total $2 trillion. \n  \n \u201cThis is what elections are about,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. \u201cBudgets are the clearest roadmaps for discovering what people\u2019s priorities are.\u201d \n  \n The Ryan budget will be formally drafted on Wednesday in the Budget Committee and brought to a House vote on Friday \u2014 if Republican leaders can muster the 217 votes to pass it over the concerns of moderates who say it goes too far and conservatives who say it does not go far enough. Because Senate Democrats do not intend to even draft a budget this year, the Ryan plan will serve more as a political manifesto than a legislative roadmap for the 113th Congress. \n  \n \u201cIt is not fair, and it is not acceptable to simply sit by and accept the status quo, as Democrats have chosen to do, time and time again,\u201d said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader. \n  \n Regardless of its fate, the budget will be pushed to the forefront of the coming campaigns, both parties say, not only in House races but also in critical Senate contests. In some of those contests, like Senate races in Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia \u2014 where Republicans seek to take seats held by Democrats \u2014 Mr. Ryan\u2019s budget will force them to choose whether to support the plan. \n  \n \u201cBill Cassidy has repeatedly voted to slash seniors\u2019 retirement benefits and turn Medicare into a voucher program that forces hundreds of thousands of Louisiana seniors to pay thousands more for their health care each year, and now he must own the new reckless G.O.P. budget proposal that does exactly that,\u201d said Andrew Zucker, communications director for the Campaign for Louisiana, a Democratic group criticizing Mr. Cassidy, a House Republican running to unseat Senator Mary L. Landrieu. \n  \n Continue reading the main story Advertisement \n  \n Representative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that in the coming weeks, the committee would be buying online advertising in competitive House districts, making automated phone calls and creating a new website, \u201cScandalous,\u201d to tell of district-specific cuts. \n  \n \u201cWe are going to make this budget the centerpiece of the next seven months,\u201d he said. \n  \n Republican leaders had considered not doing a budget this year, since spending cuts for the current fiscal year and the next were set in December with passage of a bipartisan plan. But House conservatives demanded a document they could take to their strongly Republican districts. \n  \n The new budget violates some tenets that both parties have tried to observe since the budget fights of 2011 and 2012. Those fights preserved a practice of cutting defense and nondefense programs almost equally while sparing the poorest Americans from the worst of the belt-tightening. \n  \n Mr. Ryan\u2019s plan does not strike that balance. \n  \n In his plan, military spending through 2024 would actually rise by $483 billion over the spending caps established in the 2011 Budget Control Act \u201cconsistent with America\u2019s military goals and strategies,\u201d while nondefense spending at Congress\u2019s annual discretion would be cut by $791 billion below those strict limits. \n  \n In all, Mr. Ryan said, spending would be cut by $5.1 trillion over the next decade. More than $2 trillion of that would come from repealing Mr. Obama\u2019s health care initiative, the Affordable Care Act, a political move that has become much more difficult with the closing of the first enrollment period. More than 10 million Americans have gotten health insurance through the law, either through private policies purchased on insurance exchanges, through expanded Medicaid or private policies purchased through brokers but subsidized by the law. \n  \n As with past budget proposals, Mr. Ryan seeks to eliminate the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, a $792 billion retrenchment, then turn the health care program for the poor into block grants to the states \u2014 saving an additional $732 billion over the decade. He would turn food stamps into a block grant program and cap spending, starting in 2020, cutting that program by $125 billion in five years. The budget relies on imposing new work requirements on food stamp and welfare recipients. \n  \n Such an approach \u201cempowers recipients to get off the aid rolls and back on the payrolls,\u201d Mr. Ryan wrote. \n  \n But the toughest cuts would come from domestic programs that have already been reduced steadily since 2011, when Republicans took control of the House. Mr. Ryan\u2019s 2024 domestic spending figure would be lower in nominal dollars than such spending was in 2005. Adjusted for inflation, it would be a 29 percent cut from today\u2019s levels, and 28 percent below the average level of spending in former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. \n  \n Nor did Mr. Ryan shy away from hot-button issues. Education funding would be cut by $145 billion over 10 years. Pell grants for college students would lose $90 billion. University students would start being charged interest on their loans while still in school, reaping $40 billion. \n  \n Federal subsidies for the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, as well as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \u201ccan no longer be justified,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. ||||| WASHINGTON\u2014House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan released an election-year budget blueprint Tuesday designed to unify Republicans behind an effort to balance the federal budget in 10 years, exposing the party to Democratic attacks over its proposed cuts to Medicare and other safety-net programs. \n  \n The plan marks the seventh and likely final budget from Mr. Ryan (R., Wis.), who rose to prominence among Republicans by distilling... |||||", "output": "Paul Ryan unveiled a Republican budget plan today that would slash $5.1 trillion in federal spending over the coming decade and balance the government's books with wide-ranging cuts in programs like food stamps and government-paid health care for the poor and working class. About 40% of Ryan's projected savings would come from the repeal of ObamaCare, reports the Wall Street Journal. Ryan's budget claims balance by 2024, but relies on $74 billion in savings in that year from the macroeconomic effects of cutting deficits, which CBO says would have a long-term positive effect because it would free up savings and investment capital. Democrats are sure to seize on the maneuver as phony math; without these projections, however, Ryan's budget plan would fall almost $70 billion short of balance.

President Donald Trump on Thursday cleared the way for... (Associated Press) \n  \n BRANCHBURG, N.J. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Sunday scoffed at \"politically motivated ingrates\" who had questioned his administration's commitment to revive Puerto Rico after a pulverizing hurricane and said the federal government had done \"a great job with the almost impossible situation.\" \n  \n The tweets coming from a president ensconced in his New Jersey golf club sought to defend Washington's efforts to mobilize and coordinate recovery efforts on a U.S. territory in dire straits almost two weeks after Hurricane Maria struck. \n  \n San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz on Friday accused the Trump administration of \"killing us with the inefficiency\" after the storm. She begged the president, who is set to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday, to \"make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives,\" and appealed for help \"to save us from dying.\" \n  \n Trump's weekend tweets have shown him to be contemptuous of their complaints of a laggard U.S. response to the natural disaster that has imperiled the island's future. \n  \n \"We have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico. Outside of the Fake News or politically motivated ingrates,\" he tweeted on Sunday. \n  \n He said \"people are now starting to recognize the amazing work\" done by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military. \n  \n The day before, Trump had tweeted: \"Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.\" \n  \n He added: \"They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort,\" Trump wrote from his club. \n  \n His critical response was an unusually pointed rebuke from the president in the heat of a disaster \u2014 a time when leaders often put aside partisan differences in the name of solidarity. But it was a reminder of Trump's unrelenting penchant for punching back against critics, whatever the circumstances. \n  \n Trump has said he's doing everything possible to help the \"great people of PR!\" and has pledged to spare no effort to help the island recover from Maria's ruinous aftermath. He has also repeatedly applauded his government's recovery efforts, saying military personnel and first responders have done \"an amazing job,\" despite the significant logistical challenges. \n  \n Thousands more Puerto Ricans have received water and rationed food as an aid bottleneck has begun to ease. But many, especially outside the capital, remain desperate for necessities, including water, power and fuel. \n  \n Trump's administration has tried in recent days to combat the perception that he failed to quickly grasp the magnitude of Maria's destruction and has given the U.S. commonwealth less attention than he'd bestowed on states like Texas, Louisiana and Florida after they were hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Trump had repeatedly praised the residents of those states as strong and resilient, saying at one point that Texas could \"handle anything.\" \n  \n Administration officials have held numerous press conferences providing updates on relief efforts and Trump on Saturday spoke by phone from New Jersey with FEMA Administrator Brock Long, Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, and other several other local officials. \n  \n But after a week of growing criticism, the president's patience appears to be waning. \n  \n \"The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,\" the president charged, without substantiation. \n  \n Long added: \"The problem that we have with the mayor unfortunately is that unity of command is ultimately what's needed to be successful in this response,\" he said, requesting that she report to a joint field office. \n  \n Cruz declined to engage in the tit for tat, instead calling for a united focus on the people who need help. \"The goal is one: saving lives. This is the time to show our 'true colors.' We cannot be distracted by anything else,\" she tweeted, along with photos of herself meeting with residents and rescue workers, wading hip-deep through a flooded street and comforting an elderly woman. \n  \n After a day of tweets criticizing the news media, Trump seemed to echo the sentiment: \"We must all be united in offering assistance to everyone suffering in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the wake of this terrible disaster.\" \n  \n Trump's Saturday tweets are the latest example of his insistence on \"punching back,\" even against those with far less power. After a deadly terror attack in London in June, for instance, Trump singled out London Mayor Sadiq Khan, suggesting he wasn't taking the attacks seriously enough. \n  \n Natural disasters sometimes bring moments of rare bipartisan solidarity. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, which wreaked havoc along the East Coast in 2012, New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie, praised Democratic President Barack Obama for his personal attention and compassion at a joint press conference. Still, the fight over relief money became politicized and contentious, with numerous Republicans voting against a delayed relief bill. \n  \n In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Andrew, tensions between local and federal officials also ran high. Then-New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin pleaded with the government to send help in sometimes colorful terms, while Terry Ebbert, the city's Homeland Security director, called relief efforts a \"national disgrace.\" |||||", "output": "President Trump says his administration has \"done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico\" after Hurricane Maria struck the island. He's going after what he calls \"politically motivated ingrates\" and says \"people are now starting to recognize the amazing work\" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military, reports the AP. The tweets coming from a president ensconced in his New Jersey golf club sought to defend Washington's efforts to mobilize and coordinate recovery efforts on a US territory in dire straits almost two weeks after Maria. Trump's critical response was an unusually pointed rebuke from the president in the heat of a disaster\u2014a time when leaders often put aside partisan differences in the name of solidarity. But it was a reminder of Trump's unrelenting penchant for punching back against critics, whatever the circumstances. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz on Friday accused the Trump administration of \"killing us with the inefficiency\" after the storm. She begged the president, who is set to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday, to \"make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives,\" and appealed for help \"to save us from dying.\" Another person swinging at the president, per CNN: Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose parents are from Puerto Rico. \"You're going straight to hell, @realDonaldTrump,\" he tweeted. \"No long lines for you. Someone will say, 'Right this way, sir.' They'll clear a path.\" Miranda also came to the defense of Yulin Cruz, tweeting, \"She has been working 24/7. You have been GOLFING. You're going straight to hell.

(Associated Press) \n  \n The suffix \"ism\" is photographed in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, in New York, Monday, Dec. 14, 2015. Merriam-Webster has picked a small but powerful suffix as word of the year: ism. The top... (Associated Press) \n  \n But not just any ism. The top isms to earn high traffic spikes and big bumps in lookups on the dictionary company's website in 2015 over the year before are socialism, fascism, racism, feminism, communism, capitalism and terrorism. \n  \n \"We had a lot on our minds this year,\" mused Peter Sokolowski, the Springfield, Massachusetts-based company's editor at large, in a recent interview. \"It's a serious year. These are words of ideas and practices. We're educating ourselves.\" \n  \n Pinpointing reasons why words go on the run at Merriam-Webster is an educated guess. The dictionary company tracks corresponding news events to link lookups to real life. And its researchers also crunch data in a way that filters out common words frequently looked up year after year after year when making their top annual choices. \n  \n Lookups for fascism corresponded to release of video in November showing a white police officer shooting a black teenager in Chicago, and the criminal charges that followed. Merriam-Webster also saw a stronger correlation in heavy traffic on its site for that word and \"fascist\" and flash points in Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign, including reports on his anti-Islam rhetoric. \n  \n The isms often collide, driving each other in popularity, Sokolowski said. \n  \n \"Fascism we more closely associate as the response to various acts of terrorism. After the attacks in Paris and the attacks in Colorado Springs and in San Bernardino, and because of Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims, we then see the word fascism spike,\" he said. \n  \n Lookups of racism were high all year but had two noticeable spikes, one after the South Carolina church shootings and another amid the University of Missouri protests. \n  \n Sokolowski, a lexicographer by training, said one spike in lookups for feminism came in April and corresponded with reports on an Ohio middle school student who wore a T-shirt with the word printed on it in a school photo, only to have it digitally blacked out by school administrators. The school later apologized. \n  \n Reports on Caitlyn Jenner, Amy Schumer and Hillary Clinton all included discussion of feminism, as did reviews of the film \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and chatter about previews of \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" \n  \n In addition, Emma Watson's 2014 UN speech made the news again twice this year; first for inspiring Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai to call herself a feminist in a viral video, and again when it was revealed that Watson was asked not to use the word at all in the speech, Sokolowski noted. \n  \n The word socialism has Bernie Sanders to thank for its popularity. \n  \n \"The big spikes have been associated with the fact that we have a presidential candidate who identifies as a Democratic Socialist,\" Sokolowski said. \"We saw that even though socialism was in the Top 10 of the most looked-up words in the whole history of the site, it increased in a spike beginning in late July when Bernie Sanders had a multicity rally that was organized through social media and attracted about 100,000 people in 3,000 communities or more around the country.\" \n  \n In October, lookups for socialism spiked again during the first Democratic debate featuring Sanders and Clinton. \n  \n John Morse, president and publisher of Merriam-Webster, said socialism led the ism charge after a strong showing in 2012, but the company decided to go with the broader suffix instead as word of the year \"because it was hard not see a bigger story staring us in the face, which was the profusion of ism words all over the most frequently looked-up list.\" \n  \n Other ism words on the move at Merriam-Webster.com this year were professionalism, masochism, federalism, pragmatism, existentialism, hedonism and Marxism. \n  \n Other words that sent people to the site in high numbers include marriage, hypocrite, respect, inspiration and minion. The company does not release raw numbers of lookups. \n  \n \"Inspiration still kind of baffles us,\" Morse said. \"I can't really tell you what it is in the world of 2015 that is so much different from '14 that inspiration has moved up.\" \n  \n The company began picking a word of the year in 2003. It went with \"culture\" in 2014. \n  \n This year's word of the year at Dictionary.com is identity. The folks at Oxford Dictionaries went with a pictograph, an emoji called the \"Face with Tears of Joy.\" \n  \n ___ \n  \n Follow Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie ||||| In 2015, we had minions on the mind. \n  \n So says Merriam-Webster. According to the English-language dictionary\u2019s list of most-searched this year, the word for \u201ca servile dependent, follower, or underling\u201d was one of the most searched online, of the year. Minions made headlines in 2015 as one of the highest grossing movies worldwide, and as the subject of a viral YouTube video. \n  \n But what really wracked our brains was not one word at all, but a kind of word, illustrated by Merrian-Webster\u2019s unusual choice for its annual \u201cWord of the Year\u201d: ism. \n  \n \u201cSocialism,\u201d \u201ccapitalism,\u201d \u201cfascism,\u201d \u201cterrorism,\u201d and \u201dcommunism\u201d were all among the most-popular searches this year, along with \u201cracism\u201d and \u201cfeminism.\u201d \n  \n As editor-at-large Peter Sokolowski told Quartz, 2015 was a year of news stories that raised a whole host of abstract, difficult concepts we struggled to define\u2014not just a single word around a single event, like \u201cbailout.\u201d He writes in an email, \u201cThis simply seems to be a year of heightened anxiety in many ways.\u201d \n  \n In a prepared statement, Sokolowski noted that searches for \u201csocialism,\u201d while always popular, grew significantly this year because of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders\u2019 socialist policies (and spiked following the first Democratic debate, in which Sanders gave an ode to Denmark)\u2014while Donald Trump\u2019s call to track Muslim-Americans and even to have Muslims banned from entering the country were linked to growth in searches for \u201cfascism.\u201d \u201cHypocrite\u201d was highly ranked. \n  \n Deadly attacks in Paris, Beirut, and San Bernardino, and elsewhere spurred us to seek to answers for \u201dterrorism.\u201d And in a momentous year for LGBT civil rights in the United States, \u201cmarriage\u201d and \u201crespect\u201d also trended. \n  \n Here\u2019s the dictionary\u2019s full list, ranked by highest pageviews on the site.

(AP Photo/J Pat Carter) Ad Policy \n  \n Check this space for updates throughout the day, and please send tips to jeidelson at gmail dot com. \n  \n 9:15 pm: San Leandro workers, and the \u201cbrass liberation band\u201d accompanying them, were blocked by police when they attempted to enter their store for a flash mob. San Leandro\u2019s was the last major demonstration of tonight. The three workers who were arrested for civil disobedience this afternoon have returned home. The Corporate Action Network has posted a map of many of the day\u2019s protests. This is the final live blog post of the night\u2014thanks to all who offered tips. I\u2019ll have a wrap-up post up later. Tomorrow, the Walmart strikers are headed back to work, with at least one exception: a San Leandro worker who wanted to strike but was scheduled for days off on Thursday and Friday, She\u2019ll be striking tomorrow. \n  \n 7:05 pm: San Leandro, California, workers just launched a picket line outside their store. Striker Dominic Ware told The Nation he was scared to go on strike, but he was more scared for \u201cfuture inviduals who come [to Walmart] looking for a better environment and looking for an opportunity to better their lives, and get slapped in the face like I did.\u201d He said he was driven to strike by unfair discipline and poor management. \n  \n The picket line will include a \u201cbrass liberation band\u201d and a dragon puppet. Ware said that fifty or sixty supporters had already arrived fifteen minutes early. As for San Leandro retail workers on strike, he said, \u201cSo far there\u2019s only two, but there\u2019s supposed to be another brother\u201d on his way. \u201cA lot of people get cold feet at the last minute but that\u2019s OK.\u201d Ware said that the most common reason for workers not striking is \u201cbeing told that they\u2019ll be fired if they participate.\u201d \n  \n \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s really amazing,\u201d said Ware, \u201cto see all of the people that were brave enough to go on strike\u201d and \u201cthe community support\u2026. it just touched me in so many ways that I really haven\u2019t taken it all in.\u201d After today, said Ware, \u201cI hope I wouldn\u2019t have to strike anymore. But as long as they keep playing and they don\u2019t fix anything, I\u2019m going to keep doing what I need to do to get their attention.\u201d \n  \n \u201cIt\u2019s just beautiful, man,\u201d said Ware. \u201cWe\u2019re winning. No matter what Walmart says, we\u2019re winning.\u201d \n  \n 6:30 pm: Congressman George Miller, the ranking Democrat on the House Education and Labor Committee and a longtime union ally, spoke at an event with striking Walmart workers in California today. That\u2019s noteworthy because most federal Democratic officeholders have so far been silent on the historic strikes against the nation\u2019s largest employer (Miller\u2019s future colleague, Congressman-elect Alan Grayson, rallied with strikers in Florida today). The White House still has not responded to The Nation\u2019s request for comment Tuesday regarding the strikes. Walmart critics have received support from some local politicians in cities like Los Angeles and New York where the company\u2019s expansion is hotly contested. \n  \n Last week, I asked Making Change at Walmart Director Dan Schlademan whether the campaign expected support from politicians this week, he said that it would welcome it but wasn\u2019t actively seeking it, and suggested that could be on the agenda for 2013. The last UFCW-backed Walmart group, Wake Up Walmart, was able to get Democratic presidential candidates, including then-Senator Obama, to express public criticisms of the company in 2008. But absent the ability to mobilize workers for actions like today\u2019s, that proved less potent than organizers may have hoped. \n  \n 5:10 pm: Paramount, California striker Maria Elena Jefferson told The Nation this afternoon\u2019s mass rally was \u201cvery emotional. Very big. We were hoping that there would be a lot of people from the city supporting us, and we thought there would be supporters from other stores, and every time I looked around, it was bigger than bigger.\u201d (Jefferson was interviewed in a mix of English and Spanish.) She said that the willingness of three workers to get arrested sent an important signal to management that workers are \u201cwilling to take the risk\u201d and \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing is right.\u201d \n  \n According to Make Change at Walmart, while standing in the middle of the street this afternoon, one of the three arrested workers, Charlene Fletcher, said, \u201cWe are serious about improving our jobs and ending retaliation at Walmart. No matter how hard we work for Walmart, my husband and I can\u2019t catch up on our bills. But when our co-workers speak out about problems like these, Walmart turns their schedules upside down, cuts their hours and even fires people.\u201d \n  \n Jefferson said she joined OUR Walmart because the company wouldn\u2019t to provide enough hours for many workers to qualify for health insurance. She said some of her co-workers wouldn\u2019t strike because \u201cthey think we\u2019ll never win\u201d and \u201cthey didn\u2019t want to lose their jobs.\u201d She said she hopes today will change their minds. \n  \n 4:30 pm: While there\u2019s no final count of how many workers walked off the job, organizers say one noteworthy trend is the number of places where a worker struck despite being the only one in their store to do so, often in stores with little or no prior OUR Walmart activism. One of those workers was Christopher Bentley Owen, whom I interviewed Tuesday about his experience in a mandatory \u201ccaptive audience\u201d meeting he said was designed to make workers fear they could lose their jobs if they joined the strike. \n  \n Owen said today that the sense that Walmart \u201cwanted the managers to intimidate me\u201d helped spur him to join OUR Walmart, and join the strike. On Tuesday, Owen had told me that he still had some hestitance about getting too involved because he didn\u2019t plan on staying at Walmart for too long. But \u201cthe more and more I thought about it,\u201d Owen said this afternoon, \u201cthat does seem to be one of the blocking points of people organizing in low-wage sectors: people thinking, well I can get a better job at some point. Millions of people are thinking that\u2026meanwhile, there are millions of people in those jobs\u2026at some point, people have to get together.\u201d \n  \n Owen signed up with OUR Walmart on Wednesday online. Yesterday, two hours before his scheduled 5 pm shift, he called in and told a manager he was going on strike. Owen had considered also staging a one-person picket outside his store, but decided against it. \u201cI was a little spooked,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause thirty-one off-duty police officers had been hired\u201d along with \u201ceight on-duty police\u201d for Black Friday. OUR Walmart connected Owen with a leader in Tennessee, who put him in touch with a worker in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. Owen said that if he can find an action in his area today where he wouldn\u2019t be alone, he\u2019ll definitely take part. \n  \n 3:30 pm: Civil disobedience is underway now in Paramount, outside Los Angeles, where organizers say 1,500 workers and supporters are demonstrating against retaliation. Nine people have been arrested for sitting in the street on Lakewood Boulevard, including three striking Walmart retail workers from area stores: Charlene Fletcher and William Fletcher from Duarte, and Martha Sellers from Paramount. (William Fletcher and I appeared on Democracy Now on Wednesday.) \n  \n This was the latest and largest of a series of Black Friday rallies in cities including Lancaster, Texas; San Leandro, California; Quincy, Massachusetts; Miami, Florida; and Hanover, Maryland. Organizers say they expect to exceed their promise of 1,000 total protests. \n  \n 2:35 pm: According to a spokesperson for Making Change at Walmart, a group tied to the United Food & Commerical Workers union, hundreds of Walmart retail workers have now gone on strike. He added that there are Black Friday strikers in at least 100 cities and protests in forty-six states. The spokesperson accused Walmart of making up numbers to minimize the strike, and said that it will take time to tally more exact figures because many strikers are walking off the job on their own in stores that haven\u2019t seen past OUR Walmart actions. He reiterated the group\u2019s position that the strike is legally protected, and pledged support for any workers who face illegal retaliation for participating. \n  \n 2:15 pm: In an 8:42 am statement, Walmart declared it had \u201creported its best ever Black Friday events,\u201d including \u201clarger crowds than last year and a huge response to its first-ever one-hour guarantee on key electronic items.\u201d Walmart US President Bill Simon wrote that \u201cOnly 26 protests occurred at stores last night and many of them did not include any Walmart associates,\u201d and offered an \u201cestimate that less than 50 associates participated in the protest nationwide. In fact, this year, roughly the same number of associates missed their scheduled shift as last year.\u201d The statement also touted Walmart\u2019s 10 percent employee discount and \u201can additional 10 percent discount on an entire basket of goods\u201d for workers who showed up on Black Friday. \n  \n 12:30 pm: Hanover and Severn, MD\u2014Four hundred\u2013some activists, union members and striking Walmart workers marched down streets and through a shopping center parking lot this morning before being met by a Walmart manager, and police, across from Hanover, Maryland\u2019s Capital Plaza Walmart at 10 this morning. Jobs With Justice Executive Director Sarita Gupta and local Reverend Edwin L. Jones Jr. asked the manager to commit not to punish the workers striking today; they say he replied that Walmart won\u2019t retaliate, said it never does, and denied that national Vice President David Tovar\u2019s comments that \u201cthere could be consequences\u201d constituted a threat. Chants included \u201cWhose Walmart? Our Walmart!,\u201d \u201cHey hey, ho ho, slave wages have got to go,\u201d and \u201cStand up! Live better!\u201d \n  \n \u201cManagement disrespects us every day,\u201d Laurel, Maryland, Walmart striker Cindy Murray told The Nation before speaking at the march. Murray, a twelve-year employee, said that her view of the company changed when managers refused to comply with the work restrictions her doctor had imposed due to a back injury. She said a manager took her into an office, threw an empty folder at her, and yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re going to lift whatever I want.\u201d When she responded that she could contact a lawyer, Murray said her manager accused her of making threats. \n  \n The Capital Plaza Walmart is the closest of six stores in the Washington, DC, suburbs; labor and progressives have so far been successful at keeping the store out of the city itself. Organizers said that 100 workers at those six stores have struck at least once this week; they said at least a dozen are on strike today, but some workers involved in unloading goods decided to participate in Monday\u2019s strike instead to have more of an impact. \n  \n Following the Capital Plaza rally, striking workers and most protesters went to a Laurel, MD store to distribute leaflets and sing re-written Christmas carols (\u201cI saw Walmart fire Santa Claus\u201d; \u201cDeck the aisles with living wages\u201d; \u201cMay your days abound with strike talk, and may all your workers walk\u201d) until asked to leave. One bus of community activists staged a more aggressive flash mob at a Severn, Maryland, store (check back for video). About fifty people walked quickly through the garden section, to the front of the store, and launched a mic check, the crowd echoing an organizer from Jobs with Justice as she read from a prepared script: \u201cWe call on Walmart to change. We call on Walmart to stop bullying. We are standing with those who have the courage to speak out.\u201d After being warned by police who had already been on site, the group turned and left, chanting \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d This mic check followed others around the country, including three staged by a DC-area \u201cWalmart Striking Party Bus\u201d last night. \n  \n Most of this morning\u2019s protesters arrived on a half dozen buses that departed from the nearby United Food & Commercial Workers Local 400 union hall. Felicia Miller, a UFCW member working at Safeway as a deli clerk, told The Nation that Walmart is driving down standards for new workers at her unionized store. \u201cThe young people coming in, pay stinks now because of Walmart,\u201d said Miller. \u201cThe benefits package stinks because of Walmart\u2026Because our companies are saying, if Walmart can get away with it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d She said the sight of Walmart workers on strike was \u201cawesome. I\u2019m here to support them all the way.\u201d \n  \n Walmart striker Barbara Elliot said it was a scary decision: \u201cIt\u2019s just nervous, it\u2019s new what you\u2019re doing, but you\u2019re tired\u2026. We\u2019re doing it for other generations too.\u201d \n  \n Murray was also active in a past UFCW-backed effort, Wake Up Walmart. She said that following Obama\u2019s election, \u201cI was like, we have to do something different.\u201d Murray said OUR Walmart has had greater success because it \u201cbecame an organization,\u201d officially founded by 100 associates last year. Once workers saw it \u201cas our organization\u2026,\u201d said Murray, \u201cthen I think associates finally said, maybe we can be saved. Maybe we can speak out.\u201d \n  \n 11:40 am: Hanover, MD\u2014This morning I caught up with United Food & Commercial Workers union Organizing Director Pat O\u2019Neill, who said the unprecedented strikes demonstrate \u201cthe courage of the workers,\u201d and shows \u201cthey\u2019ve reached the end of their rope.\u201d \n  \n Interviewed as a 400-person march wound towards Maryland\u2019s Capital Plaza Walmart (full report to follow), O\u2019Neill said that \u201cthe bar\u201d for today to be judged a success \u201cis really just to spread the word, so all the Walmart associates know they\u2019re not alone, that they are supported by the communities where they work.\u201d \n  \n What happens after Black Friday? O\u2019Neill, a key strategist in the OUR Walmart campaign, answered simply, \u201cWhat the workers want is a dialogue with the company, and to let their voices be heard.\u201d \n  \n I asked O\u2019Neill whether, when today\u2019s strikers return to work, retaliation from Walmart would get worse before it gets better. \u201cI think that\u2019s a real possibility,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be a mistake for Walmart to do that. I think the workers are showing that they\u2019re not going to be silenced.\u201d \n  \n 8:35 am: Walmart responds: Keeping media out of stores on Black Friday \u201chas been our practice for four or five years now.\u201d \n  \n 7:55 am: Is Walmart getting camera shy? \n  \n A media advisory sent out Monday invited local reporters in North Bergen, New Jerse to visit the local Walmart on Tuesday or Wednesday and see preparations for Black Friday. But the same advisory (shared with The Nation by a recipient) announced that \u201cLocal media will not be permitted in-store access from Thursday, November 22 through Sunday, November 25. Regular media access will resume Monday, November 26.\u201d Walmart did not immediately respond to The Nation\u2019s inquiry regarding how widespread this policy is, or whether it\u2019s a change from the past. \n  \n Local reporters aren\u2019t the only ones Walmart is reportedly keeping out of its stores. At 12:28 am, Huffington Post retail reporter Alice Hines tweeted from Wheatland, Texas: \u201c#kickedoutofwalmart for solicitation but was told i could report in the parking lot\u201d \n  \n 12:25 am EST: It\u2019s on. \n  \n A year and a half after retail workers announced the founding of a new Walmart employee group, five months after guest workers struck a Walmart seafood supplier and seven weeks after the country\u2019s first multi-store Walmart strikes, the Black Friday strike has begun. \n  \n Walmart stores opened at 8 pm, drawing additional ire from employees required to come into work on Thanksgiving earlier than ever. But workers\u2019 protests got off to an early start too. Around 7:30 pm EST, thirty workers from three Miami stores went on strike, joining 100-plus supporters for one of several nighttime rallies across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long that I\u2019ve been working for people that had no respect for me,\u201d Miami striker Elaine Rozier told The Nation. \u201cThey retaliated against me, and they always treated me like crap. And I\u2019m so happy that this is history, that my grandkids can learn from this to stand up for themselves.\u201d In the past, said Rozier, \u201cI always used to sit back and not say anything\u2026. I\u2019m proud of myself tonight.\u201d \n  \n At 9:45 pm CST, workers struck and rallied with supporters outside a store in Dallas; OUR Walmart says that the peaceful crowd was dispersed by police. When workers walked off the job in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the group says that managers kicked customers out of the store on the mistaken assumption that they were there to protest. Workers are also on strike in San Leandro, California; and Clovis, New Mexico. Stores in Ocean City, Maryland; Orlando, Florida; and Baton Rouge, Louisiana each have a single worker out on strike. In St. Cloud, Florida, Walmart associate Lisa Lopez was joined by Congressman-elect Alan Grayson as she walked out on strike. \n  \n At 11:45 pm, labor and community activists demonstrated outside a store in Quincy, Massachusetts, the first of a string of protests that allied groups promise will hit all forty-eight Walmarts in the state. \n  \n OUR Walmart, the union-backed retail worker group that spearheaded last month\u2019s twenty-eight-store strikes, promised last month to pull off a \u201cmemorable\u201d Black Friday unless Walmart reversed a slew of allegedly retaliatory firings (Walmart hasn\u2019t). Last week, as workers struck Seattle stores and a Mira Loma warehouse, OUR Walmart pledged 1,000 total actions for the nine days leading up to and including today. Workers say that will include flash mobs, rallies, leaflets, sit-ins and strikes. Retail employees will have back-up from Occupy activists, women\u2019s and consumer groups, and Walmart warehouse workers. But the day\u2019s biggest question may be just how many Walmart store workers choose the risk and the sacrifice of striking. Last month, 160 struck; how many more will join them today? \n  \n Reached over e-mail Sunday, Walmart\u2019s National Media Relations Director Kory Lundberg said, \u201cWe do not expect these actions by a very small minority of our associates (less than .0003 percent) at a handful of stores to have any impact on our stores or our customers\u2019 shopping experience on Black Friday.\u201d But the past week offers increasing signs of an aggressive campaign by the company to discourage workers from striking, including mandatory \u201ccaptive audience\u201d meetings, alleged threats, and public declarations that the strikes aren\u2019t legal and strikers could face \u201cconsequences.\u201d \n  \n OUR Walmart has also promised strikes in cities including Chicago; Los Angeles; Milwaukee; and Washington, DC; and states including Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana and Minnesota. \n  \n Expectations are high for a historic strike. Given Walmart\u2019s role as the dominant employer of our era, the current wave of work stoppages is already among the country\u2019s most consequential twenty-first-century strikes. But in interviews this month, workers and organizers described today\u2019s actions as a turning point, not a climax, in their struggle against the retail giant. \u201cThis is the beginning of something\u2026,\u201d said Dan Schlademan, a United Food & Commercial Workers union official who directs the allied group Making Change at Walmart. \u201cThis is a new permanent reality for Walmart\u2026. Two thousand and twelve is the beginning of the season where retail workers are going to start to stand up.\u201d \n  \n \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more days that we\u2019re going to strike,\u201d said Rozier, \u201cand it\u2019s not going to stop. I\u2019m not going to stop until they respect us and give us what we want.\u201d ||||| Walmart workers stage walkouts in at least seven states and protests hit at least two others. But whether the Walmart protest movement can gain momentum depends on events Friday morning. \n  \n Updated 7:40 a.m. \n  \n After hours and sometimes days of waiting, Los Angeles shoppers inaugurate Black Friday at several stores. \n  \n On Thursday evening, the Black Friday skirmishes began between Walmart and some of its employees. \n  \n Workers staged walkouts in stores in Dallas, Miami, and Kenosha, Wis., according to OUR Walmart, an employee group that's been agitating for better wages, benefits, and work schedules for more than a year. Workers also went on strike San Leandro, Calif., Clovis, N.M., Ocean City, Md., Orlando and St. Cloud, Fla., and Baton Rouge, La., The Nation reported early this morning. \n  \n Numerous Twitter posts suggest that overnight protests also hit other Walmart stores, as supporters of the strikers posted photos and messages online. In Wichita, Kan., about a dozen protesters gathered around signs and banners such as \"Support Walmart Workers\" and \"People Before Profits.\" \n  \n \"Denied entry to Walmart! Why try to silence us? Maybe because they're scared of us!\" one strike supporter tweeted from Denver. \n  \n How extensive these protests are \u2013 and how many workers are involved in the protests \u2013 are not immediately clear. \n  \n The larger and more visible protests are just beginning to get under way this morning. \n  \n OUR Walmart's website lists nine cities where Walmart rallies will take place. The first one took place Thursday evening in Miami. But the rest of the events get under way early this morning, starting at 5:30 a.m. (6:30 a.m EST) in Chicago. That will be quickly followed by a protest at 6 a.m. (7 a.m. EST) in Milwaukee; and then roll out in Washington, D.C. (7:30 a.m. EST); Dallas; Los Angeles; Sacramento, Calif.; San Francisco; and Seattle. \n  \n Given its nearly 4,000 stores, these job actions are unlikely to stop \u2013 or even slow \u2013 Walmart's Black Friday push. The strikers appear to be aiming for visibility rather than confrontation. \n  \n \"We also ask you to conduct all actions in support of the strikers peacefully, in a way to permit access to the stores and disrupt Walmart operations and worker productivity no more than necessary to express and demonstrate support for strikers and call on Walmart to change,\" OUR Walmart says on its website. \n  \n The workers group has the support of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union and is gaining support from the loosely organized Occupy Wall Street movement in some cities. \n  \n Walmart dismisses the movement as the creation of UFCW agitators. \n  \n \u201cMany of our associates have urged us to do something about the UFCW's latest round of publicity stunts,\u201d Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg told the Monitor's Gloria Goodale. \u201cThey don't think it's right that a few associates that are being coerced by the UFCW are being portrayed by the media as representative of what it's like to work at Walmart.\u201d \n  \n The next few hours could begin to reveal just how narrow or broad the movement really is. \n  \n Updated 6:33 a.m. \n  \n Black Friday starts with a bang.

Employees worked when they wanted and wherever they wanted just as long as they got the job done. \n  \n Now most corporate employees will work the traditional 40-hour week, though managers still have discretion to accommodate some workers. ROWE, which the company launched in 2005, did not apply to Best Buy\u2019s store employees, who make up the lion\u2019s share of the retailer\u2019s 168,000-person global workforce. \n  \n American workplaces have been buzzing with debate over telecommuting since Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer recently ended the company\u2019s policy of allowing staff to work from home. Critics say the move hurts working women, but proponents of working in the office say employees need to be at work to collaborate and drive innovation. \n  \n \u201cIt makes sense to consider not just what the results are but how the work gets done,\u201d said Best Buy spokesman Matt Furman. \u201cBottom line, it\u2019s \u2018all hands on deck\u2019 at Best Buy and that means having employees in the office as much as possible to collaborate and connect on ways to improve our business.\u201d \n  \n The move comes amid CEO Hubert Joly\u2019s efforts to remake the struggling consumer electronics retailer and sustain a fragile financial recovery. Last week, Best Buy laid off 400 corporate employees, a decision that will help save the company about $150 million. Best Buy also reported stronger-than-expected sales, a performance that impressed Wall Street. \n  \n Last year, 63 percent of companies allowed employees to work some hours from home, compared with 34 percent in 2005, according to a study by the National Study of Employers, which was produced by the Society for Human Resource Management and the Families and Work Institute. \n  \n In 2010, 54 percent of women 16 years and older participated in the labor force, with 71 percent of those women raising children, the study said. \n  \n Erin Kelly, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota who has authored studies on ROWE, said companies are unfairly scapegoating flexible work programs for their subpar performances. \n  \n \u201cI\u2019m concerned that these flexibility initiatives and telework initiatives are getting blamed for what may be other problems those organizations are facing in the broader market,\u201d Kelly said. \n  \n In her research, Kelly said ROWE \u201creduced work-family conflicts. In the period we were studying employees in the ROWE departments, they were less likely to leave the company and less likely to be thinking about leaving the company.\u201d \n  \n But industry experts say Best Buy and Yahoo, each led by a new CEO who inherited companies hobbled by dysfunctional cultures, are trying to send a broader message to employees, male or female, that they mean business. \n  \n \u201cThey truly want people to be available and present at this particular time to hasten a turnaround,\u201d said Carol Spieckerman, president of retail consulting firm newmarketbuilders. \u201cIn a lot of ways, it\u2019s a symbolic way for Best Buy and Yahoo to remind their employees that the old ways are not going to guide the company.\u201d \n  \n After an investor presentation last November, Joly told the Star Tribune that he intended to restore accountability to the company\u2019s culture. \n  \n \u201cIn a turnaround transformation, direction needs to come from the top. I make sure it gets to a conclusion based on fact,\" Joly said. \"You need to feel disposable as opposed to indispensable.\u201d \n  \n ROWE is the brainchild of Cali Ressler and Jody Thompson, two former Best Buy employees, who later founded CultureRx, a Minneapolis-based human resources consulting firm. In addition to Best Buy, CultureRx\u2019s clients include Gap, Banana Republic and H.B. Fuller. \n  \n According to their website, CultureRx claimed that ROWE helped Best Buy teams save $2.2 million over three years by reducing turnover by 90 percent and boosting productivity by an average of 41 percent. \n  \n Ressler and Thompson did not return a call seeking comment. But in a recent open letter to Mayer of Yahoo, the duo blasted her decision to end remote workplaces. ||||| Best Buy just announced that it was getting rid of its famously flexible work environment. Instead of being able to work whenever and wherever they choose, most corporate staff will have to work traditional 40 hour weeks in an office. \n  \n Best Buy's \"Results Only Work Environment\" program (ROWE) was designed to eliminate a culture that focused on facetime, rewarding employees for what they produced alone. Effectively, it didn't matter where or when you worked, as long as the results were good. \n  \n The program was the brainchild of two Best Buy HR employees, Jody Thompson and Cali Ressler, who pioneered the program in 2003 and saw it adopted for the wider corporate workforce in 2005. \n  \n They now run an HR consultancy which promotes the idea, and wrote a blog post highly critical of CEO Hubert Joly's decision to end ROWE, accusing Best Buy of returning to \"last century management practices.\" \n  \n They write: \n  \n \"... we think it's unfortunate, if not downright silly, that Best Buy has made the decision to discontinue operating as a Results-Only Work Environment (ROWE) for corporate employees. They are sending a clear message that they are more concerned with having leadership excel at monitoring the hallways, rather than building a leadership team that excels at defining clear, measurable results, and holding peopl e accountable for achieving those results. While we agree that Best Buy must take drastic measures to turn their business around, moving back to a 20th century, paternalistic 'command and control' environment is most certainly not the answer \n  \n In fact, any so-called leadership team can effectively get 'all hands on deck', dictate hours and delegate tasks, while their people brag about how many hours they put in 'at the office'. That's easy. But only true leadership has the ability to get 'everyone on point' with a workforce vs. a workplace that's fluid, nimble and focused on what matters: measurable results. \n  \n They chalk up any problems at corporate to poor management and leadership, rather than any inherent problems with remote work, and say that ROWE is being used as a scapegoat for other problems with the company. The two regard getting rid of it is an easy, cosmetic move that won't do any good for the company. \n  \n In an email, Best Buy spokesman Jonathan Sandler told us that \"we certainly believe in workplace flexibility and are just looking for it to come in the context of a conversation between the employee and their manager.\" \n  \n So flexibility will still be an option, but it will be at the discretion of managers, rather than solely the employee's decision. \n  \n When the news about Yahoo's decision to recall its remote workers broke, the two posted an open letter with some particularly harsh criticism for Marissa Mayer: \n  \n \"We don\u2019t think you deliberately meant to send a message to Yahoo! employees that you are an Industrial Age dictator that prefers to be a babysitter vs. a 21st century CEO that can lead a company into the future. Or did you? \n  \n When you took the reins at Yahoo!, cries of joy could be heard across the country\u2026 across the world. \u201cFinally \u2013 someone who understands the high level of control people (not just working parents, but everyone) need to perform at their best in life.\u201d There were high hopes for you and, we admit, lots of pressure to deliver on that. And last week, you didn\u2019t just mess up. You dug yourself a hole that no one can see to the bottom of. You made a move that has effectively painted you as 2013\u2019s CEO Who Doesn\u2019t Get It. And we might as well just give that award to you right now for the next 7 years\u2026 because what you\u2019ve done has sealed your place at the top of that list for a very long time. \n  \n The counterargument would be that the results at the two companies tell a different story . Both companies are seriously struggling, and clearly there's more that could be done by the teams at both organizations. \n  \n That argument makes a bit more sense in Yahoo's case, where it appears that remote workers were slacking off. \n  \n At Best Buy, on the other hand, no such evidence has come to light, and if Ressler and Thompson are right, the program's saved the company money by reducing turnover and boosting productivity. ||||| The electronics retailer nixes its flex-work policy, a week after Yahoo ended its program, as it struggles to turn business around. \n  \n (Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty Images) \n  \n Best Buy, seen as a trailblazer for its progressive telecommuting policy, is now putting limits on the ability of its non-store staff to work from home. \n  \n Just a week after Yahoo told its workers that they could no longer work from home, Best Buy ended its Results Only Work Environment (ROWE) program, which allowed employees to set their own hours and work from anywhere as long as they got the job done. Telecommuting is not completely ruled out as an option for the company's 4,000 non-store employees, but workers will need to seek managerial approval first. \n  \n The change comes as Best Buy has been trying to cut costs while dealing with sluggish sales. Company executives decided the telecommuting policy was out of step with the challenges it faces. \n  \n \"When you're in a turnaround situation, it truly is all hands on deck,\" said Best Buy spokesman Matt Furman. \"It is critical to have employees in the office to collaborate and communicate.\" \n  \n The Star Tribune in Minneapolis first reported on the policy change. \n  \n Like Best Buy, Yahoo has been struggling financially. Its telecommuting shift sparked much discussion about the merits of working from home. \n  \n Furman said that Best Buy's decision was not at all related to Yahoo's move.

But Bill Gates believes that governments should tax companies\u2019 use of them, as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment. \n  \n It\u2019s a striking position from the world\u2019s richest man and a self-described techno-optimist who co-founded Microsoft, one of the leading players in artificial-intelligence technology. \n  \n In a recent interview with Quartz, Gates said that a robot tax could finance jobs taking care of elderly people or working with kids in schools, for which needs are unmet and to which humans are particularly well suited. He argues that governments must oversee such programs rather than relying on businesses, in order to redirect the jobs to help people with lower incomes. The idea is not totally theoretical: EU lawmakers considered a proposal to tax robot owners to pay for training for workers who lose their jobs, though on Feb. 16 the legislators ultimately rejected it. \n  \n \u201cYou ought to be willing to raise the tax level and even slow down the speed\u201d of automation, Gates argues. That\u2019s because the technology and business cases for replacing humans in a wide range of jobs are arriving simultaneously, and it\u2019s important to be able to manage that displacement. \u201cYou cross the threshold of job replacement of certain activities all sort of at once,\u201d Gates says, citing warehouse work and driving as some of the job categories that in the next 20 years will have robots doing them. \n  \n You can watch Gates\u2019 remarks in the video above. Below is a transcript, lightly edited for style and clarity. \n  \n Quartz: What do you think of a robot tax? This is the idea that in order to generate funds for training of workers, in areas such as manufacturing, who are displaced by automation, one concrete thing that governments could do is tax the installation of a robot in a factory, for example. \n  \n Bill Gates: Certainly there will be taxes that relate to automation. Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you\u2019d think that we\u2019d tax the robot at a similar level. \n  \n And what the world wants is to take this opportunity to make all the goods and services we have today, and free up labor, let us do a better job of reaching out to the elderly, having smaller class sizes, helping kids with special needs. You know, all of those are things where human empathy and understanding are still very, very unique. And we still deal with an immense shortage of people to help out there. \n  \n So if you can take the labor that used to do the thing automation replaces, and financially and training-wise and fulfillment-wise have that person go off and do these other things, then you\u2019re net ahead. But you can\u2019t just give up that income tax, because that\u2019s part of how you\u2019ve been funding that level of human workers. \n  \n And so you could introduce a tax on robots\u2026 \n  \n There are many ways to take that extra productivity and generate more taxes. Exactly how you\u2019d do it, measure it, you know, it\u2019s interesting for people to start talking about now.

But Bill Gates believes that governments should tax companies\u2019 use of them, as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment. \n  \n It\u2019s a striking position from the world\u2019s richest man and a self-described techno-optimist who co-founded Microsoft, one of the leading players in artificial-intelligence technology. \n  \n In a recent interview with Quartz, Gates said that a robot tax could finance jobs taking care of elderly people or working with kids in schools, for which needs are unmet and to which humans are particularly well suited. He argues that governments must oversee such programs rather than relying on businesses, in order to redirect the jobs to help people with lower incomes. The idea is not totally theoretical: EU lawmakers considered a proposal to tax robot owners to pay for training for workers who lose their jobs, though on Feb. 16 the legislators ultimately rejected it. \n  \n \u201cYou ought to be willing to raise the tax level and even slow down the speed\u201d of automation, Gates argues. That\u2019s because the technology and business cases for replacing humans in a wide range of jobs are arriving simultaneously, and it\u2019s important to be able to manage that displacement. \u201cYou cross the threshold of job replacement of certain activities all sort of at once,\u201d Gates says, citing warehouse work and driving as some of the job categories that in the next 20 years will have robots doing them. \n  \n You can watch Gates\u2019 remarks in the video above. Below is a transcript, lightly edited for style and clarity. \n  \n Quartz: What do you think of a robot tax? This is the idea that in order to generate funds for training of workers, in areas such as manufacturing, who are displaced by automation, one concrete thing that governments could do is tax the installation of a robot in a factory, for example. \n  \n Bill Gates: Certainly there will be taxes that relate to automation. Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you\u2019d think that we\u2019d tax the robot at a similar level. \n  \n And what the world wants is to take this opportunity to make all the goods and services we have today, and free up labor, let us do a better job of reaching out to the elderly, having smaller class sizes, helping kids with special needs. You know, all of those are things where human empathy and understanding are still very, very unique. And we still deal with an immense shortage of people to help out there. \n  \n So if you can take the labor that used to do the thing automation replaces, and financially and training-wise and fulfillment-wise have that person go off and do these other things, then you\u2019re net ahead. But you can\u2019t just give up that income tax, because that\u2019s part of how you\u2019ve been funding that level of human workers. \n  \n And so you could introduce a tax on robots\u2026 \n  \n There are many ways to take that extra productivity and generate more taxes. Exactly how you\u2019d do it, measure it, you know, it\u2019s interesting for people to start talking about now. Some of it can come on the profits that are generated by the labor-saving efficiency there. Some of it can come directly in some type of robot tax.

With a... (Associated Press) \n  \n BERGEN, Norway (AP) \u2014 The pale, zombie-like addicts staggering through concrete underpasses make an unlikely scene in wealthy Norway's picturesque second city. As a gateway to the fjords which zigzag the oil-rich nation's long coastline, Bergen is the last stop on a global drug route that gives it one of the worst heroin problems in Europe. \n  \n Now with a change in local government here and in the capital, Oslo, there is an appetite to use radical policies to curb the alarming number of Norwegians who die from heroin overdoses each year. Alongside traditional replacement therapies, such as methadone, the new left-wing local leaders want to use a medical form of injectable heroin to treat the most at-risk users. \n  \n The official goal is to wean them off the drug entirely, but even the most ardent supporters admit the most achievable target is to bring them within a safer environment, while helping to tackle the crime associated with heavy drug use. \n  \n \"We can't go on criminalizing our drug users. We need the trust between us and the health professionals,\" said Kim Arnetvedt, an addict and member of the Association for a Humane Drug Policy, a campaign group. \n  \n Norway has the worst heroin mortality rate in Western Europe with 70 drug deaths per million inhabitants in 2013, according to the EU's drugs watchdog, the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drugs Addiction. In the continent as a whole, Norway trails only Estonia, with 127 deaths per million. The average is 16. \n  \n Like most of Bergen's estimated 1,100 regular users, Arnetvedt spends much of his time near the city-run Straxhuset needle exchange center between the housing projects and the industrialized western edge of the city where addicts can get clean needles, medical help and a hot meal. He reluctantly dips in and out of medical rehabilitation programs run out of centers like this, but is highly suspicious of a health system that he says is too close to the police and makes \"every day of addiction miserable.\" He is treated with methadone and anti-depressants, but says he can't imagine ever shaking his addiction to heroin. \n  \n Outside the needle exchange there is a more-or-less open drug market. Dozens of users and dealers cut deals unmolested by police. Last year a crack-down on heroin users in the notorious Nygaards Park in the center of town drove them into the tourist-heavy city-center. Straxhuset leader Hugo Torjussen says the unofficial policy is to allow them to congregate here instead. The proximity of health professionals makes it safer in case of overdose, and the new local government has cut through political deadlock to sanction a safe injecting room for users to shoot up their own gear inside. \n  \n Even so, a small number of addicts are either too suspicious or immune to the methadone to start treatment at all. \n  \n Ola Joesendal, deputy director of Bergen's Haukeland Hospital, said more than 90 percent of the city's heroin addicts receive methadone treatment. \"But for a very small amount of addicted people it is not possible to establish contact through the (methadone) maintenance program,\" he said. \"If we have the opportunity to reach them through heroin, then they can be reached.\" \n  \n Otherwise, their isolation from health professionals means they are the users most likely to die, he says. \n  \n Some are skeptical. Anti-drug campaigner Mina Gerhardsen says free heroin therapy would put too much strain on many of the vulnerable users it is intended to reach. \n  \n \"They won't be able to use this because you need to show up at the same place and time several times a day,\" she said. \"Many of these people are not capable of that.\" \n  \n Gerhardsen also said the publicly-funded medical heroin programs would be too expensive. The cost of the treatment can reach some $22,000 per year, compared with an upper level of $3,800 per year for methadone, according to the EU drugs watchdog. \n  \n First synthesized from opium poppies in 1898, and marketed as \"Heroin\" by the German pharmaceuticals giant Bayer, diamorphine was initially prescribed as pain relief. Later evidence showed its addictive qualities and it was banned in most countries, but continued to be manufactured and made available in Britain, primarily for end of life care. It also survived as a street drug where it is mixed with other toxins and its purity varies dangerously. \n  \n In 1991, Switzerland established a small scale trial, using diamorphine to treat heroin addicts unresponsive to other treatments such as methadone. Later trials in Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany all showed that supervised injectable heroin can be effective for targeting this marginal group, according to the EU watchdog. \n  \n It said the therapy creates \"major reductions\" in their continued use of illicit street heroin, \"major disengagement from criminal activities\" and \"marked improvements in social functioning.\" Joesendal says this type of harm reduction is at the heart of the proposed policy. \n  \n The drug is still available in these countries in small-scale quantities and strictly controlled conditions. \n  \n However, wary of encouraging use rather than rehabilitation, in 2013 Norway's Conservative-led national government rejected Joesendal's application for a medical heroin trial. \n  \n Cecilie Brein-Karlsen, deputy health minister for the junior ruling coalition partner, the Progress Party, says the change in local government to Labor in September will not force the Department of Health to change its mind. \n  \n \"It is not an option from the government's point of view,\" she said. \"We think we should prioritize other measures.\" \n  \n The government's overdose prevention strategy advocates persuading users to switch to smoking, which is far safer than injecting. Yet it will not allow addicts to use Oslo and Bergen's injecting rooms to smoke the drug. \n  \n \"The injecting room is supposed to help prevent overdose,\" argues Brein-Karlsen. \"Since smoking does not cause overdose, we don't think it is appropriate to use it in the injecting rooms.\" \n  \n Pricey doses of between $30-35 per hit make smoking wasteful for addicts who get a stronger high by injecting straight into their veins, especially considering that the average user will need four or more a day. In Norway, injecting has long been the preferred method. \n  \n The Conservative government has been radical in other ways. Straxhust is part of an ongoing trial to hand out and teach users how to administer Naloxone, a nasal drug that reverses the effects of overdose. Many of the addicts in the center say they have used the spray to save their friends. \n  \n Some have experienced it as a rare highlight in a tragic life. Birgitte Langoey's is a depressingly familiar story of a childhood scarred by domestic violence. \n  \n \"I grew up never with peace, always afraid,\" she says. When her husband died at 31, and her 6-year-old son was taken into protective care, her grieving brother-in-law introduced her to heroin. \n  \n \"Then it was no thinking, no feeling, no worries,\" she says. Now 43, she has struggled with addiction ever since. \n  \n Earlier this year, when she found her boyfriend in spasms and blue on her kitchen floor, she was able to use the Naloxone kit to save his life. \n  \n \"I am in heaven that he is alive,\" she says. ||||| America's heroin crisis has risen to levels that are demanding attention on the 2016 campaign trail as candidates from both sides of the aisle call for action, particularly in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire where heroin overdoses have soared. \n  \n In town hall forums and diners, the candidates repeatedly are confronting the issue, even putting out campaign platforms on addiction. Even as the Paris terror attacks bring national security and foreign policy back to the forefront of the campaign, heroin addiction remains one of the biggest domestic issues in the vital New England primary state. \n  \n Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton admits the focus took her by surprise. \"I never expected that substance abuse and mental health would be major issues in my campaign until I came to Keene on my very first trip,\" she said, speaking at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention earlier this fall. \"And then I started listening.\" \n  \n Heroin addiction has affected New Hampshire in profound ways. On average, one person dies every day from a drug-related overdose in the state. The epidemic is growing at a staggering rate -- heroin-related emergency visits have increased by 76 percent this year. \n  \n Nationally, heroin use among young adults has more than doubled in the past decade. The CDC reports that heroin overdose deaths increased by 286 percent from 2002 to 2013. Presidential candidates have heard intimate stories from families who have been torn apart by drug addiction, and they are responding in kind. \n  \n Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush opened up about his own daughter's struggle. \n  \n \"I've had the personal experience of dealing with the challenges of drug addiction and it wasn't easy,\" Bush said at a substance abuse roundtable in Manchester, N.H., in October. He echoed voters' concern, saying: \"When people are addicted to painkillers and then resort to a lower-cost alternative and then die? I mean, there should be a little more outrage about what's going on.\" \n  \n Voters remain vigilant as they seek to raise candidates' awareness, fighting to take away the stigma associated with drug addiction. \n  \n 'There should be a little more outrage about what's going on.' - Jeb Bush \n  \n New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has made advocacy and awareness his pledge. \"I'm going to be the kind of president who is going to talk about this. Because I want to remove the stigma,\" he said at a recent town hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \n  \n Christie's call for compassion and action was featured in a web video published by the Huffington Post that went viral, receiving over 8 million views. The issue hits close to home for the governor. \"I've dealt with this personally with people in my life,\" he said at a substance abuse roundtable in New Hampshire earlier this month. \"We have no tolerance for the dealing and the violence and all the rest ... [but] for those of you who become addicted we're going to do the best we can to get you treatment.\" \n  \n The issue is building common ground between parties as candidates search for solutions. Both Republicans and Democrats are calling for changes that would provide more treatment resources to communities. \"I am glad that Republicans are acknowledging this issue and hope that we can work together to go forward,\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told Fox News. \n  \n Sanders has been an outspoken advocate on the matter, telling voters at a local high school, \"You're not going to be hanging out on street corners doing drugs.\" The Vermont senator is calling for criminal justice reform, arguing that treating addicts instead of incarcerating them is both ethical and economically sound. \"You are not only going to save human lives by the thousands, you also save taxpayers' money,\" he said. \n  \n Candidates suggest they're not stumbling into the issue as a talking point but truly want to understand. \n  \n \"I am not here as a candidate. I'm here to listen and learn,\" Bush told a gathering of first responders, law enforcement, and health care providers at a substance abuse roundtable in Manchester, N.H. \n  \n Similar roundtable discussions with advocates and activists are a priority on many presidential candidate itineraries. Clinton hosted a town hall entirely focused on substance abuse where she heard heartbreaking testimony from families and loved ones who felt powerless against the epidemic that has infested their community. Christie visited a treatment center where he met with recovering addicts who shared their stories. \n  \n The issue allows candidates to move past stump speeches and connect with voters in an intimate way. Christie spoke frankly at the town hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \"I'm sure there is no one in this room that has not made a decision in their life that they wouldn't want to take back,\" he said. \"I'm just lucky that decision didn't involve drugs.

The more often the men went to the sauna, and the longer they stayed, the lower their risk for sudden cardiac death, fatal coronary heart disease and fatal cardiovascular disease over those 20 years. \n  \n The association was strong even after many potentially interacting factors were taken into account, said senior author Dr. Jari Laukkanen, a cardiologist at the Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. \n  \n Starting in the 1980s, more than 2,000 men filled out questionnaires about their weekly sauna use. About 1,500 men reported using a sauna two or three times per week, 600 said they used the sauna once per week and 200 said they visited the sauna four to seven days of the week. Only 12 men reported not using a sauna at all. \n  \n Duration ranged from two to 90 minutes at a time, and the temperature ranged from 40 to 100 degrees Celsius, or 104 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit, traditionally at low humidity levels. \n  \n In 2011, the researchers used interviews, hospital documents, death certificates and autopsy reports to assess when and how participants had died. \n  \n Overall, 190 men had died of sudden cardiac death, 281 died of coronary heart disease, 407 from cardiovascular disease, and 929 had died from other causes. \n  \n Ten percent of the once-a-week sauna users suffered sudden cardiac death, compared to almost eight percent of those who used the sauna two or three times weekly and five percent of those who went four to seven times per week. \n  \n The pattern was similar for other heart-related deaths. And for death from any cause, the risk fell from 49 percent for the least frequent sauna bathers to 31 percent for the most frequent, the researchers reported in JAMA Internal Medicine. \n  \n \u201cThere was an inverse relationship between sauna and (cardiovascular disease) risk, meaning that more is better,\u201d Laukkanen told Reuters Health by email. \u201cOn the basis of these results, it seems that more than four sauna sessions per week had the lowest risk, but also those with two to three sauna sessions may get some benefits.\u201d \n  \n Since this was an observational study, it only indicates that saunas and heart health are associated, not that one necessarily causes the other, said Dr. Rita F. Redberg of the University of California, San Francisco, who was not part of the new study. \n  \n Finnish saunas use dry heat, and these results may not apply to other types of saunas, Laukkanen said. \n  \n \u201cI must confess that although I have been a long-time fan of sauna bathing because it feels good, I had no idea it was associated with such dramatic health benefits and longer life,\u201d Redberg told Reuters Health by email. \n  \n If saunas do cause health improvements, they may do so either by relaxation or by physiological effects of heat, she said. \n  \n \u201cThe act of sitting in a sauna is relaxing by definition as one can not be doing much else while in a sauna, and often they are enjoyed with others \u2013 friends or strangers,\u201d she said. \u201cPhysiologically, they may improve circulation.\u201d \n  \n Differing activity levels did not explain the link between saunas and better health, Laukkanen noted. \n  \n \u201cSauna bathing is very common habit related to our culture,\u201d Laukkanen said. \u201cIn Finland saunas are not luxury items, almost everyone has access to a sauna,\u201d sometimes a private one inside the home. \n  \n \u201cWe think that results would be very similar in different populations including women,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, further studies are needed to show the effects of sauna among women and different age groups.\u201d \n  \n People who are dehydrated or have low blood pressure may feel dizzy or faint in saunas, and drinking alcohol beforehand is not a good idea, Redberg said. \n  \n SOURCE: bit.ly/18eWafh JAMA Internal Medicine, online February 23, 2015. ||||| Importance Sauna bathing is a health habit associated with better hemodynamic function; however, the association of sauna bathing with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality is not known. \n  \n Objective To investigate the association of frequency and duration of sauna bathing with the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), fatal coronary heart disease (CHD), fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality. \n  \n Design, Setting, and Participants We performed a prospective cohort study (Finnish Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study) of a population-based sample of 2315 middle-aged (age range, 42-60 years) men from Eastern Finland. Baseline examinations were conducted from March 1, 1984, through December 31, 1989. \n  \n Exposures Frequency and duration of sauna bathing assessed at baseline. \n  \n Results During a median follow-up of 20.7 years (interquartile range, 18.1-22.6 years), 190 SCDs, 281 fatal CHDs, 407 fatal CVDs, and 929 all-cause mortality events occurred. A total of 601, 1513, and 201 participants reported having a sauna bathing session 1 time per week, 2 to 3 times per week, and 4 to 7 times per week, respectively. The numbers (percentages) of SCDs were 61 (10.1%), 119 (7.8%), and 10 (5.0%) in the 3 groups of the frequency of sauna bathing. The respective numbers were 89 (14.9%), 175 (11.5%), and 17 (8.5%) for fatal CHDs; 134 (22.3%), 249 (16.4%), and 24 (12.0%) for fatal CVDs; and 295 (49.1%), 572 (37.8%), and 62 (30.8%) for all-cause mortality events. After adjustment for CVD risk factors, compared with men with 1 sauna bathing session per week, the hazard ratio of SCD was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57-1.07) for 2 to 3 sauna bathing sessions per week and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.18-0.75) for 4 to 7 sauna bathing sessions per week (P for trend = .005). Similar associations were found with CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality (P for trend \u2264.005). Compared with men having a sauna bathing session of less than 11 minutes, the adjusted hazard ratio for SCD was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.67-1.28) for sauna bathing sessions of 11 to 19 minutes and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.31-0.75) for sessions lasting more than 19 minutes (P for trend = .002); significant inverse associations were also observed for fatal CHDs and fatal CVDs (P for trend \u2264.03) but not for all-cause mortality events. \n  \n Conclusions and Relevance Increased frequency of sauna bathing is associated with a reduced risk of SCD, CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality. Further studies are warranted to establish the potential mechanism that links sauna bathing and cardiovascular health. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images \n  \n The only Finnish word to make it into everyday English is \"sauna\". But what it is, and how much it means to Finns, is often misunderstood - and it's definitely not about flirtation or sex. \n  \n In a dimly lit wood-panelled room, naked men sit in silence, sweating. One beats himself repeatedly with birch branches. Another stands, takes a ladle of water and carefully pours it over the heated stones of the stove in the corner. \n  \n There is a hissing noise. \n  \n Within seconds a wave of moist heat creeps up around your ankles and over your legs before enveloping your whole body. Your pores open up and sweat covers you from head to toe. \n  \n This bathing ritual has been performed across Finland for thousands of years, ever since the first settlers dug a ditch in the ground and heated a pile of stones. Water was thrown on the hot stones to give off a vapour known as loyly. \n  \n Each sauna is considered to have its own character and its own distinctive loyly. The better the loyly, the more enjoyable the sauna. \n  \n Image copyright Getty Images Sauna, noun (rhymes with downer) \"An invigorating bath originating in Finland in which the bather is subjected to hot steam, usually followed by a cold plunge or by being lightly beaten with birch twigs\" - Collins Dictionary The OED dates its first use in English to 1881 in travel writer Paul Belloni Du Chaillu's The Land of the Midnight Sun: \"One of the most characteristic institutions of the country is the Sauna.\" \n  \n For those working in the fields in harsh conditions, the sauna provided welcome relief to wash and soothe aching muscles. \n  \n These warm wooden rooms could be used at lower temperatures too, and were at the heart of the major events of a Finn's life. \n  \n Women gave birth in them because the walls of traditional smoke saunas were lined with naturally bacteria-resistant soot, making them the cleanest room in the house. \n  \n Saunas were also the place for purification rituals before marriage, and the bodies of the dead were washed and prepared for burial on the wooden benches. \n  \n For many Finns the sauna was the holiest room in the house and the one most closely associated with their wellbeing. \n  \n \"Finns say the sauna is a poor man's pharmacy,\" says Pekka Niemi, a 54-year-old from Helsinki, who spends about three hours a day in the sauna, six days a week. \"If a sick person is not cured by tar, spirits or sauna, then they will die,\" he adds, quoting a Finnish proverb. (\"Spirits\" here means strong alcohol, while tar was historically used as an antiseptic.) \n  \n Image copyright Mark Bosworth Sauna helps you to calm down in a modern society where it is never quiet Jarmo Lehtola \n  \n Today, Finland is a nation of 5.3 million people and 3.3 million saunas, found in homes, offices, factories, sports centres, hotels, ships and deep below the ground in mines. \n  \n While Pekka Niemi's sauna habit may be exceptional, 99% of Finns take at least one a week, and much more when they visit their summer cottage in the countryside. Here the pattern of life tends to revolve around the sauna, and a nearby lake used for cooling off. \n  \n Don't imagine, though, that the sauna is purely a place for fun and games. It certainly would not have been in times gone by. \n  \n \"Children were taught to behave in a sauna as if they were in church,\" says Jarmo Lehtola approvingly. He is from Saunaseura, the Finnish Sauna Society, an organisation dedicated to upholding and preserving traditional sauna culture. \n  \n Founded in 1937, this private club of 4,200 members is based on an island a 15-minute bus ride from central Helsinki. Surrounded by a silver birch forest, it overlooks the tranquil Baltic Sea. \n  \n A sign on the front door instructs you to switch off your mobile phone. \n  \n Image copyright Mark Bosworth Image caption At Saunaseura's private sauna near Helsinki \n  \n \"Sauna is for your mind. It really helps you to calm down in a modern society where it is never quiet,\" says Lehtola. \"You enter this meditative place. It's dark and it's usually so hot that you don't want to speak.\" \n  \n Types of sauna in Finland Smoke sauna (savusauna), 80-160C (176-320F): Known as the original sauna and mainly found in rural areas. Smoke fills the room as wood is burned in a large stove. Once up to heat, the fire is allowed to die and smoke is vented via a hole in the ceiling. Wood-heated sauna 70-130C (158-266F): Most common type in the countryside. Stones are placed on a metal stove fired by well-dried birch wood - preferred for its good smell and long-lasting burn. Electric sauna 80-105C (176-221F): Most common type as it's the safest and easiest to heat in homes. An electric stove is activated at the press of a button. Some apartment blocks have basement saunas that can be booked for private sessions. \n  \n There are some basic rules. No eating or drinking is allowed in the sauna and if you speak you should not discuss your job, title or religion. Members can choose between an electric sauna, two wood-burning saunas and three smoke saunas - all varying in heat and intensity. \n  \n Most Finns consider traditional smoke saunas to be the best because of the very soft loyly they produce. They take about five hours to heat and produce soot which covers the wooden walls in a thick black layer. The benches are scrubbed clean but bathers are advised not to lean against the wall, unless they want to get a sooty back. \n  \n Unlike wood-burning saunas, the smoke saunas use a stove without a chimney. The smoke clears through a small hole in the ceiling before you enter. You can still smell it - a pleasant sensation which transports your mind to the forest - but you do not see it or feel it in your eyes. \n  \n No clothes or swimsuits are allowed, for the same reason that you would not wear anything in the bath or shower. Every part of the body needs to be properly cleaned. \n  \n Men and women visit the sauna separately, unless they are members of the same family. Parents go with their children, and everyone is comfortable with that - at least until the children become teenagers, when they tend to use the sauna alone, or with friends. \n  \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The word carried sexual connotations in 1970s Soho \n  \n There is one widespread misconception that Lehtola is very keen to dispel. \"It's nothing to do with sex in Finland,\" he says emphatically. \n  \n Finnish sauna sayings In the sauna one must conduct himself as one would in church \n  \n The sauna is a poor man's pharmacy \n  \n If a sick person is not cured by tar, spirits [alcohol] or sauna, then they will die \n  \n A woman looks her most beautiful after the sauna \n  \n All men are created equal; but nowhere more so than in a sauna \n  \n A house without a sauna is not a home \n  \n A sauna without a birch whisk is like food without salt \n  \n \"But in places like Germany in the 1970s and 80s it was all to do with sex.\" \n  \n Lehtola insists he has never enjoyed a sauna beyond Finland's borders, despite trying them in many countries. \n  \n Truth to tell, he would not be happy with some of Helsinki's public saunas either. Two - Kotiharju and Arla - date from the 1920s and can be found in Kallio, a traditionally working class district. \n  \n Factory workers who lived in homes without bathing facilities used to visit these saunas to relax, socialise and be scrubbed clean by washerwomen. Now the area's new inhabitants - students, artists and adventurous tourists - come to sweat and drink cold beer. \n  \n At Arla, the mood contrasts sharply with Saunaseura's contemplative atmosphere. The famed Finnish reserve is nowhere to be seen. People seem to enjoy talking to complete strangers in the nude, as long as it's painfully hot. \n  \n And there is alcohol too. Outside in a courtyard people wrapped in towels open bottles of beer, as steam rises from their bodies. \n  \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Watching ice hockey from the warmth of a stadium sauna box in Helsinki \n  \n There used to be more than 100 public saunas in Helsinki, with one on almost every street corner.

When world leaders came to his official residence, Tamminiemi, he would hold negotiations in the sauna where new and more constructive ideas arose. Kekkonen believed all were equal in the sauna, and politics could not be hidden up a sleeve when no sleeves were worn. Finland trod a diplomatic tightrope during the Cold War. Its neutrality between East and West was constantly challenged by its giant neighbour, the USSR. In 1960, Khrushchev attended Kekkonen's 60th birthday. The story goes that Kekkonen kept Khrushchev in the sauna until 5am, throwing more water on the hot stones. Soon after, the Soviet government issued a communique expressing support for Finland's intention to co-operate with the West. It led to Finland joining the European Free Trade Association in 1971. Khrushchev was criticised at home. His countrymen said a communist should not have gone naked into a sauna with a capitalist and non-socialist. Tamminiemi is now a museum dedicated to Kekkonen.

(Associated Press) \n  \n In this Aug. 2, 2003 photo, competitors sweat on the sauna benches during the Sauna World Championships in Heinola, Finland. Frequent sauna baths may help you live longer, a study of Finnish men suggests.... (Associated Press) \n  \n Previous research suggested that saunas might improve blood vessel function and exercise capacity, and lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The new study links long, hot sauna baths with even more benefits, including fewer deaths from heart attacks, strokes, various heart-related conditions and other causes. \n  \n Five things to know about the research, released Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine: \n  \n THE METHODS \n  \n About 2,300 Finnish men, in their early 50s on average, were asked how often they used saunas. The rates ranged from once weekly to every day. During almost 20 years of follow-up, more than 900 men died. The researchers took into account characteristics in addition to sauna use that would affect survival, including cigarette smoking, weight, physical activity, blood pressure and cholesterol, and income. \n  \n THE RESULTS \n  \n Deaths from heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems were nearly two times more common in men who used saunas once weekly than in those who used saunas at least four times weekly. Deaths from other causes were also more common in men who used saunas infrequently. \n  \n The amount of time spent in the sauna mattered, too. Fatal heart-related deaths were less common in men whose sauna sessions lasted more than 19 minutes, compared with those who spent less than 11 minutes in the sauna. \n  \n THE REASONS \n  \n Dr. Jari Laukkanen, a University of Eastern Finland researcher and the lead author, said it could be that high temperature and humidity may cause beneficial physiological changes in the cardiovascular system, but that more research is needed to determine how saunas might prolong survival. \n  \n They are clearly relaxing for many people, and the camaraderie they offer may also benefit health, said heart specialist Dr. Rita Redberg, editor of the medical journal. \"Clearly time spent in the sauna is time well spent,\" she said. \n  \n SAUNA SPECIFICS \n  \n Sauna rooms were 79 degrees Celsius, or 174 degrees Fahrenheit, on average for the most frequent users, but slightly lower for men who only used saunas once weekly. Finnish sauna rooms typically allow users to regulate temperature by pouring water on heated rocks. In Finland, nearly every home has a private sauna, often a separate room built into the basement. Families often use them together and older apartments often have common saunas. \n  \n THE CAVEATS \n  \n The study is based on observational information and more rigorous research is needed to determine if saunas, or some unmeasured factor, might explain the results. The authors said similar studies are needed in women to determine if they would gain the same benefits. They said the research doesn't apply to saunas that operate at lower temperatures and don't allow pouring water on rocks to regulate heat, nor to steam rooms or hot tubs. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Online: \n  \n JAMA Internal Medicine: http://jamainternalmedicine.com |||||", "output": "\"Finns say the sauna is a poor man's pharmacy,\" a 54-year-old Helsinki native told the BBC in 2013. \"If a sick person is not cured by tar, spirits, or sauna, then they will die.\" Looks like the Finns\u2014most of whom have private saunas at home, the AP notes\u2014were onto something: A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that sauna use may provide health benefits, decrease cardiovascular disease risk, and even help you live longer, Reuters reports. Researchers tracked sauna use over 20 years for about 2,300 Finnish men (ages 42 to 60) and found that, even after accounting for other factors, heart attack deaths and other cardiovascular-related fatalities were almost twice as common in men who used saunas once a week, compared to those who used them at least four times weekly, the AP notes. For death from any cause, risk fell from 49% for the least-frequent users to 31% for those who went the most, as per Reuters. On average, the saunas hovered at 174 degrees Fahrenheit (slightly lower for those who didn't use them as often). Time spent in the sauna also affected results: Heart-related deaths weren't as prevalent in men who hung out in the sauna for more than 19 minutes compared to shorter sessions of less than 11 minutes. So what's the secret? The study's lead researcher points to the high heat and humidity as possibly causing positive cardiovascular effects, while a cardiologist tells the AP that the relaxation brought on by a sauna visit may help. \"The camaraderie they offer may also benefit health,\" Dr. Rita Redberg says. \"Clearly, time spent in the sauna is time well spent.\" Researchers note, however, that the study was based on observational info only, doesn't apply to lower-temperature saunas, and only studied middle-aged men.

Oddball inventor's laboratory Quirky is building a connected coffeepot and an infant formula machine, both of which can order their own refills and replacement equipment. Your Whirlpool washing machine could know the size of detergent bottle you buy and how much of it you've used, deducing when it's time to order more. You know that Brita filter you haven't replaced in three years? (I'm nodding my head.) It'll automatically get another one shipped out as soon as it's needed. \n  \n It's an amazing, futuristic, surprisingly logical idea. It's also totally terrifying. I have no idea when my Brita filter needs replacing; it's nice to have the filter tell me, but what's to stop Brita from ordering a replacement 25 percent sooner than it needs to? I'll never know it's conning me, and it'll suddenly cost me 25 percent more. If Kraft sends me just a little more mac 'n' cheese than I really need, it's just going to invisibly drive up the cost. And, yeah, there's something a little creepy about Amazon knowing the exact pace with which I go through toilet paper. You Might Like: Prune Juice, Fiber One cereal. \n  \n Amazon's fairly candid about the fact that it has a lot to think through, and says that's why it's opening this up slowly. There will be a beta, and a much wider launch this fall. At that point, though, Amazon VP Peter Larsen says any device with internet access can use DRS with just ten lines of code. \n  \n Larsen says this is the future, that it's not a matter of if but when. And as much as I'm terrified, and worried about Amazon's capitalistic impulses and the vast amounts of deeply personal data it will collect about me, I keep coming back to that burned-out light bulb. What if the internet of things can fix itself, or at least get you the parts you need? (Amazon's already working on being able to call the guy to come fix it, too.) That's a pretty amazing step toward removing frustrating friction from our lives. And look, let's be honest: I really need to change my Brita filter. ||||| Just when you thought American capitalism had reached its peak, Amazon is announcing the Dash Button. The idea is simple: You push a branded button, and Amazon ships that brand\u2019s products to your home. The Dash Button is free for Prime Members. Just don\u2019t let the kids near it. \n  \n While the Dash Button sounds like an April Fool\u2019s Joke, it\u2019s actually part of a long-standing Amazon initiative to make it stupid simple for you to spend money more seamlessly. Just shy of a year ago, Amazon announced Dash, a handheld wifi-enabled magic wand that helped your keep your pantry stocked. The new Dash Button is pretty much a simplified version of that, except you need a special button for each product, and you have to go with the brand that\u2019s on the button. So if you install the Amazon Dash Button for Tide, Tide is what you\u2019ll get. \n  \n Click here to sign up for your own brand-loving Dash Button. Once again, it\u2019s free with Prime. And here are the participating brands: \n  \n This is just a new extreme for the world\u2019s largest store, a store that makes it impossibly easy to buy things without overthinking it, or thinking it at all. The Dash Button joins other popular Amazon offerings like subscriptions for good you order regularly and the enterprise-focused Dash Replenishment Service\u2014thought that\u2019s still in beta. One day we\u2019ll all be buying with buttons, though. Because if there\u2019s one thing Americans like more than spending money, it\u2019s pushing buttons. \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n [ Amazon] \n  \n Image via Amazon \n  \n Contact the author at adam@gizmodo.com. \n  \n Public PGP key \n  \n PGP fingerprint: 91CF B387 7B38 148C DDD6 38D2 6CBC 1E46 1DBF 22 \n  \n Advertisement |||||", "output": "The Wall Street Journal admits it held off on writing about the new Amazon Dash Button today because it seemed like an April Fool's joke. Turns out, it's the real deal. Amazon wants people to place these branded buttons in conspicuous places\u2014one for detergent on the washing machine, for example, or one for Gatorade on the fridge\u2014and then press them when it's time to reorder. In two days (assuming you've got WiFi) your package arrives. So while it may sound like a prank, the Dash Button \"is actually part of a long-standing Amazon initiative to make it stupid simple for you to spend money more seamlessly,\" writes Adam Clark Estes at Gizmodo. The way it works for now is that Amazon will ask some Prime subscribers to participate, and they will pick from a list of buttons. Companies involved include Gillette, Cottonelle, Gatorade, Kraft, Olay, and Tide, but the list will keep growing. If a curious kid happens upon the button, safeguards will prevent multiple orders. And if it sounds a little Jetsons-like, just wait for the next phase, reports Wired.

For example, Rep. Bill Johnson (R-OH) voted against the VAWA bill because it was a \"politically\u2013motivated, constitutionally-dubious Senate version bent on dividing women into categories by race, transgender politics and sexual preference.\" The objections can be grouped in two broadly ideological areas--that the law is an unnecessary overreach by the federal government, and that it represents a \"feminist\" attack on family values. The act's grants have encouraged states to implement \"mandatory-arrest\" policies, under which police responding to domestic-violence calls are required to make an arrest. These policies were intended to combat the too-common situation in which a victim is intimidated into recanting an abuse accusation. Critics also say VAWA has been subject to waste, fraud, and abuse because of insufficient oversight. \n  \n Reference: Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act; Bill S. 47 ; vote number 13-SV019 on Feb 12, 2013 \n  \n Voted YES on prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. \n  \n Proponents support voting YES because: \n  \n Rep. CASTOR: The march towards equality under the law for all of our citizens has sometimes been slow, but it has been steady. Over time, Congress has outlawed discrimination in the workplace, based upon a person's race, gender, age, national origin, religion and disability, because when it comes to employment, these decisions are rightly based upon a person's qualifications and job performance. This legislation that outlaws job discrimination based upon sexual orientation was first introduced over 30 years ago. A broad coalition of businesses and community organizations strongly support this landmark civil rights legislation, including the Human Rights Campaign; the Anti-Defamation League; and the NAACP. \n  \n Opponents recommend voting NO because: \n  \n Rep. HASTINGS: Federal law bans job discrimination based on race, color, national origin, or gender. In addition, 19 States have passed laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I strongly oppose discrimination in the workplace. However, I do not think it is the place of the Federal Government to legislate how each and every workplace operates. A number of States have enacted State laws in this area. That is their right. Many businesses have chosen to adopt their own policies. That is appropriate as well. This bill as written would expand Federal law into a realm where PERCEPTION would be a measure under discrimination law [which I consider inappropriate]. \n  \n Reference: Employment Non-Discrimination Act; Bill HR3685 ; vote number 2007-1057 on Nov 13, 2007 \n  \n Voted YES on Constitutionally defining marriage as one-man-one-woman. \n  \n Proponents support voting YES because: \n  \n The overwhelming majority of the American people support traditional marriage, marriage between a man and a woman. The people have a right to know whether their elected Representatives agree with them about protecting traditional marriage. \n  \n Every child deserves both a father and a mother. Studies demonstrate the utmost importance of the presence of a child's biological parents in a child's happiness, health and future achievements. If we chip away at the institution which binds these parents and the family together, the institution of marriage, you begin to chip away at the future success of that child. \n  \n Opponents support voting NO because: \n  \n This amendment does not belong in our Constitution. It is unworthy of our great Nation. We have amended the Constitution only 27 times. Constitutional amendments have always been used to enhance and expand the rights of citizens, not to restrict them. Now we are being asked to amend the Constitution again, to single out a single group and to say to them for all time, you cannot even attempt to win the right to marry. \n  \n From what precisely would this amendment protect marriage? From divorce? From adultery? No. Evidently, the threat to marriage is the fact that there are millions of people in this country who very much believe in marriage, who very much want to marry but who are not permitted to marry. I believe firmly that in the not-too-distant future people will look back on these debates with the incredulity with which we now view the segregationist debates of years past. \n  \n Reference: Marriage Protection Amendment; Bill H J RES 88 ; vote number 2006-378 on Jul 18, 2006 \n  \n Voted YES on making the PATRIOT Act permanent. \n  \n Assigning three judges to hear individuals' petitions concerning improper requests by the FBI for library circulation records, library patron lists, book sales records, book customer lists, and other records \n  \n Reporting every year the number of library records orders that are granted, modified, or denied \n  \n Allows Internet service providers to disclose their subscribers information and the contents of their communications to a government entity, if they believe there is \u201cimmediate danger of death or serious physical injury\u201d \n  \n Requires that any court that allows a \u201croving wiretap\u201d under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) must describe in great detail the intended target whose identity is not known \n  \n Allows individuals and businesses to seek legal counsel if they have received a National Security Letter from the FBI requiring them to disclose financial information and records \n  \n Reference: USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act; Bill HR 3199 ; vote number 2005-627 on Dec 14, 2005 \n  \n Voted YES on Constitutional Amendment banning same-sex marriage. \n  \n Reference: Constitutional Amendment sponsored by Rep Musgrave [R, CO-4]; Bill H.J.RES.106 ; vote number 2004-484 on Sep 30, 2004 \n  \n Voted YES on protecting the Pledge of Allegiance. \n  \n Reference: Bill sponsored by Rep Todd Akin [R, MO-2]; Bill H.R.2028 ; vote number 2004-467 on Sep 23, 2004 \n  \n Voted NO on constitutional amendment prohibiting flag desecration. \n  \n Reference: Resolution sponsored by Thomas, R-CA; Bill HJRes.4 ; vote number 2003-234 on Jun 3, 2003 \n  \n Require \"Privacy Impact Statement\" on new federal rules. \n  \n SPONSOR'S INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT: It is clear that this bill's many cosponsors do not agree on every issue. The same can be said of the bill's noncongressional supporters, which include groups ranging from the National Rifle Association to the American Civil Liberties Union. \n  \n The sphere of privacy, which Justice Brandeis eloquently described as the ''right to be let alone,'' is not only rapidly diminishing, it is increasingly penetrable. The Federal Agency Protection of Privacy Act takes the first--necessary--step toward protecting the privacy of information collected by the federal government, by requiring that rules noticed for public comment by federal agencies be accompanied by an assessment of the rule's impact on personal privacy interests, including the extent to which the proposed rule provides notice of the collection of personally identifiable information, what information will be obtained, and how this informational will be collected, protected, maintained, used and disclosed. \n  \n I want to emphasize H.R. 4561 will not unduly burden regulators nor will it hinder law enforcement. This bill will apply the best antiseptic--sunshine--to the federal rulemaking process by securing the public's right to know about how rules will affect their personal privacy. \n  \n EXCERPTS FROM BILL: \n  \n Requires Federal agencies, when promulgating a rule, to publish a privacy impact analysis. \n  \n Requires an agency promulgating a rule that may have a significant privacy impact on individuals to use specified techniques to assure that individuals have been given an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking. \n  \n Requires each agency to carry out a periodic review of promulgated rules that have privacy impact, every ten years after the rule was published. \n  \n LEGISLATIVE OUTCOME: Passed House on a voice vote; sent to Senate on Oct. 8, 2002; never called to vote in Senate. \n  \n Source: Federal Agency Protection of Privacy Act (H.R.4561) 02-HR4561 on Apr 24, 2002 \n  \n Rated 27% by the ACLU, indicating an anti-civil rights voting record. \n  \n The mission of the ACLU is to preserve protections and guarantees America\u2019s original civic values - the Constitution and the Bill of Rights: Your First Amendment rights-freedom of speech, association and assembly.

Jeff Flake felt the wrath of liberal constituents Thursday during a town hall in suburban Phoenix that produced a constant stream of boos, negative chants and angry criticism. \n  \n Flake addressed topics such as health care, border security, internet privacy, and actions by President Donald Trump's administration during the fully packed town hall meeting in Mesa that lasted more than two hours. \n  \n The crowd repeatedly chanted \"you work for us\" and \"shame on you\" in response to Flake's answers during his first public event with Arizonans since January. The senator has faced withering criticism for his voting record and avoiding town hall gatherings in recent months. \n  \n The atmosphere quickly heated up as people hurled angry questions and disapproval at the Republican senator for his positions on health care, defunding Planned Parenthood and voting for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. \n  \n DeVos has been an outspoken backer of vouchers that let parents send their children to private schools with taxpayer money. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed legislation last week that will make vouchers available to every student in Arizona \u2014 one of the broadest policies in the nation. \n  \n Many constituents grilled the senator on his support of DeVos and the effects she'll have on the state's schools. \n  \n On several occasions, Flake's answers were drowned out by boos. He remained composed, thanking people for their concerns as he stood on the stage with his arms crossed or with his hands in the pockets of his blue jeans. \"We disagree on Betsy DeVos, I'm sorry that we disagree,\" he said on multiple occasions. \n  \n Flake, who was an outspoken critic against Trump during the election, sought some common ground when the constituents turned their ire toward the president's campaign promise to build a wall across the border. \n  \n \"The notion of a 2,000 mile wall, nobody believes that that's going to happen,\" he said. \"But we do need border security.\" \n  \n The senator is a moderate Republican seeking a second term in 2018, but is facing backlash from the left and right. A conservative former state lawmaker said she views Flake as part of the establishment and has already announced her candidacy to challenge him in the Republican primary next year. Liberals are upset with his votes in the opening months of the Trump administration. \n  \n Constituents criticized his legislation blocking internet privacy, which would allow telecommunications companies to track consumers browsing activities without permission and effectively dismantle regulations from former President Barack Obama's administration furthering consumers' online protections. \n  \n One constituent was concerned with Trump's trips to Mar-a-Lago, pressing Flake on whether or not he was concerned about it as well. Others brought up Trump's refusal to release his tax returns. Cheers erupted when a teenage girl described growing up in poverty and attacking Flake for his stance on Planned Parenthood. \n  \n House and Senate Republicans across the country have faced jeering crowds at town halls while home on congressional recesses, most notably during the debate over health care. Many GOP lawmakers avoided the events altogether. The outcry is similar to the opposition Democrats faced over their support of then-President Barack Obama's health care law in 2010 by the burgeoning tea party movement. \n  \n After Flake decided against holding town hall meetings earlier this year, Arizona voters held various protests and rallies outside of the senator's home and Phoenix office. Their opposition gave rise to the hashtag #SearchForFlake as groups such as Moms Demand Action and Indivisible of AZ led so-called search party events looking for Flake and demanding town hall meetings. \n  \n \"Obviously, it's about time,\" Peoria resident Kristiana Bachman said at the town hall. \"It looked like he was going to continue to try to duck us but apparently he feels some responsibility to his constituents.\" ||||| Sen.

Video by WSJ's Peter Nicholas via #WorldStream. \n  \n The centerpiece of the agenda is a federal-state partnership that would try to coax states to create preschool slots for all low- and moderate-income 4-year-olds by providing some matching federal funds. \n  \n Related Video President Obama called for colleges to rein in their costs during his State of the Union address Tuesday night. But new data show those who attend schools with lower tuition often end up paying in other ways. MarketWatch's Rex Crum reports. (Photo: AP) \n  \n President Barack Obama, speaking about the plan Thursday after touring a preschool here, said giving every child access to high-quality early education should be a national priority, adding, \"Study after study shows that the earlier a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road.\" \n  \n Mr. Obama's preschool agenda builds on research that shows investment in high-quality early education can students' boost academic achievement and job-earning potential. But it isn't clear how much the proposal would cost, or whether states could build up on a large scale the kind of high-caliber programs that research suggests deliver results. \n  \n Administration officials said the price tag would be disclosed in the federal budget next month, but said the move wouldn't add to the nation's deficit. \n  \n Still, some Republican lawmakers balked at the potential cost and the idea of a larger federal role in preschool education, while others questioned whether there is enough scientific research to support preschool expansion. \n  \n Sen. Johnny Isakson (R., Ga.) said his state's program, which offers free prekindergarten to all 4-year-olds, works because it was \"started locally, is funded locally, doesn't have a dime of federal money.\" \n  \n The nation's government-funded preschool programs are a hodgepodge in terms of quality and cost. Mr. Obama said that about one-third of U.S. 4-year-olds are enrolled in high-quality ones, adding that his plan could greatly expand those numbers. \n  \n Though the effort has been billed by the administration as \"preschool for all,\" including the middle class, the plan targets disadvantaged children. The program would provide matching funds\u2014although it isn't clear whether it would be dollar-for-dollar\u2014to states that expand preschool slots for families with incomes of twice the federal poverty level or less. States could get extra funds to expand preschool offerings to middle-class families. \n  \n States would have to meet certain conditions, such as hiring \"well-trained teachers\" who are paid comparably to K-12 teachers, adopting rigorous curricula, keeping student-teacher ratios low and assessing youngsters. \n  \n The administration would create guidelines for each standard, but states would have some leeway to craft their own. \n  \n Nobel Prize laureate James Heckman, an economist at the University of Chicago, praised Mr. Obama's plan and said every $1 invested in quality early-childhood education for low-income children provides a 7% to 10% annual return on investment per child in terms of better education, health and economic outcomes. He said high-quality programs might appear to be expensive, but the costs \"are not high in terms of the opportunity costs of not doing the programs.\" \n  \n Maria Fitzpatrick, professor of policy analysis and management at Cornell University, in an emailed news release cautioned against any plan that would expand preschool to all 4-year-olds, saying that \"results show that only some children gain\u2014disadvantaged children, particularly those in rural areas\u2014and that the effects fade out over time.\" \n  \n The president's proposal also would increase high-quality early-education programs for infants and toddlers and expand the home-visiting initiative, which sends nurses and other professionals into homes to work with low-income families on parenting and school-readiness skills. \n  \n \u2014Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article. \n  \n Write to Stephanie Banchero at stephanie.banchero@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com \n  \n A version of this article appeared February 15, 2013, on page A4 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: White House Details Preschool Plan. ||||| President Obama \u2019s call in his State of the Union address to \u201cmake high-quality preschool available to every single child in America\u201d rallied advocates across the country who have long argued that inequity in education begins at a very young age. \n  \n In details that emerged early Thursday, the administration proposed that the federal government work with states to provide preschool for every 4-year-old from low- and moderate-income families. The president\u2019s plan also calls for expanding Early Head Start, the federal program designed to prepare children from low-income families for school, to broaden quality childcare for infants and toddlers. \n  \n While supporters herald the plans as a way to help level the playing field for children who do not have the advantages of daily bedtime stories, music lessons and counting games at home, critics argue that federal money could be squandered on ineffective programs. \n  \n In the 2010-11 school year, the latest year for which data is available, 28 percent of all four-year-olds in the United States were enrolled in state-financed preschool programs, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research. \n  \n According to W. Steven Barnett, director of the institute, which is based at Rutgers University, only five states, including Oklahoma and Georgia, have a stated objective of offering preschool slots to all 4-year-olds. While about 1.1 million students across the country are enrolled in federally financed Head Start programs and others attend private preschools, that still leaves millions of children on the sidelines. \n  \n The president\u2019s plan would provide federal matching dollars to states to provide public preschool slots for four-years olds whose families earn up to 200 percent of the poverty level. President Obama would also allocate extra funds for states to expand public pre-kindergarten slots for middle-class families, who could pay on a sliding scale of tuition. \n  \n President Obama\u2019s early education proposals come as a handful of states have been more aggressively pushing taxpayer-financed preschool. \n  \n In Alabama, for example, Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, has called for a $12.5 million increase \u2014 or more than 60 percent \u2014 in the state\u2019s preschool budget, with the eventual goal of increasing financing over 10 years to the point where every 4-year-old in the state could have a preschool slot. \n  \n The governor\u2019s proposal is supported by a coalition of early-education advocates and business leaders, who see preschool as an important component of future job readiness. \n  \n \u201cWe\u2019re trying to invest in a work force that can compete in 20 years with other states and other nations,\u201d said Allison de la Torre, executive director of the coalition, the Alabama School Readiness Alliance. \n  \n Alabama is one of only five states whose preschool program received top marks based on an assessment of its quality standards by the National Institute for Early Education Research, but only 6 percent of 4-year-olds there are enrolled in a state-financed preschool. \n  \n To receive state money in Alabama, a preschool must employ teachers with bachelor\u2019s degrees in early childhood education or child development, keep class sizes under 20 children, and follow a state-approved curriculum. The Obama administration is proposing similar standards for its federal matching program. \n  \n At one of the state-financed sites on Wednesday, the Nina Nicks Joseph Child Development Center in Mobile, Tina Adair, the lead teacher in a class of 18 students, most of whom come from low-income families, helped Amiyah Wilson, 5, copy the words \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d onto a card for her mother. Elsewhere in the classroom, Donovan Smith, 5, and Henry Hinojosa, 5, used a scale to compare the weights of two loads of blocks. \n  \n Ms. Adair said that the children had plenty of time to paint, sing or play with dress-up clothes and toy trucks. But she said they were also preparing for kindergarten and beyond through letter and number games, science experiments and writing. \n  \n As a former middle-school teacher, Ms. Adair said she could tell when students have had academic preparation from an early age. \n  \n \u201cAs fast-paced as our public school system is right now,\u201d she said, \u201cany little advantage that they can get is a bonus.\u201d |||||", "output": "The Obama administration is outlining the \"federal-state partnership\" it wants to use to widen preschool programs, emphasizing small class sizes and rigorous curricula in its outreach to 4-year-olds in low- and moderate income households, reports the Wall Street Journal.

Bloomberg / Bloomberg via Getty Images \n  \n The filing came in the case of Maurice Walker of Calhoun, Georgia. He was kept in jail for six nights after police arrested him for the misdemeanor offense of being a pedestrian under the influence. He was told he could not get out of jail unless he paid the fixed bail amount of $160. \n  \n Related: Civil Rights Advocates Applaud Feds' Fight Against 'Debtors' Prisons' \n  \n Justice Department's civil rights lawyers said in their brief that courts must consider a person's indigence and look at other ways of guaranteeing an appearance in court. \n  \n \"Fixed bail schedules that allow for the pretrial release of only those who can play, without accounting for the ability to pay,\" the government said, \"unlawfully discriminate based on indigence.\" \n  \n A federal judge in January ruled in Walker's favor, ordering the city to let those arrested on misdemeanor offenses be released on their own recognizance and to make other changes in its post-arrest procedures. \n  \n In appealing that order, the city said the preset amounts of the city's bail schedule are tied to the seriousness of each offense and are specifically allowed under Georgia law. \n  \n Related: Reformers Seek to Undo Growth of New 'Debtors' Prisons' \n  \n \"A system of unsecured recognizance bonds,\" the city said in its appeal,\" greatly reduces the incentive for defendants to appear.\" \n  \n The city is supported by the Georgia Sheriff's Association and by a group representing the nation's bail bondsmen. They argue that the Constitution does not guarantee bail, it only bans excessive bail. \n  \n \"It thus simply cannot be that any defendant arrested for any crime must be immediately released based on a bare assertion of indigence,\" the group said in its court filing. \n  \n Related: Lawsuit Charges 13 St. Louis Suburbs With \"Extorting\" Black Drivers \n  \n Barry J. Pollack, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense lawyers, said Friday said he applauded the Justice Department's for making \"critically important arguments.\" \n  \n A spokesman for the defense lawyers group said it believes \"pretrial liberty must be the norm and detention prior to trial the carefully limited exception.\" ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department filed an amicus brief in a federal circuit court on Friday that said mandating inmates pay bail to be released before a trial violates civil rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n  \n The filing in the 11th Circuit marks the first time the Justice Department has told a federal court that mandating bail for release discriminates against people who cannot afford the fee. ||||| WASHINGTON \u2015 The Obama administration has joined the fight against the American bail industry, telling a federal appeals court that bail practices that keep poor defendants locked up because they cannot afford to purchase their freedom are unconstitutional. \n  \n \u201cBail practices that do not account for indigence result in the unnecessary incarceration of numerous individuals who are presumed innocent,\u201d the Justice Department wrote in an amicus brief filed Friday. \n  \n The brief marks the first time DOJ has weighed in on the constitutional requirements of bail systems in a federal appeals court. \n  \n Bail practices in the United States often leave poor people languishing in jail simply because they cannot afford a certain amount of money to purchase their freedom. Many of the more than 800 jail deaths logged by The Huffington Post between July 2015 and July 2016 involved individuals who were incarcerated after being arrested for minor offenses and who were unable to afford their bail. \n  \n DOJ says that many jurisdictions still incarcerate people without taking their financial circumstances into account, and notes that the use of money bail has \u201cincreased substantially since 1990.\u201d \n  \n Maurice Walker is at the center of the case at issue. The 54-year-old was arrested by the Calhoun Police Department in Georgia in September 2015 for allegedly being a \u201cpedestrian under the influence.\u201d Walker, who has limited income and serious mental health issues, was told he would not be released unless he came up with $160, the fixed amount set by bond for someone charged with being a pedestrian under the influence. \n  \n Court was held just once a week in Calhoun, and Walker was arrested on a Thursday before Labor Day when there was no court. He remained in jail for six days, and would have been there longer \u2015 but he was released after lawyers with Equal Justice Under Law and the Southern Center for Human Rights filed a class action lawsuit on his behalf while he was still behind bars. \n  \n A lower federal court had ruled earlier this year that \u201cany bail or bond scheme that mandates payment of pre-fixed amounts for different offenses to obtain pretrial release, without any consideration of indigence or other factors, violates the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d \n  \n That ruling is being appealed by the city, and is also opposed by the American Bail Coalition. ABC claims that the plaintiff takes the \u201cextreme position\u201d that \u201cany defendant is entitled to immediate release based on an unverified assertion of indigency,\u201d and argues that bail is a \u201cLiberty-Promoting Institution As Old As The Republic.\u201d \n  \n RELATED STORIES Our Bail System Is Leaving Innocent People To Die In Jail Because They're Poor \n  \n DOJ, which has faced pressure from advocates to get aggressive in cracking down on unconstitutional practices that plague the American justice system, said that fixed bail practices discriminate against people who lack financial means. \n  \n From Friday\u2019s filing: \n  \n Fixed bail schedules that allow for the pretrial release of only those who can pay, without accounting for ability to pay and alternative methods of assuring future appearance, do not provide for such individualized determinations, and therefore unlawfully discriminate based on indigence. Under such bail schemes, arrestees who can afford to pay the fixed bail amount are promptly released whenever they are able to access sufficient funds for payment, even if they are likely to miss their assigned court date or pose a danger to others. Conversely, the use of such schedules effectively denies pretrial release to those who cannot afford to pay the fixed bail amount, even if they pose no flight risk, and even if alternative methods of assuring appearance (such as an unsecured bond or supervised release) could be imposed. Such individuals are unnecessarily kept in jail until their court appearance often for even minor offenses, such as a traffic or ordinance violation, including violations that are not punishable by incarceration. \n  \n The Justice Department filing mentions the consent decree that the Civil Rights Division reached with Ferguson, Missouri, to end unconstitutional bail practices found as part of an investigation into the police department and municipal court there. A recent lawsuit filed by ArchCity Defenders targets other municipalities in St. Louis County that have engaged in similar practices. \n  \n Alec Karakatsanis, the co-founder of Equal Justice Under Law, told The Huffington Post that having the backing of the Justice Department as well as organizations like the American Bar Association and CATO is an important step in bringing an end to unconstitutional practices. \n  \n \u201cHundreds of thousands of human beings are held in American cages every night solely because they are too poor to make a payment,\u201d Karakatsanis said. \u201cToday\u2019s amicus filings of support by a wide range of groups, including the Department of Justice, takes us closer to finally eradicating poverty jailing from American society.\u201d |||||", "output": "It's unconstitutional to keep poor defendants in jail before their trial simply because they can't afford to pay bail.

She spent the government\u2019s $20,000 four-year allowance for White House refurbishing in one year, Baker wrote. \n  \n She also spent heavily on clothing and jewelry, seeking to emulate European royalty, even as the United States was in the grip of the Civil War. \n  \n After her 11-year-old son, \u00adWillie, died on Feb. 20, 1862, Mary took to her bed for three weeks, overcome with grief, \u00adBaker wrote. \n  \n Later, she dabbled in spiritualism and attended seances in the White House to try to contact her departed son. She believed that he and his deceased brother, \u00adEddie, appeared to her in her room at night. \n  \n Meanwhile, her jealousies tormented her. \n  \n Three weeks before her husband was assassinated, she attended an Army review with him in Virginia. Arriving late in a wagon, she became enraged that the wife of a prominent general was riding on horseback beside the president. \n  \n Mary confronted her husband and began to rail at him in front of Army officers, according to Baker. \n  \n \u201cHe bore it as Christ might have done, with an expression of pain and sadness that cut one to the heart,\u201d an officer wrote later. \u201cHe pleaded with eyes and tones, till she turned on him like a tigress, and then he walked away.\u201d \n  \n She demanded that the general be fired for his wife\u2019s offense. He wasn\u2019t. \n  \n Calamity struck again when Lincoln was assassinated while sitting beside his wife in Ford\u2019s Theatre on April 14, 1865, and she was unhinged anew. \n  \n Sotos wrote that although Mary Lincoln left few surviving medical records, he amassed a compendium of hundreds of letters and historical sources related to her health. \n  \n After the assassination, she moved to Chicago with her surviving sons, Robert and Tad, \u00adSotos wrote. But in 1871, Tad Lincoln died there at the age of 18, further afflicting his mother. \n  \n In the years after that, Mary suffered from auditory hallucinations, paranoia and delusions. \n  \n In 1875, Robert, worried about her well-being, sought a warrant for her arrest on the grounds of insanity. After a court hearing, she was ruled insane and committed to an asylum outside Chicago, where she was confined for three months. \n  \n After her release, she went to France for four years, then moved in with her sister in Springfield. She died there on July 16, 1882, at the age of 63. \n  \n Doctors in those times knew almost nothing about pernicious anemia, and until the early 20th century it was frequently fatal, according to Sotos. \n  \n Nowadays it can be spotted early through routine blood tests, he said. It is treated with B-12 pills or shots. \n  \n Mary Lincoln\u2019s misfortune \u201cwas living before treatment was available,\u201d Sotos wrote, \u201cand before physicians could make a diagnosis that would have prevented 150 years of misunderstanding about her.\u201d ||||| Mary Todd Lincoln had a lot of tragedy in her life. She lost two young children -- and, of course, was sitting next to President Lincoln when he was assassinated. \n  \n All of that contributed to years of depression, but now a medical expert believes there was a physical cause for her mental struggles. \n  \n History has not been kind to the wife of our 16th president. She was known to be a tempestuous, unpredictable force, and her son eventually had her committed. Sally Field's 2012 portrayal of Mary Todd showed a fierce and sharp-tongued first lady. \n  \n \"You think I'm ignorant of what you're up to because you haven't discussed this scheme with me as you ought to have done,\" she said in one scene. \"When have I ever been so easily bamboozled?\" \n  \n But Dr. John Sotos, a physician and medical historian, says the famously fiery first lady was not only misunderstood - but misdiagnosed. Sotos puts forth a new theory about Mary Todd Lincoln -- her erratic behavior was caused by a condition called pernicious anemia. \n  \n \"Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease that starts in the stomach and that impairs the body's ability to absorb food efficiently,\" Sotos said. \"And as a result, the person becomes B12 deficient eventually, and that causes lots of problems in every organ of the body.\" \n  \n It was a fatal illness until treatment was discovered decades after her death. The disease can lead to many of the symptoms exhibited by Mary Todd Lincoln: a sore mouth, pale skin, difficulty walking and psychiatric problems. It can also cause swelling. \n  \n \"The puffiness is not in a way that would occur with just an accumulation of fat,\" Sotos said. \n  \n Today, the disease can be picked up on a simple blood test and easily treated with B12 supplements. \n  \n \"She had a sick brain and was doing the best that she could in a very complicated, relentlessly demanding environment,\" Sotos said. \"And I think to have done as well as she did with the kind of handicaps that she had, I think that deserves admiration.\" ||||| Could pernicious anemia, a disease caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, have explained the many strange behaviors of Mary Todd Lincoln? \n  \n She was not exactly a model first lady. Historians have had a field day describing her violent temper, wild shopping sprees (she owned 300 pairs of kid gloves), depressed moods and all-consuming fears of burglars, storms and poverty. Late in life, at her son\u2019s urging, she was committed to a mental hospital for several months. \n  \n Plenty of theories, none proven, have been floated. She was bipolar. She had syphilis or that well known cause of feminine madness, menstrual trouble. She was spoiled and narcissistic. She never recovered from a road accident in which her head hit a rock. She lost her mind grieving the deaths of three of her four sons and her husband\u2019s assassination. \n  \n The latest addition to the list of possible diagnoses comes from Dr. John G. Sotos, a cardiologist, technology executive at Intel and one of the medical consultants who helped dream up the mystery diseases that afflicted patients on the television show \u201cHouse.\u201d ||||| Abstract \n  \n To date, no single diagnosis has unified the psychiatric illness and the numerous poorly defined physical complaints that Mary Lincoln (n\u00e9e Todd, 1818\u20131882) suffered in adulthood. Here, I show that her physical ailments spanned 30 years and included sore mouth, pallor, paresthesias, the Lhermitte symptom, fever, headaches, fatigue, resting tachycardia, edema, episodic weight loss, progressive weakness, ataxia, and visual impairment. Long thought hypochondriacal, these findings, plus their time course and her psychopathology (irritability, delusions, hallucinations, with preserved clarity), are all consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. Pernicious anemia most probably caused this deficiency: she lacked risk factors for other causes, and her consanguineous parents both derived from a region of Scotland having a high incidence of pernicious anemia. A diagnosis of chronic multisystem pernicious anemia would clarify the conduct of Mary Lincoln as First Lady and widow, and illuminate challenges faced by her husband, President Abraham Lincoln. Her case highlights many forgotten features of the natural history of untreated pernicious anemia and is unique in the medical literature in demonstrating such a course extending over a lifetime. |||||", "output": "She's been described as perhaps the most troubled first lady to set foot in the White House, with fearsome moods, depression, and paranoia. Now a doctor says he may have uncovered the secret to Mary Todd Lincoln's behavior: a vitamin deficiency. Interestingly, this latest theory in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine comes from cardiologist John G. Sotos, who helped come up with all those strange diseases decoded on the TV show House, per the New York Times. In what might as well be a plot from the show, Sotos was researching Abraham Lincoln\u2014whom he suspects had a genetic syndrome that led to cancer\u2014when he found an 1852 letter describing Mrs. Lincoln's sore mouth and set out to discover what ailed her. His theory? She suffered from pernicious anemia, an autoimmune disease \"that impairs the body's ability to absorb food efficiently,\" says Sotos, per CBS News. Sufferers become B12-deficient, and a lack of B12 can cause a wide range of health problems\u2014including a sore tongue. It can wreak havoc on the entire body over time, reports the Washington Post. \"You get a long list of symptoms,\" from headaches to irritability and hallucinations, Sotos says. \"Mary had just about all of them.\" The first lady\u2014who spent months in a mental hospital in later life\u2014also had \"a wide face, wide jaw, and widely separated blue eyes,\" as do many with pernicious anemia, he writes. What's more, her ancestors came from an area of Scotland where the disease was once prevalent. One doctor calls Sotos' study \"ingenious,\" though there's no proof he's correct. But Sotos simply hopes historians cut Mrs. Lincoln some slack. \"To have done as well as she did with the kind of handicaps that she had, I think that deserves admiration.\" (Someone stole Abraham Lincoln's hand.)", "category": "Summarization 417.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\".

The massive street demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Beijing's authority in Hong Kong since China took control of the former British colony in 1997. \n  \n Leung made the comments at a news conference just minutes before a deadline that had been set by the protesters for him to step down. \n  \n Standing beside him, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam said she would seek to arrange talks with student leaders of the protest as soon as possible. \n  \n \"I hope both sides will be satisfied,\" she said. \"Students had wanted a public meeting but I hope that we can have some flexibility to discuss details.\" \n  \n Before Leung's announcement, the heads of two major universities whose students have joined others in launching the protests appeared before a jittery crowd massed in front of the entrance to the leader's office and appealed for calm. \n  \n During the day, the protesters prepared face masks and goggles while police brought in supplies of tear gas and other riot gear as tensions grew in an increasingly tense standoff outside the imposing government compound near the waterfront. \n  \n Police warned of serious consequences if the protesters tried to surround or occupy government buildings. The protesters threatened to do so if Leung didn't resign by the end of Thursday. \n  \n In his news conference, held just before midnight, Leung said the authorities would continue to tolerate the protests as long as participants did not charge police lines. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Associated Press writers Elaine Kurtenbach, Kelvin Chan and Louise Watt in Hong Kong, and Didi Tang and news assistant Henry Hou in Beijing contributed to this report. ||||| Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying's daughter posted a photograph on Facebook at 3am yesterday that appeared to show her lying in a bathtub with a slashed wrist and the water tinged with red. Next to it she had written: \"Will I bleed to death?\" \n  \n The 22-year-old, who is based in Britain, posted a second picture an hour later - about 11am Hong Kong time - showing a hand covered in what appeared to be blood and wrote: \"I love blood.\" \n  \n Leung Chai-yan's messages, which were open to the public, came as her father was on board a plane headed to Britain so he could join her at the graduation ceremony of her younger sister, Leung Chung-yan, who has just finished her economics degree at Cambridge University. \n  \n The Chief Executive's Office would not comment on the incident, but website Bastille Post later uploaded a picture showing the chief executive and Chai-yan smiling in the London sunshine as they sat on a park bench. Chai-yan is seen cuddling a bulldog perched like a child on her lap. Her wrists cannot be seen. \n  \n Another picture on the Speak Out Hong Kong website, often regarded as a mouthpiece for the chief executive, shows Leung, his wife, Regina Leung Tong Ching-yee, and Chai-yan in Hyde Park. The caption reads: \"They had big smiles on their face and the atmosphere was harmonious. Obviously, they weren't affected by various unfavourable rumours on the internet.\" \n  \n Government sources said Leung had responded calmly when he heard of his daughter's posts after landing in Britain. \n  \n \"He said only that he would follow up [on the issue],\" said one of the sources. \"Leung seldom talks about his daughters and son [Leung Chuen-yan] as it is personal.\" \n  \n The posts were deleted within a few hours of their appearance. By then, comments had been posted under the picture encouraging Chai-yan to \"stay strong\". But hostile comments accused her of seeking attention and said the cuts were \"not deep enough\". \n  \n It was not Chai-yan's first time to cause a stir on her Facebook page. In March, Chai-yan - who is believed to be studying at the London School of Economics - received thousands of abusive comments after stating that the stabbing of former Ming Pao editor Kevin Lau Chun-to was not an attack on freedom of the press. \n  \n \"Why does the attack have anything to do with press freedom?! Come on people,\" she wrote. Despite the backlash, she continues to eschew tight privacy settings available on Facebook. \n  \n Labour Party lawmaker Dr Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, who is a lecturer in social sciences at Polytechnic University, said Chai-yan's posts appeared to be a cry for help. \"It suggests that a crisis is emerging,\" he added. \n  \n When asked whether any self-harm could be a reaction to the constant criticism directed at her father, Cheung said such cases were more likely to be related to personal affairs or depression. \n  \n * Feeling like you need somebody to talk to?

She also posed for some modelling pictures. \n  \n Platonic friendship \n  \n At the age of 17 she became pregnant. Attempts at a self-induced abortion failed but the child, a boy, died days after the birth. \n  \n \"I was just 17, I did not have many illusions left, and the ones that did remain were soon to vanish.\" \n  \n Keeler found a job in Murray's, a Soho nightclub, where she served drinks and posed semi-naked on the stage. She also befriended another model, Mandy Rice-Davies. \n  \n \"When we weren't on stage, we were allowed to sit out with the audience for a hostess fee of \u00a35,\" she later wrote. \n  \n By her own account she, like a number of the girls, had sexual relationships with the club's clients, although it was officially forbidden by the management. \n  \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Her relationship with Stephen Ward was platonic \n  \n It was at Murray's that she met Stephen Ward, an osteopath who had a client list that included a number of rich and important people, including the former Conservative MP Viscount Astor. \n  \n Keeler moved into Ward's flat although the couple maintained a platonic friendship. \n  \n Ward took Keeler to parties where he introduced her to many of his friends including Peter Rachman, the notorious slum landlord, with whom she had a relationship. \n  \n Ward and Keeler were also frequent attendees at weekend parties at the Astors' Cliveden estate in Buckinghamshire. \n  \n Dismissed \n  \n At one of these events, on 8 July 1961, Keeler, splashing in the swimming pool, caught the attention of John Profumo, then Secretary of State for War. \n  \n Profumo, who was married to the actress Valerie Hobson, was seen as one of the government's rising stars. He kept in touch with Keeler and the pair had a brief affair. \n  \n Also at the party was Eugene Ivanov, assistant naval attach\u00e9 at the Soviet Embassy, who was friendly with Ward. \n  \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption John Profumo, here with his wife Valerie Hobson, was seen as a rising political star \n  \n Keeler later claimed she had been sleeping with Ivanov at the same time as she was having an affair with Profumo, but many commentators have since dismissed her account. \n  \n She had also been having relationships with two other men, Lucky Gordon and Johnny Edgecombe. \n  \n Gordon and Edgecombe quarrelled bitterly over Keeler, resulting in Edgecombe firing shots at a flat where Keeler was hiding. \n  \n The subsequent police investigation led the press to take an interest, and reporters soon learned of Keeler's relationship with Profumo. \n  \n 'No impropriety' \n  \n Suspicions that Keeler had obtained secrets from Profumo and passed them to Ivanov, led Labour to decide the whole matter was a security issue. \n  \n With the press unwilling to risk a libel suit by publishing the story, Labour MP George Wigg used parliamentary privilege to accuse Profumo of having an affair with Keeler. \n  \n Profumo was forced to come to the House where he denied having sexual relations with Keeler. \n  \n Image copyright PA Image caption Stephen Ward was not destined to hear the verdict at his trial \n  \n \"Miss Keeler and I were on friendly terms,\" he told fellow MPs. \"There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler.\" \n  \n Meanwhile, Keeler had testified at the trial of Lucky Gordon, who she claimed had assaulted her. He was jailed for three years. \n  \n On 5 June, Profumo resigned as Secretary of State for War, having admitted that he had lied to the House of Commons about his relationship with Keeler. \n  \n Perjury \n  \n Stephen Ward was arrested and accused of living on Keeler's immoral earnings. His trial began at the Old Bailey in July 1963. \n  \n Image copyright PA Image caption Mandy Rice-Davies (l) was, with Keeler, a key witness in Ward's trial \n  \n In what the writer Ludovic Kennedy described as a blatant miscarriage of justice, Ward was convicted following a devastating summing up by the trial judge. \n  \n But, by the time the jury announced its verdict, Ward was in a coma, having taken an overdose of sleeping pills. He died in hospital three days later. \n  \n In December 1963 Lucky Gordon's sentence was overturned by the Court of Appeal, and Keeler was accused of lying at his trial. \n  \n She pleaded guilty to charges of perjury, and was sentenced to nine months in prison. \n  \n Scandal \n  \n Labour won the 1964 General Election, having used the Profumo affair to accuse the Conservatives of being unfit to govern. \n  \n On her release from prison, Christine Keeler largely disappeared from the public eye. \n  \n There were two marriages which did not last, but did produce two children. \n  \n Image copyright PA Image caption She had little time for a fusty establishment \n  \n Much of the money she had been paid by newspapers had disappeared by the 1970s. \n  \n She published five books about her life, one of which, entitled Scandal, was the basis for the 1989 film of the same name, which starred Joanne Whalley as Keeler. \n  \n As a young woman, Christine Keeler was desperate to get away from an unhappy home and make something of herself. She had little time for the fusty morals of a traditional establishment class. \n  \n Unfortunately for her, that class was desperate to maintain its influence in a country about to experience the dawn of the huge social changes of the 1960s. \n  \n That establishment was aided and abetted by a tabloid press, desperate to expose scandal, even where it didn't exist, just to maintain circulation. \n  \n \"They wanted to hear about the sex of course,\" she once said bitterly. \"But not the rest. No one wanted to hear the rest.\" ||||| Christine Keeler, a London showgirl whose simultaneous relationships with British war secretary John Profumo and a Soviet military attache produced the country's most notorious political scandal of the 1960s, died Dec. 4 at a hospital in Farnborough, England. She was 75. \n  \n Her son Seymour Platt announced the death on his Facebook page, noting that the cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \n  \n The Profumo Affair, as it became known, has echoed through the years as one of the era's most lurid tabloid scandals, with hints of espionage, Cold War politics, class prejudice and sexual hypocrisy. \n  \n The case has stayed in the popular imagination in the form of theatrical plays, including a musical by Andrew Lloyd-Webber, a feature film and dozens of books \u2014 three of which were written by Ms. Keeler. \n  \n The Profumo Affair made the strikingly beautiful young woman from the British provinces a London celebrity and a perennial staple of headlines and gossip. A nude photograph of Ms. Keeler straddling a chair in 1963 became one of the decade's most famous images. \n  \n She was often described as the call girl \u2014 a term she adamantly rejected \u2014 who brought down Britain's ruling Conservative government. Profumo, a rising political star who held the cabinet post of secretary of state for war, saw his career go down in flames. \n  \n  \n  \n Christine Keeler in 1963. (Stf/AP) \n  \n He and Ms. Keeler met in 1961, when she was taking a dip in a swimming pool at the estate of a British lord. He was 46, married and wearing a dinner jacket; she was 19, free-spirited and wearing a smile. \n  \n They began an affair that lasted several months. At the same time, Ms. Keeler was seeing other men, including Yevgeny Ivanov, widely believed to be a Soviet spy. \n  \n Profumo, who was married to film actress Valerie Hobson, tried to conceal his affair with Ms. Keeler. But in 1962, another of her jealous lovers, Johnny Edgecombe, opened fire on the front door of the house where Ms. Keeler was living. \n  \n When she failed to appear as a witness at Edgecombe's trial, people began to wonder why. The full extent of the scandal came to light in 1963. \n  \n After the press learned that Ms. Keeler was keeping company with a Soviet spy, there was concern that she had been wheedling state secrets from Profumo during pillow talk. She said she had to devise clever ploys to keep her romantic (and geopolitical) rivals from bumping into each other. \n  \n 1 of 66 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2017 View Photos Remembering those who died in 2017.

She was a party girl. A gorgeous-looking woman who liked men, liked sex and liked to be the center of attention.\" \n  \n Ms. Keeler and a friend, Mandy Rice-Davies, who died in 2014, acquired a cheeky kind of notoriety, known for their looks and their airy dismissal of stuffy social standards. \n  \n When Lord Astor, the nobleman in whose swimming pool Ms. Keeler had been cavorting, denied that he was involved with the teenage Rice-Davies, she quipped in court, \"Well, he would, wouldn't he?\" \n  \n Wherever she turned, Ms. Keeler found herself caught up in legal trouble. She was convicted of perjury in the assault trial of another of her onetime lovers, a man named Lucky Gordon. \n  \n She found her connection to high society through a well-connected osteopath named Stephen Ward. In 1963, Ward went on trial for living off the \"immoral earnings\" of Ms. Keeler and Rice-Davies \u2014 a charge denied by all three. \n  \n \"This is a political revenge trial \u2014 someone had to be sacrificed, and that was me,\" Ward said at the time. Near the end of the trial, he took an overdose of sleeping pills. He was found guilty, then died days later without regaining consciousness. \n  \n The story of Profumo, Ward and Ms. Keeler was portrayed in director Michael Caton-Jones's 1989 film \"Scandal,\" in which Ms. Keeler was played by Joanne Whalley. \n  \n \"You talk to Christine, and it all happened the day before yesterday,\" the film's screenwriter, Michael Thomas, told the New York Times. \"She says Ward's the only man she ever loved, and you believe her. It's a love story between two people who were the weapons of each other's destruction.\" \n  \n Christine Margaret Keeler was born Feb. 22, 1942, in Uxbridge, England. Her father left the family when she was young, and she grew up with her mother and stepfather in an abandoned railroad car in rural Berkshire, England. \n  \n She lived in such fear of her stepfather, she said, that she kept a knife under her pillow. She left home for London when she was 15. \n  \n Over the years, she said she had liaisons with the Beatles' Ringo Starr and actors Warren Beatty, Peter Lawford and George Peppard. Ms. Keeler co-wrote three autobiographical books and had two brief marriages, to James Levermore and Anthony Platt. \n  \n Survivors include a son from each marriage and a granddaughter. \n  \n Profumo, once considered a potential candidate for British prime minister, reconciled with his wife and quietly worked on behalf of the poor and downtrodden. He died in 2006. \n  \n In her later years, Ms. Keeler lived in poverty. She adopted the name of C.M. Sloane as she struggled to find work in advertising, in a school cafeteria and as a receptionist. \n  \n \"I mean, it's been a misery for me, living with Christine Keeler,\" she told Britain's Observer newspaper in 2001. \"Even a criminal has the right to a new life, but they made sure I did not have that. They just didn't stop calling me a prostitute for ever and ever and ever and ever. How can anyone live with that?

Yevgeny Ivanov The Soviet naval attach\u00e9 had an affair with Keeler at the same time as Profumo. The romantic triangle led to Profumo, then secretary of state for war, resigning. John Profumo The affair nearly destroyed Harold Macmillan\u2019s government. Profumo spent the rest of his life volunteering at Toynbee Hall, a charity in east London. He died in 2006, aged 91. \n  \n Written by Holly Watt Photograph: PA \n  \n She had been ill for several months, and suffered from the lung disease COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). \n  \n  \n  \n A major BBC series revisiting the scandal is due to start filming next year. \n  \n  \n  \n Keeler, who had been living under the name of Sloane for many years, was briefly married twice, both marriages ending in divorce. She had two sons \u2013 James from her first marriage, and Seymour from her second \u2013 and a granddaughter. \n  \n  \n  \n Platt, who lives in Ireland, said he, his wife and their daughter had last seen his mother a week ago. \u201cThere was a lot of good around Chris\u2019s rather tragic life, because there was a family around her that loved her,\u201d he said. \n  \n \u201cI think what happened to her back in the day was quite damaging.\u201d \n  \n Born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, and raised by her mother and stepfather, Keeler was working as a cabaret dancer in Soho in London when she met Stephen Ward, an osteopath, artist and \u201cman about town\u201d. \n  \n Christine Keeler obituary Read more \n  \n He introduced her to a party scene attended by aristocrats and VIPs, and through him, in 1961, she met both Profumo, then 46 and secretary of state for war, and the Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov, having affairs with both men. \n  \n When the relationships came to light in 1963, amid fears of a cold war security leak, the scandal rocked the Harold Macmillan government. \n  \n Profumo told the House of Commons there was no \u201cimpropriety\u201d in their relationship after being asked about it by opposition MPs who voiced concerns about national security implications. \n  \n  \n  \n Eventually, after more newspaper stories emerged, he admitted lying to the house, and resigned from the cabinet and the Commons. \n  \n  \n  \n His fall from grace was deemed a contributory factor in the fall of the Macmillan government, with Labour winning under Harold Wilson in 1964. \n  \n Keeler met Mandy Rice-Davies when they worked as dancers in Soho and both women were involved with Ward\u2019s social set. Ward would later be convicted of living off immoral earnings, with Keeler and Rice-Davies as the main witnesses, but he took a fatal overdose before the jury returned their guilty verdict in August 1963. \n  \n At the height of the Profumo affair, Keeler gave newspaper interviews and also posed for the now famous photograph of her sitting naked on a chair. \n  \n Lewis Morley took the photo at the request of Peter Cook as publicity for a film.

She had been living under the last name Sloane in an attempt to put more distance between herself and the Profumo affair that she was so infamously and indelibly attached to. In 1961 Keeler, then a young cabaret dancer working in London, met Tory cabinet minister and rising political star John Profumo\u2014as well as Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov. She began affairs with both men, and when the triangle came to light in 1963, it gripped Britain, played upon Cold War fears, and triggered events that led to the undoing of the Harold Macmillan government. The BBC reports Keeler caught Profumo's eye while \"splashing\" in a swimming pool at a party in Buckinghamshire; she was 19, reports the Washington Post, and he was 46 and married. Their brief affair surfaced in a convoluted way: Two other men fought over Keeler, and one of them fired shots into a home where she was hiding. Police investigated, and Keeler's connection to Profumo ultimately became publicized. The Ivanov angle led to fears of a security issue; when Profumo was questioned by Parliament, he characterized his relationship with Keeler as platonic. Profumo ended up resigning after admitting he lied.

President Barack Obama has called for banning gun sales to those on the federal \"no-fly\" list, but a similar measure failed to clear Congress last week. \n  \n \"If Congress will not act, we in the states will,\" Malloy told reporters gathered outside his office. \"The [National Rifle Association] and their supporters have stood in the way time and time again as we have fought for sensible gun violence prevention ... these are measures that will save lives.\" \n  \n Malloy cited FBI statistics that found people on government watch lists tried to buy guns 2,233 times between 2004 and 2014; they succeeded in more than 90 percent of cases. \n  \n Connecticut, which passed some of the nation's strictest gun control laws after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shootings, would become the first state to bar those on watch lists from buying guns. \n  \n \"Like all Americans, I've been horrified by the recent terrorist attacks in California and Paris,\" the Democratic governor said. \"This should be a wake-up call for all of us. This is a moment to seize here in America, and today I'm here to say in Connecticut, we are seizing this moment.\" \n  \n The state's all-Democratic congressional delegation applauded Malloy's move. \"His action underscores that Congress has failed to act \u2014 completely abdicating responsibility as a public health crisis sweeps the nation, killing 30,000 Americans each year,\" Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy said in a joint statement. \"If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.\" \n  \n Malloy trumpeted his plan as \"basic common sense,\" but critics denounced it as a political stunt that does nothing to enhance public safety while encroaching on the constitutional rights of people who have not been convicted of any crime. \n  \n \"The governor knows full well that law-abiding Americans who pose no threat to national security are mistakenly on the terror watch list,\" said Jennifer Baker, the NRA's director of public affairs. \"The NRA's only objective is to ensure that law-abiding American citizens who were mistakenly put on the list are afforded their constitutional right to due process. Due process is a pillar of the American justice system and cannot be discarded for a talking point that makes people feel safer.\" \n  \n The no-fly list is one of several government databases of people suspected of terrorist connections. The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list, arguing in federal court that standards for inclusion in the database are vague, shrouded in secrecy and prone to error. \n  \n \"The ACLU of Connecticut has severe reservations about the reliability and constitutionality of government watch lists like the no-fly list,\" said Stephen Glassman, the group's executive director. \"While we acknowledge that the governor's intentions are admirable, the government's watch list system is notorious for including innocent people, and the ACLU was in court this week fighting to fix the inadequate process for people wrongly blacklisted on the no-fly list to clear their names.'' \n  \n Scott Wilson, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, which opposes stronger gun control, was more blunt. \n  \n \"Gov. Malloy is planning to take what is in our view unconstitutional executive action that would prohibit firearms purchases and seize firearms of individuals who have not been indicted or convicted for any crime,\" Wilson said. \"While we are all concerned about terrorism, this approach is very un-American and shameful.\" \n  \n Malloy's executive order raises a host of legal questions, said Len Fasano, the Republican leader in the Connecticut Senate. \"The top priority is to protect against terrorism, but efforts to protect the country from violence need to be balanced with individual civil liberties,\" Fasano said. \n  \n Malloy said he is confident safeguards can be put in place to protect those who are erroneously placed on the watch lists. \n  \n \"Certainly if you have the wrong person or the person simply has the same name [as someone on the list] that's something that could be resolved, I think, relatively quickly and administratively,\" said Malloy, who was joined at the press conference by Dora Schriro, commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection. \"If there's a broader question about why they're on the list, clearly we'll have to cover that.\" \n  \n A \"rigorous appeals process\" will also help protect the rights of individuals who find themselves on the list in error, he added, without providing details of how that appeals process would work. \n  \n There are other practical considerations as well: It is unclear how the state would obtain access to the databases and when the policy would take effect. Malloy said he has a commitment from the Obama administration to support his plan and work through legal channels to bring it to fruition. \n  \n \"The issue is not fully resolved but let me assure that people are supportive of this concept,\" he said. \n  \n Malloy's high-profile announcement generated national headlines and a strong reaction on social media. As the newly elected chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, he has positioned himself as a pugnacious defender of liberal causes. In recent weeks, he made a point of personally welcoming refugees from Syria to Connecticut after some Republican governors declared their states would not host the new arrivals. ||||| The National Rifle Association \u201cdoes not want terrorists or dangerous people to have access to weapons,\u201d said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the organization\u2019s lobbying arm. \u201cBut this is a constitutional issue,\u201d she said, adding that mere suspicion should not be enough to take away the right to own a gun. \n  \n While federal gun control legislation has gone nowhere in recent years, certain states have had more success. Connecticut has passed some of the strictest gun laws in the country, including measures enacted after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, when a gunman killed 20 schoolchildren and six staff members before killing himself. \n  \n Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said it was unclear what the practical implications of Connecticut\u2019s proposed ban would be in stopping someone who is determined to carry out an act of terrorism. That person could simply travel to another state. \n  \n \u201cSeems to me that the greatest importance of this is to get the ball rolling so more people follow, and ideally the federal government,\u201d Mr. Webster said. \u201cI suspect more states will do this.\u201d \n  \n Devon Puglia, a spokesman for Mr. Malloy, said the governor\u2019s office was \u201cworking with the federal government\u201d to gain access to the watch lists and determine which would be most appropriate to use. The governor, he said, would sign the order as soon as he received approval to use the watch lists for that purpose. \n  \n The federal government\u2019s terrorism watch list is a database maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center, an arm of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It fuses information gathered from many sources \u2014 including law enforcement, military and intelligence agencies, as well as foreign governments \u2014 and is used for various purposes, including keeping certain people off planes or blocking certain noncitizens from entering the country. The no-fly list is a subset of the watch list. \n  \n The debate has become fodder for presidential candidates, with most Republicans attacking the idea of denying gun sales to people on the no-fly list. |||||", "output": "The governor of Connecticut announced Thursday he would sign an executive order to keep anyone on federal watch lists from legally purchasing guns, the Hartford Courant reports. \"If you can't fly without clearing government watch lists, you shouldn't be able to buy a gun,\" Reuters quotes Dannel Malloy. The executive order would apply to people on the federal no-fly list as well as a list of people with suspected terrorist connections, the Courant reports. Malloy says he thinks allowing people on those lists to purchase weapons is more dangerous than letting Syrian refugees into the country. In addition, the order would revoke current gun permits from anyone found to be on the lists, according to Reuters. Malloy cited FBI statistics that showed people on watch lists tried to buy guns and explosives more than 2,200 times between 2004 and 2014 and succeeded more than 90% of the time, the New York Times reports. He calls the order \"simple common sense,\" according to the Courant. The move is creating strange bedfellows, as it's opposed by both the NRA and ACLU. Earlier this month, Democrats failed to pass a similar bill\u2014modeled on an old George W. Bush proposal\u2014at the national level. \"If Congress will not act, we in the states will,'' Malloy says. The Times reports it's unclear how Connecticut would get access to the watch lists.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn Indictment No. 2526/2011 Dear Mssrs. (William) Taylor and (Benjamin) Brafman: \n  \n In connection with the above-captioned case, the People disclose the following information to the defense pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law 240.20 as well as Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its doctrinal progeny. \n  \n In an application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal dated December 30, 2004, the complainant provided the United States Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service with factual information about herself, her background and her experiences in her home country of Guinea. This information was in the form of a written statement attached to her application, and was submitted as a basis for her request for asylum. In her application, she certified under penalty of perjury that her written statement was true. \n  \n In substance, the complainant's statement claimed that she and her husband had been persecuted and harassed by the dictatorial regime that was then in power in Guinea. Among other things, the complainant stated that the home she shared with her husband was destroyed by police and soldiers acting on behalf of the regime, and she and her husband were beaten by them. When her husband attempted to return to what was left of their home the next day, she stated that he was again beaten, arrested and imprisoned by police and soldiers. She stated that she also was beaten when she attempted to come to her husband's aid. In her statement, she attributed the beatings to the couple's opposition to the regime. She stated that during her husband's incarceration, he was tortured, deprived of medical treatment, and eventually died as a result of his maltreatment. Following his death, according to her, she began to denounce the regime and finally fled the country in fear of her life, entering the United States in January 2004 to seek refuge (she has told prosecutors that she used a fraudulent visa). She repeated these facts orally during the course of her asylum application process. \n  \n In interviews in connection with the investigation of this case, the complainant admitted that the above factual information, which she provided in connection with her asylum application, was false. She stated that she fabricated the statement with the assistance of a male who provided her with a cassette recording of the facts contained in the statement that she eventually submitted. She memorized these facts by listening to the recording repeatedly. In several interviews with prosecutors, she reiterated these falsehoods when questioned about her history and background, and stated that she did so in order to remain consistent with the statement that she had submitted as part of her application. \n  \n Additionally, in two separate interviews with assistant district attorneys assigned to the case, the complainant stated that she had been the victim of a gang rape in the past in her native country and provided details of the attack. During both of these interviews, the victim cried and appeared to be markedly distraught when recounting the incident. In subsequent interviews, she admitted that the gang rape had never occurred. Instead, she stated that she had lied about its occurrence and fabricated the details, and that this false incident was part of the narrative that she had been directed to memorize as part of her asylum application process. Presently, the complainant states that she would testify that she was raped in the past in her native country but in an incident different than the one that she described during initial interviews. \n  \n In the weeks following the incident charged in the indictment, the complainant told detectives and assistant district attorneys on numerous occasions that, after being sexually assaulted by the defendant on May 14, 2011 in Suite 2806, she fled to an area of the main hallway of the hotel's 28th floor and waited there until she observed the defendant leave Suite 2806 and the 28th floor by entering an elevator. It was after this observation that she reported the incident to her supervisor, who arrived on the 28th floor a short time later. In the interim between the incident and her supervisor's arrival, she claimed to have remained in the same area of the main hallway on the 28th floor to which she had initially fled. The complainant testified to this version of events when questioned in the Grand Jury about her actions following the incident in Suite 2806, she proceeded to clean a nearby room and then returned to Suite 2806 and began to clean that suite before she reported the incident to her supervisor. \n  \n Additionally, the complainant has stated that for the past two tax years, she declared a friend's child in addition to her own as a dependent on her tax returns for the purpose of increasing her tax refund beyond that to which she was entitled. She also admitted to misrepresenting her income in order to maintain her present housing. \n  \n Finally, during the course of this investigation, the complainant was untruthful with assistant district attorneys about a variety of additional topics concerning her history, background, present circumstances and personal relationships. \n  \n Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions.

She can leap from an overpass onto a truck, dress her own bullet wounds, and yank a guy off a motorcycle as he rides by on the highway. She can even chase an elevator that's going down by jumping from side to side along the shaft like a human fly. The woman is amazing. \n  \n Now some might say that Jolie can't do these things, that what we're really talking about here is Evelyn Salt, the heroine of the new action thriller, and that Jolie is just an actress. But this is a prosaic distinction hardly worth making. \"Salt\" is a dream tailored to the public idea of Jolie as the woman who can do anything. She can do anything onscreen, just as in real life she can stand next to one of the most desired men in the world and have it look like, \"Oh, yeah. Him.\" \n  \n Jolie's superwoman tendencies have resulted mainly in cartoonish, abrasive movies (\"Wanted,\" \"Tomb Raider\") worthy of neither her talent nor the intelligence of an audience older than 12. But when exploited properly - as \"Salt\" does, keeping her human and vulnerable, so that the character's amazing ability and ingenuity continue to surprise - this thing that Jolie does is, well, very cool. Making us believe in the woman who can do anything, and I mean anything, is Jolie's distinct contribution to today's cinema. \n  \n This time she really doesn't want to kill anybody. Salt is a CIA agent in search of a desk job, and on the day all hell breaks loose, she's just looking forward to a quiet anniversary dinner at home with her kindly, nerdy husband (August Diehl). Then in walks an old Soviet agent, wanting to defect, with a wild story to tell: Apparently, there are Russian nationals embedded within our intelligence agencies, and at a signal, they will commence their doomsday plan. And one of those agents, he says, is Salt. \n  \n From there, hold on to your hat. She goes on the run, with the CIA, FBI and the Secret Service after her, and those Russians might want a piece of her, too. Sometimes they're chasing her, and sometimes she's chasing them, but throughout the movie is careful to slow down long enough for viewers to catch their breath and find their place within the story. Director Phillip Noyce strikes a modern mood and makes use of modern technologies, but he's forgotten nothing of what he knew about storytelling in the 1990s, when he made \"Patriot Games\" and \"Clear and Present Danger.\" \n  \n In its small details, \"Salt\" can seem ridiculous at times. At one point, she seems to be steering a car by using a Taser on the driver's leg; each spasm makes the car accelerate. The president is presented as a moron, which is a bit behind the curve, and his name - President Lewis - sounds as though it were pulled from a phone book. But it's no match for Vice President Maxwell Oates, a name that sounds funny the first time you hear it and is repeated over and over. \n  \n The main thing is that \"Salt\" holds together. Its narrative strategy is to leave audiences in the dark for much of the action, but each tidbit we're given fits into the broader picture. The action scenes are imaginative and elaborate without seeming fake. Nothing is belabored, and the stakes never stop escalating. \n  \n Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber offer vivid support as two distinctly different government types (the unimaginative suit and the independent thinker), and the movie never forgets the human element. Salt always has a strong emotional reason for what she does. \n  \n For Jolie, it's the best of both worlds. For once, she gets to be a woman and a superwoman in the same movie. \n  \n -- Advisory: This movie contains lots of violence. \n  \n This article appeared on page E - 1 of the San Francisco Chronicle ||||| Salt \n  \n July 21, 2010 \n  \n \"Salt\" is a damn fine thriller. It does all the things I can't stand in bad movies, and does them in a good one. It's like a rebuke to all the lousy action movie directors who've been banging pots and pans together in our skulls. It winds your clock tight and the alarm doesn't go off for 100 minutes. \n  \n It's gloriously absurd. This movie has holes in it big enough to drive the whole movie through. The laws of physics seem to be suspended here the same way as in a Road Runner cartoon. Angelina Jolie runs full speed out into thin air and doesn't look down until she's in the helicopter at the end. \n  \n  \n  \n Jolie is one fine-looking woman. You don't need me to tell you that. It's why she gets the big bucks. The movies have celebrated her eyes, lips, profile, biceps, boobs, waist, butt, thighs. \u201cSalt\" pays tribute to her ankles. Anyone who can jump from the heights she does here, in the way she does it, may die from a lot of causes, but a sprained ankle won't be one of them. \n  \n  \n  \n You know parkour? Wikipedia defines it as \u201cthe physical discipline of training to overcome any obstacle within one's path by adapting one's movements to the environment.\" Jolie's character, Evelyn Salt, makes it look as though \"Run Lola Run\" was about walking. There's a scene when she descends eight stories in an elevator shaft by simply jumping across it to one wall support lower than the last. Each time she lands she says \u201coof,\" but that's about it. \n  \n  \n  \n You're not going to hear much about the plot here. Nothing I could tell you would be necessary for you to know, and everything could be fatal to your enjoyment. Let's just make it simple: She plays a woman determined to singlehandedly save the world from nuclear annihilation. Oh, it's not that the plot holds water or makes any sense, but it's a pleasure to be surprised here and there along the way, and it's not like the movie lingers over each twist and turn as if it's just pulled an elephant out of a hat. \n  \n  \n  \n No, each revelation is the occasion for another chase scene. Evelyn Salt escapes from, or breaks into, one inescapable and/or impenetrable stronghold after another. And she does it all by herself, and with her bare hands, plus a few guns, grenades and a home-made rocket launcher. You know how it's been said of Ginger Rogers that \u201cshe did everything Astaire did, except backwards and in high heels\"? Evelyn does everything James Bond did, except backwards and barefoot in the snow. \n  \n  \n  \n At one point in the movie, Evelyn is chained to a concrete floor in a North Korean dungeon while a rubber hose is charmingly stuck into her mouth and gasoline is poured in. That's at the beginning of the film. I'm not going to tell you what she survives later. She plays a spy for the CIA \u2014 but now I'm giving away too many details. Important supporting roles are played by Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor. \n  \n  \n  \n The movie has been directed by Phillip Noyce, an Australian whose work ranges from Tom Clancy thrillers to the great and angry drama \"Rabbit-Proof Fence.\" Here he performs as a master craftsman, aided by the cinematography of Robert Elswit and the editing of Stuart Baird and John Gilroy. The movie has a great many chase scenes, and faithful readers will know that these, in general, have lost their novelty for me. But a good chase scene is a good chase scene. It demands some sense of spatial coherence, no matter how impossible; some continuity of movement, no matter how devised by stuntwork and effects, and genuine interest for the audience. \n  \n  \n  \n It's in that area that Angelina Jolie really delivers. She brings the conviction to her role that such a movie requires. She throws herself into it with animal energy. Somehow, improbably, she doesn't come off as a superhero (although her immunity suggests one), but as a brave and determined fighter. How does she look? She looks beautiful by default, and there's a scene in an office where she looks back over her shoulder to talk with Schreiber and you think, oh, my. But neither Jolie nor Noyce overplays her beauty, and she gets gritty and bloody and desperate, and we get involved. \n  \n  \n  \n Although \u201cSalt\" finds an ingenious way to overcome history and resurrect the Russians as movie villains, neither that nor any other elements of the plot demand analysis. It's all a hook to hang a thriller on. It's exhilarating to see a genre picture done really well. ||||| Salt is a Hollywood stuntman (and stunt woman) stimulus package, an espionage thriller filled with epic brawls, shootouts and a chase across the roofs of assorted semi trucks and tankers along the highway interchanges of Greater Washington, D.C.What, you think that stick figure Angelina Jolie is the one doing all that derring do? Remember your physics, kids! Girlfriend's got no throw weight.The film, originally built as a Tom Cruise vehicle, is about a spy outed as a sleeper, a deep-planted mole within the CIA . She's on the run because she may have been falsely accused. We see in the opening scenes how she survived North Korean torture thanks to the love of her devoted spider-expert husband. She's fleeing her CIA colleagues ( Liev Schreiber and Chewitel Ejiofor) because of her ongoing mental issues over being held captive, because she's actually a Russian spy completing her mission, or for fear of what one side or the other will do to her husband.She has her defender (Schreiber) -- \"Mayebe Salt is just who she says she is.\"And her accuser (Ejiofor) -- \"'Maybe' is your department.\"But as good an actress as the Oscar -winning Jolie is, as much experience as she has in action roles playing women \"with particular skills,\" I never really bought her in the part. She seems too frail to do most of the things director Phillip Noyce has her doing.It's a talky film, dropping into long blurts of exposition that stop it in its tracks. And for all its breathless chases, Salt has little urgency--the drive that would make her character risk her neck and stack up a staggering body count in pursuit of whatever her agenda is. Watching her fellow agents stare helplessly at video monitors as she makes her first get away is laughable. They've just let her accuser escape. Uh, turn off Facebook and RUN AFTER HER, fellas! And bring your guns!A brief if not entirely brisk film, the tale is interrupted by flashbacks that give us Evelyn Salt's back-story, snippets of her earlier experience that explain who she is today. Only they don't come anywhere near explaining all that. And the lack of urgency means it's a movie allows us to ponder where it's going and get there LONG before the drawn-out finale, with the many \"Oh COME on\" moments leading up to it. Inglourious Basterds ) is miscast as the husband, a fellow not given enough scenes with any emotional depth to them, scenes that would give us the idea that love might be driving Evelyn's actions.Noyce, well over a decade removed from his Patriot Games action heyday, does well enough by the more preposterous stuff in the Kurt Wimmer (Law Abiding Citizen) logic-out-the-door script. Salt's many escapes have enough novelty that were this set in the unreality of Wanted , it wouldn't matter that we don't see her face doing any jumps, motorcycle tricks or the like.But all those criticisms aside, it's still a short-enough time-killer of a thriller -- not the worst of the summer, but a long way from the current state of the art. And not to pour you-know-what on the wound, but Jolie's days as an action heroine may be behind her. She's still got the cruel lips. But at some point, a cookie or two needs to pass over them to give her the brawn to pull off this stuff.See for Yourself'Salt'Cast: Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, Chiwitel Ejiofor, August DiehlDirector: Phillip NoyceRunning time: 1 hour 38 minutesIndustry rating: PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action. ||||| Watching Angelina Jolie slice, dice, kick, jump, shoot, run, and blow stuff up, all while camera-ready has its moments. The idea of a 110-pound action star with ropy arms, Claes Oldenburg lips, and a bosom Roger Corman would love made sense only on the pages of a comic book. But Jolie operates in ridiculous defiance of physics. In \u201cSalt,\u2019\u2019 she plays Evelyn Salt, an American spy on the run for, perhaps, being a Russian double agent. At some point, it looks as though she\u2019s been cornered and caught. But, no: She leaps off an overpass onto a moving semi, then onto a tanker, followed by a delivery truck, then a motorbike. She hangs off a speeding vehicle, forces a poor police officer to drive while she Tases him, and goes rolling off a bulleting subway. For 45 minutes as a blonde, for 45 as a steely brunette. \n  \n I started to call a doctor friend to find out how many sequences ago a tag should have graced Evelyn\u2019s cold, lifeless toe. But realizing I was missing the point of the Angelina Jolie experience, I put the phone down and considered consulting a personal trainer. I want the Evelyn Salt workout. Otherwise, \u201cSalt\u2019\u2019 is ridiculous. A Russian baddie (Daniel Olbrychski) casually insists, during a CIA interrogation, that the terrorist scheduled to kill the Russian president at the funeral of the recently deceased American vice president is, indeed, Agent Salt. \n  \n That I can believe. What I can\u2019t believe is that the North Koreans would have nabbed her in the field, as they have in the comical opening scene , or that she\u2019d marry a homely German entomologist (August Diehl). Liev Schreiber plays a co-worker, and why no one has thought to get these two together until now is mystery. That said, only in the latter scenes of Kurt Wimmer\u2019s screenplay do they really connect in any meaningful way. Otherwise, she\u2019s Harrison Ford, and he and Chiwetel Ejiofor, as an FBI agent also trying to catch her, share the Tommy Lee Jones part. It takes a lot of men not to catch this woman. \n  \n So, yes, the movie is part \u201cThe Fugitive.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s also part \u201cBourne Identity\u2019\u2019 and part dutiful airport thriller. To that end, the director is Phillip Noyce, an Australian who has spent the most lucrative years of his career orchestrating the Hollywood adaptations of such books. \u201cPatriot Games,\u2019\u2019 \u201cClear and Present Danger,\u2019\u2019 and \u201cThe Bone Collector,\u2019\u2019 also with Jolie, were professional, mostly serious entertainments. \u201cSalt\u2019\u2019 is a lesser relative. \n  \n Those first two films, along with \u201cDead Calm,\u2019\u2019 a thriller Noyce made with Nicole Kidman in 1989, exemplified a talent for generating the tension that results in excitement or suspense. Over 20 years later, \u201cSalt\u2019\u2019 appears to have been assembled in the same food processor as most mainstream action films. So much of its fights and chases share a generic sameness both in their sloppy construction and where they\u2019re situated. Take, Ye Olde Highway Chase, which this movie finds so nice it tries it twice. \n  \n But Jolie doesn\u2019t seem entirely bored with the routine. She has a laugh or two at her bionic image: Evelyn is a woman who uses a maxi pad as a bandage, and this is a star who\u2019s OK spending her movie\u2019s last quarter looking like Hilary Swank playing Jason Bourne. But at this point, Jolie\u2019s ultraness needs a foil. \u201cSalt\u2019\u2019 concludes with the promise of a sequel. With any luck Queen Latifah will tempt fate and join the proceedings as Pepper. \n  \n Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorris@globe.com.

The Liwa al-Tawhid, an Islamist faction commanded by Abdul Qadir al-Saleh, were leading rebel advances into Aleppo. But in recent months the government has succeeded in taking back lost ground. The government air raid on Aleppo on 14 November was part of a two-week offensive to regain rebel-held areas. Abdul Qadir al-Saleh's death, from injuries sustained in the air raid, deals a symbolic and practical blow to the Liwa al-Tawhid, widely seen as the strongest rebel movement in the region, with more than 8,000 fighters. But the movement will now have to regroup. The Liwa al-Tawhid say they have appointed Abdul Aziz Salama to succeed Abdul Qadir al-Saleh as military commander. \n  \n The Syrian opposition National Coalition told AFP news agency its president had also been invited to visit Moscow at the same time, but had been unable to attend due to prior commitments. \n  \n The United States, Russia and the United Nations are trying to convene the much-postponed conference in Geneva to try to end the civil war. \n  \n Monday's meetings follow a telephone call on Thursday between President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which the Kremlin said was their first since Mr Putin returned to the Russian presidency in 2012. \n  \n Liwa al-Tawhid formed in July 2012, uniting many separate fighting groups in the northern Aleppo countryside. Later that month, it led a rebel offensive on the city of Aleppo and took control of several districts. \n  \n In January, Liwa al-Tawhid joined the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front (SILF), an alliance of Islamist groups which mostly recognise the Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army but not the National Coalition. \n  \n Saleh, a former businessman from the town of Marea, had been meeting other senior figures from Liwa al-Tawhid at the time of the air strike. \n  \n Youssef al-Abbas, also known as Abu al-Tayyeb, died soon after the attack. There are conflicting reports about whether he was the brigade's intelligence or financial chief. \n  \n Saleh was meanwhile rushed to a hospital in neighbouring Turkey. The opposition Aleppo News Network reported on Friday that he was in a \"good condition\". \n  \n As an individual, he was very, very important, certainly in the Aleppo area, but increasingly as an individual that many in Syria felt represented the revolution Charles Lister, IHS Jane's \n  \n However, Saleh's subsequently died and was brought back to Syria for burial, Liwa al-Tawhid and activists confirmed on Monday. \n  \n \"We declare the martyrdom of Abdul Qadir al-Saleh,\" a statement by the brigade said. \n  \n Abdul Aziz Salama, the brigade's political leader, has assumed overall command, the group's spokesman said. \n  \n Liwa al-Tawhid arrested 30 people suspected of being government informers following the strike. \n  \n Counter attack \n  \n \"As an individual, he was very, very important, certainly in the Aleppo area, but increasingly as an individual that many in Syria felt represented the revolution,\" Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, told the AFP news agency. \n  \n \"He came from a humble background, was outwardly religious but was very open... and he maintained extremely good relations with almost all groups of all different natures.\" \n  \n He said Saleh's death might \"spur on the rebels to launch a counter-attack as the regime advances\" on opposition-held parts of Aleppo. \n  \n A week ago, Liwa al-Tawhid joined five other rebel groups operating in the city, including the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, in urging people to \"face up to regime attacks\". \n  \n Their joint statement said government forces backed by fighters from the Lebanese Shia Islamist movement Hezbollah, Iranian Revolutionary Guards and members of Abu al-Fadl Abbas, an Iraqi Shia militia, had launched a \"fierce offensive to reoccupy\" Aleppo. \n  \n Aleppo has been divided roughly in half by the government and opposition since mid-2012, when rebel fighters launched an offensive to gain control of northern Syria. \n  \n However, in the past few weeks the army has secured the area around the city's international airport and retaken the strategically important Base 80 nearby. Troops have also captured the towns of Safira and Tal Aran. \n  \n Despite the rebel losses, Saleh was resolute in an interview with Opposition Orient Television last week, insisting: \"We will not let Iran and Hezbollah advance except over our dead bodies.\" ||||| Key Syria rebel chief killed in regime strike \n  \n (AFP) \u2013 Nov 18, 2013 \n  \n Beirut \u2014 Abdel Qader Saleh, the charismatic chief of the Syrian rebel Liwa al-Tawhid Brigade, has died of his wounds after a regime air strike last week, rebels and activists said Monday. \n  \n His death is a blow to the opposition, particularly in the Aleppo area that Saleh came from and fought in, where the Syrian regime has made a string of advances in recent weeks. \n  \n Saleh was considered one of the opposition's most respected commanders, with ties across the opposition seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad, and his death was widely mourned on Monday. \n  \n The 33-year-old \"was the first to organise peaceful demonstrations in Aleppo and then the first to attack the bastions of Assad's gangs\", the opposition National Coalition said in a statement. \n  \n \"He became a living symbol in the hearts of the Syrians,\" the statement added. \n  \n Saleh's death was announced by Liwa al-Tawhid on its official Facebook page and confirmed by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \n  \n \"Abdel Qader Saleh, known as Hajji Marea, died of wounds he sustained last Thursday when warplanes targeted the Liwa al-Tawhid leadership,\" the watchdog said in a statement. \n  \n \"He was taken to Turkey after being wounded, and died in a hospital there before being brought back to Syria for burial,\" Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. \n  \n Thursday's strike also killed Liwa al-Tawhid's intelligence chief Yussef al-Abbas, known as Abu al-Tayyeb. \n  \n He had been in a car along with Saleh, and another senior figure in the rebel group, Abdelaziz Salameh, who was also wounded. \n  \n Following the attack, Liwa al-Tawhid arrested 30 people suspected of being regime informers. \n  \n Saleh, chief of operations for Liwa al-Tawhid, was widely seen as the brigade's most important figure. \n  \n A former grain merchant, he was one of tens of thousands of civilians who took up arms as a 2011 peaceful uprising against Assad gradually turned violent. \n  \n He was considered a moderate Islamist, particularly compared to the hardline jihadists who have flooded into Syria, and said he sought an Islamic state but with free elections. \n  \n \"In Europe, all the leaders are Christian because the majority is Christian. In Syria, the majority is Muslim and the government should be too, elected by the people,\" he told AFP during an interview in March. \n  \n Saleh's death comes as the Syrian regime makes new gains in Aleppo, seizing several towns and talking about reopening Aleppo International Airport after nearly a year of closure. \n  \n \"As an individual, he was very, very important, certainly in the Aleppo area, but increasingly as an individual that many in Syria felt represented the revolution,\" said Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane?s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre. \n  \n \"He came from a humble background, was outwardly religious but was very open... and he maintained extremely good relations with almost all groups of all different natures.\" \n  \n Lister said Saleh's death would be \"a very significant blow\" to the opposition, but added that it could \"spur on the rebels to launch a counterattack as the regime advances\". \n  \n In a sign of his good ties across the opposition spectrum, Saleh -- a father of five -- was being widely mourned on social media sites by activists and fighters from a range of groups. \n  \n Liwa al-Tawhid, which is backed in part by Qatar, has some 8,000 fighters and is among a number of Islamist units that have rejected the mainstream opposition National Coalition. \n  \n It does participate in the military command linked to the Coalition, and is one of the best known rebel brigades fighting in the Aleppo area, where Saleh was widely known. \n  \n Copyright \u00a9 2013 AFP.

Basically, think of it as your heart being attacked directly by the flu. \n  \n Up to 30 viruses are known to cause cardiomyopathy, and since it is a virus to blame there is little treatment except supportive measures (oxygen, medicines to help the heart beat more strongly, etc). Antibiotics do not help. It\u2019s also not contagious. \n  \n The reason a cardiomyopathy is bad news is that when the heart muscle gets a germ in it, it doesn\u2019t pump blood very well, so the usual picture is one of heart failure. The illness also can cause some dangerous and irregular heart rhythms. \n  \n Why do people get cardiomyopathy? We generally don\u2019t know. If your immune system is weak, if you abuse alcohol, or take a lot of medications you may be at higher risk. \n  \n Yet we also see young, healthy people get this condition. One tidbit \u2014 we don\u2019t like people who have a bad cold or virus, as in suffering fever, chills, and aches, to exercise strenuously because we worry the germ could spread to the heart.

Domestic violence, accidental, and suicide shootings accounted for approximately a fifth of all gunshot casualties in 2018. \n  \n The top 10 states for gun-related domestic violence incidents in 2018 (# per million people) were: Vermont (35.3), Alaska (32.5), Maine (28.3), Mississippi (24.5), West Virginia (22.2), Arkansas (20.8), New Hampshire (20.7), Kentucky (19.7), Alabama (18.8), Oklahoma (18.5). \n  \n DEFENSIVE GUN USES (DGUs) IN THE U.S. IN 2018 \n  \n By comparison, in 2018 there were 1,443 apparently justified DGUs in the U.S. where armed civilian gun owners attempted to prevent crimes (including incidents where no shots were fired), as presented in the table below (the figures below do not include incidents where unarmed citizens successfully defended themselves against armed criminals, incidents where armed law enforcement officers defended themselves, or \"bad DGUs\"): \n  \n Incident Type # Incidents # Killed # Wounded # Casualties List Source \"Justified\" DGUs 1,443 491 835 1,326 [List] GVA \n  \n The figures above indicate that in 2018, incidents where Americans shot themselves, a family member, an intimate partner or an innocent bystander (unintentionally) were 23 times more common than incidents where Americans used a gun in a justified attempt to stop a crime (see chart). This includes reported DGU incidents where Americans used guns to prevent petty larceny. Even if gun suicides are excluded, Americans were still 3.3 times more likely to shoot themselves, a family member, an intimate partner or an innocent bystander (unintentionally) than to use a gun in a justified attempt to stop a crime (including petty larceny). Women were approximately 100 times more likely to be killed by a man with a gun than to use a firearm in self defense [source]. For more in depth analysis, see Gun Threats and Self-Defense Gun Use and Firearm Justifiable Homicides and Non-Fatal Self-Defense Gun Use. \n  \n Finally, there were approximately 250,000 to 500,000 cases in 2018 in which guns were stolen from private owners, more than enough to provide a weapon for every instance of gun violence in the country [source]. This indicates that gun owners were at least 173 times more likely to have a gun stolen by criminals than to use a gun in an attempt to stop a crime. ||||| From Columbine to Charleston, here's a look at some of the most notable U.S. mass shootings. (Alice Li/The Washington Post) \n  \n The headlines all start to sound the same after awhile. Seven people shot inside Louisville nightclub. Four men shot in Suffolk early Sunday morning. Two dead, two hospitalized in Brice Street shooting. \n  \n The shootings happen so often, the circumstances become so familiar, that we tune them out. One dead, five injured in west Columbus shooting. Four shot in grocery store ambush. One dead, four injured in Stockton shooting. \n  \n Every now and then a particularly heinous crime makes us pause and reflect. Nine dead in shooting at black church in Charleston. Four marines, one sailor killed in attacks on Chattanooga military facilities. Gunman opens fire on Louisiana movie theater. \n  \n The Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced project of the anti-gun folks at the Guns Are Cool subreddit, lists 203 mass shooting events so far in 2015. Add in the shooting at a Louisiana movie theater last night and you get 204. Incidentally, yesterday was the 204th day of the year. \n  \n [Another day, another massacre \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to explain why] \n  \n The Mass Shooting Tracker is different from other shooting databases in that it uses a broader definition of mass shooting. \"The old FBI definition of Mass Murder (not even the most recent one) is four or more people murdered in one event,\" the site's creators explain. \"It is only logical that a Mass Shooting is four or more people shot in one event.\" \n  \n  \n  \n An officer walks with people near the scene of a shooting at the Grand Theatre on Thursday, July 23, 2015, in Lafayette, La. (Leslie Westbrook/The Advocate via AP) \n  \n These shootings have become so common that they typically don't even make national news. Do you remember the four people shot in Cincinnati earlier this month? How about the seven in Cleveland, or the nine in Fort Wayne? Unless you live in these areas, you probably didn't even hear about them. \n  \n This year there were 18 mass shootings in April, 39 in May, 41 in June, and 34 so far in July -- and the month isn't over yet. The theater shooting was Louisiana's 8th this year. There have been 10 in Ohio, 14 in California and 16 in New York. \n  \n Will anything change? Probably not. The Charleston shooting did produce a fruitful national conversation -- not on guns, but on the symbolism of the Confederate flag, which the shooter adopted as a banner of his racist beliefs. It took 150 years and a national tragedy for the country to reach something like a consensus on the meaning of a battle flag. \n  \n \"Those who live in America, or visit it, might do best to regard [mass shootings] the way one regards air pollution in China: an endemic local health hazard which, for deep-rooted cultural, social, economic and political reasons, the country is incapable of addressing,\" The Economist wrote in response to the Charleston massacre. \"This may, however, be a bit unfair. China seems to be making progress on pollution.\" ||||| WE DO not yet know why a gunman entered a church in Charleston, South Carolina on Wednesday and killed nine people at a prayer meeting, but in a sense it does not matter. One searches for reasons in order to assign responsibility and to devise solutions, but in this case no one will accept responsibility, and no solutions will be devised. One might blame radical ideology; given that the gunman, who police suspect is 21-year-old Dylann Roof, is white and the victims black, it seems probable that the motives were rooted in racial hatred. But no modern American party, movement or politician embraces explicit racism. While some exploit more subtle forms of racial resentment, none would admit to any link to a mass killer. A South Carolina branch of the Ku Klux Klan has been on a last-ditch recruitment drive to save itself from extinction, but one expects even the KKK would dissociate itself from violence these days. \n  \n The massacre, then (like those in Sandy Hook , Isla Vista, Aurora, and many others), will almost surely be blamed on the actions of a lone madman, who is now in the custody of police. This might, as with the Sandy Hook massacre, lead to support for legislation to make the public mental-health system more proactive (and more coercive). But that legislation is controversial among mental-health practitioners, and has been bogged down in Congress. In any case, while better mental health is a good thing in itself, it is unlikely to have a reliable impact in finding and stopping the small number of people who commit mass killings. The gunman's access to firearms was obviously a prerequisite for the killings. But it has become clear since Sandy Hook that meaningful gun control is politically impossible in America. While certain forms of restrictions on gun ownership are popular, the power of lobbying organisations such as the National Rifle Association and the lock-step opposition of Republicans in Congress have blocked all moves towards legislation. \n  \n Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n This political dynamic helps explain why the rise in mass killings in America has not led to any changes in policy. Such killings have become increasingly common , even as the overall number of gun-related homicides has declined. Before yesterday, there had been 279 killings involving four or more victims since 2006, according to an excellent database compiled by USA Today . About five out of six such killings target family members, or involve the commission of another crime such as a burglary. The mass killing in Charleston appears to belong to the sub-category of \"public killings\": those, like the Sandy Hook massacre, in which the killer had no intimate personal relationship with the victims. In fact, 2015 has not been a particularly bad year for public killings: until yesterday there had been just one, in San Francisco, and police believe it was gang-related. (The biker brawl in Waco , Texas, which left nine people dead, is not classified as a public killing because the victims appeared to have known each other.) \n  \n The massacre in Charleston will certainly add to America's growing racial tensions. After a series of killings at the hands of white police officers and citizens in the past few years, African-Americans increasingly feel they are the victims of structural racist violence. One of the most egregious slayings took place in nearby North Charleston in April, when a police officer shot a fleeing African-American man eight times after pulling him over for a broken tail light. (The officer has been indicted for murder.) White Americans often refuse to accept that such violence is rooted in widespread racism; for African-Americans, the connection is obvious. Still, while racist killings by officers could be addressed by changes in jurisprudence or policing practices, it is harder to imagine how to tackle mass murder. \n  \n This is not to say that Wednesday's massacre in Charleston has had no political consequences at all. There has been one: Jeb Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, cancelled a rally in the city that had been planned for Thursday. It is interesting to contemplate how many victims a killing must claim before politicians feel they need to cancel a rally in the area, and what types of victims merit cancellation. Would Mr Bush have cancelled his rally after a gang-related killing? What about a terrorist attack? (For that matter, why are political murders such as the Boston Marathon bombing immediately labelled \"terrorism\", while the apparently political mass murder in Charleston is not?) Will mass killings someday be unremarkable enough in America that politicians feel comfortable ignoring them entirely? \n  \n The regularity of mass killings breeds familiarity. The rhythms of grief and outrage that accompany them become\u2014for those not directly affected by tragedy\u2014ritualised and then blend into the background noise. That normalisation makes it ever less likely that America's political system will groan into action to take steps to reduce their frequency or deadliness. Those who live in America, or visit it, might do best to regard them the way one regards air pollution in China: an endemic local health hazard which, for deep-rooted cultural, social, economic and political reasons, the country is incapable of addressing. This may, however, be a bit unfair. China seems to be making progress on pollution. |||||", "output": "It's the worst kind of synchronicity: A website that tracks mass shootings in the US had logged 203 through Wednesday.

By using Tregs to 're-educate' the immune system, we may be able to really change the course of this disease,\" he explained. \n  \n In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas. Many treatments suppress the immune system, but that can lead to serious side effects, such as increasing a patient's susceptibility to infections or cancer. About 5 percent of all cases of diabetes are type 1 disease. \n  \n According to the researchers, the new therapy uses a patient's own regulatory T cells to protect insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The approach is designed to reduce the immune system's attack on beta cells, while still leaving the immune system strong enough to fight infections. \n  \n The patients in the first U.S. safety trial of the treatment received infusions of as many as 2.6 billion of the protective Treg cells and had no serious side effects, Bluestone's team said. \n  \n The results of the Phase 1 trial were published in the Nov. 25 online edition of the journal Science Translational Medicine. Phase 1 trials typically only examine if a drug or intervention is safe, they are not focused on effectiveness. \n  \n The next phase of this research would be a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the new therapy, the researchers said. \n  \n Two experts in type 1 diabetes said the approach holds real promise. \n  \n \"This is a very novel approach to treatment because it deals with the route cause for type 1 diabetes -- which is destruction of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas by one's own immune system,\" said Dr. Deena Adimoolam, assistant professor of medicine, endocrinology, diabetes and bone disease at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \n  \n \"The use of regulatory T-cells in its early stages of clinical research appears successful,\" she said, \"and I hope that future trials show long-term treatment with minimal side effects.\" \n  \n Dr. Minisha Sood directs inpatient diabetes care at Lenox Hill Hospital, also in New York City. She said that regulatory T cells \"are known to control autoimmunity -- not only in type 1 diabetes but also in a number of other autoimmune diseases. Therefore, it is believed that eventual treatments involving regulatory T cells may slow progression of or reverse the autoimmunity, which is the cause of type 1 diabetes.\" \n  \n While larger trials are needed to confirm a benefit for patients, the study \"did establish that immunotherapy with regulatory T cells is feasible from a safety standpoint, which is very promising,\" Sood said. \n  \n More information \n  \n The American Diabetes Association has more about type 1 diabetes. \n  \n Copyright \u00a9 2015 HealthDay.

They now plan a larger trial. \n  \n The method involves taking a pint of blood from the patient, removing up to 4 million Tregs and then increasing that number by 1,500 times in a test tube. \n  \n They are then returned to the patient and do not attack the pancreas. Up to 25 per cent were found to be still there after 12 months. \n  \n The procedure could potentially be used to treat other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease and even obesity. \n  \n \u201cUsing a patient\u2019s own cells - identifying them, isolating them, expanding them, and infusing them back - is an exciting new pillar for drug development,\u201d Professor Bluestone said. \n  \n One of the patients in the trial, Mary Rooney, 39, said: \u201cThe work of Dr Bluestone and his team offers new hope for people with type-1 diabetes. \n  \n \u201cThe Treg intervention aims to prevent the development and progression of type-1 diabetes, freeing people like me from the daily grind of insulin therapy and lifelong fear of complications.\u201d ||||| Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science Translational Medicine. \n  \n NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

Many T1D therapies aim to tackle this problem by suppressing the immune response, but that approach can have serious consequences, including an increased susceptibility to infection or cancer. \n  \n As reported in the Nov. 25, 2015, online issue of Science Translational Medicine, however, the cells used in the completed Phase 1 trial, known as regulatory T cells (Tregs; pronounced \"tee-regs\"), are instead based on the concept of \"immune tolerance\" - these cells have the potential to dampen the immune system's assault on beta cells while leaving its infection-fighting capabilities intact. \n  \n \"This could be a game-changer,\" said first author Jeffrey A. Bluestone, PhD, the A.W. and Mary Margaret Clausen Distinguished Professor in Metabolism and Endocrinology at UCSF. \"For type 1 diabetes, we've traditionally given immunosuppressive drugs, but this trial gives us a new way forward. By using Tregs to 're-educate' the immune system, we may be able to really change the course of this disease.\" \n  \n The encouraging safety results from the trial, conducted at UCSF by Stephen E. Gitelman, MD, professor of pediatrics, and at Yale School of Medicine by Kevan C. Herold, MD, \"support the development of a Phase 2 trial to test efficacy of the Treg therapy,\" the research team writes. \n  \n The infused Tregs used in the trial were derived from the trial participants' own cells, using an ex vivo (outside the body) \"isolation and expansion\" technique first described by Bluestone and colleagues in 2009. \n  \n In this procedure, doctors remove less than two cups of blood, which in T1D patients usually contain between 2 and 4 million of the desired Tregs, commingled with millions of cells of other types. Using a method known as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), which precisely segregates cells based on molecules they display on their surface, the therapeutic Tregs are separated and then placed into a growth medium in which they can attain a 1,500-fold increase in number. \n  \n Bluestone and colleagues have shown in previous work that Tregs recovered after this expansion are more functionally active, can repair defects in the immune system of patients with T1D and are more likely to survive long-term in the body than Tregs produced by other means. \n  \n The trial marked the first U.S. study in which large populations of Tregs created using these techniques were infused back into patients' circulation. Fourteen patients from 18 to 43 years old, all with recent-onset T1D, were organized into four groups that successively received infusions containing greater numbers of Tregs: members of the first group received about 5 million cells, and the fourth group about 2.6 billion cells. \n  \n In addition to being well tolerated by all four groups, the treatments were durable, with up to 25 percent of the infused therapeutic cells still detectable in patients' circulation a year after they had received just a single infusion. \n  \n The positive safety results from the trial are particularly reassuring, because in some instances T cells that were therapeutically introduced in cancer treatment have caused patients' immune systems to spiral out of control. Based on the Phase 1 data from this trial, New Jersey-based Caladrius Pharmaceuticals is now in the early stages of planning a Phase 2 trial of Tregs for T1D. \n  \n Trial participant Mary Rooney, 39, who was diagnosed with T1D four years ago, said she has experienced no side effects from Treg treatment. \"The work of Dr. Bluestone and his team offers new hope for people with type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune disorders,\" Rooney said. \"The Treg intervention aims to prevent the development and progression of type 1 diabetes, freeing people like me from the daily grind of insulin therapy and lifelong fear of complications. It's truly groundbreaking research with enormous potential.\" \n  \n In addition to their potential value as a diabetes therapy, said Bluestone, a member of the UCSF Diabetes Center, Tregs hold great promise as treatments for other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, and even as therapies for cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases and obesity. \n  \n UCSF research on Tregs and other novel approaches to autoimmune diseases recently received a significant boost from the Parker Foundation, established this year by Silicon Valley entrepreneur and philanthropist Sean Parker. In November, the foundation donated $10 million to establish the Sean N. Parker Autoimmunity Research Laboratory, with Bluestone as the laboratory's inaugural director. \n  \n \"Using a patient's own cells - identifying them, isolating them, expanding them, and infusing them back into the patient - is an exciting new pillar for drug development,\" said Bluestone, \"and we expect Tregs to be an important part of diabetes therapy in the future.\" \n  \n Explore further: Immune cell subset in mouse model of disease promotes healing and reduce inflammation \n  \n More information: \"Type 1 diabetes immunotherapy using polyclonal regulatory T cells,\" by J.A.

USA TODAY \n  \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions makes a statement on DACA at the Justice Department on Sept. 5, 2017. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) \n  \n WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department issued new guidance across the government Friday aimed at giving religious groups and individuals broad protections to express their beliefs when they come into conflict with government regulations, including when making hiring decisions. \n  \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions' directive fleshes out an executive order issued by President Trump earlier this year that had targeted in particular a provision of tax law prohibiting churches from direct involvement in political campaigns, a point that has chafed some evangelical activists. \n  \n But Sessions\u2019 action, long anticipated since Trump\u2019s announcement in May, also staked out religious protections for hiring decisions that could threaten those whose sexual orientation conflicts with employers' faith. \n  \n \"Except in the narrowest of circumstances, no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law,\" the attorney general wrote. \"To the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, religious observance and practice should be reasonably accommodated in all government action, including employment, contracting and programming.\" \n  \n For example, the directive says the Internal Revenue Service may not enforce the so-called Johnson Amendment \u2014 which prohibits non-profits from intervening in a political campaign on behalf of a candidate \u2014 in cases involving a religious non-profit when the same activity would not be enforced against a secular organization. \n  \n The guidance also reiterates that religious non-profits may not be excluded from federal grant programs for activities unrelated to their worship, and explicitly states that private businesses are entitled to the same conscience protections as churches. \n  \n \u201cOur freedom as citizens has always been inextricably linked with our religious freedom as a people,\" Sessions said. \"It has protected both the freedom to worship and the freedom not to believe. Every American has a right to believe, worship, and exercise their faith. The protections for this right, enshrined in our Constitution and laws, serve to declare and protect this important part of our heritage.\" \n  \n The Justice Department guidance was issued as the Trump administration announced that it would expand the religious exemption for employers who object to providing insurance coverage for birth control because of their religious or moral beliefs. \n  \n Read More: \n  \n Trump offers broad leeway to employers to drop birth control coverage \n  \n Trump's religious freedom order doesn't change law on political activity \n  \n The Sessions guidance offered strong support for the move, saying that the Department of Health and Human Services should not \"second guess the determination of a religious employer that providing contraceptive care to employees would make the employers compliant in wrongdoing.\" \n  \n Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, lauded both actions Friday. \n  \n \"After eight years of the federal government's relentless assault on the First Amendment, the Trump administration has taken concrete steps today that will once again erect a bulwark of protection around American's first freedom \u2014 religious freedom,\" Perkins said. \n  \n The Justice directive comes just days after a separate Sessions memo concluded that the federal civil rights law does not protect transgender people from discrimination in the workplace. The action reverses an Obama administration policy issued nearly three years ago. \n  \n According to Sessions' memo, the prohibition on sex discrimination \"encompasses discrimination between men and women but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity, per se, including transgender status.\" \n  \n The directive effectively rolls back 2014 guidance provided by then-Attorney General Eric Holder, which stated that the \"most straightforward reading\" of the civil rights law also guards transgender workers from discrimination. \n  \n Kris Hayashi, executive director of the Transgender Law Center, characterized Sessions' transgender directive and the religious freedom memo as \"a license to discriminate.\" \n  \n \u201cJust one day after announcing the government would refuse to uphold the law when it comes to protecting transgender workers, the attorney general today issued alarming guidance promoting state-sanctioned, taxpayer-funded discrimination against women, transgender people, and many other members of our communities,\" Hayashi said. \n  \n \"Make no mistake: today\u2019s guidance is devastating for transgender people. This license-to-discriminate memo invites illegal discrimination on a chilling new scale and attempts to open the door for carving certain communities, including transgender people, out of basic protections guaranteed by law.\" \n  \n University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said civil rights groups \"are right to be concerned.\" \n  \n \"When you take into account the transgender directive and this (religious freedom) memo, there seems to be a pattern here\" that could lead to possible discrimination, Tobias said. \"I can see why LGBT employees and others could be concerned about employers in this context.\" \n  \n But Richard Garnett, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame who writes on First Amendment and religious freedom issues, said Sessions memo Friday represents \"a significant commitment to a robust understanding of religious freedom.\" \n  \n \"The attorney general stated clearly, in keeping with longstanding American tradition, that religious freedom is a fundamental human right and not merely a policy preference,\" Garnett said. \n  \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2yMFvfS |||||", "output": "Last year, President Trump signed an executive order on religious freedom, and now the Department of Justice is creating a \"religious liberty task force\" to implement the guidance that was issued as a result of that order.

The mother of the children is in custody. Sheriff Bill Oldham said all the children are under 6 years old. (Mark Weber/The Commercial Appeal) \n  \n By Daniel Connolly of The Commercial Appeal \n  \n Shanynthia Gardner was charged overnight with multiple offenses in connection with the stabbing deaths of her four children in southeast Shelby County. \n  \n Gardner, 29, faces four counts of first-degree murder associated with aggravated child abuse, four counts of first-degree murder in association with aggravated child neglect, plus four more counts each of aggravated child abuse and aggravated child neglect or endangerment. \n  \n The details of the charging document states deputies were called to 7449 Southern Hill Drive, Apt. 101 at 12:28 p.m. Friday. The nature was \u201ca wounding call where four juveniles were found deceased upon Deputies\u2019 arrival.\u201d \n  \n According to Gardner's arrest affidavit, deputies found Garner on the scene with \"superficial cuts to her neck and wrists.\" The four children were found with \"severe throat lacerations\" were: six-month old Yahzi; Sya, 3; Sahvi, 2; and 4-year-old Tallen. A witness told deputies he saw 7-year-old Dallen run from the home and say his mother stabbed his sister, the affidavit said. \n  \n The children's father, Martin Gardner, spoke to Shanynthia on the phone at 12:50 p.m. and she admitted to killing their four children, the affidavit said. Deputies recovered a bloody butcher knife from the home. \n  \n Gardner's charging document lists her as 5-foot-6, 145 pounds with black hair and brown eyes. She uses the nickname \u201cYari.\u201d \n  \n The charges capped a day that started after a 911 call led deputies to an apartment on Southern Hill in the Greens of Irene complex, and the discovery of the four children in the unit. \n  \n It was one of the worst acts of violence in what\u2019s already been a bloody year in the Memphis area. \n  \n \"I've seen a lot of bad stuff in 33 years, but this is the worst,\" said Mark Dunbar, Shelby County assistant chief deputy. \n  \n Shelby County Sheriff Bill Oldham somberly addressed reporters Friday afternoon, saying, \"This is an egregious act of evil that has shocked us to our core.\" \n  \n The sheriff's office said all the children were under 6 years old. Oldham said it wasn't clear if anyone else had been present at the time of the killings. \n  \n Sheriff's deputies Friday had blocked off one section of the sprawling, well-maintained complex of neat brick buildings, and a reporter saw a boy behind police tape before security guards began clearing journalists out of the area, which is private property. \n  \n Throughout the sunny, hot afternoon, the guards moved journalists farther from the crime scene. They began screening drivers at an entrance gate into the complex to make sure they were residents. A line of vehicles stretched into nearby Shelby Drive. \n  \n As the investigation went on, golfers in baseball caps continued their games on the Irene Golf and Country Club, which adjoins the apartment complex. Later, authorities ordered the golf course closed, and golfers were reimbursed for their round and asked to leave, officials with the course said. It wasn't clear when the course would reopen. \n  \n \"I could never imagine this, not in this neighborhood. It's really quiet. We've never had a problem,\" said Barbara Hilliard, a resident of the community for seven years. \n  \n Resident Harold Morris learned of the situation after receiving a call from his nephew. Morris said he never imagined something like this happening in his community. \"This is one of the best places I ever lived in my life,\" he said. \n  \n A church vigil for the victims took place Friday night. \n  \n This is among the area's worst multiple homicides since the Lester Street killings in 2008, which was one of the bloodiest mass killings in Memphis history. Jessie Dotson was convicted of six counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of four adults and two children in Binghamton. \n  \n As of Friday evening, a total of 115 homicides had been recorded within the Memphis city limits, including several children and teenagers. This year's homicide count is on track to exceed the 2015 total of 161. \n  \n But the stabbing deaths of the children took place Friday in an unincorporated area outside the city limits that's patrolled by the sheriff's office. Including the four children, the sheriff's office has dealt with three cases covering seven homicides in less than four weeks. \n  \n The Tennessee Department of Children's Services had no history of violence involving the woman and victims, officials said. \n  \n \"We have been contacted by the Shelby County Sheriff's Department and of course we are standing by to see if we can be any help,\" said Rob Johnson, DCS communications director. \"At this time we've done an exhaustive search and we are not aware of any contact with this family.\" \n  \n The killings left many people wondering why someone would hurt children. One person who's studied this question is Dr. Phillip Resnick, a professor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who for decades has studied similar cases. He assisted the legal defense of Andrea Yates and Susan Smith, mothers accused of killing their offspring. \n  \n He emphasized he had no knowledge about Friday's case and wasn't commenting on it. But he answered the general question of why mothers might kill children and said his research has determined five principal reasons. \n  \n The first is a warped form of altruistic love: the mother is suicidal and believes the children would be better off joining her in heaven than living without their mother on this earth, he said. The second is child battery that leads to a death. \n  \n The third is killing of unwanted infants \u2014 for instance, the baby might stand in the way of a marriage. \n  \n \"The most dangerous day of your life is the day you were born,\" he said. \n  \n The fourth common reason for killing a child is revenge against a spouse. \n  \n And the fifth reason is psychotic behavior for which there's no rational explanation at all, he said. \n  \n Each year, about 500 children are killed by their parents in the U.S., he said. About equal numbers are killed by mothers and by fathers. Teenagers are more likely to be killed by fathers, infants are more likely to be killed by mothers. \n  \n County Commissioner Mark Billingsley spoke with reporters at the scene. He said he didn't know what led to the killings, but said the government should invest in mental health treatment. \n  \n \"A gigantic percentage of people who are incarcerated today have mental health issues.\" \n  \n He also said the sheriff has reached out to the child advocacy center and said that, in general, people should look out for neighbors in crisis. \"It takes all of us paying attention to our neighbors.\" \n  \n Frederick Smith, 47, pastor of nearby New Life Church of God in Christ, came to the area, saying his wife had sent him to help, saying, \"You've got to see what we can do.\" He said the church would offer child care Monday through Friday to any parent who's suffering from mental illness or who needs support. \"We'll take them for free.\" \n  \n Reporters Yolanda Jones, J.T.

No officers or bystanders were injured, police said. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cHe committed his crimes in the south and is suddenly thousands of miles west of there in our city,\u201d Phoenix Officer James Holmes said during a Sunday press conference. \n  \n Garnett had previously served time in federal prison for making threats to President Obama in 2010, according to the Associated Press. Garnett was living in Oklahoma City at the time of that arrest, Secret Service spokesman Max Millien said. He would not say how the case was resolved. \n  \n  \n  \n Garnett, who is from the Midwest and a four-year U.S. Army veteran, had no ties to Phoenix and no crime record except with the United States Secret Service, said Holmes, who could provide no information on that record. \n  \n  \n  \n The colleagues and families of the murdered and injured officers in Mississippi praised Phoenix police for getting a killer off the streets before he could hurt anyone else, Holmes said. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cWe don\u2019t celebrate any death regardless of the circumstances,\u201d Holmes said. However, now that it occurred, \u201cwe hope it brings a little peace to officers and their families in Tupelo.\u201d \n  \n  \n  \n Phoenix police also hailed one of their detectives, a 10-year veteran, as a hero after they said he sped to the scene of a bank robbery, saw a fellow officer under fire, exited his vehicle and shot the suspect dead. \n  \n  \n  \n Police and Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton on Sunday praised the efforts of a witness waiting in line at a drive-through fast-food restaurant across the street from the Compass Bank who called 911 at 10 a.m. after spotting a masked man going into the bank. \n  \n  \n  \n Holmes said Garnett, was wearing a bandana over his face when he entered the bank with a .45 caliber gun, wedged the bank door shut with a piece of wood, Holmes said. He pointed the weapon at the manager, said, \u201cThis is a bank robbery,\u201d Holmes said. \n  \n  \n  \n Garnett then ordered him to open the teller drawers while demanding everyone get on the ground, Holmes said. At one point, he had the manager and one of the tellers open the vault. \n  \n  \n  \n At another point, a woman pushed open the wedged door to enter the bank, Holmes said. Garnett pointed his gun at her and ordered her the ground, he said.

The boys are also again seen asking how soon food is coming. \n  \n Written on a rock in the cave can be seen the name of the football team and of the navy unit involved in the rescue. \n  \n Two Thai navy divers will be staying with the group underground from now on. \n  \n Could the group swim out? \n  \n \"Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive,\" Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. \n  \n A report in The Guardian says the boys are being trained to breathe through scuba masks. \n  \n But a source inside the Thai navy diving team has told the BBC that taking the boys, few of whom can even swim, out through the narrow flooded passages is too risky. \n  \n He said the journey in to where they were, deep in the caves, had exhausted even experienced divers. So they were seriously considering keeping the boys there for the full four or five months of the rainy season, he added. \n  \n Some of the route involves squeezing through tight gaps underwater. In parts it is too narrow to wear an oxygen tank and the exits are not visible, so it would be easy for a child to panic. \n  \n However, other Thai officials say they may need to bring the boys out quickly if water levels rise. Weather forecasts for the area are being closely monitored for heavy rain which could trigger further flooding. \n  \n What are the trapped group having to endure? \n  \n Before they were found, they would have lived in total darkness once any torch batteries had expired. \n  \n However, the three basic conditions for survival were met: \n  \n The temperature in the cave is thought to be around 26C (79F) so hypothermia was not an issue \n  \n There was sufficient oxygen because air enters through porous limestone or cracks in the rocks. \n  \n They had drinkable water \n  \n Oxygen may yet become a problem should the water level rise and the air pocket they are in get smaller. \n  \n Unknown factors include the possibility of dangerous animals like snakes in the cave or of contamination from bat droppings. \n  \n What rescue efforts are being made? \n  \n Rescuers are trying to work out how best to bring them all to safety, with officials stressing they do not intend to take any risks with the boys' safety. \n  \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Families have been shown new footage of the 12 boys and their coach stuck in a cave in Thailand. \n  \n At a news conference, officials said no rescue attempt would be made on Wednesday but conditions were perfect for a rehearsal. \n  \n Water continues to be pumped out of the cave complex and officials have said they are confident they have been able to stop more water getting into the chamber the boys are in. \n  \n Emergency teams are also trying to install a phone line so the group can talk to their families but attempts to do so failed on Tuesday. \n  \n Outside the cave, medics are staging rehearsals in case the group can be brought out soon. \n  \n Other teams are still scouring the mountainside in the hope of finding another way into - and out of - the cave. \n  \n How did the group get trapped? \n  \n The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June. It is believed they entered the cave in northern Chiang Rai province when it was dry and that sudden heavy rains blocked the exit. \n  \n It is thought they could at first move through parts of the cave in dry conditions but rushing waters clogged the narrow passages with mud and debris, blocking visibility and access. \n  \n How were they found? \n  \n They were finally reached by two British rescue divers late on Monday, nine days after they entered the caves. \n  \n They were huddled on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave. \n  \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment divers discover the missing boys \n  \n The video of that first contact was also posted on Facebook by Thai navy special forces. \n  \n The boys are seen by torchlight sitting on a ledge above water, responding to the divers that all 13 are there and they are very hungry. \n  \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Diver Ben Reymenants is assisting with the rescue mission and says none of the boys can swim ||||| Thai authorities are racing to finalise rescue plans to retrieve 12 boys and their football coach from a Thailand cave before storms forecast for the end of the week, after which an extraction will become \u201calmost impossible\u201d for months, according to one coordinator of the international rescue effort. \n  \n The boys, none of who can swim, are being trained in how to breathe through diving masks but none have made any attempt to get through the water hemming them in. \n  \n Authorities said they appeared mentally and physically healthy after receiving food and water supplies, but were yet to speak to their parents after the waterproof seal of a phone sent into the narrow, muddy cave system was breached, ruining the device. |||||", "output": "If 12 boys and their coach are going to get out of a flooded cave in northern Thailand before monsoon rains make their situation worse, it is going to have to happen soon, authorities say. The government says the boys are receiving crash courses in swimming and diving from rescue teams, though the 2.5-mile route to safety through dark, treacherous tunnels takes even the best divers around three hours, reports Reuters. The governor of Chiang Rai province, Narongsak Osatanakorn, says the youth soccer team has been practicing with diving masks but he's not sure if they have attempted any dives yet, the Guardian reports. He says no attempt to extract the boys will be made Wednesday, though the weather will remain ideal for a rescue later in the week. Rainy season is only just beginning in the area, meaning the boys could be trapped for up to four months if authorities decide it is too dangerous to extract them, though the military describes four months as a worst-case scenario. In video released by Thai Navy SEALs, the boys, aged from 11 to 16, appear healthy, the BBC reports. The boys, who have been in the cave since June 23, have been provided with supplies and the military says two SEALs will remain with them at all times.

Just seeing or being told about the signature at the end of the diary would have been enough for him to reach for the phone. \n  \n \u201cHe was not very literate and the idea that he would have been capable of producing such a sophisticated and credible forgery is not remotely plausible.\u201d \n  \n MOST READ IN LIVING GREAT BRITISH BUZZ OFF We rate sex toys from Poundland Bullet to Tango Lipstick to see if discount brands are an anti-climax fresh princess Remember Ashley from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air?

It\u2019s usually hot, and despite the fact that we are Tetrised in there, all of us are trying desperately to pretend that we are completely alone. Rarely do I give thanks for the experience, but this year marks the 155th anniversary of the London Underground, that efficient marvel of public transport. \n  \n On January 9, 1863, the world\u2019s first-ever underground railway train, steam-operated, pulled out of Paddington Station, and rumbled 3.5 miles down the tubular tunnel to Farringdon Station. The line, which was financed by Metropolitan Railway, was an instant success: Approximately 40,000 people lined up for the novelty of riding a train underground. Within six months, 26,000 people were riding the train each day. \n  \n By 1884, there were more than 800 trains in operation in what was called the Inner Circle, a circular line that enclosed central London and that is now just the Circle Line. And now, with more than five times that number of trains operating and millions of people safely and swiftly reaching their destinations every day, the London Underground is truly a modern miracle of efficient transport. Here are 18 impressive facts and figures you might not have known about the London Tube. \n  \n 1. THE MAJORITY OF THE LONDON UNDERGROUND IS NOT UNDERGROUND. \n  \n  \n  \n iStock \n  \n The entire London Underground network is approximately 249 miles long, employing more than 4100 trains, and linking 270 stations. But only about 45 percent of those miles are underground. \n  \n 2. EACH TRAIN TRAVELS ABOUT 114,500 MILES A YEAR. \n  \n Each Tube train travels an average of 114,500 miles a year, or 4.6 times around the world. The longest distance between adjacent stations is approximately 3.9 miles, between Chesham to Chalfont & Latimer. The shortest distance is about 984 feet, between Leicester Square and Covent Garden on the Picadilly Line (and since Covent Garden is usually mobbed, you\u2019re better off getting off at Leicester Square and walking). \n  \n 3. MORE THAN 1 BILLION JOURNEYS ARE MADE EACH YEAR. \n  \n Each year, about 1.3 billion journeys are made on the London Underground. The busiest station in the network is Waterloo, which sees about 100.3 million passengers per year; the least used is Roding Valley. \n  \n 4. HALF A MILLION MICE CALL THE UNDERGROUND HOME. \n  \n An estimated 500,000 mice live in the tunnels, but they\u2019re not the only pests\u2014the mosquitoes that live in the Tube are of a different and somewhat more vicious species than their aboveground cousins. Called Culex pipiens molestus, they\u2019re supposedly known for their voracious appetites. \n  \n 5. THERE AE SOME GHOSTS REPORTEDLY LIVING DOWN THERE, TOO. \n  \n The London Underground is also supposedly home to a group of subterranean Londoners, who, just like the Mole People of New York\u2019s Subway, took to the tunnels and mutated. The Tube is also reportedly home to a host of ghostly apparitions, including the Faceless Woman of Beacontree Station, the Toothy Man of Channelsea Depot, and the Screaming Spectre of Farringdon Station. \n  \n 6. THE AVERAGE LONDONER SPENDS 11.5 DAYS OF EACH YEAR ON THE TUBE. \n  \n The average Londoner spends an average of about 11.5 days each year on the Underground\u20145.2 of those days in the Underground\u2019s underground tunnels. (What\u2019s unknown is how many hours of those days are spent stopped underground, waiting for a signal failure to be resolved, another train to move along, or for whatever bit of rubbish that has been thrown on the tracks at the station ahead of you to be cleared.) \n  \n 7. THE FASTEST TRAINS TRAVEL AT SPEEDS OF OVER 60 MILES PER HOUR. \n  \n The fastest line is the Metropolitan, where trains can reach speeds of more than 60 miles per hour, but the average speed of a London Underground train is only around 20.5 miles per hour. \n  \n 8. THE DEEPEST STATION IS NEARLY 200 FEET BELOW STREET LEVEL. \n  \n The deepest Underground station is Hampstead, on the Northern Line, which is located nearly 192 feet below street level. There\u2019s an elevator, of course, but also an emergency spiral staircase featuring more than 320 steps, in case of emergency (or a fit of exercise mania). \n  \n 9. IN 1969, QUEEN ELIZABETH TOOK CONTROL OF THE VICTORIA LINE. \n  \n In 1969, Queen Elizabeth II commemorated the opening of the Victoria Line by driving one of the new trains from Green Park to Oxford Circus. It was her second ride ever on a London Underground train, the first being when she was 13 and accompanied by her sister and governess. Presumably her stint as Tube driver was without incident as eight years later, the Queen was again allowed in the cab of a Picadilly Line train when she presided over the opening of the line\u2019s extension. \n  \n 10. THE FIRST ESCALATOR WAS A MISERABLE FAILURE. \n  \n The Underground\u2019s first real escalator was built in 1911 at Earl\u2019s Court, but four years before that, a spiral escalator was installed at Holloway Road Station. It didn\u2019t last very long\u2014in fact, it only lasted a day of testing and never actually saw public use. Its remains are held at the London Transport Museum\u2019s Depot, which is only open to the public a few times per year. \n  \n 11. THE LONGEST ESCALATOR IS NEARLY 200 FEET LONG. \n  \n The longest escalator at any Underground station is the 197-foot-long moving stair at Angel, in Islington, on the Northern line. \n  \n 12. PEOPLE HAVE LEFT A LOT OF WEIRD THINGS ON THE TRAINS. \n  \n Among the strangest things left on the Underground and collected by the Lost Property Office: A jar of bull semen; outboard motor; three dead bats in a container; a vasectomy kit; a harpoon gun, which may have gone with the 14-foot long boat; a stuffed eagle; breast implants; false teeth and a surprising number of prosthetic limbs; a four-foot tall Mickey Mouse; six full-sized mannequins; and an urn containing a dead man\u2019s ashes, which was reunited with his brother five years after it was lost. \n  \n 13. JERRY SPRINGER WAS BORN AT HIGHGATE STATION. \n  \n Politician-turned-trash talk show host Jerry Springer was born at Highgate Station on the Northern Line on February 13, 1944, when his mother sought shelter during a Luftwaffe raid during World War II. \n  \n 14. MANY PEOPLE USED TUBE STATIONS ARE AIR RAID SHELTERS DURING WORLD WAR II, EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT BANNED THE PRACTICE. \n  \n Speaking of air raids: At the start of the London Blitz, Germany\u2019s nightly bombing raids on the British capital in September 1939, the government banned people from using the Tube stations as air raid shelters, claiming that the stations should be reserved only for transport. People got around the ban by simply buying a ticket and refusing to the leave the platform. A month later, the government realized that the ban was unenforceable at best and cruel at worst, and gave the go-ahead for stations to be used as shelters. \n  \n By the end of the war, sheltering in the Underground had became so regular that a ticketing scheme was introduced to keep people from panicking at the queues, and more than 22,000 bunk beds were installed in stations across the system to provide places for them to sleep. \n  \n 15. ITS ICONIC MAP WAS INSPIRED BY A CIRCUIT BOARD. \n  \n  \n  \n iStock \n  \n The London Underground\u2019s iconic map, which bears no relationship to actual topographical or geographical features, was designed in 1933 by Harry Beck. Beck, an engineering draftsman who worked in the London Underground\u2019s signals office, was supposedly inspired by electronic circuit boards, and saw ways of tidying up the lines. But the department rejected the initial proposal, claiming it was too radical, and Beck was paid a paltry less than $15 for his work. Two years and some modifications later, however, the Underground adopted the map and has used it ever since. |||||", "output": "In 1992, a 9,000-word diary was found in the floorboards of a home in England containing a detailed confession to murders tied to Jack the Ripper, the serial killer who terrorized London for 10 weeks in 1888. It ended thusly: \"I give my name that all know of me, so history do tell, what love can do to a gentleman born. Yours Truly, Jack The Ripper.\" It appears to belong to wealthy Liverpool cotton Merchant James Maybrick, who died a year later, but many experts dismissed the tell-all tome as a sophisticated forgery. Now, the Telegraph reports, a team led by writer and film director Bruce Robinson has unearthed timecards that show which electricians were working on Maybrick's home, Battlecrease House, on March 9, 1992, the morning the book was said to have been found. The man who came up with the diary, scrap metal dealer Mike Barrett, claimed to have gotten it through a family friend who died soon thereafter, leading many to believe it was a fake. But Barrett was a colorful character who frequented the Saddle Inn public house in Anfield, where one of the electricians working on Battlecrease House was also a regular. Because Barrett fancied himself a writer, it is believed that the electricians who found the book passed it onto Barrett, who then famously contacted a London literary agent that very day in March claiming he had Jack the Ripper's diary, adds the Sun.

An explosion struck an Ariana Grande concert in northern England late Monday, killing over a dozen people and injuring dozens in what police say they are treating as a terrorist attack. (AP... (Associated Press) \n  \n MANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 An explosion struck an Ariana Grande concert attended by thousands of young music fans in northern England, killing at least 19 people and injuring dozens in what police said Tuesday was being treated as a terrorist attack. \n  \n Greater Manchester Police said 19 people were confirmed dead after the explosion at Manchester Arena. Northwest Ambulance Service said 59 injured people had been taken to hospitals, and a number of \"walking wounded\" were treated at the scene. \n  \n Police cars, bomb-disposal units and 60 ambulances raced to the scene as the scale of the carnage became clear. \n  \n \"We are currently treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise,\" said Ian Hopkins, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police. \n  \n There was panic after the explosion, which struck around 10:30 p.m. (2130GMT) Monday night as Grande was ending the concert, part of her Dangerous Woman Tour. \n  \n Grande, who was not injured, tweeted hours later: \"Broken. From the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry. I don't have words.\" \n  \n Manchester Arena said on its website that the blast struck outside the venue as concertgoers were leaving. Some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended. \n  \n One witness said Grande had just finished her final song and said \"Thank you, Manchester,\" before leaving the stage. \n  \n The incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another. \n  \n Taxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free, and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down. \n  \n City officials said the true spirit of Manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident. \n  \n Twitter and Facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for. \n  \n Jenny Brewster said she was leaving the concert with her 11-year-old daughter when the blast hit. \n  \n \"As I turned around, boom, one loud noise,\" she told Sky News. \"A gentleman said 'run!' so we ran.\" \n  \n Outside, she said, \"you could smell the burning.\" \n  \n Britain's terrorist threat level stands at \"severe,\" the second-highest rung on a five-point scale, meaning an attack is highly likely. \n  \n There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Online, supporters of the extremist Islamic State group, which holds territory in Iraq's Mosul and around its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, celebrated the blast. \n  \n One wrote: \"May they taste what the weak people in Mosul and (Raqqa) experience from their being bombed and burned,\" according to the U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group. \n  \n If the incident is confirmed as a terrorist attack it would be the deadliest in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 London commuters on three subway trains and a bus in July 2005. \n  \n \"A huge bomb-like bang went off that hugely panicked everyone and we were all trying to flee the arena,\" said concertgoer Majid Khan, 22. \"It was one bang and essentially everyone from the other side of the arena where the bang was heard from suddenly came running towards us as they were trying to exit.\" \n  \n Added Oliver Jones, 17: \"The bang echoed around the foyer of the arena and people started to run.\" \n  \n Video from inside the arena showed concertgoers screaming as they made their way out amid a sea of pink balloons. \n  \n British Prime Minister Theresa May said the government was working to establish \"the full details of what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack.\" \n  \n May is due to chair a meeting of the government's COBRA emergency committee later Tuesday. She and other candidates suspended campaigning for Britain's June 8 election after the blast. \n  \n Police advised the public to avoid the area around the Manchester Arena, and the train station near the arena, Victoria Station, was evacuated and all trains canceled. \n  \n The Dangerous Woman tour is the third concert tour by 23-year-old Grande and supports her third studio album, \"Dangerous Woman.\" \n  \n Grande's role as Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon's high school sitcom \"Victorious\" propelled her to teen idol status, starting in 2010. \n  \n The tour began in Phoenix, Arizona, in February. After Manchester, Grande was to perform at venues in Europe, including Belgium, Poland, Germany, Switzerland and France, with concerts in Latin America and Asia to follow. \n  \n Pop concerts and nightclubs have been a terrorism target before. Almost 90 people were killed by gunmen inspired by the extremist Islamic State group at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris during a performance by Eagles of Death Metal in November 2015. \n  \n In Turkey, 39 people died when a gunman attacked New Year's revelers at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul. \n  \n There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

Your task is to summarize them.", "input": "While putting together our original story, the fact that the crime happened so long ago presented certain reporting challenges. Although the St. Charles Police Department records and investigative notes about the robbery in 1999 are public, none of the contact information for anyone interviewed was current. It was important to us to try to contact the victim of the robbery, but we were unsuccessful. \n  \n Instead, the victim found us. \n  \n Two days after the story published, we received an e-mail with the subject line, \"man that robbed the burger king man.\" \"Just to let you know that I was that victim. Why don't you talk to me and I will tell you how bad it screwed up my life,\" it read. \n  \n His name is Dennis -- we've agreed to use only his first name. \n  \n \"I got cigarettes and picked up the Riverfront Times...and I was sitting there back at work eating my lunch and reading this magazine,\" he says. \"About halfway through I realized they were talking about me. The guy was a Burger King manager on a night shift, and he got robbed in St. Charles, and that's when I was like, 'Damn, that's the same thing that happened to me.'\" \n  \n After the robbery in 1999, Dennis quit his job at Burger King and became increasingly paranoid that the men who'd held him up would find him and try to prevent him from testifying. He had a wife and small children, and he says he made them move more than once. But that didn't seem to calm his nerves. \n  \n \"Once this happened, I shut everything out around me. Didn't care,\" he says. \"I didn't want to be involved in anything. Stayed away from home, stayed away from the kids or the old lady. Would not even come home. Go get shitfaced, pretty much.\" \n  \n Eventually, after his marriage broke up, Dennis moved to Florida to be near his brother. About six years ago, he decided to come back so his now-teenage daughter could be closer to his ex. He says he mostly forgot about the robbery -- until he read about it in the RFT. Naturally, he'd just assumed that after the trial, Anderson went to prison. \n  \n \"There are so many cracks he fell through -- how could that be possible?\" Dennis asks. \n  \n In our first conversation with Dennis, he seemed angry at Anderson. But by the time we met him in person, he had a new, more surprising reaction. \n  \n \"I think what really pissed me off is how our government dropped the ball. They didn't do what they were supposed to do. They were supposed to make sure he went to jail,\" he says. \"[Mike] screwed up and he was supposed to pay for it. Our government screwed up. Who's paying for that? Does he have to pay for that again? Doesn't seem right.\" \n  \n Dennis shared another surprising anecdote -- his daughter read the story in a high school class, not knowing that her dad was the victim of the robbery.

Watch us live on the Today Show on NBC tomorrow morning. My client and his wife will be interviewed. \n  \n We could not have achieved this without your help and support. \n  \n Cornealious \"Mike\" Anderson is 36 years old, a married father of four, youth football coach, volunteer, homeowner and small business owner in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1999, he was arrested and later convicted of participating in a robbery of a Burger King manager. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison. He was released on bail while his appeals were pending, and after he lost his appeals, the State of Missouri simply forgot about him. They never told him to report to prison to serve his sentence. \n  \n When he was arrested, he was 22 years old, had no children, was not married, and did not own a home or a business. \n  \n From 1999 to 2013, he lived a law-abiding life, paid taxes, and worked to build a career as a carpenter. He never became a fugitive, tried to change his identity, or flee from justice. He had no further trouble with the law. He stayed right in St. Louis. He got married, had 4 children, built his own home in Missouri, and started several successful small businesses, including a contracting business. He volunteered at his church and coached his son's youth football team. \n  \n In July, 2013, the State of Missouri suddenly realized, 13 years later, that Mike Anderson had never served the sentence, and that he was out on bail this entire time. They raided his house with a SWAT team, and ripped him from his home without warning, hauled him off to prison, and told him he now had to serve 13 years in prison. \n  \n If he is required to serve the sentence, he will be 50 years old when he is released. His kids will have grown up without a father, his wife will have had to raise 4 children alone, and they will lose their home and business - everything he had worked so hard to attain in the last 13 years of leading a normal life. \n  \n The victim of the robbery believes that Mike Anderson should not be forced to now serve a 13- year sentence, and believes the State of Missouri dropped the ball. He has said that he believes it would serve no purpose in now incarcerating this man. \n  \n I am representing Mike Anderson in his petition for release from prison. Join us in petitioning the Attorney General of the State of Missouri and Mississippi County Judge T. Lynn Brown to release this man from this unjustice. \n  \n Read his story here: Riverview Times Article 2-14-2014 \n  \n Listen to his story here: This American Life \n  \n FOLLOW NEW DEVELOPMENTS ON THE CASE AT www.appealslawgroup.com ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Anderson was convicted in a 1999 armed robbery, and was supposed to go to prison after he exhausted all his appeals. But the state never ordered Anderson to prison, because it somehow mistakenly believed he was already there, CBS News reports. Then, when the time came for what should have been Anderson's discharge date last summer, the state realized it couldn't discharge him ... because he had never been in prison. Anderson had made no attempt to hide over the ensuing years\u2014he got married and is a father of four, started a contracting business, and built a house\u2014where he was re-arrested in July. Anderson's attorneys have filed a motion arguing that after so long, jailing Anderson amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, and thus he should be released. Even Anderson's victim agrees, as do the more than 11,000 supporters who've signed an online petition calling for Anderson's release. The state attorney general is expected to respond Tuesday. Anderson, now 37, was 22 when he and a friend robbed a St. Louis Burger King night manager at gunpoint, the New York Post reports. No one was hurt, but the victim talked to the Riverfront Times after Anderson went to prison last year and said that he was emotionally \"screwed up\" by the crime. Even so, he says it \"doesn't seem right\" that Anderson should have to go through this ordeal because of a government error.

John Boehner, the top Republican in the House, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. \n  \n  \n  \n McConnell issued a statement Friday evening saying that \"As we have over the past year, Republicans will continue to offer the types of ideas and step-by-step approach that Americans are calling for.\" While the letter laid out an agenda for the meeting, McConnell said that \"we will consult with the White House about the proposed format and topics in order to maximize the effectiveness of the meeting.\" Most Republicans have yet to commit to the meeting, but Obama has invited House and Senate leadership, as well as the chairmen and ranking members of relevant committees (full list here ). He's also asked Pelosi, Reid, Boehner and McConnell to each choose another four members and one staffer specializing in health care policy to attend the meeting. \n  \n  \n  \n \"This leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Are they excluding governors, state legislators, CBO, and rank-and-file congressional Democrats who have opposed Obamacare and are the reason the president hasn't had a bill to sign?

Or are they willing to start over with a blank sheet of paper?\" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. \"We need answers before we know if the White House is more interested in partisan theater than in facilitating a productive dialogue about solutions.\" \n  \n  \n  \n The White House plans to post online the bill that Republicans have said needs to be scrapped in order for them to come to the negotiating table. \n  \n  \n  \n \"Since this meeting will be most productive if information is widely available before the meeting, we will post online the text of a proposed health insurance reform package,\" the invite says. \"It is the President\u2019s hope that the Republican congressional leadership will also put forward their own comprehensive bill to achieve those goals and make it available online as well.\" \n  \n  \n  \n The legislation that will be posted online is a \"product of the discussions between the House and Senate,\" a White House official said, adding that Democrats are still working to bridge the differences between the two bills, and the end result is what will ultimately be posted online. The official said more details will be released going forward. \n  \n  \n  \n The invitation lays out the meeting agenda: Obama will deliver opening remarks, it explains, then hand the mic off to \"a Republican leader chosen by the Republican leadership and a Democratic leader chosen by the Democratic leadership.\" \n  \n  \n  \n \"The President will then open and moderate discussion on four critical topics: insurance reforms, cost containment, expanding coverage, and the impact health reform legislation will have on deficit reduction,\" says the invite. \n  \n  \n  \n The invite also nudges back against GOP complaints that Obama did not make good on his campaign pledge to air health care negotiations on C-SPAN - a criticism that Obama has said is legitimate. \n  \n  \n  \n In highlighting the efforts over the past year to craft health care legislation, the invitation points out that \"there have been hundreds of hours of committee hearings and mark-ups in both the House of Representatives and Senate, with nearly all of those sessions televised on C-SPAN.\" \n  \n  \n  \n \"The Blair House meeting is the next step in this process,\" the invitation says. \"The session will begin at 10:00 a.m. and be broadcast live in its entirety.\" \n  \n  \n  \n Joining Obama at the meeting from the White House will be Vice President Biden, Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the Office of Health Reform, Sebelius and a representative from the Office of Management and Budget. \n  \n  \n  \n The congressional invite list and the full letter are below: \n  \n  \n  \n Senator Harry Reid, D-NV, Majority Leader \n  \n Senator Mitch McConnell, R-KY, Republican Leader \n  \n Senator Richard Durbin, D-IL, Majority Whip \n  \n Senator Jon Kyl, R-AZ, Republican Whip \n  \n Senator Max Baucus, D-MT, Chairman of the Finance Committee \n  \n Senator Chuck Grassley, R-IA, Ranking Member of the Finance Committee \n  \n Senator Tom Harkin, D-IA, Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n  \n Senator Mike Enzi, R-WY, Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n  \n Senator Christopher Dodd, D-CT, Member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n  \n  \n  \n Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA \n  \n Representative Steny Hoyer, D-MD, Majority Leader \n  \n Representative John Boehner, R-OH, Republican Leader \n  \n Representative James Clyburn, D-SC, Majority Whip \n  \n Representative Eric Cantor, R-VA, Republican Whip \n  \n Representative Charles Rangel, D-NY, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee \n  \n Representative Dave Camp, R-MI, Ranking Member of the Ways and Means Committee \n  \n Representative Henry Waxman, D-CA, Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee \n  \n Representative Joe Barton, R-TX, Ranking Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee \n  \n Representative George Miller, D-CA, Chairman of the Education and Labor Committee \n  \n Representative John Kline, R-MN, Ranking Member of the Education and Labor Committee \n  \n Representative John Dingell, D-MI, Chair Emeritus of the Energy and Commerce Committee \n  \n  \n  \n --- \n  \n  \n  \n Dear Speaker Pelosi, Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, and Representative Boehner: \n  \n  \n  \n We are writing to ask that you join President Obama for a bipartisan meeting at the Blair House on February 25 to discuss health reform legislation. \n  \n  \n  \n We have seen again in recent days that when it comes to health care, the status quo is unsustainable and unacceptable. The proof is right in front of us: just last week, a major insurer, Anthem Blue Cross, announced plans to increase premiums for many of its policyholders in California by as much as 39 percent on March 1. \n  \n  \n  \n As the President noted this week, if we don\u2019t act on comprehensive health insurance reform, this enormous rate hike will be \"just a preview of coming attractions. Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance; millions more will lose their coverage altogether; our deficits will continue to grow larger.\" \n  \n  \n  \n Now is the time to act on behalf of the millions of Americans and small businesses who are counting on meaningful health insurance reform. In the last year, there has been an extraordinary effort to craft effective legislation. There have been hundreds of hours of committee hearings and mark-ups in both the House of Representatives and Senate, with nearly all of those sessions televised on C-SPAN. The Senate spent over 160 hours on the Senate floor considering health insurance reform legislation and, for the first time in history, both the House of Representatives and Senate have approved comprehensive health reform legislation. This is the closest our Nation has been to resolving this issue in the nearly 100 years that it has been debated. \n  \n  \n  \n The Blair House meeting is the next step in this process.

It doesn't belong on the street,\" Walker's attorney, Jeff Milam, said in a statement. \"And we shouldn't be without Paul Walker or his friend, Roger Rodas.\" \n  \n Calvin Kim with Porsche Cars North America said the automaker hasn't seen the lawsuit and wouldn't comment on specifics. \n  \n \"As we have said before, we are saddened whenever anyone is hurt in a Porsche vehicle, but we believe the authorities' reports in this case clearly established that this tragic crash resulted from reckless driving and excessive speed,\" Kim said. \n  \n The actor was best known for his role as Brian O'Conner in the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise. His life was cut short in a car crash in Southern California on November 30, 2013, during a few days off in the filming of the seventh movie in the popular series. He was 40. \n  \n The lawsuit alleges \"the vehicle lacked safety features that are found on well-designed racing cars or even Porsche's least expensive road cars -- features that could have prevented the accident or, at a minimum, allowed Paul Walker to survive the crash.\" \n  \n The court document contends the 2005 Carrera GT should have come with an electronic stability control system to protect against swerving. The car also lacked adequate side door reinforcement bars and had defective rubber fuel lines, according to the lawsuit. \n  \n The investigation \n  \n An investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said it was speed that killed the \"Fast & Furious\" star. \n  \n \"Investigators determined the cause of the fatal solo-vehicle collision was unsafe speed for the roadway conditions,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Commander Mike Parker said in March 2014. \n  \n The high-performance 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was going \"between 80 and 93 mph at the time the car impacted a power pole and several trees,\" the report said. The posted speed limit on the Santa Clarita, California, office park road was 45 mph. \n  \n The sheriff's conclusion was no surprise, since the coroner's report previously estimated the car was speeding at 100 mph. \n  \n A source familiar with the Walker family's lawsuit, however, say that investigators who analyzed surveillance video think the car was actually going slower. The suit, in fact, claims the vehicle was traveling \"at approximately 63 to 71 mph when it suddenly went out of control.\" \n  \n The family's investigators think the car was going between 40 and 60 mph at the point of impact, according to the source. \n  \n Possibly to explain the damage to the car in a lower-speed accident, the suit says the doors on the Porsche used \"side door reinforcement bars that lacked adequate welds and consisted of material weaker in strength than what is used in popular mass-market cars ... designed and built to be operated at speeds much slower than the Carrera GT.\" \n  \n JUST WATCHED Walker tribute video goes viral Replay More Videos ...

The airbags deployed as they should have when the car clipped a light pole and several trees, investigators said. \n  \n Nothing mechanical went wrong to cause the Porsche to leave the wide road. Investigators found \"no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision,\" the report said.

(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images) \n  \n There are all sorts of micro economies that are fed or supported by Hollywood. Picture-making doesn\u2019t just provide a living for actors and the small armies of lawyers, crew members, production and insurance companies enlisted by movie studios; it contributes to the livelihoods of hairdressers, stylists, designers, makeup artists and handlers. When you\u2019re a star, you\u2019re not just famous. You\u2019re a giant, monetizable billboard. The more recognizable you are, the more stuff you get for free. \n  \n Unless you\u2019re Melissa McCarthy. \n  \n Awards season is the prime opportunity for designers to showcase their most decadent wares; this year\u2019s Oscar telecast had 43.7 million viewers. But two years ago, McCarthy couldn\u2019t find anyone to design an Oscar dress for her. \n  \n \u201cWhen I go shopping, most of the time I\u2019m disappointed,\u201d McCarthy said in the July issue of Redbook. \u201cTwo Oscars ago, I couldn\u2019t find anybody to do a dress for me. I asked five or six designers \u2014 very high-level ones who make lots of dresses for people \u2014 and they all said no.\u201d That year McCarthy wore a dress made by Marina Rinaldi, a ready-to-wear plus line you can find in stores such as Bloomingdale\u2019s or Saks. Bear in mind, with the Oscars in particular, most actresses are wearing borrowed dresses, shoes, and jewelry valued at more than most Americans\u2019 mortgages. \n  \n McCarthy, the much-loved breakout star of \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d won an Emmy in 2011 for her role on CBS\u2019s \u201cMike & Molly.\u201d Her work with director Paul Feig, including \u201cThe Heat,\u201d \u201cBridesmaids\u201d and the upcoming \u201cSpy\u201d have made her a favorite funny lady, particularly in feminist circles. In interviews, she seems down-to-earth, approachable, and well, normal. \n  \n  \n  \n Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy in \u201cThe Heat.\u201d (Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation) \n  \n And that\u2019s because she is. Despite her success and the wealth that comes with it, McCarthy faces the same problem of millions of plus-size American women: wanting a wardrobe that\u2019s stylish and fashion forward, and finding slim pickings, which is why she decided to develop her own plus-size clothing line. She collaborated with couture dress maker Daniella Pearl for the gown she wore to the 2011 Emmy Awards, and the two are releasing a line called Pearl. Before becoming an actress, McCarthy studied fashion design at Southern Illinois University. \n  \n \u201cTrying to find stuff that\u2019s still fashion-forward in my size is damn near impossible.\u201d McCarthy told the Hollywood Reporter in 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s either for like a 98-year-old woman or a 14-year-old hooker, and there is nothing in the middle.\u201d \n  \n  \n  \n Melissa McCarthy arrives at the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards in a dress she designed with Daniella Pearl. (AP Photo/Matt Sayles) \n  \n Sure, every once in a while you\u2019ll see a star walk a red carpet in Topshop, Asos, H&M or some other off-the-rack brand, but it\u2019s the exception, not the rule, and it\u2019s almost always as an official brand ambassador. In April, McCarthy sported a dress from Eloquii as she walked the red carpet at CinemaCon (Eloquii sells the sleeveless version for $118). Eloquii was a plus line by The Limited that fashion bloggers greeted with enthusiasm when it launched in 2011. It was discontinued last year, then reemerged this spring as an online-only store, completely free of its ties with The Limited.

(Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images for CinemaCon) \n  \n What McCarthy is talking about isn\u2019t just an inability to find designers who would craft dresses for her; it\u2019s about being hampered in your ability to communicate your personality through your style. Rihanna\u2019s ability to sport a range of looks, from boyish to grungy to chic, is the very reason she was honored with the CFDA\u2019s Icon Award. As Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour noted while praising the singer, \u201cThe point is to be audacious, even jaw-dropping or button-pushing \u2014 and yes, we know she enjoys pushing buttons \u2014 while remaining true to yourself.\u201d None of the dresses McCarthy has worn on red carpets since the 2012 Oscars have been nearly as frilly or fussy as the Rinaldi number, which resembled something commissioned for an opera diva. Sure, it fit, but it wasn\u2019t particularly youthful, and the 43-year-old McCarthy has shown an interest in looks that are modern and trendy. \n  \n It\u2019s not just McCarthy who found limited style options because she doesn\u2019t fit Hollywood\u2019s hegemonic beauty standards; a few years ago, Hendricks, who plays Joan Holloway on \u201cMad Men,\u201d had the same problem. \n  \n  \n  \n Christina Hendricks at the 67th Annual Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2014 in Cannes, France. (Photo by Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images) \n  \n In a 2010 interview with Glamour, she told the magazine: \u201cIt is difficult come awards season, and I need to find a gown to walk down the red carpet in, and there are only size zeros and size twos available.

Your task is to summarize them.", "input": "A chat about life's end over coffee and cake doesn't sound like everyone's cup of tea. But could it be a way to get people talking about a subject we can't escape and is often avoided? \n  \n I told about five people that I was going to something called a death cafe \u2013 the reactions were mixed, but none was particularly positive. \"Will it be full of goths?\", \"How morbid\", \"That's weird.\" The thing is that people don't just find talking about death uncomfortable \u2013 they find the idea of talking about death uncomfortable. In general, we just don't do it. \n  \n This is what inspired Jon Underwood to create the non-profit death cafe in 2011, based on the Swiss Cafe Mortel movement. As he saw it, western society has long outsourced discussions about death to doctors, nurses, priests and undertakers. The result, says Jon, is that we have lost control of one of the most significant events we ever have to face. \n  \n He suggested to various cafes in east London his idea of setting up a place to go and talk about death, but there were no takers. So the first death cafe in the UK was in Jon's own house in Hackney and was run by his mother, Sue Barsky Reid, a psychotherapist. \n  \n It was a great success and interest grew, leading to the events, which are usually about an hour long, popping up in a range of venues from cafes and private houses to a cemetery and a yurt. The premise was simple: people go along, drink tea, eat cake and discuss death: not to be morbid, just to raise awareness and to \"help people make the most of their (finite) lives\". \n  \n Jon and Sue went on to produce a guide to running your own death cafe, which was published in 2012. Since then, hundreds of people have been hosting them around the world. \n  \n I went along to an event in central Edinburgh at a bohemian cake shop called Lovecrumbs. I had no idea what to expect, so I met with one of the organisers beforehand, Katherine Newbigging, director of Just Festival, who brought along Rebecca Paterson, who works for Good Life Good Death Good Grief, a campaign that has been involved in hosting other death cafes in Scotland. \n  \n Katherine Newbigging greets visitors to the death cafe in Edinburgh. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian \n  \n I wanted to find out what brought people to the gatherings, which were undoubtedly popular: Katherine told me that the Lovecrumbs event that evening had a reserve list of guests as they were expecting to be full. \"People are just interested. It's something a bit different. There aren't many places where talking about death is OK. We want to provide that environment, and help lead the discussion.\" \n  \n Rebecca agrees. \"Talking about it can only be a good thing: not only does coming to terms with your own mortality mean you're more likely to live life to the full, being open about it means we can support each other, our families and ourselves when death has an impact on our lives. It makes for a healthier, happier community.\" \n  \n She paused, and for a second looks moved: \"I've heard of people saying that death can be a really special time. Imagine that \u2013 how differently we would all feel about it if that could be the case?\" \n  \n This struck a chord with me. My sister is a doctor who works in palliative care, and she has told me about talking to the families of frail, elderly patients with multiple illnesses. She tells family members that their loved one is going to die \u2013 they simply can't believe it and aren't equipped to deal with it, or even support the person involved. How have we got to the stage in our sanitised society where we can't bring ourselves to believe anyone is going to die? \n  \n It made me think that less than 100 years ago, death would have been all around us. People had big families because it was expected that some would die in infancy. Men went to war and never came back. Women died in childbirth. And not many people made it past middle age. Compare that with now: we all live so much longer, our lives sometimes prolonged by advances in medical care. The result is that we can now reach 35 or even 40 without ever having a relative die. Through what Underwood refers to as the \"outsourcing of death\", and through this lack of exposure to it, we have become ill-equipped to deal with it \u2013 and in denial of the one thing that affects us all. \n  \n At 6pm, Katherine hushes the assembled tea drinkers in Lovecrumbs and announces the start of the meeting. Customers who didn't know about the death cafe gulp back their tea and leave hastily, staring at us in concern and fascination. Menus are passed around: a list of questions for discussion, divided into starters, mains and tea & coffee. The questions, Katherine reassures us, are just conversation starters, and not to be stuck to rigidly. Between each course we will move around, to make sure everyone speaks to someone different. \n  \n I sit down next to a woman in her late 50s, Lesley. We scan the questions on our starters list: \"Cremation or burial?\", \"Nature taking its course or assisted suicide?\", \"Where would you like to be when you die?\" \n  \n For a second I feel daunted \u2013 these are certainly ice-breakers. But somehow, talking to someone you don't know about such things is a lot easier than starting a conversation about churchyards versus woodland burial with your husband when he gets in from work. \n  \n Lesley and I chat about the questions briefly before moving on to why she is here: \"I suppose I'm interested in how people who want to talk about it actually do talk about it. Is death taboo? I'm not sure it is. But sometimes I think that talking about dependency \u2013 being dependent on others as you reach the end of life \u2013 is taboo. It worries me that so many people these days have a problem with that. As a child, you're dependent, then you're independent, then you become dependent again. That's what happens. It's nothing to be ashamed of. If we talked more about the inevitable, at least it would be easier to plan.\" \n  \n The woman next to her nods enthusiastically at Lesley's words. \n  \n S o I leave them to finish their starters and sit down with Rae and Rachel, two young women, both with fresh grief etched on their faces, and looking slightly daunted. Death cafes don't offer bereavement support or counselling, but sometimes it could be that people who have experienced death suddenly feel the need to talk about it. That is why Rae and Rachel have come. \"We've lost someone close to us, unexpectedly,\" Rae explains. \"We're not here to talk about that though \u2013 we talk about it all the time anyway. It's more that, since it's happened, I've been more open. And I suppose it's OK to talk about dying in general to your friends, but to talk about me dying? They would think that was morbid.\" \n  \n When we get on to the mains, the questions are a bit lengthier \u2013 the ice-breaking is over, and it is time for some in-depth discussion, with starters-for-10 such as: \"What things do you think make for a good death?\" and \"What words do you want on your tombstone?\" The room is noisy with chatter at this point, to the extent that Katherine has trouble getting everyone's attention. There are no tears, serious voices or solemnity, just animated discussion. \n  \n Eventually Katherine bangs a teaspoon on a cup to tell us all it is time for the tea & coffee part of the menu, and we all swap tables again. There are only two questions: \"What song would you like at your funeral?\", and \"How would you like to be remembered?\". These positive themes are happily discussed at my table. I turn to the woman next to me, Rebecca, and asked what has brought her to the cafe. She tells me that she was a death doula, which fascinates me, as I've always felt that so much planning goes into the hugely significant event of giving birth, but very little into the event of dying. \n  \n \"I have a background in nursing, which gives me essential expertise, but a death doula is not a nurse,\" she says. \"It's a completely different approach, in that it's not allied to medicine or the medical 'narrative'. It's led by the individual themselves \u2013 the person who is dying. It's somewhat similar to the role of a birth doula.\" \n  \n For someone who works with death, surely the cafe was a busman's holiday? Not at all, says Rebecca. \"I wanted to see where other people were at in the discussion of death \u2013 it's very much part of my job so it's a lot easier for me to discuss, but I can't assume everyone else feels that way. I also wanted to find out what people felt about having someone there, other than family \u2013 someone like me, a death doula. What did I get from my discussions tonight? I feel as though people are keen to personalise their deaths \u2013 and their lives. And I'm glad.\" \n  \n The cafe winds down to a natural end after its official hour, but many linger, deep in conversation. I hail a cab and the chatty driver asks what I've been up to this evening. I hesitate, then tell him. And that was it, we are off, talking about death, to the point where even after we reach my house, we sit in the taxi for 20 minutes chatting before I go in. It seems that people really do want to talk about death. \n  \n \u2022 deathcafe.com ||||| Search in Movies \n  \n Theater Any 99 West Drive-In Academy Theater Avalon Theatre & Wunderland Bagdad Theater Century 16 Cedar Hills Century 16 Eastport Plaza Century Clackamas Town Center and XD Cinema 21 CineMagic Theatre Cinetopia Mill Plain 8 Clinton Street Theater Cornelius 9 Cinemas Edgefield Powerstation Theater Empirical Theatre at OMSI Fifth Avenue Cinema Forest Theatre Hollywood Theatre Indoor Twin Cinemas Kennedy School Theater Kiggins Theatre Lake Theater & Cafe Laurelhurst Theatre & Pub Living Room Theaters Milwaukie Cinema & Wunderland Mission Theater and Pub Moreland Theatre Mt.

In a car accident, in the year 2000. And just about everything I do in my world, in my life today, is a reflection of that.\u201d \n  \n \u201cA death caf\u00e9 provides a safe place for people to talk about anything and everything to do with death,\u201d said Toronto Death Caf\u00e9 organizer and life-cycle celebrant Linda Stuart. \u201cSometimes it can be easier to talk about a taboo topic in a room of strangers than with your own family.\u201d \n  \n I was curious too, so I called the expert before attending. \n  \n \u201cIs that where Toronto\u2019s goths meet?\u201d one person asked. \u201cDoes everyone dress in black and do morbid things?\u201d wondered another. \n  \n I attended a death caf\u00e9 this month. I tell people this because of their reactions. \n  \n I arrive at Mount Pleasant Cemetery at 6:30 p.m., ready to be ushered into a damp crypt where people talk about ghosts and spirits while drinking black coffee. \n  \n I was intrigued. Stuart said I could attend death caf\u00e9 on July 10, Toronto\u2019s sixth official meeting \u2014 but I would need to be an active participant. Fair enough. \n  \n I\u2019m directed upstairs to a bright, sunny room at the cemetery\u2019s visitation centre. Soothing music plays. Tables with crisp white linens are set up, one laden with the promised refreshments. \n  \n In the middle of each table is a place card. It outlines the death caf\u00e9 guidelines. Each table has a stack of death cards, to be used \u201cin case the conversation got stuck.\u201d \n  \n \u201cDo you believe in life after death?\u201d one reads. \u201cDeath is an illusion, true or false?\u201d asks another. This is going to be interesting. \n  \n Around 35 people of all ages attend this death caf\u00e9; young adults arrive on bicycles to sip coffee with silver-haired seniors at various tables. \n  \n Stuart organized Toronto\u2019s first death caf\u00e9 in June 2013. She offers a safe place to talk about death. She adheres to the principles of Jon Underwood, who founded the death caf\u00e9 model in England several years ago. \n  \n Death caf\u00e9s are free, and are also free of ideology, Stuart explains on death caf\u00e9 night. They are not intended to lead to conclusions about life, death or the afterlife\u2014 or to sell products or services. They are not bereavement or support group. \n  \n \u201cTalking about death can be difficult,\u201d says Stuart. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting tendency to think if we talk about it, it\u2019s going to happen. Well it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d \n  \n \u201cEver?\u201d shouts a man from the back of the room. Everyone laughs. \n  \n \u201cThis is a confidential space,\u201d Stuart continues. \u201cWhat happens at death caf\u00e9 stays at death caf\u00e9.\u201d She points to where I sat in the back of the room. I wave awkwardly. Everybody laughs again. \n  \n Then Stuart ceremoniously lights candles representing the past, present and future: \u201cWe light our past candle to honor those who came before us. Our present candle for all of us here, and our future candles for those who we have not yet met.\u201d \n  \n Toronto\u2019s death caf\u00e9 is officially underway. \n  \n We begin around our table, sharing why we came to death caf\u00e9. The room is humming. \n  \n Barbara Morris, psychotherapist and massage therapist, is a death caf\u00e9 regular. She has done end of life work with veterans for more than a decade at Sunnybrook Hospital. \n  \n \u201cI needed to think a lot about death myself, so I could think of how to best support the vets I work with,\u201d Morris says, sipping herbal tea. \u201cI try to be a steady person for them. But I absolutely cry when they die.\u201d \n  \n A golf club funeral? Why not? \n  \n Despite being a life-cycle celebrant, Stuart tells us that she and her elderly father never really talk about death. He recently asked her to do his funeral when the time comes. \n  \n \u201cHe wants to have it at the golf club,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI said, \u2018Dad, are they going to let us bring a body into the golf club?\u2019 The next day he went down to the club and talked to the general manager and told me, \u2018There, it\u2019s done. We can do it!\u2019 \u201d \n  \n Jake McArthur volunteers at a hospice, and has organized death caf\u00e9s in Caledon and Collingwood. Nearly an hour passes before he asks if he could tell the table a story. \n  \n \u201cMy daughter died when she was 23,\u201d McArthur says. \u201cIn a car accident, in the year 2000. And just about everything I do in my world, in my life today, is a reflection of that.\u201d \n  \n McArthur\u2019s voice wavers slightly; Morris squeezes his shoulder. \n  \n \u201cI said to myself, I\u2019m not wasting another minute of my days,\u201d McArthur says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend my life doing anything that isn\u2019t rewarding and meaningful to me.\u201d \n  \n There\u2019s a pause in the conversation. My tablemates are staring expectantly at me. \n  \n Deep breath. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about death since I heard of death caf\u00e9, I say. It isn\u2019t so much dying myself that scares me, but losing the people I love. \n  \n Morris says the thought of losing her children scares her the most. Others agree. \n  \n \u201cSo maybe it\u2019s the grief that scares us, more than the death,\u201d muses Stuart. She asks me: \u201cHave you lost anybody close to you?\u201d \n  \n I had anticipated this question. I was ready. Grandparents, I planned to say. Three grandparents. \n  \n 1,000 caf\u00e9s in 19 countries \n  \n I wasn\u2019t going to bring up my 17-year-old cousin, killed last summer when a drunk driver t-boned his car. But I do. Death doesn\u2019t seem so alien at the death caf\u00e9. \n  \n That\u2019s kind of the point, says death caf\u00e9 founder Jon Underwood. He was drawn to the topic through being a Buddhist, and wanted to create a place where people could safely discuss death. \n  \n \u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything particularly smart or clever,\u201d Underwood had told me on the phone from England. \u201cWe\u2019re just talking about death over tea and cake. It\u2019s very simple and straightforward.\u201d \n  \n And popular. There have been nearly 1,000 death caf\u00e9s held in 19 countries since Underwood began in September 2011. He says the growing popularity suggests a shift in how society views death. \n  \n \u201cIf we had launched 10 years ago we would have got nowhere,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father-in-law told me at the beginning that no one was going to want to sit around and talk about death. But it turns out that\u2019s not true.\u201d \n  \n It\u2019s not true in Toronto either. I linger after the death caf\u00e9 ends to talk. What had lured others here? \n  \n \u201cI\u2019m 85 years old and looking death in the face,\u201d says Stig Harvor, finishing a butter tart. \u201cIt\u2019s good to talk about it.\u201d \n  \n \u201cIn my social life nobody wants to talk about death,\u201d says Naomi D\u2019Souza, a palliative care social worker in her seventies. \u201cThey think it\u2019s morbid. So I came here. It\u2019s always fascinating.\u201d \n  \n I ambush two young women outside the washroom. They don\u2019t want to be named, but say they are regulars. \n  \n \u201cI grew up in a war zone and have lost people, but no one talks about death in my culture,\u201d says the dark-haired woman. \u201cIt\u2019s taboo. They also say that babies come from cabbages!\u201d \n  \n She laughs, reflecting on death. \u201cIt\u2019s important to talk about.\u201d \n  \n Her friend agrees, adding she had previously brought her mom. \u201cMy husband and I are paramedics, and I see death all the time. I need to have a position on death myself so I can better help people.\u201d \n  \n \u201cAre you coming back next time?\u201d the dark-haired woman asks me. \u201cHave we sucked you in yet? \n  \n It has been a good time; a surprisingly good time for an evening devoted to death. \n  \n \u201cI didn\u2019t think there would be so much laughing at a death caf\u00e9,\u201d I say to Stuart. \n  \n \u201cThere\u2019s always lots of laughter,\u201d she replies. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about death without talking about life.\u201d |||||", "output": "People around the world are meeting over tea and cakes to talk about death\u2014in surprisingly lighthearted ways. Created by a Swiss sociologist, so-called \"death cafes\" are designed to give people a positive atmosphere in which to discuss all matters surrounding human mortality, Prospect Magazine reports. The concept has taken off, too, with a death cafe website and more than 1,400 death cafes held in 26 countries over the past three years. \"Talking about [death] can only be a good thing,\" a British death-cafe host tells the Guardian. \"It makes for a healthier, happier community.\" In fun, even gleeful atmospheres, participants discuss issues like natural death vs assisted suicide, how we'd like to be remembered, and what happens to us when we die, San Diego CityBeat reports. The cafes are also arising as society changes, with fewer Westerners guided by religious beliefs and most of us likely to die alone as we lose our faculties; one in three will have dementia. \"We do need to address how to deal with that, both as a society and as individuals and families,\" says a sociologist. Participants also get to discuss taboo aspects of death, like the fact that many fear grief more than death, or believe that talking about death will make it happen, the Toronto Star reports. Death cafes are also venues for the elderly to discuss what it means to die: \"I\u2019m 85 years old and looking death in the face,\" says a Toronto participant as he eats a butter tart. \"It's good to talk about it.\" For once, notes San Diego CityBeat, death won't be \"a conversation stopper.\" (A recent study finds that if you feel younger than your age, you'll live longer.)", "category": "Summarization 417.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\".

It alleges that the following dry \u201ckibble\u201d dog foods are sickening and killing dogs: \n  \n Purina Beneful Healthy Weight \n  \n  \n  \n Purina Beneful Original \n  \n  \n  \n Purina Beneful Incredibites \n  \n  \n  \n Purina Beneful Healthy Growth for Puppies \n  \n  \n  \n Purina Beneful Healthy Smile \n  \n  \n  \n Purina Beneful Healthy Fiesta \n  \n  \n  \n Purina Beneful Healthy Radiance \n  \n  \n  \n Purina Beneful Playful Life \n  \n  \n  \n The suit claims the pet foods contain substances that are toxic to animals, including propylene glycol, an antifreeze component and known animal toxin that is poisonous to cats and dogs. \n  \n According to the lawsuit, Nestle knew or should have known that the Food and Drug Administration has prohibited propylene glycol from being used in cat foods. \n  \n The suit also claims the food contains mycotoxins, a group of toxins that are produced by fungus that occurs in grains. Mycotoxins are a significant health rish to dogs, the suit says. In the lawsuit, the plaintiff alleges that dangerous levels of mycotoxins have been found during testing conducted on Purina Beneful Original. \n  \n The consumer complaints show \u201cconsistent symptoms, including stomach and related internal bleeding, liver malfunction or failure, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, seizures, bloating, and kidney failure,\u201d the lawsuit claims. \n  \n In many cases, pet owners claimed their dogs showed symptoms prior to these diagnoses, including lethargy, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, weight loss, seizures and bloating. \n  \n The class action lawsuit invites pet owners who have fed their dogs and cats Beneful brands between 2011 and 2015 to join. It asks for a jury to hear the case and award $5 million in damages. \n  \n At this time, no recall has been issued. \n  \n Covington resident Lee Whalen fed her dog, Toby, Beneful from 2008 to 2012. \n  \n Whalen told WLWT News 5 Toby, a dachshund, started having health issues in April 2013. He was constantly dehydration and his kidneys failed. Toby died in May 2014. \n  \n \"He had a seizure in the living room, I picked him up and carried him outside and he died on my arms, it was awful but I was just glad to be there with him,\" Whalen said. \n  \n Whalen cannot prove she bought Beneful from 2008 to 2012 and doubts she will join the lawsuit, but felt compelled to share her story for other dogs and owners with the same experience. \n  \n \"There's no 100 percent proof that this is what happened this just makes me wonder, makes me think, 'What if I hadn't of bought Beneful?,\" Whalen said. \n  \n The suit claims Nestle and Purina were negligent and violated false advertising laws while selling pet foods. It includes nine testimonials from owners who claimed their pets were also sickened after eating tainted brands. \n  \n St. Louis-based Purina issued the following statement to WLWT News 5: \n  \n \"First and foremost, there are no quality issues with Beneful. Beneful is a high quality, nutritious food enjoyed by millions of dogs every day. Recently, a class action lawsuit was filed against Beneful in Northern California. We believe the lawsuit is baseless, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and our brand. Beneful had two previous class action suits filed in recent years with similar baseless allegations, and both were dismissed by the courts. Beneful is backed by Purina\u2019s strict quality controls and comprehensive food safety program. Like other pet foods, Beneful is occasionally the subject of social media-driven misinformation. Online postings often contain false, unsupported and misleading allegations that cause undue concern and confusion for our Beneful customers,\u201d a spokesperson said. \n  \n The Beneful Toxic Dog Food Class Action Lawsuit is Frank Lucido v.

A class action lawsuit was filed that blames the deaths of thousands of dogs on one of Purina\u2019s most popular brands of chow. \n  \n Googling Nestle Purina Petcare\u2019s Beneful brand will get you the pet food manufacturer\u2019s website, a Facebook page with over a million likes, and, in stark contrast, a Consumer Affairs page with 708 one-star ratings supported with page after grim page detailing dogs suffering slow, agonizing deaths from mysterious causes. \n  \n Internal bleeding. Diarrhea. Seizures. Liver malfunction. It reads like something from a horror movie or a plague documentary, but a suit brought in California federal court by plaintiff Frank Lucido alleges that this is all too real\u2014and too frequent to be a coincidence. \n  \n But it all relies upon finding a chemical that may be in the food\u2014and has been a staple in dog food recalls in the past\u2014with an experiment that neither Lucido, his lawyers, or even independent scientists have even begun to conduct. \n  \n Lucido said it began last month when his beloved German shepherd began losing an alarming amount of hair, smelled strange, and wound up at the vet with symptoms \u201cconsistent with poisoning.\u201d A week later, his wife found one of their other dogs, an English Bulldog, dead. An autopsy showed signs of internal bleeding in the stomach and lesions on the liver, symptoms eerily similar to the shepherd\u2019s, according to the complaint. Then their third dog also became ill. \n  \n \u201cAll these dogs are eating Beneful,\u201d explained Jeff Cereghino, one of the attorneys representing Lucido in the action. \u201cAnd the dogs are all, for a variety of reasons, not in the same house. So you take away the automatic assumption that the neighbor didn\u2019t like the dogs or whatever. He was feeding them Beneful at the start of this, and one got sick and died, the other two were very ill. And then he started doing a little research, and he realized the causal link, at least in his mind, was the food.\u201d \n  \n It doesn\u2019t take much digging to uncover what appears to be a pattern of allegations, Cereghino said. Lots and lots of allegations. After hearing Lucido\u2019s story, Cereghino checked it out for himself. \n  \n \u201cWe found a significant number of folks who were trying to draw exactly the same causal link. Thousands,\u201d he said. \n  \n The sheer volume is what made the seasoned lawyer\u2014one who said \u201ca good part of our business is class action work\u201d\u2014realize something may be fishy. \n  \n \u201cIf it\u2019s a hundred or so, it\u2019s like, \u2018Okay, a lot of dogs eat Beneful; things happen.\u2019 But when you start getting into the thousands\u2026 The long and short of it is the complaint pyramid is such that even with the Internet\u2013easy access to complain about things\u2013 there\u2019s still a very large percentage of folks who simply don\u2019t complain, or whose vet tells \u2018em, \u2018We don\u2019t know what happened,\u2019 and they\u2019re not drawing conclusions or leaping to assumptions, \u201c he said. \n  \n \u201cBut when I look at 4,000? Holy hell, there\u2019s a lot of people out here.\u201d \n  \n So Cereghino and his partners started talking to those people, comparing more and more of the stories of heartbreak. \n  \n Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

They\u2019re having liver problems, failures,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a vet, but you look at some of this stuff and say, \u2018OK, we\u2019re starting to have similar symptoms across the board, and we\u2019re starting to have causation.\u2019\u201d \n  \n When these dire accusations first started appearing online years ago, the initial accusation was that one of the additives in the food, propylene glycol, was the culprit. \n  \n Purina maintains the type of propylene it uses is perfectly safe for consumption, saying on its website: \u201cPropylene glycol is an FDA-approved food additive that\u2019s also in human foods like salad dressing and cake mix.\u201d \n  \n It\u2019s also the same substance that caused the spiced whiskey Fireball to be recalled in Europe, which found excessive amounts of the chemical, also used in antifreeze, in the cinnamon swill last fall. The tainted liquor was from the North American batch because, in the U.S., much higher volumes of antifreeze additives are OK for human\u2014or canine\u2014consumption. \n  \n \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. That is something that you don\u2019t want in dog food,\u201d noted veterinarian and author Karen \"Doc\" Halligan when reached by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s controversial. Why do you want to take a risk if there\u2019s any kind of chance that that could be bad for them?\u201d \n  \n But whether it\u2019s good for dogs or not, food grade propylene glycol has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It also hasn\u2019t been linked to toxicity, especially the type being alleged against Beneful. \n  \n Cereghino thinks there\u2019s another culprit in the mix, and he\u2019s named it in the lawsuit. They\u2019re called mycotoxins. \n  \n Translated directly from the Greek words for \u201cfungus poison,\u201d mycotoxins are, essentially, a toxic byproduct of mold. When it comes to ducking discovery, they\u2019re an especially crafty brand mold byproduct, and one found in all types of grains. In fact, a new study, released this month, indicates they\u2019re even pretty common in breakfast cereal. \n  \n Related: The Toxin Hiding in Your Cereal \n  \n If you read the ingredients label of Beneful, it sounds an awful lot like breakfast cereal: ground yellow corn, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, rice flour, soy flour. Sure, there\u2019s some \u201cchicken byproduct meal\u201d and \u201canimal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols,\u201d but the food is certainly more grain than meat. \n  \n \u201cIn the channels of trade, grain is quite a lot like hamburger these days. As in \u2018There\u2019s multiple cows in a hamburger,\u2019 if you will,\u201d explained Dr. Gregory M\u00f6ller, professor of environmental chemistry and toxicology at the University of Idaho and Washington State University joint School of Food Science. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed and blended commodity. So one farmer, one granary, or one mill, may have not stored their product well, which allowed for mold growth in storage.\u201d \n  \n Even if a scientist were to stumble upon a load of grain rife with mycotoxins, M\u00f6ller added, he or she could test it and still miss them. \n  \n \u201cYou can go into a sample that is known contaminated,\u201d M\u00f6ller noted. \u201cBut the particular sub sample you pull may not have enough on it to actually see. There is that challenge.\u201d \n  \n This can be exacerbated when the host grain is earmarked for non-human use. \n  \n \u201cCommodities that are targeted towards pet foods are managed a little bit differently, in terms of the regulatory criteria they have to pass,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is a very large industry. There is attention and concern about quality, but there is a difference in how the concern is managed.\u201d \n  \n In layman\u2019s terms? \n  \n \u201cI think what\u2019s put forth here is a plausible scenario,\u201d M\u00f6ller said. \n  \n When asked about the alleged symptoms described in the class action suit and online, especially the repeated liver failure, Halligan was clear in her potential diagnosis, especially as it pertained to animals of a variety of ages. \n  \n \u201cToxins would be real high on my list. If an animal ingests some type of toxin, that can lead to liver disease because the liver has to process it,\u201d said Halligan. \n  \n But there have not yet been any tests to determine if mycotoxins are in Beneful at all\u2014or any other dog food, for that matter. \n  \n Cereghino said he\u2019s determined to find that out. \n  \n \u201cAs soon as we are able to, and the federal courts move at a fairly rapid rate, we will get discovery,\u201d said Cereghino. \n  \n That\u2019s when Cereghino will get to find out where Beneful\u2019s products come from, how they\u2019re stored, whether there\u2019s a \u201cconnecting piece in the storage or the grain, the sourcing of it all, that sort of make sense.\u201d He plans on running tests on the food both he and other members of the class action suit have saved to send over to a lab in the next few weeks. \n  \n That\u2019s when they\u2019ll know if those potentially dangerous chemicals are in the formula. And, if they are, they\u2019ll still have to fight to prove that the mycotoxins are dangerous enough to make thousands of dogs sick. \n  \n As for Purina, when approached for comment, Keith Schopp, vice president of corporate public relations, read this statement to The Daily Beast: \n  \n \u201cWe believe the lawsuit is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves. Beneful is a high-quality nutritious food enjoyed by millions of dogs each year and there are no product quality issues with Beneful.\u201d ||||| Lawsuit claims Purina Beneful dog food is killing pets Posted: Tuesday, February 24, 2015 10:08 PM EST Updated: Tuesday, March 3, 2015 10:10 PM EST \n  \n There is a warning out about a popular dog food brand. Thousands of people across the country say their dogs became sick or even died after eating Purina Beneful dry dog food. \n  \n There is a warning out about a popular dog food brand. Thousands of people across the country say their dogs became sick or even died after eating Purina Beneful dry dog food. \n  \n The Morgan and Morgan law firm out of Tampa, FL is filing a multi-state class action lawsuit saying Purina Beneful dog food is making pets sick and even causing death. The firm says more than 3,000 people have complained, saying they incurred extensive veterinary bills to have their dogs tested and treated for illnesses. \n  \n The suit says pet owners reported their dogs were diagnosed with things like bladder stones, internal bleeding and liver and kidney failure after eating the food. Pet owners claimed, prior to the diagnosis, their dogs had lethargy, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, weight loss, seizures and bloating. \n  \n Here is the specific list of Beneful dry kibble listed in the lawsuit: \n  \n -Purina Beneful Health Weight \n  \n -Purina Beneful Original \n  \n -Purina Beneful Incredibites \n  \n -Purina Beneful Healthy Growth for Puppies \n  \n -Purina Beneful Healthy Smile \n  \n -Purina Beneful Healthy Fiesta \n  \n -Purina Beneful Healthy Radiance \n  \n -Purina Beneful Playful Life \n  \n The lawsuit claims one of the food's ingredients, propylene glycol, is causing dogs to get sick. The suit says propylene glycol is a known animal toxin and the maker of Purina Beneful should have known that. \n  \n Dr. Brett Boatsman, a veterinarian and Neel Veterinary Hospital on N. MacArthur, says propylene glycol is not dangerous at all. \n  \n \"It's one of the safest drugs, preservatives that's been proven by the FDA. So I think it's going to be difficult for them to prove that that did that,\" Dr. Boatsman said. \n  \n Dr. Boatsman says propylene glycol is found in many human and animal products as a preservative. He says the compound is a known toxin to cats, but it has not been proven dangerous for dogs. He's all for holding pet food companies accountable for mistakes, but in this case, he does not see a mistake by Purina. \n  \n \"You have to prove that specific bag of dog food, or bags of dog food, resulted in those dog's illnesses and that's very difficult to prove,\" he said. Dr. Boatsman said if you currently feed your dog Purina Beneful and have not had any problems, there's no reason to throw it out. He says, if dogs eat something that isn't good for them, they usually exhibit symptoms within the first few hours. \n  \n Nestle, the company that makes Purina Beneful, has not issued a recall of the food. |||||", "output": "A class-action lawsuit claims that the popular Beneful brand of dog food from Nestle Purina is killing dogs, reports the Top Class Actions blog. Plaintiff Frank Lucido alleges that one of his three dogs died and two others became seriously ill because of the dry \"kibble\" food, which the lawsuit blames on unsafe levels of propylene glycol and mycotoxins; the Daily Beast explains the latter are essentially a \"toxic byproduct of mold.\" The former is an FDA-approved additive, and a vet tells KTUL that while it's dangerous for cats, it hasn't been proven to be a danger for dogs. Purina also insists it's safe and is used in \"human foods like salad dressing and cake mix.\u201d One of Lucido's attorneys says the suit has become a class-action one because of similar complaints that have been piling up over the years. Legal Newsline reports the suit references at least 3,000 online complaints of dogs becoming sick or dying. Internal bleeding, liver malfunction, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss are among the \"consistent symptoms\" mentioned, per the suit (which names these 8 kinds of Beneful). \"If it's a hundred or so, it\u2019s like, 'OK, a lot of dogs eat Beneful; things happen,'\" says lawyer Jeff Cereghino. \"But when I look at 4,000? Holy hell, there\u2019s a lot of people out here.\" He tells the DB that he hopes to get court permission soon to dig into Beneful's ingredients and conduct the necessary tests. \"As soon as we are able to, and the federal courts move at a fairly rapid rate, we will get discovery,\" he says. Purina maintains that the suit is \"without merit\" and that the food is \"enjoyed by millions of dogs each year\" without problems.

Or as I put it on the eve of another Republican Party sweep, politics determines who has the power, not who has the truth. Still, it\u2019s not often that a party that is so wrong about so much does as well as Republicans did on Tuesday. \n  \n I\u2019ll talk in a bit about some of the reasons that may have happened. But it\u2019s important, first, to point out that the midterm results are no reason to think better of the Republican position on major issues. I suspect that some pundits will shade their analysis to reflect the new balance of power \u2014 for example, by once again pretending that Representative Paul Ryan\u2019s budget proposals are good-faith attempts to put America\u2019s fiscal house in order, rather than exercises in deception and double-talk. But Republican policy proposals deserve more critical scrutiny, not less, now that the party has more ability to impose its agenda. \n  \n So now is a good time to remember just how wrong the new rulers of Congress have been about, well, everything. \n  \n First, there\u2019s economic policy. According to conservative dogma, which denounces any regulation of the sacred pursuit of profit, the financial crisis of 2008 \u2014 brought on by runaway financial institutions \u2014 shouldn\u2019t have been possible. But Republicans chose not to rethink their views even slightly. They invented an imaginary history in which the government was somehow responsible for the irresponsibility of private lenders, while fighting any and all policies that might limit the damage. In 2009, when an ailing economy desperately needed aid, John Boehner, soon to become the speaker of the House, declared: \u201cIt\u2019s time for government to tighten their belts.\u201d \n  \n So here we are, with years of experience to examine, and the lessons of that experience couldn\u2019t be clearer. Predictions that deficit spending would lead to soaring interest rates, that easy money would lead to runaway inflation and debase the dollar, have been wrong again and again. Governments that did what Mr. Boehner urged, slashing spending in the face of depressed economies, have presided over Depression-level economic slumps. And the attempts of Republican governors to prove that cutting taxes on the wealthy is a magic growth elixir have failed with flying colors. \n  \n In short, the story of conservative economics these past six years and more has been one of intellectual debacle \u2014 made worse by the striking inability of many on the right to admit error under any circumstances. \n  \n Then there\u2019s health reform, where Republicans were very clear about what was supposed to happen: minimal enrollments, more people losing insurance than gaining it, soaring costs. Reality, so far, has begged to differ, delivering above-predicted sign-ups, a sharp drop in the number of Americans without health insurance, premiums well below expectations, and a sharp slowdown in overall health spending. \n  \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n And we shouldn\u2019t forget the most important wrongness of all, on climate change. As late as 2008, some Republicans were willing to admit that the problem is real, and even advocate serious policies to limit emissions \u2014 Senator John McCain proposed a cap-and-trade system similar to Democratic proposals. But these days the party is dominated by climate denialists, and to some extent by conspiracy theorists who insist that the whole issue is a hoax concocted by a cabal of left-wing scientists. Now these people will be in a position to block action for years to come, quite possibly pushing us past the point of no return. \n  \n But if Republicans have been so completely wrong about everything, why did voters give them such a big victory? \n  \n Part of the answer is that leading Republicans managed to mask their true positions. Perhaps most notably, Senator Mitch McConnell, the incoming majority leader, managed to convey the completely false impression that Kentucky could retain its impressive gains in health coverage even if Obamacare were repealed. \n  \n But the biggest secret of the Republican triumph surely lies in the discovery that obstructionism bordering on sabotage is a winning political strategy. From Day 1 of the Obama administration, Mr. McConnell and his colleagues have done everything they could to undermine effective policy, in particular blocking every effort to do the obvious thing \u2014 boost infrastructure spending \u2014 in a time of low interest rates and high unemployment. \n  \n This was, it turned out, bad for America but good for Republicans. Most voters don\u2019t know much about policy details, nor do they understand the legislative process. So all they saw was that the man in the White House wasn\u2019t delivering prosperity \u2014 and they punished his party. \n  \n Will things change now that the G.O.P. can\u2019t so easily evade responsibility? I guess we\u2019ll find out. ||||| Memo to the GOP. You had a great night on Tuesday. But remember: You didn\u2019t win it. The Democrats lost it. \n  \n This is not to say that you didn\u2019t show discipline in making the election a referendum on six years of Barack Obama. You exercised adult supervision over the choice of candidates. You didn\u2019t allow yourself to go down the byways of gender and other identity politics. \n  \n Charles Krauthammer writes a weekly political column that runs on Fridays. View Archive \n  \n It showed: a gain of probably nine Senate seats, the largest Republican House majority in more than 80 years, and astonishing gubernatorial victories, including Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois, the bluest of the blue, giving lie to the Democrats\u2019 excuse that they lost because the game was played on Republican turf. \n  \n The defeat \u2014 \u201ca massacre,\u201d the Economist called it \u2014 marks the final collapse of Obamaism, a species of left liberalism so intrusive, so incompetently executed and ultimately so unpopular that it will be seen as a parenthesis in American political history. Notwithstanding Obama\u2019s awkward denials at his next-day news conference, he himself defined the election when he insisted just last month that \u201cthese [i.e. his] policies are on the ballot \u2014 every single one of them.\u201d \n  \n They were, and America spoke. But it was a negative judgment, not an endorsement of the GOP. The prize for winning is nothing but the opportunity for Republicans to show that they can govern \u2014 the opportunity to seize the national agenda. \n  \n Five weeks ago, I suggested a series of initiatives that would be like the 1994 \u201cContract with America\u201d but this time post facto. It\u2019s not rocket science. Mitch McConnell, the incoming Senate majority leader, and Speaker John Boehner are already at work producing such an agenda. \n  \n It needs to be urgent, determined and relentless. Say, a bill a week for the first 10 weeks. Start with obvious measures with significant Democratic support, like the Keystone XL pipeline. \n  \n Like fast-track trade negotiation authority that Harry Reid killed and that Obama, like all presidents, wants. Republicans should propose and pass it, thereby giving Obama a victory and demonstrating both bipartisanship and magnanimity (as well as economic good sense). \n  \n Then a simple, targeted bill to repatriate the $2 trillion of assets being held by U.S. corporations overseas, a bill to authorize and expedite the export of liquid natural gas and crude oil (the latter banned by an obsolete 1975 law) and a strong border security bill. \n  \n As for Obamacare, a symbolic abolition that Obama will immediately veto is less important than multiple rapid-fire measures to kill it with a thousand cuts. Repeal of the medical device tax. Repeal of the individual mandate. Repeal of the employer mandate. Repeal of the coverage mandate, thereby reinstating Obama\u2019s broken promise that \u201cIf you like your health-care plan, you can keep it.\u201d And repeal the federal bailout for insurers on the Obamacare exchanges. \n  \n If Obama issues vetoes, fine. Let the Democrats defend them for the next two years. \n  \n Then go big and go positive: a sweeping reform of the tax system, both corporate and individual, abolishing loopholes and lowering rates, like the historic Reagan-O\u2019Neill 1986 reform or Obama\u2019s own abandoned Simpson-Bowles commission. And go large: Invite the other side into immediate negotiations with the aim of producing a tax bill by spring. \n  \n The GOP gained control of the Senate Tuesday night, taking hold of the legislative agenda in that chamber. Here are three of the policies Republicans are likely to tackle as they take the reins in January 2015. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post) \n  \n How will Obama react? My guess \u2014 with the petulance and denial he displayed in his post-election news conference. Moreover, he will try to regain control of the national agenda with executive amnesty for illegal immigrants. \n  \n Final memo to the GOP: That would be naked impeachment bait. Don\u2019t take it. Use the power of the purse to defund it. Pledge immediate repeal if Republicans take the White House in 2017. Denounce it as both unconstitutional and bad policy. But don\u2019t let it overwhelm and overtake the GOP agenda. That\u2019s exactly what Obama wants. It is his only way to regain the initiative. \n  \n The 2014 election has given the GOP the rare opportunity to retroactively redeem its brand. The conventional perception, incessantly repeated by Democrats and the media, is that Washington dysfunction is the work of the Party of No. Expose the real agent of do-nothing. Show that, when Harry Reid can no longer consign House-passed legislation to oblivion, Congress can actually work. \n  \n Pass legislation. When Obama signs, you\u2019ve shown seriousness and the ability to govern. When he vetoes, you\u2019ve clarified the differences between party philosophies and prepared the ground for 2016. \n  \n Tuesday\u2019s victory was big.

You could call it \"Three Beheadings and No Funeral,\" but even that doesn't give an accurate idea of what you're in for. \n  \n The film is ably directed by the veteran Ridley Scott and features a high-powered cast headed by Michael Fassbender, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt, none of whom seem to realize that the gem they are so assiduously polishing is pure cubic zirconia and not the real thing. \n  \n That's because everyone here is the prisoner of \"The Counselor's\" clumsy puppet master, screenwriter Cormac McCarthy. Yes, that Cormac McCarthy, who's apparently been eager to write directly for the screen for some time but should have stifled the impulse. \n  \n PHOTOS: Billion-dollar movie club \n  \n For though he's a Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winner and has had several of his novels \u2014 including \"No Country for Old Men,\" \"The Road\" and \"All the Pretty Horses\" \u2014 made into films, McCarthy has not done himself or his reputation any favors with this original. \n  \n This terminally bleak story of a lawyer (Fassbender) who gets in way over his head when he becomes part of a multimillion-dollar drug deal with a Mexican cartel is so entranced with its pseudo-mythic qualities that we never learn what the attorney's name is: Everyone just calls him \"counselor.\" \n  \n A key difficulty is that this plot is so predetermined there is little point in seeing it through to the end. Both the counselor and his girlfriend, Laura (Cruz), are so bleakly fated from frame one to have the most awful things happen to them they might as well have \"helpless victims\" written on their sleeves. \n  \n Another problem is that McCarthy's famously enigmatic dialogue turns out to work better on the page than on the screen. Hearing lines such as \"truth has no temperature\" and \"grief transcends value\" spoken by flesh-and-blood individuals makes the words sound hollow, stilted and theatrical. \n  \n PHOTOS: Hollywood backlot moments \n  \n Unfortunately, McCarthy's words are at their weakest in the film's opening scene in an El Paso bedroom, where the counselor and Laura are discovered under the sheets in the middle of a marathon session of l'amour. The dialogue between them is frank, adult and so unconvincing that it's an embarrassment the film never recovers from. \n  \n After a trip to Amsterdam to buy a diamond for an engagement ring, the counselor looks up Reiner (Bardem), a nightclub owner with a passion for Versace shirts and unspecified connections to the drug trade. It's not completely clear why the counselor wants into the business, but he is not easy to dissuade. \n  \n Met next is the equally enigmatic Westray, played by Pitt and beautifully costumed by director Scott's longtime designer, Janty Yates, to look like a hipster version of Hank Williams. Westray has connections to the cartel and the same flat, oracular way of speaking as everyone else. He too tries to talk the counselor out of his chosen path, but this guy is too cocky to listen to anyone. \n  \n While all these men think they are slick operators, it soon becomes apparent that the blackest, most conniving heart in the group belongs to Reiner's girlfriend, Malkina, played with convincingly frigid nastiness by Diaz. \n  \n PHOTOS: Celebrities by The Times \n  \n The owner of two pet cheetahs and enamored enough of the animal's prowess in killing to have its markings tattooed on her back, Malkina is such a creature of pure evil she scares a priest out of his confession booth and in general makes Cruella de Vil seem as harmless as Mary Poppins. \n  \n While all these people are trading bleak and inscrutable McCarthyisms, an ancient septic tank truck is making its way to the United States from Mexico. Except it's not really a septic tank truck; its insides contain the drug shipment that the counselor has his heart set on. \n  \n The movements of this truck may not sound very exciting, but you will find yourself longing for its presence because it replaces the toxic characters whose escapades end in misery, pain and, yes, no fewer than three beheadings. The milk of human kindness does not flow through \"The Counselor's\" veins, not even close. \n  \n kenneth.turan@latimes.com \n  \n --------------------------- \n  \n 'The Counselor' \n  \n MPAA rating: R for graphic violence, some grisly images, strong sexual content and language \n  \n Running time: 1 hour, 57 minutes \n  \n Playing: In general release ||||| Considering the deep bench of A-list talent involved, Ridley Scott's new Southwestern noir, The Counselor, is a jaw-dropping misfire. The dialogue is laughably pretentious, the plotting is virtually nonexistent, and the performances are so broad and cartoony that you keep wondering if it's all some sort of prank. \n  \n Reteaming with Ridley Scott after the disappointing Prometheus, Michael Fassbender stars as a smooth, naive lawyer operating in the moral grey zone along the border between Texas and Mexico. It's a godforsaken land where drugs are cheap and life is cheaper. After years defending crooked clients there, Fassbender's ''Counselor'' finds all of the easy money too tempting to resist. So he sells his soul and saddles up with a ring of flashy bad guys for a big drug-smuggling score. There's Javier Bardem as Reiner, a spiky haired playboy who looks like he picked his wardrobe from a Siegfried and Roy yard sale; Brad Pitt as Westray, a charismatically mysterious stringy-haired hood who speaks in cryptic riddles; and Cameron Diaz as Malkina, a sex-crazed harpy covered in tattooed spots to match her pet cheetahs. (This is the film's subtle idea of character development.) For all of her man-eating efforts in the film, Diaz is punished with one of the most wince-inducing scenes in years \u0097 a spread-eagle masturbation spectacle performed on the hood of Bardem's yellow Ferrari that I'd say has to be seen to be believed. But I wouldn't want to encourage anyone to cough up ten bucks to sit through it. \n  \n If the film's posse of ethically shady villains seems right out of a bad Cormac McCarthy novel, that's because it more or less is. The Counselor is the celebrated bard of the borderland's first feature-film screenplay. And as Fassbender's drug deal goes sour, putting his fianc\u00e9e (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) in harm's way, he's forced to listen to a lot of poorly-sketched characters wander on screen and deliver stilted metaphorical speeches about greed and the evil that men do. All of this may have seemed fine and dandy on the page. But I suspect that McCarthy is about to find out the hard way that writing novels and writing screenplays are two very different things. In No Country For Old Men, the Coen brothers wisely stripped the author's doomed tough-guy dialogue and injected it with a stiff dose of harrowing naturalism. But operating on his own here, McCarthy's unchecked macho arias leave you sitting there slack-jawed, wondering if he has any idea how people talk in real life. \n  \n Scott doesn't do him any favors either. The director surrounds the garishly painted characters in excessive dollops of glitzy opulence, hammer-to-the-skull symbolism, and sex scenes that are as embarrassing as they are unerotic \u0097 the film's paranoid view of women comes off as downright Neanderthal. I suppose the only good thing than can be said of a movie as bad as The Counselor is that its existence is a reminder of just how right Hollywood usually gets it. Big honking bombs as bad as this one are like solar eclipses. Rare and not be looked at directly.

Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the main sponsor of the regulatory bill, put forward an amendment hoping to broker a compromise over a controversial provision that would force the biggest Wall Street banks to spin off their lucrative derivatives business. \n  \n Under Mr. Dodd\u2019s proposal the new restrictions on derivatives trading would be delayed for two years until after they have been studied by a council of federal regulators. The council would probably kill the provision, and Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, the author of the rules, said that she would fight efforts to weaken them. \n  \n Mrs. Lincoln, who was home in Arkansas on Tuesday battling for her career in a tough primary race, issued a statement saying she would not back down. \n  \n \u201cI\u2019m proud of the support my provision has received both inside and outside the Senate and will defend it should there be a debate on the Senate floor,\u201d Mrs. Lincoln said. \n  \n The remarks by Republican leaders on Tuesday suggested they saw no benefit in joining with the Democrats even to impose tougher rules on Wall Street. At a news conference, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, blamed the White House. \n  \n \u201cThe marching orders are coming from downtown: push the bill as far to the political left as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the last 15 months. They\u2019re running banks, insurance companies, car companies, taking over the student loan business, taking over health care, now, apparently doing to the financial services industry what they did to the health care industry.\u201d \n  \n \u201cThis is a massive government overreach,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, adding that Republicans were confident about their political prospects. \u201cThe American people are saying, \u2018enough\u2019 and I think that\u2019s why everyone is anticipating a major midcourse correction this November.\u201d \n  \n The majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, countered by accusing Republicans of doing the bidding of big banks. \n  \n \u201cWe have a strong bill to crack down on Wall Street gamblers, end too big to fail and protect consumers,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cRepublicans have made it clear that they have no interest in accountability or fairness.\u201d \n  \n Mr. Reid said the Republicans had tried \u201ctime and time again, to weaken these Wall Street reforms, and shield those big banker friends that they have. The Senate rejected those efforts.\u201d \n  \n But given the deep public anger over the 2008 financial collapse, at least a handful of Republicans who are up for re-election are expected to support the legislation. And some Republican aides said party leaders might still support the bill, if they win additional concessions before a final vote, perhaps Thursday. \n  \n With the race on to complete the bill, lawmakers battled furiously to get votes on their amendments. \n  \n Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, clashed with his fellow Democrats to get a vote on an amendment to outlaw so-called naked credit default swaps, by which investors buy insurance on bonds they do not own. \n  \n Mr. Dorgan, who is retiring after this year, criticized lawmakers in both parties for trying to block a vote on his plan, which he said would curb risky behavior by financial companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a purely speculative gamble,\u201d Mr. Dorgan said. \u201cThere\u2019s not one social or economic benefit.\u201d \n  \n He added, \u201cThere\u2019s about $10.9 trillion in credit default swaps held by commercial banks. Those are institutions, by the way, whose deposits are insured by us, by the American taxpayer.\u201d His amendment was defeated, 57 to 38. \n  \n In other floor action, the Senate, by a vote of 80 to 18, approved an amendment that would ease proposed restrictions on the federal government\u2019s ability to prevent states from adopting and enforcing their own, tougher standards on federally-regulated banks. \n  \n The amendment, sponsored by Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, relaxed some of the proposed restrictions on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\u2019s ability to override state banking laws. The overall intent of the broader bill, however, is to make it tougher for the federal government to do so. \n  \n While approving the measure, the Senate rejected, by a vote of 55 to 43, a more sweeping proposal by Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, that would have restricted state attorneys general from enforcing rules to be issued by a new federal consumer financial protection bureau. \n  \n With primary elections being held in several states on Tuesday, Republican Senate leaders seemed intent to portray Democrats as growing the federal government. \n  \n \u201cIncreasingly, the majority seems to be doing what they did on health care now to Main Street,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the No. 3 Republican. \u201cIt looks like another Washington takeover.\u201d \n  \n Sewell Chan contributed reporting. \n  \n Go to Article from The New York Times \u00bb ||||| Senate Republicans blocked Democrats from voting on three amendments Tuesday that are strongly opposed by Wall Street. \n  \n Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the top-ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, rose to object to a vote on one of the most talked-about amendments, cosponsored by Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). Levin-Merkley would ban commercial banks from trading for their own benefit with taxpayer-backed money. \n  \n Shelby also objected to an amendment from Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) that would rein in predatory practices of payday lenders and one from Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) that would have banned naked credit default swaps, which were at the heart of the financial crisis. Dorgan's amendment was expected to fail, but Levin-Merkley had been surging in recent days. [UPDATE: The floor chaos continued late into the night.] \n  \n When it looked as if Levin-Merkley had at least 50 votes, the threshold was moved up to 60. Now that it appears within striking distance of 60 votes, the new tactic is to deny it a vote altogether. \n  \n Negotiations around Levin-Merkley have been going on throughout the day, with Levin and Merkley working out details of the bill with holdouts. But without an opportunity for a vote on the floor, those successful negotiations add up to little. \n  \n \"Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is yet again doing the bidding of Wall Street and is blocking the Merkley-Levin amendment that will ban high-risk trading inside the lending and depository institutions from coming up for a vote today,\" said a statement from Merkley's office after the blockade. \"They won't even allow a vote with a 60 vote threshold. On a day two Democrats are missing from the chamber. Wall Street lobbyists, and consequently Senator McConnell and the Republicans, want to kill the Merkley-Levin amendment by attrition because they're afraid of losing a vote.

By using part or all of the insignia of the Marines, Air Force, Navy, Army, and the US Special Operations Command on its website, Facebook, and Twitter pages, the super-PAC has run afoul of military regulations, according to representatives of the US Marine Corps and Air Force who spoke to Mother Jones. \n  \n According to the Department of Defense, each service branch\u2019s symbols are trademarked, and their commercial and political use is tracked closely by military officials to prevent any appearance of the military\u2019s endorsing a partisan or for-profit cause. The officials said they will be contacting the group and asking them to stop using the insignia or face potential legal action. \n  \n \u201cThey don\u2019t have permission to use the Marine Corps eagle, globe, and anchor in promotion of their service,\u201d said Jessica O\u2019Haver, director of the Marine Corps\u2019 trademark licensing program, after inspecting the super-PAC\u2019s website and checking her database. \u201cWe can\u2019t appear to endorse them\u2026We don\u2019t currently license nonprofits and charities, especially if they\u2019re promoting a political cause.\u201d O\u2019Haver added that since the super-PAC\u2019s website includes marks from the other services, she\u2019ll be contacting the DOD\u2019s Trademark Office so that it can notify the PAC about its unauthorized use of the material. \n  \n \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing the same thing,\u201d Staff Sgt. Jarrod Chavana, a representative of the Air Force\u2019s Trademark and Licensing Program, said regarding the group. \u201cIt\u2019s against military regulations for people to use [the Air Force logo] for political purposes.\u201d \n  \n Officially launched this week, the anti-Obama super-PAC is led by Ryan Zinke, a retired Navy SEAL and conservative state senator from Montana. \u201cIt is time to take back America,\u201d the group\u2019s site exhorts would-be donors. \u201cYour support of Special Operations for America (\u201cSOFA\u201d) is vital to the success of our mission: Advocating for the election of Mitt Romney and like-minded candidates\u2026who believe in permanent and enduring American Exceptionalism.\u201d \n  \n Part of that mission is firing away at President Obama for allegedly spiking the bin Laden football. \u201cNavy SEAL\u2019s, Special Operations Personnel and Veteran\u2019s across America have been outraged since Barack Obama conveniently took credit for killing Osama Bin Laden for political gain,\u201d writes Zinke. The headline on the press release announcing the group on Wednesday trumpeted Zinke as \u201cFormer Commander at SEAL TEAM SIX.\u201d That seems a bit misleading: The unit, now known as DEVGRU, hasn\u2019t officially been called SEAL Team Six since 1987, and Zinke once led subordinate units, not the entire SEAL Team. \n  \n The group\u2019s tactics are nothing new: They\u2019ve partnered with the soft-money group Veterans for a Strong America and its leader, South Dakota political operative Joel Arends, who deployed a web ad back in May that blasted Obama for taking \u201cso much credit for killing Bin Laden.\u201d But \u201cSpecial Operations for America\u201d has now gone a step farther by wrapping itself in the US military\u2019s official symbols. \n  \n Mother Jones emailed SOFA for comment, but the group didn\u2019t respond by publication time. What will happen once they are notified that they can\u2019t use the military logos? Such organizations tend to respond in one of two ways, according to O\u2019Haver. Most take the trademarked material down and offer apologies. \u201cSometimes, though, we get a cheeky letter back,\u201d she says. \u201cI forward them to our legal department.\u201d \n  \n Correction: The story originally identified the group as a PAC rather than a super-PAC. ||||| A new super PAC that includes retired special operations personnel and other veterans announced plans Wednesday to raise money to run ads in swing states against President Obama. \n  \n The group, Special Operations for America, filed paperwork Monday with the Federal Election Commission. It is headed by retired Navy SEAL Commander Ryan Zinke. During his 23-year career, Zinke spent time in the Navy's elite SEAL Team 6, the same team that killed Osama bin Laden in a commando raid last year. \n  \n Zinke said he and other members of the special operations community are outraged that SEAL Team 6 was identified as the commando unit that carried out the raid, saying it put its members and their families at risk. Zinke said he believes the president has politicized his role as commander in chief to win re-election. \n  \n \"Who was it at risk?\" he said. \"Was it the president? Or was it the young SEAL with the wife and kid at home? That's the arrogance.\" \n  \n Zinke, a Republican state senator from Montana, said the group also objects to deep military cuts and increases in health care costs to veterans. While he agreed there's room for cuts in military spending, he said the $1.1 trillion in cuts over 10 years that could start at the end of the year are too deep. \n  \n Officials with the group claim membership is in the \"hundreds\" and growing, although there is no way to confirm the number. And while spokesman Scott Hommel said the group is in negotiations with donors and is aiming for a budget of $10 million, records indicate it currently has assets of only $60. \n  \n Whatever money the organization eventually raises, Hommel said, would be used to air ads in swing states targeted on veterans issues. \n  \n Rob Diamond, the national veterans and military families vote director for the Obama campaign, said the president \"has their backs\" when it comes to veterans and military families, and the president's record is a \"stark contrast\" to Mitt Romney's. He said Romney has refused to outline plans for veterans, has suggested that health services provided by Veterans Affairs be privatized and has failed to put forth a specific jobs proposal to get veterans back to work. \n  \n \"Even worse, his reckless and na\u00efve statements about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan show that he would prefer our servicemen and women remain overseas, indefinitely fighting in wars he has no strategy to lead and no plan to end,\" Diamond said in a statement. \n  \n But Benjamin Smith, who spent six years as a SEAL, said he is upset by the level of detail that emerged about the bin Laden operation. Special operations personnel have a mystique that depends on secrecy, he said, and details about the use of stealth helicopters and other information that leaked about the operation run counter to the way they conduct themselves. \n  \n \"That right there to any operator is blasphemy,\" said Smith, 36, of Wilmington, N.C. \"It's insulting. It made me sick to my stomach.\" \n  \n Not all members of the new super PAC are veterans, Zinke said. Members are \"people who have been successful on the battlefield or in business.\" Its board includes former Republican Sen. Conrad Burns of Montana and former Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons, and it has ties to the conservative groups Stand Up for America and Veterans for a Strong America. \n  \n \"It's a good group of guys, and they're going to come out swinging,\" said Joel Arends, an Iraq Army veteran and chairman of Veterans for a Strong America. \n  \n But Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics said there's debate over how much influence these types of groups have in presidential elections. \n  \n Sabato thinks macro issues drive presidential elections, issues such as the economy, war and peace and scandals. In this election, the campaigns for Obama and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney have been competently run so far, he said. \n  \n Still, polls generally give Romney an edge with veterans, he said, and such groups can have an effect on the margins. But they aren't the deciding forces. \n  \n \"I don't think it will be one of the things we'll cite after the election's over,\" he said. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

High winds and possible tornadoes struck Minneapolis and other parts of Minnesota, leaving at least one person dead and injuring nearly two dozen others, police said. \n  \n Witness: \"Lots of overturned trees\" | Hospital damaged \n  \n  \n  \n Authorities in Joplin were contending with multiple reports of people trapped, as well as significant structural damage to St. John's Regional Medical Center, which was hit directly by the tornado, city officials said. CNN affiliate KSHB said there were reports of fires throughout the hospital. \n  \n One facade of the building made of glass was completely blown out, and authorities were evacuating the medical center, said Ray Foreman, a meteorologist with KODE in Joplin. Makeshift triage centers were being set up in tents outside, witness Bethany Scutti said. \n  \n Missouri governor: \"Total devastation\" \n  \n Residents 70 miles away from Joplin in Dade County, Missouri, were finding X-rays from St. John's in their driveways, said Foreman, indicating the size and power of the twister. \n  \n Parts of the city were unrecognizable, according to Steve Polley, a storm chaser from Kansas City, Missouri, who described the damage as \"complete devastation.\" \n  \n The tornado, which touched down just before 6 p.m. CDT, cut a path of destruction through the heart of the city, hitting heavily populated areas, Foreman said. \n  \n \"We've had numerous vehicles picked up and thrown into houses,\" he said. \n  \n iReport: Are you there? Please send photos, videos \n  \n At least seven overturned tractor-trailers were seen on one stretch of Interstate 44 west of the city, said Michael Ratliff, who has been chasing storms for eight years. Ratliff said the possible tornado was \"rain wrapped,\" making it impossible to see as it tore what he estimated to be a half-mile to three-quarter-mile path of damage. \n  \n Officials did not know how many were injured. Witnesses reported seeing some of the wounded being ferried to hospitals in the backs of pickup trucks as first responders struggled to handle the overwhelming destruction. \n  \n Lynn Ostot, the spokeswoman for the city of Joplin, confirmed \"some fatalities,\" but did not have an exact number. \n  \n The Joplin mayor has declared a local disaster, and the Missouri National Guard was activated by Gov. Jay Nixon. \n  \n \"These storms have caused extensive damage across Missouri, and they continue to pose significant risk to lives and property,\" Nixon said in a statement. \"As a state, we are deploying every agency and resource available to keep Missouri families safe, search for the missing, provide emergency medical care, and begin to recover.\" \n  \n Deadly tornado hits Kansas | Storm footage \n  \n  \n  \n Elsewhere, tornadoes were spotted in Forest Lake, north of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and near Harmony, more than 120 miles to the south. And in Minneapolis, witnesses reported numerous downed trees and neighborhoods without power. \n  \n Minneapolis police spokeswoman Sara Dietrich said the storm left one fatality, with 22 people reported hurt. One hospital, North Memorial Medical Center, said it had treated 18 people for minor injuries. \n  \n LeDale Davis, who lives on the north side of Minneapolis, told CNN, \"This is the first time we can remember a tornado touched down in this area. They aren't usually in the heart of the city.\" \n  \n In Anoka County, north of the city, sheriff's dispatcher Linda Hamilton said authorities were receiving reports of roofs blown off, trees down and gas leaks. Hamilton said the worst damage appeared to have been in Fridley, on the northern outskirts of the metro area. \n  \n Curby Rogers said warning sirens sounded near her northwest Minneapolis home Sunday afternoon. Shortly afterward, the light rain that had been falling was whipped into sheets by heavy wind, and power went out. \n  \n \"We could hear doors busting open through the house,\" Rogers said. \"There was a lot of commotion, and then it was silent.\" \n  \n When she and a visiting friend emerged from their house, the streets were blocked by debris and a tree had fallen on her car. Around the corner, the damage was \"a million times worse,\" with some houses split in half. \n  \n CNN meteorologist Chad Myers warned that the storms were not over for the Midwest. \n  \n \"You need to have that NOAA radio on tonight everywhere from Wisconsin to Texas and Oklahoma,\" he said. \n  \n Forecasters said the system that struck Minnesota was separate from another storm that struck eastern Kansas on Saturday, killing one person and damaging or destroying hundreds of homes there. \n  \n CNN's Greg Morrison, Divina Mims, Anna Gonzalez, Stephanie Gallman, Joe Sutton, Jessica Jordan, Ross Levitt, Sarah Aarthun, Don Lemon and Sean Morris contributed to this report. ||||| The death toll from the monster tornado that ripped through Joplin, Mo., has soared to 116, making it the deadliest single tornado in nearly 60 years, according to federal records. \n  \n And, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told The Associated Press of the death toll, \"Clearly, it's on its way up.\" \n  \n The lethal Joplin twister has also made 2011 the deadliest year for tornadoes since 1953, with 454 deaths in 1,000 tornadoes so far, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \n  \n NOAA began keeping records of tornado fatalities in 1950. Before Sunday's storm, the deadliest tornado hit Flint, Mich., on June 8, 1953, also killing 116 people, although independent record keepers have recorded higher death counts in earlier years. \n  \n This past April also set a record as the deadliest month on record with 361 tornado related deaths, according to NOAA's records. \n  \n The Joplin tornado was rated as an EF-4, the second-strongest classification with winds ranging between 166 and 200 mph. The nearly mile-wide funnel touched down at 5:41 p.m. CT Sunday and blasted a six mile wide path through the city and left trapped survivors crying out for help this morning. \n  \n Rescuers shifted through rubble today looking for survivors as high winds and hail continues to plague the area. \n  \n Want to help? Here is a list of organizations. \n  \n As of approximately nightfall Monday, 17 people had been pulled alive from the wreckage, Gov. Nixon said. \n  \n In fact, the storm and its aftermath included amazing stories of survival. \n  \n One man was saved by rescuers after texting his friend his location and the words, \"I'm alive.\" \n  \n \"You see pictures of World War II, the devastation and all that with the bombing. That's really what it looked like,\" Kerry Sachetta, the principal of Joplin High School, which was mangled by the tornado. \"I couldn't even make out the side of the building. It was total devastation in my view. I just couldn't believe what I saw.\" \n  \n Nixon declared a state of emergency Sunday evening and activated the Missouri National Guard in response to the destruction. \n  \n Four people were killed at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Joplin when it took a direct hit from the tornado. Patients and staff have been evacuated as damage suffered during the storm has affected the structural integrity of the building. Every window in the facility was blown out and the top two floors were blown off, ABC News affiliate KMBC reported. \n  \n Hospital spokeswoman Cora Scott told the station that 183 patients were in the hospital at the time and the facility only had five minutes warning that the tornado would strike. More than 100 patients have since been evacuated to other hospitals, Scott said. \n  \n Seven people have been reported dead at a nursing home, according to police reports. \n  \n Kelley Fritz, a 45-year-old resident of Joplin, went out with her family after the storm to survey the damage. \"My sons had deceased children in their arms when they came back,\" said Fritz. \"My husband and I went out and saw two or three dead bodies on the ground.\" \n  \n Authorities estimate 25 to 30 percent of Joplin has been damaged by the tornado, with highly populated areas having been hit by the storm. \n  \n Cries could be heard early this morning from people trapped below the wreckage, while crews have been pulling out bodies and lining them up in the streets for loved ones to identify, according to ABC News affiliate KODE. \n  \n Search and rescue efforts are being hampered by continuing severe weather today, including 40 mph gusts and hail. Strong winds can topple the cranes used to lift wreckage, although current wind speeds are still allowing their use. \n  \n More severe weather, including high winds, rain and hail, is expected Tuesday before the storms finally abate later in the week, according to Accuweather meteorologist Mark Paquette. \n  \n There is also a fear of gas explosions in the storm's aftermath and authorities are telling people not to light any cigarettes because so many gas pipes are broken, causing concern that what's left of Joplin might go up in flames, KODE reported. \n  \n \"These storms have caused extensive damage across Missouri, and they continue to pose significant risk to lives and property,\" Gov. Nixon said. \"As a state, we are deploying every agency and resource available to keep Missouri families safe, search for the missing, provide emergency medical care, and begin to recover.\" \n  \n State and local law enforcement agencies, including fire mutual aid, are coordinating search and rescue and recovery operations. The Missouri State Highway Patrol sent troopers from other regions to help local officers in southern Missouri deal with the destruction, the governor's office said in a statement. \n  \n Keith Stammer, emergency management director for the city of Joplin, told \"Good Morning America\" that all 25 of the city's sirens did activate, and that there was a 20-minute notice from when the sirens were activated before there was a first report of a tornado strike. \n  \n \"At the moment its surreal, our landmarks are gone -- road signs, places where you know to turn -- we're doing search and rescue, going house to house on that six mile strip,\" Stammer told \"GMA.\" \n  \n Jeff Piotrowsky, a storm chaser who was in Joplin at the time the storm hit and spoke to \"GMA\" about witnessing the tornado form over the city, said, \"We saw a big cloud mass and we knew it was going to start tornadoing. It quickly brewed to a half mile wide, then three-quarters ? then it came to the heart of the city,\" Piotrowsky said, adding that \"there was a warning, about 17 minutes.\" \n  \n Federal Emergency Management Agency Region VII set up a response coordination center and sent a liaison team to the Missouri state emergency communications center, according to a FEMA official. \n  \n \"Basically it's an all-out effort to get all of the most important resources available for this type of situation down as soon as possible,\" a state emergency management representative said. \n  \n In total, 70 tornadoes were produced by the storm system since Friday, including at least 47 tornadoes Sunday. Tornadoes were reported in seven states from the Canadian border to Oklahoma. Warnings and watches were posted from Texas to Michigan. \n  \n President Obama released a statement on the emergency late Sunday night, saying, \"Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives in the tornadoes and severe weather that struck Joplin, Missouri as well as communities across the Midwest today. We commend the heroic efforts by those who have responded and who are working to help their friends and neighbors at this very difficult time,\" Obama said in the statement. \n  \n \"At my direction, FEMA is working with the affected areas' state and local officials to support response and recovery efforts, and the federal government stands ready to help our fellow Americans as needed,\" he added. \n  \n The President is sending FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate to Missouri to ensure that the state has all the support it needs. Today, FEMA Deputy Administrator Rich Serino will also travel to Joplin to survey the destruction in the town and meet with state and local officials. \n  \n Earlier Sunday, tornadoes had torn across other parts of the region, killing at least one person in Minneapolis. |||||", "output": "The latest savage slash of US tornadoes ripped up the Midwest last night, flattening the town of Joplin, Missouri.

The trip is the first official engagement for Harry and the American actress since they announced earlier this week that they would wed. They plan to tour Britain in the next six months to give Markle an opportunity to learn about the country before their wedding at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The couple traveled to the east Midlands in England to visit a youth project and to raise AIDS awareness. It is Prince Harry's third visit to Nottingham since October last year. The prince has long championed AIDS charities, following in the footsteps of Princess Diana, reports the AP. The BBC reports that a rep for the couple has confirmed that Markle will cease the work she's been doing related to gender with the UN and will start new charity work, with a rep for the prince saying her focus would be on the UK. \"This is the country that's going to be her home now and that means travelling around, getting to know the towns and cities and smaller communities,\" he said.

You can watch the nominations here on Thursday morning, as Mindy Kaling and Carson Daly are slated to announce them at 5:40 a.m. Pacific time. \n  \n This year, the drama and comedy series races could have a new twist. Thanks to an abundance of apparently award-worthy television, the TV academy decided to expand those two categories to up to seven nominees each. Even so, some popular shows are sure to be left out. \n  \n In the comedy series race, \"Modern Family\" -- which has dominated during its four-year Emmy run -- will probably face off against a new, formidable challenger in Netflix's \"Orange Is the New Black.\" But the field could also include any number of shows such as \"Louie,\" \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Veep,\" \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\" \"Girls,\" \"Parks and Recreation\" and \"Silicon Valley.\" \n  \n Emmys live: 'Game of Thrones' dominates with 19 nominations \n  \n For drama series, it's a similar story. \"Breaking Bad\" won the Emmy in this category last year, and it is a favorite to gain a nomination and even a repeat victory for its final season. Still, there are plenty of other would-be contenders in \"True Detective\" (positioned, notably, as a drama series and not as a miniseries), \"Game of Thrones,\" \"The Good Wife,\" \"The Americans,\" \"House of Cards,\" \"Masters of Sex,\" \"Mad Men\" and \"Downton Abbey.\" \n  \n As if those races weren't crowded enough, perhaps the Emmy Awards' deepest category is lead actress in a drama. To start, there's Tatiana Maslany (\"Orphan Black\"), repeat winner Claire Danes (\"Homeland\") and past nominees Robin Wright (\"House of Cards\"), Kerry Washington (\"Scandal\"), Julianna Margulies (\"The Good Wife\") and Elisabeth Moss (\"Mad Men\"). The contenders could also include Lizzy Caplan (\"Masters of Sex\"), Michelle Dockery (\"Downton Abbey\") and Keri Russell (\"The Americans\"). \n  \n After three years in which TV movies and miniseries were lumped together in one group, the television academy believes there's enough programming to again warrant a separation. In the miniseries category, that means FX's \"Fargo\" and \"American Horror Story\" could vie against each other, alongside potential nominees \"The Hollow Crown,\" \"Luther\" and \"The White Queen.\" \n  \n HBO will look to continue its recent dominance in TV movies, with \"The Normal Heart\" a virtual lock for a nomination and most likely victory at the awards. Other nominees could include \"The Trip to Bountiful,\" \"Sherlock: His Last Vow,\" \"Return to Zero,\" \"Killing Kennedy,\" \"Burton and Taylor\" and \"Clear History.\" \n  \n Of course, it's all just speculation until the nominations are handed out Thursday -- and then, the real speculation will start as to who walks away a winner on Aug. 25, when Seth Meyers hosts the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards.

It joins the likes of Macy's, which will welcome shoppers at 5 p.m., an hour earlier than last year. \n  \n J.C. Penney will also kick off its holiday shopping event on Thanksgiving Day, at 3 p.m. \u2014 before many have had a chance to digest their turkey. \n  \n Those announcements came just weeks after major mall operator CBL & Associates said it would keep 73 of its centers closed on the holiday. Its properties opened for the first time on Thanksgiving in 2013. \n  \n The Mall of America, which first opened its retail shops on Thanksgiving in 2012, is also staying closed this year, although tenants have the choice to stay open. \n  \n Anchor stores like Macy's, which have their own exterior entrance, also have the option to stay open at CBL's malls. \n  \n While many consumers bemoan early store openings, others are showing up. \n  \n Data from NPD Group's Checkout Tracking, which scans customer receipts from in-store and online purchases, found the share of Black Friday shoppers who started on Thanksgiving fell 3 points last year, to 57 percent. Yet the number of people who shopped only on Thanksgiving edged slightly higher, to 18 percent, as people were less likely to shop both Thursday and Black Friday. \n  \n That means a store that wasn't open Thanksgiving Day may have lost sales to one that was. (To be sure, the number of shoppers who only purchased something on Black Friday also rose, to nearly 43 percent.) \n  \n And in many cases, consumers are shopping from their living rooms. A separate survey by PwC found 22 percent of shoppers plan to go to a physical store on Thanksgiving, while a greater chunk of the 2,100-plus respondents, 31 percent, said they'll go online \n  \n To cater to these digital shoppers, Kohl's for the first time will launch its Black Friday doorbuster deals online. Those deals also go live at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. ||||| Update \u2013 Please see our Stores Closed On Thanksgiving Day 2018 list. \n  \n While certain retailers are going to open even earlier on Thanksgiving this year, other stores are taking the day off entirely. Even more surprising, some stores will close their doors on Black Friday, opting to allow their employees and customers to enjoy the holiday weekend with their friends and families. \n  \n Towards the end of September, we were the first website to report that GameStop, Home Depot, Lowes, Costco, BJ\u2019s, Nordstrom, Jo-Ann, and Patagonia would be closed on Thanksgiving.

This means 1,300 employees will likely have the day off, but that could change if any of the over 500 individual stores decides to remain open. Certain mall employees \u2014 maintenance and security workers \u2014 will have to work if enough individual stores within the mall open their doors. \n  \n What Stores Are Are Open On Thanksgiving? \n  \n Because of the massive profit potential, the biggest stores like Walmart, Target, Kohl\u2019s, Macy\u2019s and Sears will likely open their doors on Thanksgiving. Please see our complete post featuring a list of Stores Open for Thanksgiving 2016. \n  \n Why Are Stores Closing On Thanksgiving? \n  \n While the motives of large stores and corporations may be questionable at times, we truly believe retailers are closing for the right reasons on Thanksgiving. In speaking to nearly 50 retailers, the general consensus seems to be so their \u201cemployees and customers can enjoy Thanksgiving with their friends and families.\u201d \n  \n For stores that plan to open on Thanksgiving, we do believe that they value and appreciate their employees and customers. Different stores have different strategies, and it is important and sometimes essential for certain retailers to be open as often as possible, and that includes Thanksgiving for many of them. \n  \n What About Online Thanksgiving Sales? \n  \n Even though a large number of stores will be closed on Thanksgiving, many of them will have online sales. Since more doorbusters than even are now available online, you may even be able to enjoy the same savings by shopping online on Thanksgiving as opposed to going to a traditional brick and mortar location. \n  \n Thanksgiving Blue Laws for Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine \n  \n Due to some pretty old laws \u2014 known as Blue Laws \u2014 a few states are required by law to close all of their stores on holidays. The current list of states includes Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine. That means that stores that are open nationally on Thanksgiving, such as Walmart, will be closed on Thanksgiving in those three states. While every store will be closed on Thanksgiving in those states, many of them could open at 12 a.m. on Black Friday morning. \n  \n What About Non-Store Employees? \n  \n While all of the stores listed above will close their retail locations on Thanksgiving, some non-store employees will be working. This may include online customer service workers and call center associates. Only Nordstrom has informed us that non-store employees will be working, but this could be true for other stores on the list. \n  \n Further Reading \n  \n If you found this post useful, here are a few other related articles and pages that may provide an expanded outlook. \n  \n \u2013 Mall Of America To Close On Thanksgiving Day 2016 \n  \n \u2013 BJ\u2019s Officially Announces They Will Be Closed On Thanksgiving 2016 And Open At 7 A.M.

(Photo: PAUL J. RICHARDS, AFP/Getty Images) \n  \n One of the nation's leading toy superstore chains is planning a post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon that may force rivals to rethink their holiday plans. \n  \n Shoppers will be able to head straight from the Thanksgiving dinner table to Toys R Us where it will unlock its doors at 5 p.m. and keep them open for 30 hours straight. \n  \n The toy retailer says that once stores open, most of its stores won\u2019t close until 11 p.m. on Black Friday. The move shows that while a small group of malls and retailers are staying shut, citing concerns about employee morale and diluted sales, the trend to kick off the holiday shopping frenzy right after the Thanksgiving dishes are cleared is not fading away. \n  \n \u201cOur customers have voted at the doors year after year, and they continue to want the option to get an early start on their holiday shopping lists,\u201d Joe Venezia, executive vice president, global store operations, for Toys R Us, said in a statement. \n  \n Black Friday was traditionally the day reserved for so-called \"doorbuster\" specials, deep discounts on popular items designed to build store traffic early in the day. But Walmart has been flinging the doors open on Thanksgiving since 1988, and in recent years, a growing number of retailers have followed suit. \n  \n This year, Macy's, will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, an hour earlier than it did in 2015. And Kohl\u2019s will open on the holiday at 6 pm. \n  \n Still, there has been some backlash. BestBlackFriday.com, which highlights bargains, found in a recent poll that 54.6% of those surveyed didn\u2019t like or strongly disliked retailers being open on Thanksgiving, and 60.2% said that they would not shop on that day. And according to RetailNext, an analytic solutions provider, in store Thanksgiving Day net sales last year were down 7% from 2014, while traffic slipped 0.7%. \n  \n Some malls and retailers are now choosing to stay shut, partly to give their employees the holiday off -- and sow some good will with shoppers who have soured on the practice -- but also because Thanksgiving had started to steal some of Black Friday\u2019s thunder, with no bump in overall sales to show for it. \n  \n Electronics and appliance chain hhgregg began opening on Thanksgiving in 2012, but this year it will be giving employees at its 220 stores the holiday off. The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. says that it will close on Thanksgiving. and CBL & Associates Properties Inc. is shuttering 72 of its 89 malls after being open on the holiday the last three years. However, some stores in those centers, as well as in the Mall of America, can make their own decisions about whether or not to open. \n  \n Contributing: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel \n  \n EMBAR \n  \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f8apJ6 ||||| The battle has been on for some time. Which retailers will open on Thanksgiving, and which will give their workers the holiday off and gamble they can do very well on Black Friday? Toys \u201cR\u201d Us wants to top the list of \u201cwe\u2019re open on Thanksgiving\u201d retailers. So it will be open 30 hours straight. \n  \n The troubled toy retailer announced: \n  \n Shoppers should get their walking shoes ready. Right on the heels of the company\u2019s Great Big Toys\u201dR\u201dUs Book of Awesome catalog, which offers hundreds of deals valid through November 19, Toys\u201dR\u201dUs\u00ae today announced it has begun preparations for Thanksgiving Weekend. Its stores nationwide will open at 5pm (local time) on Thursday, November 24 and remain open through 11pm on Friday, November 25 for 30 hours of continuous shopping*. Readying the stores to offer doorbuster savings on the season\u2019s must-have toys, Toys\u201dR\u201dUs has hired thousands of helpful elves to begin stocking the shelves. \n  \n Those who want to wander the hours for the entire time may resemble the winners of the 1920s dance marathons: groggy, but still moving. \n  \n There was a time, not long ago, when the future of the retailer was in doubt. This holiday season will prove whether financiers who reinforced its balance sheet were right. Otherwise, they risk part or all of their investment. According to The Wall Street Journal: \n  \n Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. is getting some needed relief on much of its $850 million debt load coming due in the next two years, alleviating investor concerns about its ability to meet its next deadlines for repaying debt. Under a refinancing agreement announced Tuesday (June 13), holders of bonds maturing in 2017 and 2018 will swap their holdings for new debt that will mature in 2021 and be secured by a newly formed entity. \n  \n Why? \n  \n Chief Executive David Brandon said the refinancing will free up the company to focus on improving its store operations and developing its online business, where it is in the midst of bringing the operations in house. The toy retailer is focusing on trying to shore up its in stock levels and is testing using parts of its stores for events, like birthday parties. \n  \n A 30-hour marathon may help. ||||| Brian Rich has been waging a five-year battle to protest retailers that open on Thanksgiving. He says some stores are finally listening. \n  \n When Toys R Us said it would open on Thanksgiving in 2011, Rich started a page on Facebook opposing it, dubbing it Boycott Black Thursday. It got scant attention. \"I had 47 'likes' the first year,\" he recalls. \n  \n Now his page has more than 145,000 likes. And the image he posted that says \"I'm NOT shopping on Thanksgiving Day!\" has been shared 65,000 times in the last 72 hours. \n  \n And some stores are indeed dropping Thanksgiving hours. \n  \n The Mall of America, the nation's largest, is shutting its operations and allowing its tenants to close that day. \n  \n Mall operator CBL & Associates Properties (CBL) says it's closing 72 malls on Thanksgiving that were open last year to allow \"employees, retailers, and shoppers to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with their families.\" \n  \n \"After evaluating feedback from our mall employees and retail partners as well as input from our shoppers, we determined that this was the best decision for our properties,\" said CBL CEO Stephen Lebovitz. \n  \n Office Depot (ODP) and RadioShack were both open last year but will closed for the holiday this year, while Staples (SPLS) will remain dark for the second year in a row. \n  \n \"Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and Target (TGT) probably won't close on Thanksgiving anytime soon, but this movement is clearly having an impact,\" Rich said. \n  \n Related: Mall of America will be closed on Thanksgiving (sorta) \n  \n He adds that the Boycott Black Thursday movement is also making it easier for stores like Costco (COST), REI, Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) that have remained closed in recent years to \"stick with that decision.\" \n  \n Some of his group's supporters aren't just refusing to shop on Thanksgiving, they are boycotting stores open on the holiday for the rest of the shopping season. \n  \n \"We had one woman who posted on the site that she made it through May of last year before she went into Walmart again because of her own personal boycott,\" he said. |||||", "output": "Black Friday has in recent years received a black mark as retailers took criticism for slowly pushing back the mega-shopping event until it actually started on Thanksgiving Day.

Our job is to do the best content we can and let people enjoy it in whatever way they want. The world is heading in that direction.\u201d ||||| Hot on the heels of HBO announcing a standalone streaming option, CBS just debuted its own subscription streaming service... and it is possibly the worst streaming TV deal out there. \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n CBS is offering access to the current seasons of 15 primetime shows, full past seasons of 8 popular shows, some seasons of \"CBS Classics\" like CSI: Miami, access to live events, and the ability to stream Big Brother 24/7. \n  \n This is such a bad deal in so many ways. Unlike HBO, you don't need a subscription to CBS, so you'd be paying for content you could get for free anyways. Football is not included in the live events. You can watch some of these programs on Amazon Prime and Netflix, and even if you can't, it some cases it still makes more sense to access them another way. Say you love The Good Wife but aren't that into other CBS programming (like me). It's cheaper to just buy a season pass on iTunes for $45 than it is to shuck out $72 a year for this streaming service and try really hard to care about NCIS. \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n And while the CBS Classics options don't have ads, the current shows do, meaning you'll have to sit through the same stuff you'd see on TV. \n  \n Sorry, DiNozzo, but there are very few people who this deal will appeal to, and most of them are my grandma. \n  \n The most interesting thing about this service isn't what it is offering, but what it could mean for Showtime, which is owned by CBS. This may be a test balloon to see how the company handles streaming. And Showtime would actually make sense to offer as a standalone streaming service, since it requires a subscription that costs an additional fee on your cable bill. We have to pay for shows like Homeland no matter what device we watch Carrie Matheson ugly-cry on, so paying for a streaming option would be a logical alternative to paying for the channel through cable. |||||", "output": "Yesterday, HBO announced it's launching a stand-alone Web streaming service.

One of the first questions Gates tackled is whether technology is making us all dumber. (The unsurprising answer? No.): \n  \n Technology is not making people less intelligent. If you just look at the complexity people like in Entertainment you can see a big change over my lifetime. Technology is letting people get their questions answered better so they stay more curious. \n  \n It turns out that Gates is a Breaking Bad fan. Well, duh. \n  \n 2. You know what does make Bill Gates feel stupid? Not being able to speak a foreign language. \n  \n I took Latin and Greek in High School and got A\u2019s and I guess it helps my vocabulary but I wish I knew French or Arabic or Chinese. I keep hoping to get time to study one of these \u2014 probably French because it is the easiest. I did Duolingo for awhile but didn\u2019t keep it up. Mark Zuckerberg amazingly learned Mandarin and did a Q&A with Chinese students \u2014 incredible. \n  \n We\u2019re pretty sure that just made Zuck\u2019s day. \n  \n 3. Here\u2019s what Mr. Bill thinks technology will look like 30 years from now: \n  \n There will be more progress in the next 30 years than ever. Even in the next 10, problems like vision and speech understanding and translation will be very good. Mechanical robot tasks like picking fruit or moving a hospital patient will be solved. Once computers/robots get to a level of capability where seeing and moving is easy for them then they will be used very extensively. \n  \n One project I am working on with Microsoft is the Personal Agent which will remember everything and help you go back and find things and help you pick what things to pay attention to. The idea that you have to find applications and pick them and they each are trying to tell you what is new is just not the efficient model \u2014 the agent will help solve this. It will work across all your devices. \n  \n 4. Gates also weighed in on the new holographic glasses his former company unveiled last week: \n  \n The HoloLens is pretty amazing. Microsoft has put a lot into the chips and the software. It is the start of virtual reality. Making the device so you don\u2019t get dizzy or nauseous is really hard \u2014 the speed of the alignment has to be super super fast. It will take a few years of software applications being built to realize the full promise of this. \n  \n hololens More \n  \n (Microsoft) \n  \n He did not offer an opinion as to whether this device finally makes Microsoft \u2018cool\u2019, however. \n  \n 5. The single greatest thing that has improved life in poor countries? Vaccines, says Gates. \n  \n Being able to grow up healthy is the most basic thing. So many kids get infectious diseases and don\u2019t develop mentally and physically. I was in Berlin yesterday helping raise $7.5B for vaccines for kids in poor countries. We barely made it but we did which is so exciting to me! \n  \n Read More ||||| Hi Reddit, I\u2019m Bill Gates and I\u2019m back for my third AMA.

(Short answer: Just like drinking any other kind of water, except that people get a little freaked out by the whole idea.) \n  \n I hope you\u2019ll take a few minutes to look at the annual letter that Melinda and I just published (gatesletter.com).

The Senate couldn't even agree on holding a vote on Thursday night, adjourning after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spurned Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's request to hold a vote and, assuming it failed, restart bipartisan negotiations on immigration and government spending levels. \n  \n Story Continued Below \n  \n Senators said they expected a vote on Friday, but had little idea what would come next. \n  \n \"These are hard issues, there's a lot of disagreement.

John Thune (R-S.D.)., the No. 3 GOP leader. \n  \n The uncertainty came just hours after House Republicans put weeks of internal squabbling behind them and secured votes for a spending plan to keep the government open for another four weeks. The vote was 230-197, with 11 Republicans in opposition and six Democrats crossing the aisle to back it. \n  \n The Senate voted to open debate on the bill late Thursday, but the plan's prospects in the Senate are dicey at best, with no apparent hope of winning the required 60 votes to break a filibuster. Some GOP lawmakers said they intend to vote against it, arguing that repeated short-term funding measures harm the military. And a sizable bloc of Democrats have also come out in opposition because it does not address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants at threat of being deported. \n  \n The end game appears to be either a much shorter extension of government funding and rapid negotiations \u2014 or a shutdown and finger-pointing. \n  \n \"I'm not going to vote for 30 days more of chaos,\" said Sen.

He said the House's bill reauthorizing a children's health insurance program and keeping the government's lights on should be an \"easy yes vote for any senator.\" \n  \n \"My Democratic colleagues' demand on illegal immigration at the behest of their far-left base have crowded out all other important business,\" McConnell said. \"I think the American people clearly would not expect us to act this way.\" \n  \n Schumer shot back: \"The leader is looking to deflect blame. But it just won't work. We all know what the problem is. It's complete disarray on the Republican side.\" \n  \n The two party leaders spent much of Thursday evening bickering on the Senate floor. \n  \n Federal funding runs out at midnight Friday. If there is no spending plan in place by then, the federal government will begin to shut down non-essential operations \u2014 a crisis that both parties and the White House say the desperately want to avoid. \n  \n Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called on Senate Democrats to drop their opposition to the funding proposal, which would keep federal agencies open through Feb. 16. House Republicans also added tens of billions of dollars of funding for a popular children's health program in a bid to win more support. \n  \n \u201cSen. Schumer, do not shut down the federal government,\" Ryan told reporters after the House vote. \u201cIt is risky, it is reckless and it is wrong.\u201d \n  \n Ryan added: \u201cThe only people standing in the way of keeping the government open are Senate Democrats. Whether there is a government shutdown or not is entirely up to them.\u201d \n  \n In order to win Thursday's vote, Ryan struck a deal with Freedom Caucus conservatives shortly before a scheduled floor vote on a spending provision. The agreement, which promised the group a separate vote on military funding, is expected to yield enough votes to secure passage of the spending bill in the House. \n  \n The deal came together after Freedom Caucus members circumvented leadership and took their demands to President Donald Trump. A lingering disagreement between Ryan and conservatives had threatened to blow up the spending deal in the lower chamber \u2014 and undercut the GOP strategy of blaming Democrats for any shutdown. \n  \n Numerous Democratic senators emerged from a lively party lunch Thursday in opposition to the GOP plan. \n  \n \u201cI am convinced that between Republicans who publicly said they\u2019re [voting] no and Democrats who said they\u2019re a \u2018no,\u2019 there are not enough votes in this chamber\u201d to pass the House plan, said a Democratic Senator, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter freely. \n  \n The sentiment was confirmed by a Democratic aide and another senator. \n  \n McConnell told his members in an email obtained by POLITICO that he intends to keep the chamber in session through the weekend if a shutdown occurs. Republican senators also discussed the possibility of a much shorter spending bill at a Wednesday lunch, hoping to keep the pressure on Congress to hammer out a large agreement rather than punt on contentious spending and immigration issues. \n  \n Democrats and some Republicans appear willing to back only a spending bill lasting several days, hoping the small window would kickstart negotiations on a plan to protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from being deported. \n  \n \u201cThat would allow us to get a compromise, get a deal done. If we wait a month there\u2019s little likelihood we\u2019re in a better position than we are now,\u201d said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas.), who made the case to his colleagues that funding bills for as short as one or two days are preferable to allowing the government to close. \n  \n But Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) dismissed the idea of a spending plan that only lasts days. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to do that,\u201d he said. \n  \n Senate Democrats \u2014 furious with Trump for his reversal last week on a bipartisan Senate plan to protect 700,000 young immigrants from deportation \u2014 have signaled a new willingness to take a harder line. A handful who previously supported short-term funding measures have declared they will not this time around, including Tom Udall and Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \n  \n Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Senate Democrats are \u201cvery unified\u201d in opposition to the House bill. Still he could not say for sure the bill would fail in the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s very close at this point,\u201d Durbin said. \n  \n Several Republicans, like Graham and Rand Paul of Kentucky, indicated they can't support the House either, imperiling the GOP's unity in the Senate. McConnell tried to stop the bleeding in a Thursday email to his conference by warning other Senate Republicans against siding with Democrats: \"This is an irresponsible position... I hope not a single Republican is inclined to join them.\" \n  \n McConnell prevailed on Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). who had said he opposed the House bill but reversed course, saying he'd made a deal with the House for more defense funding. \n  \n The House GOP spent Thursday morning doing damage control after Trump tweeted criticism of their spending bill \u2014 all while trying to whip the GOP votes needed to pass the text through their own chamber. \n  \n In a Twitter broadside that rattled Republican nerves, Trump blasted the GOP congressional leadership\u2019s decision to attach tens of billions of dollars in funding for a popular children\u2019s health program to the spending bill. That money is a key part of the GOP's effort to pick up Democratic votes. \n  \n \u201cCHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!,\u201d Trump said, referring to the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Speaker Paul Ryan and other House GOP leaders had attached the funding to the spending package in a \u2014 so far failed \u2014 effort to win Democratic support. \n  \n Ryan spoke with Trump about the matter afterward. And by lunchtime, the White House issued a statement clarifying that the president supports passage of the stop-gap measure. ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n  \n President Donald Trump will mark the first anniversary of his inauguration on Saturday with a celebration at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, with tickets starting at $100,000 a pair. \n  \n That amount, according to the invitation, will pay for dinner and a photograph with the president. For $250,000, a couple can also take part in a roundtable. \n  \n Trump told reporters in November that he had thought about having a celebration that month, a year after his victory over Hillary Clinton, but he was touring Asia at the time. \n  \n The event, hosted by Ronna Romney McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and the casino mogul Steve Wynn, will benefit the Trump presidential campaign and the RNC. \n  \n McDaniel\u2019s maiden name, Romney, is not written on the invitation.

Legislation to extend the deadline is at an impasse in the Senate, and Republican leaders haven\u2019t set out a way around it. Trump\u2019s advisers believe the Senate will pass a short-term funding extension so it\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019ll be staying in Washington, a person familiar with his plans said. \n  \n Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee hosting the event, raised $11.1 million through the first three quarters of 2017.

The Senate scheduled a procedural vote for 10 p.m. and House members \u2014 who had passed a bill of their own Thursday night \u2014 stuck around Washington in case they were called to come vote on a new deal. The 10 p.m. vote will be the first test of support for the House-passed measure. \n  \n White House budget director Mick Mulvaney predicted that Congress would most likely fail to meet the midnight Friday deadline to avert a shutdown, but he said he is optimistic that lawmakers and the White House would agree on a compromise by the end of the weekend. \n  \n \"In theory, the Senate could deal with it before midnight and the House could in some fashion deal with it before midnight,\" he told reporters Friday. \"It's more likely that if the Senate makes any changes it would take the House a while to get everybody back for the vote.\" \n  \n Still, \"there's a really good chance it gets fixed\" before government offices open on Monday, Mulvaney said. \n  \n Meanwhile, a group of centrist Democrats \u2014 all up for re-election in states Trump won in 2016 \u2014 appeared to be attempting pre-emptive damage control. The group introduced a bill that would withhold the pay of members of Congress if the government shuts down. \n  \n \u201cIf members of Congress can\u2019t figure this out and keep the government open, then none of us should get paid,\u201d said Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Jon Tester, D-Mont., Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Joe Manchin, D-W.V. also co-sponsored the legislation. \n  \n Trump and Schumer \"had a long and detailed meeting,\" Schumer said when he returned from the White House Friday afternoon. \"We discussed all of the major outstanding issues. We made some progress, but we still have a good number of disagreements. The discussions will continue.\" \n  \n Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn of Texas said it is up to Congress to resolve the impasse. \n  \n \u201cI talked to (Chief of Staff) Gen. Kelly and he was telling me about the meeting at the White House and he said there were were no agreements with Sen. Schumer and the president told him to go back and talk to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and work it out,\" Cornyn said. \"I think that\u2019s the best way to handle this.\u201d \n  \n Senate Democrats \u2014 and a few Republicans \u2014appeared poised to kill a Republican spending bill that would keep the federal government funded through Feb. 16, and lawmakers are locked in an increasingly bitter stalemate over a broader spending deal. \n  \n Most Senate Democrats oppose the short-term spending bill, called a continuing resolution, because it does not include protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. But they also object to the measure because it fails to deal with a broad array of other Democratic spending priorities. \n  \n But the House passed the bill Thursday and it is the only funding bill currently on the table. \n  \n \u201cThis vote should be a no brainer,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor Friday morning. \n  \n He blasted the Democrats for their plan to reject the four-week spending bill, saying they were \u201cholding the entire country hostage\u201d in an effort to win protections for immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children. \n  \n \u201cTo even repeat this position out loud is to see how completely ridiculous it is,\u201d McConnell said, saying the government is now just hours away from what he called a \u201cDemocrat shutdown.\u201d \n  \n Democrats quickly noted that Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House and yet have failed to come up with a budget agreement that can pass Congress and win the president's signature. \n  \n \u201cThe Republican majority has failed in 119 days to produce a budget for the United States of America,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the No. 2 Senate Democrat. \u201cThe best that the Republican leader in the Senate can offer us is another Band-aid, another four weeks of temporary funding.\u201d \n  \n Durbin noted that the spending bill now pending in the Senate is the fourth such temporary funding measure Republicans have pushed in the last year. It would keep government funding frozen at current levels for four weeks, with no indication Republicans could come up with a full-year spending agreement before Feb. 16. \n  \n CLOSE House Speaker Paul Ryan is pressuring Democrats to back a bill preventing a weekend government shutdown and says \"cool heads hopefully will prevail.\" (Jan. 17) AP \n  \n Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate are floating the idea of an even shorter timeframe for a spending bill in order to ratchet up pressure on lawmakers to negotiate. \n  \n But not everyone is on board. \n  \n \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 position is we don\u2019t want to have (continuing resolutions) because they\u2019re bad for the government. So how is it logical to go from a 30 day CR to a 10 day CR or a 4 day CR? That\u2019s silly,\u201d Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said. \u201cI support what the House passed yesterday.\u201d \n  \n The immigration debate was sparked by Trump in September, when he reversed an Obama-era executive order that granted legal protections to the so-called Dreamers, those immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children. Many of these immigrants now have temporary legal states under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program, but it will expire in March under the new White House policy. \n  \n Demonstrators supporting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program rally outside the office Sen.

But last week, he rejected a bipartisan Senate deal, saying it did not do enough to stop illegal immigration and close a visa lottery program. \n  \n The House passed the spending bill Thursday night 230-197, with almost all Republicans voting yes. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had urged her caucus to vote against the bill. Six centrist Democrats ultimately voted in favor, but not until after it was clear the bill would pass. \n  \n In the Senate, Republicans have a narrow 51-49 majority and legislation requires 60 votes to advance. Democrats say they have enough \u201cno\u201d votes to block the bill, and at least two Republican senators have said they will vote against the bill as well. \n  \n A government shutdown Saturday would fall on the one-year anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Friday the White House announced that a pre-planned trip to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., which would include a fundraising dinner, was no longer certain as the chances of a government shut down rose. \n  \n Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., have both announced they\u2019re against the bill. Sen. John McCain of Arizona is out of Washington dealing with health issues. Graham late Friday said he is suggesting instead a 3-week extension that would fund the government through Feb. 8. \n  \n Contributing: David Jackson, Gregory Korte and Erin Kelly \n  \n Read More: Social security benefits?

However, the likelihood of a deal shrank even more on Friday when Trump and Sen. Chuck Schumer failed to strike an agreement at an afternoon White House meeting, reports USA Today. Trump had been planning to leave Friday to attend an anniversary bash on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, a celebration of his first year in office, reports Bloomberg. More on the shutdown, and its potential effects on everyday life: Prospects: Things are \"dicey at best\" in terms of a deal, with Politico seeing a \"seemingly intractable impasse\" in the Senate. One huge sticking point is that Democrats want any spending plan to include protections for about 700,000 young \"Dreamer\" immigrants. Still, talks were continuing, and it's possible the Senate could take some kind of action Friday to avoid the shutdown, if only for the short term. The effects: You'll still get mail if the government shuts down, and Social Security recipients will still get their checks. Air traffic controllers and the TSA would stay on the job, so air travel shouldn't be greatly affected, explains USA Today. But services deemed \"non-essential\" would suffer\u2014for example, those waiting on a passport might be out of luck. The AP has a video primer.", "category": "Summarization 417.json"}]
