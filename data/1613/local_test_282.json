In normal subjects fecal excretion of the radiolabel was increased with increasing stool volumes. As a group, patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea excreted radiolabeled bile acid more rapidly than normal subjects with induced diarrhea (t1/2 56 +/- 8 vs. 236 +/- 60 h, respectively, p less than 0.005). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between t1/2 of radiolabeled bile acid and Schilling test results in these patients. Although 14 of 17 patients absorbed labeled taurocholic acid less well than any of the normal subjects with comparable volumes of induced diarrhea, cholestyramine had no statistically significant effect on stool weight in the patient group, and in none of the patients was stool weight reduced to within the normal range. In summary, most patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea have bile acid malabsorption (as measured by fecal excretion of labeled bile acid), but they do not respond to cholestyramine therapy with a significant reduction in stool weight. Although the significance of these findings was not clearly established, the most likely interpretation is that bile acid malabsorption is a manifestation of an underlying intestinal motility or absorptive defect rather than the primary cause of diarrhea. \n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Studies of the prevalence and significance of radiolabeled bile acid malabsorption in a group of patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea. option2: Arsenic content of homeopathic medicines.", "output": "Studies of the prevalence and significance of radiolabeled bile acid malabsorption in a group of patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea.", "category": "Text Matching 1251.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, indicate which of the provided candidate titles (Option1 and Option2) best describes it (respond with the text of the title, not option1/2).", "input": "Abstract: Four patients who had no oocytes retrieved during an IVF cycle were studied in an attempt to identify predictors of such an occurrence and suggestions for its cause.

The latter had old myocardial infarction and no conduction disturbances and had not been receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. In both normal subjects and patients with VT, isopotential maps of the time-averaged and filtered (25 Hz high-pass) electrocardiograms during the terminal portion of the QRS were dipolar, i.e., they showed single positive and negative regions. For patients with VT, the extrema were either distant, with one over the precordial area and the other over the back, or close together in the precordial region. In 10 patients, maps recorded after administration of antiarrhythmic drugs remained the same while QRS duration was prolonged. In six patients, maps recorded before antiarrhythmic surgery showed distant extrema for septal or posterobasal VT sites of origin and close extrema for anterior or posteroapical sites. Generally, QRS duration was reduced and maps were modified after surgery. Late potentials can be well detected with only three orthogonal leads because their distributions are dipolar, but maps provide additional information about their distribution, which may be related to conduction delay sites and possibly to VT sites of origin.

One was a 1-4 scale based on a subjective evaluation of embryo quality (EQ) from microscopic appearance. In addition, a formula for scoring embryo growth rate in vitro was developed. The embryo development rating (EDR) was based on the ratio between the time at which embryos were observed at a particular stage after insemination and the time at which they would be expected to reach that stage in a hypothetical \"ideal\" growth rate with a cell cycle length of 11.9 hr. Using this scoring system, \"normally\" growing embryos scored 100. This approach was aimed at partially normalizing the data and allowed all embryos to be analyzed similarly regardless of the time of observation. Analysis of 1539 embryo replacements resulting in 232 clinical pregnancies showed that both EDR and embryo-quality scores were of value in predicting success, with clinical pregnancy most likely to eventuate from a combination of moderate to good EQ scores (2-4) coupled with average or above-average growth rates (EDR scores from 90 to 129). Poor-quality and very slowly or very rapidly growing embryos were underrepresented in cycles that proceeded to pregnancy. These inferences were based on all embryos transferred (mean, 2.73 per transfer cycle), and they were substantiated by an analysis of 33 pregnancies resulting from replacement of a single embryo and from 18 pregnancies in which all embryos scored the same with both systems.

To establish the value of ovariohysterectomy in female beagle dogs as a model for bone loss and to study static and dynamic parameters of bone associated with the negative bone balance occurring after cessation of ovarian function, we performed iliac crest bone biopsies before and 4 months after ovariohysterectomy in eight beagle dogs and in five sham-operated controls. Cessation of ovarian function was documented by an increase in serum levels of LH 4 weeks after ovariohysterectomy. There was no change in serum calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine during the 4 months of the study. Cancellous bone mass and trabecular mean wall thickness decreased significantly after ovariohysterectomy (P less than 0.01). In addition, the number of osteoblasts was increased and the bone formation rate per osteoblast, that is, the activity of bone-forming cells, was decreased (P less than 0.01). Parameters of bone resorption were not significantly altered in the animals with ovariohysterectomy. No changes in histomorphometric parameters of bone structure, formation or resorption were observed in the sham-operated controls. These data indicate that ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs may serve as a useful model for bone loss associated with cessation of ovarian function.

Single, double and triple truncated exponential shocks separated by 1 ms were delivered through various electrode combinations and cardiac vectors after electrical induction of ventricular fibrillation. A single shock through a pathway not incorporating the interventricular septum (catheter electrodes or epicardial patches between anterior and posterior left ventricle) required the highest total energy (22.6 and greater than 26.4 J, respectively) and peak voltage (1,004 and greater than 1,094 V, respectively) to terminate ventricular fibrillation. A single shock through a pathway including the interventricular septum required lower total energy and peak voltage to defibrillate. Combinations of two sequential shocks between an intracardiac catheter electrode and anterior left ventricular epicardial patch, between the catheter electrode and subcutaneous extrathoracic plate and between three ventricular epicardial patches all significantly reduced total energy (7.7, 8.7 and 7.8 J, respectively) and peak voltage (424, 436 and 424 V, respectively) needed to defibrillate. Three sequential shocks exerted no significant additional reduction in total energy of the defibrillation threshold than did two sequential shocks.

Right atrial pressure and other hemodynamic variables including right ventricular stroke work index were also measured before and after the pericardium was widely opened. The pericardium was grossly normal in all patients and only small physiologic effusions were present. In Group I mean pericardial pressure was 8 +/- 2 mm Hg as was mean right atrial pressure. In Group II mean pericardial pressure was 6 +/- 2 mm Hg versus mean right atrial pressure of 10 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Excluding 2 of the 20 patients with outlying data, pericardial pressure showed linear correlation with right atrial pressure (r = 0.689).

Thus, even in the absence of an abnormal effusion the normal pericardium exerts a significant pressure on the heart, which is often similar in magnitude to right atrial pressure.
