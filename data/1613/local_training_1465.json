Forced to take action, in the autumn of 894 Simeon invaded the Byzantine Empire from the north, meeting little opposition due to the concentration of most Byzantine forces in eastern Anatolia to counter Arab invasions. Informed of the Bulgarian offensive, the surprised Leo sent an army consisting of guardsmen and other military units from the capital to halt Simeon, but his troops were routed somewhere in the theme of Macedonia.The Magyars managed to defeat Simeon's army twice, but in 896 they were routed in the Battle of Southern Buh.

The series of military setbacks (principally the losses at Brandywine in September and Germantown in October) caused many in the Continental Army and Congress to question George Washington's leadership of the war effort. In contrast, the northern army of General Horatio Gates had won a signal victory over John Burgoyne's forces, compelling Burgoyne to surrender his entire army after the Battles of Saratoga. Gates controversially claimed credit for the victory. Some historians feel that this was more due to the actions of Benedict Arnold, who, in the first battle on September 19, effectively and almost independently defended his forces against British assaults. It was also alleged that Gates had failed to provide Arnold with adequate reinforcements which would have turned the battle into an outright American victory, although there is not universal agreement on this matter. Gates was politically well connected to Congress. Some congressmen such as Richard Henry Lee, John Adams, and Samuel Adams wanted tighter Congressional control of the war effort and supported Gates. Although John Adams did not specifically call for Washington to be replaced, he worried that Washington was being made into a military idol, and was fearful of the effects of this upon republicanism. \n Link Information: Lee presiding until November 23, 1785.

He was at Pimu Hospital, Province of \u00c9quateur until 1946, most of the time as the only doctor there (TLM, The Leprosy Mission started working there in 1944). He remained in the Belgian Congo in World War II. In 1930 there had been 30 Protestant missionaries in the Congo, but by 1939 Dr. Price was one of only five left. Although Belgium had been invaded by the Nazis, the Belgian government in exile in London continued to control the Congo and its valuable resources. In 1944 he published a paper on the grammar of the Ngombe language (one of the languages of Equateur Province) and thereafter contributed to the updating of the British and Foreign Bible Society's 1930 Ngombe New Testament, which was republished in 1956.

Kimpese hospital was set up by the protestant missions in the Congo as an interdenominational training hospital for medical auxiliaries. A Protestant hospital at Kimpese had first been mooted in 1923 (there had been an Evangelical training Institute there since 1909), but was strongly resisted by the Roman Catholic Church.. Before the war, the Belgian colonial government had refused to subsidise any Protestant educational enterprise, even the training of medical aides (the sole exception was the BMS medical aides training school at Yakusu). After the war this policy was reversed by the Socialist governments of Achille Van Acker and Protestant establishments were subsidised on the same basis as Catholic ones. As a result the Protestant IME (Institut Medical Evangelique) Kimpese could be opened. He was at IME Kimpese as an orthopaedic surgeon 1947-1956. He was succeeded in this post, as he had been at Pimu by Dr David Hedley Wilson, later the first President of the Royal college of Emergency Medicine. IME Kimpese \"became rapidly known throughout the lower Congo river and beyond for the high standard of its nursing school and hospital\".

Approximately 19 different chemokine receptors have been characterized to date, which share many common structural features; they are composed of about 350 amino acids that are divided into a short and acidic N-terminal end, seven helical transmembrane domains with three intracellular and three extracellular hydrophilic loops, and an intracellular C-terminus containing serine and threonine residues that act as phosphorylation sites during receptor regulation. The first two extracellular loops of chemokine receptors are linked together by disulfide bonding between two conserved cysteine residues. The N-terminal end of a chemokine receptor binds to chemokine(s) and is important for ligand specificity. G-proteins couple to the C-terminal end, which is important for receptor signaling following ligand binding. Although chemokine receptors share high amino acid identity in their primary sequences, they typically bind a limited number of ligands. Chemokine receptors are redundant in their function as more than one chemokine is able to bind to a single receptor.\n Link Information: Approximately 150 of the GPCRs found in the human genome Question: Where else are Chemokine receptors found?", "output": "Answer: in the human genome ", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

In 1570, Pope Pius V issued his papal bull Regnans in Excelsis, which absolved Catholics from their obligations to the government. This dramatically worsened the situation of the Catholics in England. English governments continued to fear the fictitious Popish Plot. The 1584 Parliament of England, declared in \"An Act against Jesuits, seminary priests, and such other like disobedient persons\" that the purpose of Jesuit missionaries who had come to Britain was \"to stir up and move sedition, rebellion and open hostility\". Consequently, Jesuit priests like Saint John Ogilvie were hanged. This somehow contrasts with the image of the Elizabethan era as the time of William Shakespeare, but compared to the antecedent Marian Persecutions there is an important difference to consider. Mary I of England had been motivated by a religious zeal to purge heresy from her land, and during her short reign from 1553 to 1558 about 290 Protestants had been burned at the stake for heresy, whereas Elizabeth I of England \"acted out of fear for the security of her realm.\"\n Link Information: none Question: When did the era in which William Shakespeare was active begin?", "output": "Answer: none", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

British general William Howe had landed troops on Long Island in August and had pushed George Washington's Continental Army completely out of New York by mid-November, when he captured the remaining troops on Manhattan. The main British troops returned to New York for the winter season. They left mainly Hessian troops in New Jersey. These troops were under the command of Colonel Rall and Colonel Von Donop. They were ordered to small outposts in and around Trenton. Howe then sent troops under the command of Charles Cornwallis across the Hudson River into New Jersey and chased Washington across New Jersey. Washington's army was shrinking, due to expiring enlistments and desertions, and suffered from poor morale, due to the defeats in the New York area. Most of Washington's army crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania north of Trenton, New Jersey, and destroyed or moved to the western shore all boats for miles in both directions. Cornwallis (under Howe's command), rather than attempting to immediately chase Washington further, established a chain of outposts from New Brunswick to Burlington, including one at Bordentown and one at Trenton, and ordered his troops into winter quarters.

He was also close friends with Everett Dirksen. Novak later stated that reading Whittaker Chambers' book Witness changed his views from moderate-to-liberal to a strident anticommunism.

The missionaries encountered resistance from the Tongva to their attempts to resettle the Natives on the mission. The mission encountered further trouble in 1776 when a flood damaged the mission, convincing the missionaries to move and rebuild the mission on a higher and more defensible location: its present site in San Gabriel. The first Spanish governor of Las Californias, Felipe de Neve had, as well, recommended to Viceroy Bucareli Father Cresp\u00ed's location on the R\u00edo Porci\u00fancula (Los Angeles River) for a mission. Instead, in 1781, King Charles III mandated that a pueblo be built on the site instead, which would be the second town in Alta California, after San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe in 1777. The monarch, disregarding the production and trade roles of the missions, saw a greater need for secular pueblos to be established as the centers of agriculture and commerce to supply the crown's ever-growing military presence in \"Nueva California.\" The priests at the missions ignored the royal mandate and continued their ranching, trading and production of tallow, soap, hides, and beef, often in competition with new pueblo ventures.\n Link Information: Felipe de Neve (1724\u20131784) was the fourth governor of Las Californias Question: When was the first Spanish governor of Las Californias born?", "output": "Answer: 1724", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

Evidence of iron smelting has also been excavated at sites in the Nsukka region of southeast Nigeria in what is now Igboland: dating to 2,000 BC at the site of Lejja (Uzomaka 2009) and to 750 BC and at the site of Opi (Holl 2009). The transition from Neolithic times to the Iron Age apparently was achieved indigenously without intermediate bronze production. Others have suggested that the technology moved west from the Nile Valley, although the Iron Age in the Niger River valley and the forest region appears to predate the introduction of metallurgy in the upper savanna by more than 800 years. The earliest iron technology in West Africa has also been found to be contemporary with or predate that of the Nile valley and North Africa, and some archaeologists believe that iron metallurgy was likely developed independently in sub-Saharan West Africa.\n Link Information: The Nok Culture appeared in northern Nigeria around 150 Question: Why did the Nok culture die off about 200 AD on the Jos Plateau?", "output": "Answer: unknown", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

Today, the species is only known from a specimen kept in World Museum, Liverpool. Overlooked for much of the 20th century, it was recognised as a valid extinct species by the IUCN Red List only in 2008.

The Philippine Navy addressed these shortfalls through modernization programs. In Philippine service, Diego Silang retained her South Vietnamese armament, consisting of a single Mark 12 5\"/38 caliber (127-mm) gun, a dual-purpose weapon capable of anti-surface and anti-air fire, mounted in a Mark 30 Mod 0 enclosed base ring with a range of up to yards; two twin Mark 1 Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft gun mounts, four Mk. 4 single 20-millimeter Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun mounts, four M2 Browning .50-caliber (12.7-millimeter) general-purpose machine guns, and two 81-mm mortars. However, in 1979 Hatch and Kirk, Inc., added a helicopter deck aft which could accommodate a Philippine Navy MBB Bo 105C helicopter for utility, scouting, and maritime patrol purposes, although the ship had no capability to refuel or otherwise support visiting helicopters. The Sperry SPS-53 surface search and navigation radar also was installed, replacing the AN/SPS-23 radar, although the ship retained both its AN/SPS-29D air search radar and its Mark 26 Mod 1 Fire Control Radar System. The Philippine Navy made plans to equip Diego Silang and her sister ships with new radar systems and long-range BGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles, but this upgrade did not materialize due to the worsening political and economic crisis in the Philippines in the mid-1980s.\n Link Information: none Question: How many of the 105C helicopter did the Philippine Navy operate?", "output": "Answer: none", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

However, its growth was limited by shipping rates. With the trucking industry and Interstate Highway System not yet developed, SCGX was constrained by monopolized railroad rates, primarily by the Great Northern Railway. Exhausting their bargaining power with the Interstate Commerce Commission, SCGX President Charles C. Flanley directed future lobbying efforts to unlocking barge navigation of the Missouri River. His initiative was stalled throughout the 1930s by the Great Depression and Dust Bowl. In 1938, a renewed thirteen year campaign led by Secretary William Henry Marriott finally opened commercial navigation of the Missouri River and helped establish the Missouri River Basin Project, which included development of the Gavins Point Dam. The alternate transportation succeeded in breaking the railroad's monopoly.

Black Hawk's success drew fighters from other Utes in Colorado, Apaches from New Mexico, and many Navajos. In the winter of 1866 Black Hawk and his band went to the Four Corners region where he received many new recruits. So many Navajos joined him that they formed almost half his raiders. The Navajo had been decimated by the U.S. Army under Kit Carson and forced out of their ancestral homeland. The remaining Navajos were eager for a chance to build up their herds at the expense of white settlers. Manuelito, the most important chief refusing to relocate to the Bosque Redondo Reservation, jointly led Black Hawk's raids on Mormon settlements in southern Utah during 1866. The attacks commenced at Pipe Springs, then a Mormon settlement on the Arizona-Utah border. The retaliation for the Pipe Springs raid left four unarmed Paiutes dead for murders they had nothing to do with. This brought some Paiute fighters to Black Hawk's band. Hopis hearing of the Navajo's movements feared they were to be attacked and struck first ambushing Manuelito's Navajos. The raids continued at the Paria settlements, and Kanab, who sent pleas for help against the raids. In subsequent years, the raids continued in the south by Navajos and Paiutes, which raised tensions to a fever pitch which would result in the worst massacre of the war at Circleville. Chief Kanosh predicted that in 1867 six thousand Navajos would wipe out the Mormon towns in southern Utah.\n Link Information: Carson was appointed brevet brigadier general (dated March 13, 1865) and appointed commandant of Ft.

Their practitioners slowly migrated away from the teachings of the Vedas attaching greater significance to their founders and their preachings. From then onwards polytheism commenced. Great differences developed among the different sects and divided and weakened Hindu society. The caste system based on birth became strong and gave rise to further fragmentation. Like with any aging society without reforms, the customs gave way to superstition and ignorance wherein practice superseded reason and the spread of blind faith threatened degradation of \"Hindu\" society. The word Hindu is an improper word or misnomer- the correct word is Vedantic or Sanathana Dharma, a religion based upon the Vedas.

Virginia, in which the Court said, in 1967, that its decision striking down anti-miscegenation laws could be justified either by substantive due process, or by the Equal Protection Clause. The unconstitutionality of bans on and refusals to recognize same-sex marriage was decided partly on substantive due process grounds by Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015. A right to have children was addressed in Skinner v. Oklahoma, but the Court in Skinner, in 1942, explicitly declined to base its decision on due process but instead cited the Equal Protection Clause since the Oklahoma law required sterilization of some three-time felons but not others. A substantive due process right of a parent to educate a young child (before ninth grade) in a foreign language was recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, in 1923, with two justices dissenting, and Justice Kennedy has mentioned that Meyer might be decided on different grounds in modern times. Laws that \"shock the conscience\" of the Court were generally deemed unconstitutional, in 1952, in Rochin v. California, but in concurring, Justices Black and Douglas argued that pumping a defendant's stomach for evidence should have been deemed unconstitutional on the narrower ground that it violates the Fifth Amendment's right against self-incrimination. The Court, in O'Connor v. Donaldson, in 1975, said that due process is violated by confining a nondangerous mentally ill person who is capable of surviving safely in freedom. Chief Justice Burger's concurring opinion was that such confinement may also amount to \"punishment\" for being mentally ill, violating the Court's interpretation of the Eighth Amendment in Robinson v. California. Freedom from excessive punitive damages was deemed to be a due process right in BMW v. Gore, in 1996, but four justices disagreed. The Court, in Cruzan v.

He built there a new church and founded a boys' college with funds gathered on a tour through France.

Cr\u00e9tin was one of the few who volunteered and on 16 August 1838, he secretly left his parish, embarked at Le Havre with Bishop Loras, and landed in New York in October of the same year. The winter of 1838-39 was spent in St. Louis, Missouri, and on his arrival in Dubuque, 18 April 1839, he was immediately appointed vicar-general of the new diocese.

Elsewhere in North America, McCartney would perform in Portland after an eleven-year absence following his 2005 'US' tour. The two shows in Vancouver would follow his previous performance in the city at the BC Place stadium in 2012, yet this tour would feature two shows in the neighboring Rogers Arena after the pyrotechnics during his concert at BC Place accidentally damaged the stadium's new roof. McCartney's Seattle show would mark his shortest absence from any North American city on the tour announced currently, as he performed at the city's Safeco Field during the inaugural year of the 'Out There' tour.

Pertinax was elevated to the purple and recognized by his peers, but following his murder by a restive Praetorian Guard, Septimius Severus decided to make his bid for power and usurped the throne. Although initially a usurper, Severus managed to remain in power for the next 18 years and died a natural death while campaigning in northern Britain. The death of Severus Alexander (the last emperor of the Severan dynasty) in 235 triggered what historians call the crisis of the third century. In this period, from 235 to the accession of Diocletian and the establishment of the Tetrarchy in 286, Rome saw 28 emperors of whom only two had a natural death (from the plague). However, there were also 38 usurpers who raised revolts across the Empire, a clear sign that the security of the frontiers was not the only problem within the Roman world. Usurpation attempts were a constant worry for the emperors in this period; it was a too common method of acceding the throne. Successful usurpers were usually either provincial governors, commanders of a large grouping of Roman legions, or prefects of the Praetorian Guard, which had control of Rome, where the Imperial palace still lay.\n Link Information: The Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty was a dynasty of seven Roman Emperors who ruled over the Roman Empire from 96 CE to 192 CE.

He returned to Leningrad in 1938, lecturing, completing his Ph.D. and becoming employed as a junior scientist. He joined the Lebedev Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in Moscow as a senior scientist in 1940. In 1941 the institute was evacuated to Kazan. Under Abraham Alikhanov, he studied cosmic rays in Armenia from 1942. In 1943, he transferred to Laboratory No.2 under Igor Kurchatov as part of the Soviet project to develop nuclear weapons. Alikhanov founded Laboratory No.3 (which became the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP)) and Pomeranchuk worked there from 1946 (and for the rest of his life), founding and leading the Theoretical department, as well as being Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Moscow Mechanical Institute where students admired his infectious enthusiasm for his subject. Rudolf Peierls was consoled by the fact that it was \"very clever Pomeranchuk\" - and no-one else - who corrected his 1/T law for heat conduction in high-temperature condensed matter physics. His work in the 1940s was dominated by neutron research and his manuscript with Akhiezer was the basic guide for Soviet nuclear reactor construction. In 1950, he published a paper suggesting that the entropy of helium-3 as a liquid was less than as a solid. In 1950, Pomeranchuk received an order from Josef Stalin to go to Arzamas-16, located in the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region, to work on Soviet nuclear weaponry. Missing his family and his 'hobby physics' problems, he was advised not to apply for a revocation but wait until the order was \"forgotten.\" He returned to ITEP within a year. He continued enthusiastically with work on quantum field theory and S-matrix theory, particle collisions and Regge theory, the latter in vigorous collaboration with Vladimir Gribov. His last paper on Regge theory was published posthumously. For his work, Pomeranchuk was twice awarded the Stalin Prize (1950, 1952).

The series was scripted by veteran Doctor Who writer Paul Cornell, with Richard E. Grant providing the voice for the Ninth Doctor. This performance followed years of rumours that Grant would play the Doctor in a film or new series, and indeed he had appeared as the \"Conceited Doctor\" in the Comic Relief special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death in 1999. Grant subsequently went on to appear in the revived television series of Doctor Who as a guest villain in 2012's \"The Snowmen\" and 2013's \"The Bells of Saint John\" and \"The Name of the Doctor\". The Doctor's companion for this adventure, Alison Cheney, was voiced by Sophie Okonedo who a year later would be nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in Hotel Rwanda. She also appeared in the 2010 series of Doctor Who, as Liz 10, in the episodes \"The Beast Below\" and \"The Pandorica Opens\". Derek Jacobi reprised his role as the Master in 2007's \"Utopia\". David Tennant appeared in a cameo role as the Caretaker, later being cast as the Tenth Doctor in 2005.\n Link Information: Actors.- Richard E. Grant was later cast as the Doctor in the animated 40th-anniversary adventure Scream of the Shalka in 2003, though his status was relegated to unofficial following the announcement of a new series in September 2003. He later played the villainous Great Intelligence (in its Walter Simeon persona) in 2012 \"The Snowmen\", and 2013's \"The Bells of Saint John\" and \"The Name of the Doctor\".\n- Jim Broadbent had previously played the Doctor in a sketch on Victoria Wood, mocking the series' perceived sexism, cheapness, and use of technobabble.\n- Roy Skelton had voiced Daleks since 1967.\n- Julia Sawalha was being considered for the role of a new companion, a \"cat burglar\" who would have been introduced in the twenty-seventh season. Building on this, a \"what if\" article in Doctor Who Magazine #255 featured her in this role along with a hypothetical Eighth Doctor, played by Richard Griffiths, who was at one time considered for the role of the Fifth Doctor.\n- Hugh Grant was offered the role of the Doctor again ahead of Christopher Eccleston, and later said publicly that he regretted dismissing it without much thought when he saw how good the series was \u2013 and that he was hoping to play a villain in the ongoing programme instead. Russell T Davies would later describe Hugh Grant's performance as \"fleetingly\" one of the best performances in the part of the Doctor.\n- Joanna Lumley is the first woman to play an incarnation of the Doctor. The second was Arabella Weir in the Doctor Who Unbound Big Finish episode Exile. On 16 July 2017, Jodie Whittaker was revealed as the official Thirteenth Doctor, becoming the first woman to be cast in the role of the Doctor within the canon of the series.\n\n Question: Who were the other main stars in the special that Grant made a special appearance as the \"Conceited Doctor\"?", "output": "Answer: Jim Broadbent", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

Infection occurs via the fecal\u2013oral route, meaning that one ingests the virus and viral replication occurs in the alimentary tract. Virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals. In 95% of cases only a primary, transient presence of viremia (virus in the bloodstream) occurs, and the poliovirus infection is asymptomatic. In about 5% of cases, the virus spreads and replicates in other sites such as brown fat, reticuloendothelial tissue, and muscle. The sustained viral replication causes secondary viremia and leads to the development of minor symptoms such as fever, headache, and sore throat. Paralytic poliomyelitis occurs in less than 1% of poliovirus infections. Paralytic disease occurs when the virus enters the central nervous system (CNS) and replicates in motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex, resulting in the selective destruction of motor neurons leading to temporary or permanent paralysis. In rare cases, paralytic poliomyelitis leads to respiratory arrest and death. In cases of paralytic disease, muscle pain and spasms are frequently observed prior to onset of weakness and paralysis.

NFL Europe encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three (much like Australian rules' Super Goal or basketball's three-point line), a rule since adopted by the Stars Football League. Similarly, the sport of arena football sought (unsuccessfully) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points; it failed, since only one kicker (Brian Mitchell) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency.

A vector space over GF(q) of n + 1 dimensions produces an n-dimensional Galois geometry PG(n,q) with its subspaces: one-dimensional subspaces are the points of the Galois geometry and two-dimensional subspaces are the lines. Non-singular linear transformations of the vector space provide motions of PG(n,q). The first book (1979) covered PG(1,q) and PG(2,q). The second book addressed PG(3,q) and the third PG(n,q). Chapters are numbered sequentially through the trilogy: 14 in the first book, 15 to 21 in the second, and 22 to 27 in the third. Finite geometry has contributed to coding theory, such as the Goppa code, so the field is supported by computer science. In the preface of the 1991 text Hirschfeld summarizes the status of Galois geometry, mentioning maximum distance separable code, mathematics journals publishing finite geometry, and conferences on combinatorics featuring Galois geometry.

The new-build campus was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the Gothic revival style. The largest of these buildings echoed, on a far grander scale, the original High Street campus's twin-quadrangle layout, and may have been inspired by Ypres' late medieval cloth hall; Gilmorehill in turn inspired the design of the Clocktower complex of buildings for the new University of Otago in New Zealand. In 1879, Gilbert Scott's son, Oldrid, completed this original vision by building an open undercroft forming two quadrangles, above which is his grand Bute Hall (used for examinations and graduation ceremonies), named after its donor, John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. Oldrid also later added a spire to the building's signature gothic bell tower in 1887, bringing it to a total height of some .

This usually happens due to a mutation that alters the reading frame of the RNA downstream of the mutation, so-called frameshift mutation. If an exon with an appropriate number of bases lies near the mutation, removing that exon can correct the downstream reading frame, restoring the production of partially functional dystrophin. This is the general strategy used in the design of exon-skipping oligonucleotides for DMD.

The triode was immediately applied to many areas of communication. Triode \"continuous wave\" radio transmitters replaced the cumbersome inefficient \"damped wave\" spark gap transmitters, allowing the transmission of sound by amplitude modulation (AM). Amplifying triode radio receivers, which had the power to drive loudspeakers, replaced weak crystal radios, which had to be listened to with earphones, allowing families to listen together. This resulted in the evolution of radio from a commercial message service to the first mass communication medium, with the beginning of radio broadcasting around 1920. Triodes made transcontinental telephone service possible. Vacuum tube triode repeaters, invented at Bell Telephone after its purchase of the Audion rights, allowed telephone calls to travel beyond the unamplified limit of about 800 miles. The opening by Bell of the first transcontinental telephone line was celebrated 3 years later, on January 25, 1915.

At the Paris Peace Conference a commission for Polish affairs was created to prepare proposals for Polish borders. In their first two proposals (of 27 March 1919 and of 7 May 1919) most of the future province was ceded, together with the region of Oppeln, to Poland. Yet that was not accepted by the Big Four, and following David Lloyd George's suggestion, the plebiscite was organized. Before it took place on 20 March 1921, two Silesian Insurrections instigated by Polish inhabitants of the area were organized. After the referendum, in which Poland had 41% of the votes, a plan of division was created that divided Upper Silesia. Following this, the Third Silesian Uprising took place. The Inter-Allied Commission on Upper Silesia, headed by the French general Henri Le Rond suggested a new plan for division of the area, which was prepared by an ambassadors commission in Paris on 20 October 1921. The division - which became effective by 20 June 1922 - still created a situation in which some rural territories that voted mostly for Poland were granted to Germany and some urban territories with a German majority were granted to Poland. The Polish Sejm decided that the eastern-most Upper Silesian areas should become an autonomous area within Poland organised as the Silesian Voivodeship and with Silesian Parliament as a constituency and Silesian Voivodeship Council as the executive body. The part of Silesia awarded to Poland was by far the best-developed and richest region of the newly formed state, producing most of Poland's industrial output.

The deployment would be highly unusual, as Japan's non-aggressive constitution means Japanese military forces can only be used for defensive purposes. The issue has been controversial in Japan, although the ruling party maintains this should be seen as fighting crime on the high seas, rather than a \"military\" operation. The process of the Prime Minister of Japan, Taro Aso, giving his approval is expected to take approximately one month. However, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Japanese government face legal problems on how to handle attacks by pirates against ships that either have Japanese personnel, cargo or are under foreign control instead of being under Japanese control as current Article 9 regulations would hamper their actions when deployed to Somalia. It was reported on 4 February 2009, that the JMSDF was sending a fact-finding mission led by Gen Nakatani to the region prior to the deployment of the Murasame-class destroyer Samidare and the Takanami-class destroyer Sazanami to the coast of Somalia with a 13-man team composed of Japanese Ministry of Defense personnel, with members coming from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the JMSDF to visit Yemen, Djibouti, Oman, and Bahrain from 8 to 20 February. Both JMSDF vessels are units of the 8th Escort Division of the 4th Escort Flotilla based in Kure, Hiroshima Prefecture. The JMSDF's special forces unit, the Special Boarding Unit is also scheduled to potentially deploy to Somalia. The SBU has been deployed alongside the two destroyers to Somalia on 14 March 2009. According to JMSDF officials, the deployment would \"regain the trust of the shipping industry, which was lost during the war.\" The JMSDF task force would be deployed off the coast of Somalia for 4 months. In its first mission, the Sazanami was able to ward off pirates attempting to hijack a Singaporean cargo ship. In addition, JMSDF P-3Cs are to be deployed in June from Djibouti to conduct surveillance on the Somali coast. The House of Representatives of Japan has passed an anti-piracy bill, calling for the JMSDF to protect non-Japanese ships and nationals, though there are some concerns that the pro-opposition House of Councillors may reject it. The Diet of Japan has passed an anti-piracy law that called for JMSDF forces to protect all foreign ships traveling off the coast of Somalia aside from protecting Japanese-owned/manned ships despite a veto from the House of Councillors, which the House of Representatives has overturned. In 2009, the Murasame-class destroyer Harusame and the Asagiri-class destroyer Amagiri left port from Yokusuka to replace the two destroyers that had been dispatched earlier in March 2009.

By this point, Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi had worked on the series' earlier games and Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1 and was experienced at pitching video games, so Miyamoto provided a team willingly. The Mother 2 development team carried over to the new game's development, though several people left and the team grew in size.

In September 1994, he predicted that Mother 3 development would end around 1996 with a release on Nintendo's then-upcoming console. The team was inspired by Super Mario 64 and felt that they too could creatively flourish by making a 3D world without restrictions.

The name Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim first cropped up only in the 17th century. In the 19th century, the name Thalb\u00f6ckelheim first came to light. On 1 November 1910, municipal council agreed to introduce Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim as the municipality's name. The name Talb\u00f6ckelheim seems to have had its spelling changed in line with the spelling reforms over the years; it is now written without the first H, but the name Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim itself has not been changed in the wake of the German orthography reform of 1996; the \u00df has not been changed to SS. The three prefixes that serve to distinguish the three centres whose names are otherwise the same are all standard German words with well understood meanings: Wald (\u201cforest\u201d); Schlo\u00df (or Schloss in up-to-date spelling; \u201ccastle/palace\u201d); Tal (\u201cdale/valley\u201d). The village chronicle has this to say about the village's name:Until the beginning of the last century (meant here is the 19th century) the village was named after the castle Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim, which still existed in the 17th century. The castle was destroyed by the French in 1688. The village of Thalb\u00f6ckelheim consists of the two constituent centres of Thalb\u00f6ckelheim and Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim: Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim with the ruin of Castle B\u00f6ckelheim lies on the mountainside and the constituent centre of Thalb\u00f6ckelheim lies 0.5\u00a0km away down in the dale. Both constituent centres have roughly the same population figure. The village\u2019s name was changed in quite a peculiar way. In the early part of the last century, in response to an inquiry by the authorities as to what the village was called, because it consisted of two constituent centres, the name Thalb\u00f6ckelheim was given by the then Sch\u00f6ffe (roughly \u201clay jurist\u201d). The Sch\u00f6ffe lived in the constituent centre of Thalb\u00f6ckelheim and a certain selfishness on his part made him want to call the village Thalb\u00f6ckelheim, without regard to the historical importance of the constituent centre of Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim. None of the locally customary rural cadastral names had to do with the name Thalb\u00f6ckelheim, but rather they were named after Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim, like Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheimer M\u00fchlberg, Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheimer Felsenberg, Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheimer Kupfergrube and so on. Wines had earned quite an important reputation as Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheimer in the wine trade, whereas Thalb\u00f6ckelheim never cropped up in the wine trade. Municipal council asked on these grounds to have the historical name Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim reinstated, as it was already well known throughout Germany for Emperor Heinrich IV\u2019s imprisonment at Castle B\u00f6ckelheim (1105).Also given as grounds for the reversion to the older name was the name's recognizability in winegrowing and the wine trade. A decree made on 22 April 1911 approved the municipality's application. Since this time, the two constituent centres of Thalb\u00f6ckelheim and Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim have been united under the collective name \u201cSchlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim\u201d. Among the places in the middle Naheraum (regions flanking the Nahe), Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim belongs among those places that were already often being mentioned in the Middle Ages. Castle B\u00f6ckelheim, built on what was to become Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim's municipal area, was among the oldest in the region. Generally regarded as the village's first documentary mention is a document from 16 February 824. Late in 1105, Emperor Heinrich V, the last of the Salian dynasty, had his father, Emperor Heinrich IV taken prisoner in Ingelheim and then brought to Castle B\u00f6ckelheim to be held prisoner there. In 1688, the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf\u00e4lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession) broke out. That year, the castle was destroyed on French orders.\n Link Information: Holy Roman Emperor\n\nHenry IV (; 11 November 1050 \u2013 7 August 1106) Question: How much older was Emperor Heinrich's father than he was when he was taken prisoner in Ingleheim?", "output": "Answer: 31", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

The monarch, disregarding the production and trade roles of the missions, saw a greater need for secular pueblos to be established as the centers of agriculture and commerce to supply the crown's ever-growing military presence in \"Nueva California.\" The priests at the missions ignored the royal mandate and continued their ranching, trading and production of tallow, soap, hides, and beef, often in competition with new pueblo ventures.\n Link Information: Felipe de Neve (1724\u20131784) Question: At what age did the first Spanish governor of Las Californias when die?", "output": "Answer: 60", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

The previous record was 63, originally set by Tom Dempsey (1970) and then matched by Jason Elam (1998), Sebastian Janikowski (2011), David Akers (2012), Graham Gano (2018), and Brett Maher (2019). The record in the CFL is 62 yards, set by Paul McCallum on October 27, 2001. High school, college and most professional football leagues offer only a three-point field goal; however, some professional leagues have encouraged more rare kicks through four-point field goals. NFL Europe encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three (much like Australian rules' Super Goal or basketball's three-point line), a rule since adopted by the Stars Football League. Similarly, the sport of arena football sought (unsuccessfully) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points; it failed, since only one kicker (Brian Mitchell) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency.

The foreword of the book was written by Grafton Elliot Smith. The work covers the earliest settlement of Britain by the first modern humans from around 35,000 years ago during the Aurignacian (pp.\u00a019\u201327). In the book, Mackenzie maintains that the Caucasoid Cro-Magnons who settled in Britain were dark haired and dark eyed, racially akin to the French Basques, Iberians and Berbers of North Africa (p.\u00a025), who he theorised were one of the earliest representatives of the Mediterranean race. This indigenous proto-Mediterranean racial stock was later invaded by another \"variety of the Mediterranean race\" who initiated the Solutrean culture around 20,000 years ago (p.\u00a050). According to Mackenzie, the Aurignacian and Solutrean peoples of Britain traded in shells with Cro-Magnons of France. They later intermingled with later arriving Caucasoid racial types, including the proto-Alpines (Furfooz race), who were brachycelphalic (broad-skulled) and a Lappid race, who had minor Eskimo phenotypic traits. Mackenzie also believed that there was a highly depigmentated racial type in small numbers in Britain during the Magdalenian, perhaps who were also blonde, who intermingled with the \"dark Iberians\" (p.\u00a060). During the Neolithic, Mackenzie believed that the predominant racial type of Britain continued to be Mediterranoid: \"The carriers of Neolithic culture were in the main Iberians of Mediterranean racial type\" (p.\u00a0126) who traded in pearls and ores. Regarding Bronze Age Britain, Mackenzie devoted several chapters supporting his theory that traders and \"prospectors\" (miners) arrived in Britain c. 2500 BC, originally from the Eastern Mediterranean (pp.\u00a098\u2013101). This theory was initially developed by Harold Peake, who coined the term \"Prospector Theory\". In the scientific literature of Carleton S. Coon (1939), the theory was revived, and the Mediterraneans who colonised Britain during the late Neolithic or Bronze Age were associated with the Medway megaliths (or long-barrow Megalithic culture). Joseph Deniker earlier called these colonists \"Atlanto-Mediterranean\". Mackenzie believed that these Mediterraneans who colonised parts of Britain survived well into later historic periods (p.\u00a0118) and that the Mediterranean race in general was the bulk racial stock of Britain from Paleolithic through to the Neolithic and to more recent periods. They had black or brown hair, and swarthy skin \"like those of the Southern Italians\" (p.\u00a0126) and have survived in numerous pockets of Britain to the modern day (p.\u00a0139) despite that the later Anglo-Saxon and Norse settlement, who were fairer in appearance, Mackenzie believed their genetic input or admixture was very limited but that they subjugated the British imposing a new civilization and culture (p.\u00a0227).\n Link Information: none Question: How long did Grafton Elliot Smith know Donald Alexander Mackenzie at the time he wrote the foreword of Ancient Man in Britain?", "output": "Answer: none", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

The USSR countered by rapidly developing their own nuclear weapons, surprising the US with their first test in 1949. In turn, the U.S. countered by developing the vastly more powerful thermonuclear weapon, testing their first hydrogen bomb in 1952 at Ivy Mike, but the USSR quickly countered by testing their own thermonuclear weapons, with a test in 1953 of a semi-thermonuclear weapon of the Sloika design, and in 1956, with the testing of Sakharov's Third Idea \u2013 equivalent to the Castle Bravo device. Meanwhile, tensions between the two nations rose as 1956 saw the suppression of Hungary by the Soviets; the U.S. and European nations drew certain conclusions from that event, while in the U.S., a powerful social backlash was afoot, prompted by Senator Joseph McCarthy, the House Un-American Activities Committee, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, U.S. citizens executed in 1953 after conviction of espionage. This atmosphere was further inflamed by the 1957 launch of Sputnik, which led to fears of Communists attacking from outer space, as well as concerns that if the Soviets could launch a device into orbit, they could equally cause a device to re-enter the atmosphere and impact any part of the planet.

Kennedy capitalized on this situation by emphasizing the Bomber gap and the Missile gap, areas in which the Soviets were (inaccurately) perceived as leading the United States, while heated Soviet rhetoric added to political pressure.

They originated from the Donghu people who splintered into the Wuhuan and Xianbei when they were defeated by the Xiongnu at the end of the 3rd century BC. The Xianbei were largely subordinate to larger nomadic powers and the Han dynasty until they gained prominence in 87 AD by killing the Xiongnu chanyu Youliu. However unlike the Xiongnu, the Xianbei political structure lacked the organization to pose a concerted challenge to the Chinese for most of their time as a nomadic people. After suffering several defeats by the end of the Three Kingdoms period, the Xianbei migrated south and settled in close proximity to Chinese society and submitted as vassals, being granted the titles of Dukes. As the Xianbei Murong, Tuoba and Duan tribes were one of the Five Barbarians who were vassals of the Han Chinese Western Jin and Eastern Jin dynasties, they took part in the Uprising of the Five Barbarians as allies of the Han Chinese Eastern Jin against the other four barbarians, the Xiongnu, Jie, Di and Qiang. The Xianbei were at one point all defeated and conquered by the Di Former Qin empire before it fell apart at the Battle of Fei River at the hands of the Eastern Jin. The Xianbei later founded their own states and reunited northern China as the Northern Wei. These states opposed and promoted sinicization at one point or another but trended towards the latter and had merged with the general Chinese population by the Tang dynasty.\n Link Information: Emperor He (r.\u00a088\u2013105 AD) Question: Who was the Han emperor when the Xianbei killed the Xiongnu chanyu Youliu?", "output": "Answer: Emperor He", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

The Korean War began and the Navy realized it had a need for an air station in the region. Cubi Point in the Philippines was selected, and civilian contractors were initially approached for the project. After seeing the Zambales Mountains and the surrounding jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The U.S. Navy then turned to the Seabees and was told no problem, Can do. The first Seabees to arrive were surveyors of Construction Battalion Detachment 1802. Moblie Comstruction Battalion 3 arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November.

Formed by John Gorham, the unit served as the prototype for many subsequent ranger forces, including the better known Rogers' Rangers. The unit started out as a Massachusetts provincial auxiliary company, which means it was not part of the province's normal militia system. Recruited in the summer of 1744 at the start of King George's War, Governor William Shirley ordered the unit raised as reinforcements for the then-besieged British garrison at Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal. Over the next eight years the unit proved remarkably effective at suppressing Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance to British rule in Nova Scotia and helped to both expand and secure the British sphere of influence in the region. Initially a sixty-man all-Indian company led by British colonial officers, the original Native American members of the unit were gradually replaced by Anglo-Americans and recent Scots and Irish immigrants and were a minority in the unit by the mid-1750s. The company were reconnaissance experts as well as renowned for their expertise at both water-borne operations and frontier guerrilla warfare. They were known for surprise amphibious raids on Acadian and Mi'kmaq coastal or riverine settlements, using large whaleboats, which carried between ten and fifteen rangers each. This small unit was the main British military force defending Nova Scotia from 1744 to 1749.

The Representation of the People Act 1928 extended equal suffrage to both men and women. It also shifted the socioeconomic makeup of the electorate towards the working class, favouring the Labour Party, which was more sympathetic to women's issues. The 1918 election gave Labour the most seats in the house to date. The electoral reforms also allowed women to run for Parliament. Specifically, the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 gave women over 21 the right to stand for election as an MP. Christabel Pankhurst narrowly failed to win a seat in 1918, but in 1919 and 1920, both Lady Astor and Margaret Wintringham won seats for the Conservatives and Liberals respectively by succeeding their husband's seats.

Even basic information is subject to uncertainty and controversy. Born at Torquemada, Palencia, north central Spain, at an unknown date before 1566 (Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla argues in detail for 1562) he was brought by his parents to New Spain probably while still a child. He took the Franciscan habit, as is generally agreed, in 1579, and pursued a course of studies in Latin, theology, philosophy and Nahuatl. Brief notices in his own works put him at the convent in Tlacopan in 1582 and (while still a youth) at the convent in Chiauhtla - the presumption being that these relate to his novitiate. It is uncertain if he began his studies at the convento mayor de San Francisco in Mexico City, but it is presumed that part at least of his studies were conducted while resident at the convent of Santiago, Tlatelolco. Among his teachers he names fray Juan Bautista (who taught him theology) and Antonio Valeriano (who taught him Nahuatl and whom he especially praised for his talents). At some time in the early 1580s he was sent by his superiors to Guatemala where he encountered the conquistador Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo.

The moral guidelines set down by Roman Catholic magisterial teachings of Natural Moral Law are mostly upheld in that intrinsically evil acts are still classified so. In certain situations where there is a balance of ontic goods and ontic evils (ontic evils are those that are not immoral but merely cause pain or suffering, ontic goods are those that alleviate pain or suffering). Proportionalism asserts that one can determine the right course of action by weighing up the good and the necessary evil caused by the action. As a result, proportionalism aims to choose the lesser of evils. Pope John Paul II rules out the 1960s proportionalism in his encyclicals Veritatis Splendor, promulgated in 1993 (cf. section 75), and in Evangelium Vitae, 1995 (cf. article 68).

Wm Theodore de Bary, an East Asian studies expert, describes that \"The final process of collection and codification of the Quran text was guided by one over-arching principle: God's words must not in any way be distorted or sullied by human intervention. For this reason, no serious attempt, apparently, was made to edit the numerous revelations, organize them into thematic units, or present them in chronological order...\".

According to some classical traditions, commentaries and tafsirs the proposed order is 2nd in place right after Muhammad's first revelation. The supporting argument of this surah being the second revelation is that Arabs were unaware of angels in the time of Jahiliyyah and news of Muhammad's first revelation made them curious about the sanity of Muhammad, thus to refute this idea God revealed the first seven ayaat of Surah Qalam.\n Link Information: earlier suras that were revealed to Muhammad at Mecca before the hijrah to Medina in 622 CE.

When the body receives sensory information, the sympathetic nervous system sends a signal to preganglionic nerve fibers, which activate the adrenal medulla through acetylcholine. Once activated, norepinephrine and epinephrine are released directly into the blood by postganglionic nerve fibers where they act as the bodily mechanism for \"fight-or-flight\" responses. Because of this, the sympathoadrenal system plays a large role in maintaining glucose levels, sodium levels, blood pressure, and various other metabolic pathways that couple with bodily responses to the environment. During numerous diseased states, such as hypoglycemia or even stress, the body's metabolic processes are skewed. The sympathoadrenal system works to return the body to homeostasis through the activation or inactivation of the adrenal gland. However, more severe disorders of the sympathoadrenal system such as phaeochromocytoma (a tumor on the adrenal medulla) can affect the body's ability to maintain a homeostatic state. In such cases, curative agents such as adrenergic agonists and antagonists are used to modify epinephrine and norepinephrine levels released by the adrenal medulla.\n Link Information: none Question: Are the chemicals released at the same time?", "output": "Answer: none", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

It was also announced that the editor would be Edward Burlingame, the son of Anson Burlingame, who was already connected to the publishing house as literary adviser. Charles Scribner also noted that the magazine would not be a revival of the formerly published Scribner's Monthly. Charles Scribner's Sons spent over $500,000 in launching Scribner's Magazine to complete with the already successful pictorials, The Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine. Burlingame hired the best artists in his country for the magazine; Howard Pyle, Howard Chandler Christy, Charles Marion Russell, Walter Everett, Maxfield Parrish and Frederic Remington. Before the first issue was released, Charles Scribner's Sons had their first annual \"Scribner's Magazine\" dinner at their main offices. Scribner's Magazine was launched in January 1887, the first issue of which was to be published from January to June of that year. The magazine was printed and bound by Trow's Printing and Bookbinding Company. Scribner's Magazine was also the first magazine to introduce color illustrations later on. The first issue opens with the literary article \"The Downfall to the Empire.\" by E.B. Washburne, the former minister to France. An early morning fire in 1908 at the Charles Scribner's Sons offices heavily burned the third and fourth floors, where the magazine was produced. In May 1914, the magazine's editor, Edward L. Burlingame, retired and Robert Bridges took over as editor. (Bridges was a lifelong close friend of President Woodrow Wilson ever since the two had met as students at Princeton University.) During the First World War, the magazine employed authors, Richard Harding Davis, Edith Wharton and John Galsworthy, to write about the major conflict. During the time of 1917, when the United States joined the war, the magazine had four to six articles on the subject. On the date of November 19, 1922, the first editor of the magazine, Edward L. Burlingame, died. On January 1928 the magazine had a change in format, with the first of the newly formatted issue having a cover design by Rockwell Kent.\n Link Information: Richard Harding Davis (April 18, 1864 \u2013 April 11, 1916) Question: Which of the authors employed by Scribner's Magazine to write about the First World War was the olderst?", "output": "Answer: Edith Wharton ", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

Timmermans became Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs and was responsible for the co-ordination of government policy towards the European Union, and was conferred the diplomatic title of Minister of European Affairs during international visits. A major theme of his time as Undersecretary for European Affairs was to increase support for European integration. This was done both by seeking greater influence of citizens on European policies and by improving communication and public perception; besides citizens the aim was that education should have also be more involved with Europe. The Treaty of Lisbon was signed whilst he was Undersecretary, before which Timmermans and Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende successfully lobbied to secure a greater role for national parliaments in European Union decision-making processes. In February 2010, NATO officially requested the Netherlands to extend its military involvement in Task Force Uruzgan.

Even basic information is subject to uncertainty and controversy. Born at Torquemada, Palencia, north central Spain, at an unknown date before 1566 (Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla argues in detail for 1562) he was brought by his parents to New Spain probably while still a child. He took the Franciscan habit, as is generally agreed, in 1579, and pursued a course of studies in Latin, theology, philosophy and Nahuatl. Brief notices in his own works put him at the convent in Tlacopan in 1582 and (while still a youth) at the convent in Chiauhtla - the presumption being that these relate to his novitiate. It is uncertain if he began his studies at the convento mayor de San Francisco in Mexico City, but it is presumed that part at least of his studies were conducted while resident at the convent of Santiago, Tlatelolco. Among his teachers he names fray Juan Bautista (who taught him theology) and Antonio Valeriano (who taught him Nahuatl and whom he especially praised for his talents). At some time in the early 1580s he was sent by his superiors to Guatemala where he encountered the conquistador Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo. By 1584 he was certainly at the convent of San Francisco, where he assisted in the infirmary.

He left Case Western Reserve to become the section chief of neurochemistry at The Roche Institute of Molecular Biology. Through his research, Sachs discovered the relationship between neurophysin, an intracellular chaperone protein and vasopressin, the neurohormone that is critical for maintaining water balance in the body. He hypothesized that neurophysin and vasopressin are both part of a larger, inactive precursor protein, a prohormone, which is then enzymatically cleaved and processed within the secretory granule to produce and secrete both peptide products. Sachs' hypothesis preceded the discovery of proinsulin by 3 years, and his research laid the foundation for understanding the biosynthesis of all brain peptides and many proteins, which are major constituents involved in brain and neuroendocrine functions. Sachs showed that vasopressin was first synthesized as a prohormone in specialized nerve cells (called neurosecretory cells) in the hypothalamus and was then transported to the nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary where the vasopressin peptide was completely processed during axonal transport in secretory granules and ultimately secreted into the blood. He also showed that brain tissue could be kept intact and functional for two months in tissue culture, and contributed to the understanding of the interactions between the neuroendocrine neurons and neuroglial cells in the hypothalamal-neurohypophysial system (HNS).\n Link Information: Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) is a private research university in Cleveland, Ohio.

It is also known for being the cause of displacing countless Mexican Angeleno communities, as 19 percent of East Los Angeles is intertwined with freeways. The freeway system grew as multiple freeways were built over two decades: the Santa Ana (5) Freeway (1944), the Hollywood (101) Freeway (1948), the San Bernardino (10) Freeway (1953), the Santa Monica (10) Freeway (extended to the East Los Angeles Interchange in 1961), the Long Beach (710) Freeway (1961), and the Pomona (60) Freeway (1965).Boyle Heights and neighboring communities protested against the first construction phases of the freeways.

The construction of the freeways started as scheduled despite the resistance. The numerous freeways in this era displaced many East Los Angeles residents as they had their homes and property seized.

Boyle Heights was a densely populated area because of low mortgages that were enjoyed by Mexican Angelo families. When families were forced to give up their homes they struggled to find homes that matched in affordability. Some families were also displaced in gang ridden areas and further from the freeways that they never used.

Two brothers from Oslo who both became priests, Hans (1587\u20131648) and Peder Povelsson Paus (1590\u20131653), have long been known as the family's earliest certain ancestors. In his book Slekten Paus (\"The Paus family\"), genealogist S.H. Finne-Gr\u00f8nn traced the family two further generations back, to Hans Olufsson (died 1570), a member of the royal clergy in Norway before and after the Reformation, who served as a canon at the royal chapel in Oslo, St Mary's Church, the seat of government of Norway at the time, and who belonged to the high nobility by virtue of his high ecclesiastical and governmental office. The name Paus is known in Oslo since the 14th century, notably as the name of the Lawspeaker of Oslo Nikolas Paus (mentioned 1329\u20131347) and as the name of one of medieval Oslo's \"city farms\" (mentioned 1324\u20131482) that was probably named after the lawspeaker or his family; while a relation between the older and the younger family of the name in Oslo is plausible, it has not been established. Regardless, the modern Paus family is likely the only surviving family to hail from the medieval city of Oslo which burned down in 1624 without being rebuilt, making it the family with the longest documented history in the Norwegian capital.\n Link Information: The Reformation in Norway was accomplished by force in 1537 Question: How old was Peder Paus during the Reformation?", "output": "Answer: 0", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

Apparently, during the first plunder of Cetinje, after the Battle of Vrtijeljka, the forces of S\u00fcleyman Bushati did not gravely damage the monastery. Their idea was to pacify Montenegrins, and prevent them from aiding Venetian war effort. On the other hand, his army comprised a considerable amount of forcibly mobilised Christians, and he was afraid of mutiny. The popular tale has it that expeditionary force did start to rob the monastery, however, as one of the soldiers was trying to take down a cross from the top of the roof, he was struck by lightning, which was immediately perceived as Gods sign. In 1689, the Venetians were invited to take control of Cetinje. As they arrived, they quickly fortified themselves in the monastery and in the nearby former court of Crnojevi\u0107. It thus served as a garrison for three years, when Cetinje was attacked again by Suleyman on 25 September 1692. Instead of fighting, Venetians entered negotiations, and reached an agreement to abandon the monastery under honorable terms. However, they mined a monastery with a time bomb, which set of in the evening hours, right after Venetians retreated and as the Ottomans were victoriously entering the monastery, killing many of them in the process. This resulted in seat of Metropolitanate being moved to Dobrska \u0106elija monastery for some time. Vladika Danilo reestablished it, in 1701 or 1704, across the site of the first location, atop the remains of the court with stone from the old one, and added a tablet with the coat of arms of the Crnojevi\u0107 family, and a dedication to Ivan Crnojevi\u0107. Before 1714, it was burnt, and then it was reconstructed yet again around 1743 by Metropolitan Sava Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161. It was the center of spiritual, cultural and political life of the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro. Its importance is clearly emphasised in Prince-Bishop Vasilije's exaggerated claim, written in his \"History of Montenegro\", that ... before its destruction, Cetinje Monastery was among the most beautiful monasteries in Europe. The last time monastery was devastated was in 1785, when Mahmud Pasha Bushati sacked Cetinje. Ultimately defeated in the Battle of Krusi, his severed head is since then kept as a relic in the monastery. It has been built on several times, the current appearance dates to 1927. The original site of the monastery, known as \u0106ipur (after Greek word \u039a\u03ae\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 - Garden) was used in 1886 by Prince Nicholas of Montenegro for his Court church. The position of the newly built church follows the lineup of the original one from inside the monastery complex.

She introduced the term \u201cthe dark side of evangelicalism\u201d to draw attention to the ways that popular culture such as horror films and apocalyptic video games draw upon Christianity\u2019s historic narratives of demons, hell, and the afterlife, often in ways leaders of religious conservative movements reject in spite of the perennial interest these stories garner among young people. Basing her findings on the differing ways in which young people respond to popular cultural stories of the supernatural, Clark argued against the media effects perspective. Instead of people taking media alternatives more seriously than those of religion, popular media narratives reflect and contribute to ongoing challenges to traditional religious authority as lived out in everyday life.

The match concept involved a 15 foot tall steel cage surrounding the wrestling ring. The competitors, so far always four, would each be attached by the wrist to a long chain where the other end is attached to the cage. The object of the match is to reach the key to the lock that is hung from the cage. Once a wrestler has the key he is able to unlock himself and climb out of the cage, thus escaping the match. The last man left in the ring would be forced to unmask and reveal his real name if he is masked, or have his hair shaved totally off if he is unmasked, as per the Luchas de Apuestas traditions. For the match Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. and Cien Caras, Jr. both risk their mask on the outcome while Pirata Morgan and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000, Jr. risk their hair. Of the four wrestlers involved M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000, Jr. has only lost one Apuestas match, which forced him to unmask, while Pirata Morgan has lost a number of Apuestas matches and thus been shaved bald on multiple occasions in his 30-plus year career. Cien Caras, Jr. and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000, Jr. had at this point been teaming together since 2007, forming Los Capos Junior along with Hijo de M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000, with no storyline signs of tension or friction between the two before the match was announced. Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. had not worked for IWRG on a regular basis since 2006 and not worked for IWRG in the months leading up to the Prisi\u00f3n Fatal show, making his inclusion in the steel cage match a bit of a surprise. Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. had been involved in a long running storyline feud with Los Capos, including M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000, Jr.'s father M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000, the storyline father of Cien Caras, Jr., Cien Caras and Universo 2000, but that storyline had up until the time of the show being announced only sporadically involved the second generation Capos, primarily when Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. teamed up with his son Rayman to take on the senior/junior M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000s. Pirata Morgan and his sons had been a regular worker for IWRG for several years and had at times wrestled Los Capos Junior, but this had never escalated into a long running storyline feud. The first real interaction between the factions in the main event of the Prisi\u00f3n Fatal show happened on March 10, 2013 during the main event of an IWRG event where Cien Caras, Jr. and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000, Jr. teamed up with Hijo de M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 to take on the team of Hijo de Pirata Morgan, Pirata Morgan and Electroshock. During the match Cien Caras, Jr. used an illegal low blow on Hijo de Pirata Morgan to win the first fall for his team, taking advantage of the fact that all six competitors were in the ring at the same time, distracting the referee. During the second fall Pirata Morgan tried to gain a measure of revenge for his son and pulled Cien Caras, Jr.'s mask off, but this illegal move was noticed by the referee who disqualified his team for the overall loss.

Biblical scholars regard it as obvious, from their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that originally Ephraim and Manasseh were considered one tribe \u2013 that of Joseph. The Book of Revelation, however, accords only Ephraim the tribal name of Joseph. According to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was originally part of the suggested Ephraim-Manasseh single \"Joseph\" tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost. A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the Joseph tribes (including Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites which went to Egypt and returned, while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in Canaan throughout. According to this view, the story of Jacob's visit to Laban to obtain a wife originated as a metaphor for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt; according to textual scholars, the Jahwist version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and does not mention the other tribal matriarchs at all. \n Link Information: Benjamin was born in Canaan Question: In what city was Joseph's brother born?", "output": "Answer: Canaan", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

The first practical large-scale method of blood plasma fractionation was developed by Edwin J. Cohn during World War II. It is known as the Cohn process (or Cohn method). This process is also known as cold ethanol fractionation as it involves gradually increasing the concentration of ethanol in the solution at 5C and 3C. The Cohn Process exploits differences in properties of the various plasma proteins, specifically, the high solubility and low pI of albumin. As the ethanol concentration is increased in stages from 0% to 40% the [pH] is lowered from neutral (pH ~ 7) to about 4.8, which is near the pI of albumin. At each stage certain proteins are precipitated out of the solution and removed. The final precipitate is purified albumin. Several variations to this process exist, including an adapted method by Nitschmann and Kistler that uses fewer steps and replaces centrifugation and bulk freezing with filtration and diafiltration.\n Link Information: Edwin Joseph Cohn (December 17, 1892 \u2013 October 1, 1953) Question: When was Cohen born?", "output": "Answer: December 17, 1892", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

Like Mezmerize, it debuted at No. 1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with The Beatles, Guns N' Roses, and rappers 2Pac and DMX, the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at No. 1 in the same year. In February 2006, System of a Down won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for \"B.Y.O.B.\", beating out other established artists such as Nine Inch Nails and Robert Plant. Their second single off the Hypnotize album, \"Lonely Day\" was released in March in the United States. System of a Down released \"Kill Rock 'N Roll\" and \"Vicinity of Obscenity\" as their next promo singles. The band headlined Ozzfest 2006 in cities where tour founder Ozzy Osbourne opted not to appear or was not playing on the main stage (with the exception of the show at Randall's Island, where Ozzy Osbourne headlined the second stage before System of a Down's performance that night).\n Link Information: \n\nMezmerize is the fourth studio album by Armenian-American heavy metal band System of a Down, released on May 17, 2005  Question: Of System of a Down's double albums to debut at Number 1 in the US, which came first?", "output": "Answer: Mezmerize", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

The sound is first rate, for one thing, and director Pierre Adidge has some idea of why Cocker electrifies a crowd.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film a \"most satisfying, record-album of a movie\" which \"patronizes neither its audience nor its stars ... It is uncluttered, one of the best concert films so far.\" A review in Variety said, \"Considerable technical expertise has gone into this production, and though the objective may be clear, it just hasn't turned out to be another 'Woodstock,' possibly because Joe Cocker's personality isn't all that endearing.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune rated the film three stars out of four and wrote, \"'Mad Dogs' is distinguishable from other 'rockumentaries' because it deals almost exclusively with the musician and his music. There are few side trips to cultural comments.\" Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times stated, \"As a film, 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen' is a good concert. For much of the picture's 114 minutes, the camera is on Joe Cocker, by most standards the best and most exciting singer in rock music ... But 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen,' unfortunately, fails in the end to rise above this interesting, but clearly limited historical summary of the Cocker tour. As a film, it doesn't establish its own importance.\" A negative review by Tom Zito of The Washington Post advised readers to \"Forget the film and try the record,\" explaining, \"What emerges from all this is roughly two hours of footage that looks terrible on the screen and sounds almost as bad. The film is projected in an annoying square format, except for the moments when the screen area is broken up into some poorly coordinated split-screen effects. The camerawork is often sloppy ... the whole thing winds up looking and sounding like a cheap, imitation (indoor) 'Woodstock.'\" James D. White of The Monthly Film Bulletin declared that \"The music itself is excellent,\" but \"The film's information content is minimal; and one's heart sinks as the screen is split into a double image for the first number and as the mandatory shots\u2014of excited fans, of joint-rolling in a hotel bedroom, of an interview with a vacuous groupie\u2014are inevitably wheeled out.\"\n Link Information: \"Forget the film and try the record,\" Question: Of the newspapers that gave Mad Dogs & Englishmen a poor review, which was established last?", "output": "Answer: The Washington Post", "category": "Question Answering 866.json"}]
