With the number of people visiting this place increasing each year, the chances are great that any of us may damage the natural environment along the Trail and affect the experience for others. So please do your part by following these hiking and camping practices, and encourage others to learn about and adopt these techniques. 1 Plan ahead and prepare. Evaluate the risks associated with your outing, identify campsites and destinations in advance, and use maps and guides. Prepare for extreme weather, dangers, and emergencies - especially the cold - to avoid impacts   from searches, rescues, and campfires. Learn when areas are most crowded and try to avoid those times. 2 Dispose of waste properly. Pack out all trash and food waste, including that left behind by others. Don't bury trash or food, and don't try to burn packaging materials in campfires. Use the privy   for human waste only. Do not add trash. If there is no privy, dispose of human waste by burying it in a hole, a hole at least 200 feet (80 steps) from campsites, water sources and shelters, and well away from trails. 3 Leave what you find. Leave plants, cultural artifacts   and other natural objects where you found them for others to enjoy. Do not damage live trees or plants; green wood burns poorly. Collect only firewood that is dead, down, and no larger than your wrist. Leave dead standing trees and dead limbs on standing trees for the wildlife. 4 Minimize campfire impacts. Use stoves for cooking - if you need a fire, build one only where it's legal and in an existing fire ring. Keep fires small. Never leave your campfire unattended, and drown it when you leave. Do not try to burn trash, including plastic, glass, cans, tea bags, food, or anything with food on it. These items do not burn thoroughly. They create harmful fumes  , and attract wildlife like skunks and bears. \n Answer: avoid crowded periods and book a hotel in advance", "output": "Before you hike on the Appalachian Trail, you are advised to   _  .", "category": "Question Generation 1276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

I followed Ged's adventures and his gradual transformation from a wild and proud kid into a wise,powerful wizard.     A Wizard of Earthsea begins in Ged's own village where he,a kid of 7,learns his first magic from his aunt. Five years later he starts to learn from Ogion the Wizard. But Ogion teaches him patience-not magic-so Ged leaves him and sails to the island of Roke to learn the art in a real School of Magic. There the boy is so proud that he plays with forbidden spells -he frees into this world a terrible shadow horn the land of the dead,leading to the death of Nemmerle,the head of the school. Now Ged must try to overcome this shadow before it controls him. Finally,Ged guesses its secret and saves the world-and himself-from a terrible danger. He knows now the patience is indeed the greatest of arts,and names Ogion his only true master. Ursula K.

The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative  effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep. But now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \"culture of fear\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history. These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them. Government must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars. There is no doubt that traffic danger, unlike stranger danger, is a real threat to children and a constant worry for parents.  Around 100 child pedestrians  are killed every year, a figure that puts the UK near the bottom of Europe's child road safety league. It is no surprise that figures show a steady fall in children walking or cycling over the last twenty years, to the extent that while over 90% of children own a bicycle, just 2% cycle to school. Also, 30% of children aged eight to ten never play outside without an adult watching over them. In a single generation, the \"home habitat\" of a typical eight-year-old----the area in which children are able to travel on their own- has shrunk to one-ninth of its former size. Health experts have even created a new word, \"obesogenic\", to describe those aspects of our lives that make us fat, and top of the list is the design of streets, towns and cities. \n Answer: exercising the mind", "output": "Playing outside is just as important as   _   .", "category": "Question Generation 1276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

The American Journal of Epidemiology   did a study in 2010 on the correlation   between sitting and an individual's physical health. In the study, 53,440 working men and 69,776 working women were surveyed on their time spent sitting. The subjects were all disease free when employed. The researchers identified 11,307 deaths in men and 7,923 deaths in women during the 14-year follow-up. The findings: Women who reported sitting for more than six hours per day had an approximately 40 higher all-cause death rate than those who reported less than three hours a day, and men had an approximately 20 higher death rate.

So what can you do if you have to work for a living at a job that requires a lot of sitting? Here are some ideas: Take frequent breaks. It is recommended that workers vary activities, change their position, and take short breaks every 20 minutes to rest muscles and increase blood circulation. Get a standing desk. Some studies have shown that working from an upright position may be better for health. The serious fitness people can even purchase a treadmill   desk. It only goes about one mile per hour.

Diane Fossey was murdered in Rwanda in 1985 and her story was made into the popular filmGorillas in the Mist. It was a long way fromKing Kong, which is about a gorilla as a monster (a frightening animal), and helped to show a new idea: the real monster is man, while the gorilla is to be admired.

From the Congo in West Africa, to Rwanda and Uganda further east, they are endangered by hunting and by the cutting down of their forest homes. Some time ago, I found in my letterbox a little magazine from the World Wide Fund for Nature. It had two photos side by side.

In the beginning, the games were open only to amateurs. An amateur is a person whose involvement in an activity---from sports to science or the arts---is purely for pleasure. Amateurs, whatever their contributions to a field, expect to receive no form of compensation ; professionals, in contrast, perform their work in order to earn a living. From the perspective of many athletes, however, the Olympic playing field has been far from level. Restricting the Olympics to amateurs has precluded  the participation of many who could not afford to be unpaid. Countries have always desired to send their best athletes, not their wealthiest ones, to the Olympic Games. A slender and imprecise line separates what we call \"financial support\" from \"earning money.\" Do athletes \"earn money\" if they are reimbursed  for travel expenses? What if they are paid for time lost at work or if they accept free clothing from a manufacturer or if they teach sports for a living? The runner Eric Liddell was the son of poor missionaries; in 1924 the British Olympic Committee financed his trip to the Olympics, where he won a gold and a bronze medal. College scholarships and support from the United States Olympic Committee made it possible for American track stars Jesse Owens and Wilma Rudolph and speed skater Dan Jansen to train and compete. When the Soviet Union and its allies joined the games in 1952, the definition of amateur became still muddier. Their athletes did not have to balance jobs and training because as citizens in communist regimes, their government financial support was not considered payment for jobs. In 1971 the International Olympic Committee(IOC) removed the word amateur from the rules, making it easier for athletes to find the support necessary to train and compete. In 1986 the IOC allowed professional athletes into the games. There are those who regret the disappearance of amateurism from the Olympic Games. For them the games lost something special when they became just another way for athletes to earn money. Others say that the designation of amateurism was always questionable; they argue that all competitors receive so much financial support as to make them paid professionals. Most agree, however, that the debate over what constitutes an \"amateur\" will continue for a long time. \n Answer: developing Olympic-level skills in athletes is costly", "output": "One might infer that   _  .", "category": "Question Generation 1276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Washoe was born in 1965 in Africa, where she was captured by the Air Force and taken to the US for research use in the space program. In 1966, she left the program and began living with two scientists, Allen and Beatrix Gardner, who led a project to teach the chimp American Sign Language (ASL) in Washoe, Nevada, for which it was named. Washoe had been living on Central Washington University's Ellensburg Campus since 1980. She had a vocabulary of about 250 words. Also, Washoe taught sign language to three younger chimps: Tatu, 31, Loulis, 29, and Dar, 31 Primate   researcher Jane Goodall, in Fouts' book Next of Kin, noted the importance of the work with Washoe. \"Roger, through his ongoing conversations with Washoe and her extended family, has opened a window into a chimpanzee's mind,\" Goodall said. Though previous efforts to teach chimps spoken languages had failed, the researchers believed there was a better chance using signs. But Washoe's language skills were disputed by scientists who believed that language is unique to humans.

The small island of Puerto Rico is in the West Indies, off the coast of Florida. This is where all the hurricanes begin that strike the east coast of the United States. Often they pass near Puerto Rico or cross it on their way north. The people of Puerto Rico expect some of these unwelcome visitors every year. Each one is named after the Saint's Day on which it arrives. Two of the most destructive storms were the Santo Ana in 1840 and the San Ciriaco in 1899. Giving girls' names to hurricanes is a fairly new idea. It all began with a story called \"Storm\", written by George Stewart in 1941. In it a weatherman amused himself by naming storms after girls he knew. He named one Maria. The story describes how she Maria grew and developed, and how she changed the lives of people when she struck the United States. Weathermen of the U.S. Army and Navy used the same system during World WarII. They were studying weather conditions over the Pacific Ocean. One of their duties was to warn American ships and planes when a storm was coming. Whenever they spotted one, they gave it a girl's name. The first one of the year was given a name beginning with [A]. The second one got a name beginning with [B]. They used all the letters from A to W, and still the storms kept coming. They had to use three lists from A to W to have enough names to go around. This was the first list of hurricane names that followed the alphabet. It served as a model for the system the Weather Bureau   introduced in 1942. Before 1950 the Weather Bureau had no special system for naming hurricanes. When a hurricane was born down in the West Indies, the Weather Bureau simply collected information about it. It reported how fast the storm was moving and where it would go next. Weather reports warned people in the path of the hurricane, so that they could do whatever was necessary to protect themselves. This system worked out fine as long as weather reports talked about only one hurricane at a time. But one week in September 1950 there were three hurricanes at the same time. The things began to get confused. Some people got the hurricanes mixed up and didn't know which was which. This convinced the Weather Bureau that it needed a code for naming the storms in order to avoid confusion in the future. \n Answer: date on which they occurred", "output": "Hurricanes were first named after the    _   .", "category": "Question Generation 1276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Of those who did read, women and pensioners   were the most eager readers, and religious works and popular fiction were the top choices.

The number also showed that those with college degrees read the most, and people aged 50 and over read more than those who are younger. People from the West and Midwest are more likely to have read at least one book in the past year. Southerners who do read tend to read more books -- mostly religious books and romance novels -- than people from other regions. Those who said they never attend religious services read nearly twice as many books as those who attend frequently, but the Bible and religious works were read by two thirds of the people in the survey, more than all the other categories. Popular fiction, histories, biographies and mysteries took up about half, while one in five read romance novels. Politics, poetry and classical literature were named by fewer than 5% of readers. More women than men read every major category of books except for history and biography books. Men tend to prefer non-fiction.

It's one of the most controversial practices in agriculture: feeding small amounts of antibiotics to animals in order to make them grow faster. But what if the drugs don't even work very well? There's some good evidence that they don't, at least in pigs. They used to deliver a boost in growth, but that effect has disappeared in recent years or declined greatly. The reason for this is interesting and even paradoxical. Researchers think the antibiotics used to work by suppressing low-grade infections. In recent years, however, pork producers found other ways to accomplish the same thing through improved hygiene  . As a result, the drugs have become largely superfluous -- yet many farmers still use them. To understand how this happened, you have to step back in time, says Steve Dritz, a specialist in pig nutrition at Kansas State University. Sixty years ago, when antibiotics were new, \"people started treating animals, and feeding [the antibiotics], and finding that they had increased growth rates and feed efficiencies,\" he says. Nursery-age pigs, for instance, grew 12 to 15 percent faster with antibiotics. The animals also needed less feed to reach full weight. Other studies showed similar results in chickens and cattle. In the 1980s, a new set of studies found similar effects. So the growth-promoting effects of antibiotics became standard practice among meat producers. Fast forward to the 1990s. Dritz was starting his career as a scientist at Kansas State University, and pork production was changing dramatically.  Previously, pigs were born and raised in one barn or in several barns close together. This meant infections could easily pass from one generation to the next, the way that kids share germs between their friends on the playground and their parents at home. Under the new system, when piglets are weaned, they move to a whole different place. That new site is carefully scrubbed and free of disease. Craig Rowles, who runs a large swine operation in Carroll, Iowa, shows me one such room. There's not a piglet in sight. \"This room just got completely washed and disinfected, and now it's going to sit here and dry for a while,\" he says. A whole group of pigs will come in here together, and later they will move out together to yet another site. \"That group of pigs will stay together until they go to market,\" Rowles says. The groups are kept strictly separated from each other. If workers move between the groups, they first have to change their boots. When farmers adopted multisite production, it cut down on disease -- and pigs actually grew faster. \n Answer: helped animals grow faster", "output": "One of the advantages of using antibiotics in the past is that it   _  .", "category": "Question Generation 1276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

This is because most people do not realize that there is actually a sort of process when it comes to making art so much so that lots of individuals  cannot understand why true artists take their time when creating brilliant works. The reason as to why artists take their time when creating their works is because they will first have to look for something beautiful which will inspire them. This is because an artist is someone who appreciates beauty and captures  the said beauty in a portrait, a song, a novel, and any other forms of artistic medium available to man. Rather than those commercial artists who simply paint a picture because they are paid to do so, a true artist will only work if he or she is inspired. The true artist shall not compromise his or her work because of earth temptations  and as such they run the risk of being ridiculed in exchange for their happiness. History has however shown that the true artist who correctly appreciates beauty is one whose works will end up being celebrated. How does a true artist spot beauty? The only possible way to go about doing this is to actually look at the world. This means that the true artist is someone who loves to walk around and look at new things. Whatever it may be, the point here is that the artist does take a bit of time out to survey the world and find something beautiful which would inspire him. At times it even happens that the object that inspires the artist is not a thing but rather a person. At the end of the day, it must be said that each artist has his own views of what is beautiful and what is not.

The Park Service may also raise entrance fees   . Another problem caused by increased park use is pollution. Some garbage and waste can be cleaned up, and the cleanup can be paid for by increased entrance fees. To cut down on noise pollution and air pollution, the number of cars allowed in parks may be limited. If this happens, people may use buses to travel around the parks. Officials may also limit the use of jet-skis, snow-mobiles, motor-boats, and sightseeing helicopters and planes. The parks may also be in danger because of development that is going on around them. For example, around Yellow Stone Park, many hotels, golf courses, resorts, and other tourist attractions have been built. Some of these developments have effect on areas that are used by animals.

A team from the School of Dentistry's Violence Research Group studied drinking habits in children aged 11 - 16 in England. They found not only a link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit, even if they weren't violent themselves. The researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk. Current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization. More than 4,000 children were surveyed at 13 schools at four local authorities in the North, the Midlands, London, and the South. The study found that 25% of 11-year-olds were drinking monthly and 3.6% daily, with 12.8% admitting to getting drunk 3 to 5 times a year. By the age of 16, 40% were drinking weekly and 6.2% were drinking every day. The research also showed 22.6% of 16-year-olds were getting drunk more than 21 times a year. The study, which has just been published in the Journal of Adolescence, found a strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people. However, children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit. Adolescents  who drank but didn't get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight. Professor Jonathan Shepherd, who led the research, said a lot of previous alcohol-related violence work had focused on the offenders  rather than the victims. His team is calling for more prevention work from parents and teachers in the first two years of secondary school by taking advantage of the \"teachable moment\", that is, immediately after a student has missed school because of drunkenness. Previous work by Professor Jonathan Shepherd has shown drinkers may be more at risk of violence because of reduced physical co-ordination, poor decision-making in threatening situations and isolation while out late at night. He said, \"This new study seems to be the first to show a direct link between alcohol misuse and victimization.

Joggers have been found to live an average of six years longer than those who don't jog.  However, you'll have to run for at least one hour a week for benefit, according to a new study in Denmark.  Researchers found that jogging was associated with a 44 per cent reduction in the   risk of death for those over 35 years compared with deaths among those who did not run.  The same benefit applied to both men and women.  The 44 per cent reduction translates to an 'age-adjusted survival benefit' of 6.2 years in men and 5.6 years in women, according to Dr. Peter Schnohr, chief cardiologist from the Copenhagen City Heart study. Furthermore, the jogger's lives are not only longer but happier too as those who ran reported an overall sense of well-being, said Schnohr.  The results of our research allow us to definitively answer the question of whether jogging is good for your health,' Schnohr said in a statement. 'We can say with certainty that regular jogging increases longevity. The good news is that you don't actually need to do that much to reap the benefits,' he continued.  The study also found that the optimum benefit of jogging was for those who jogged at a slow-to-average pace for between an hour and two and a half hours spread over two or three weekly sessions.

A study has found that marrying later in life is generally financially benfeicial for women,but not for men. The University of Virginia has published a report that college-educated women who get married in their thirties earn an average of 56 percent more than those who wed a decade earlier. In contrast,men who settle down in their twenties have higher intomes than those who wait until after 30,whatever their education. The Natioal Marriage Project's study,with the title:The Benefits and Costs of Delayed Marriage in America,examines the consequences of marrying later,a growing trend in the US. It notes that the average age of marriage is ag an all-time high of 27 for women and 29 for men,compared to 1990 when the averages were 23 for women and 26for men. But while wome have actually benefited financially from delayed marriages,men who getmarried earlier in life tend to be more successful later on. The study says that childbirth plays a role in these results. Around tow-thirds of lifetime income growth takes place during the first ten years of a career,according to clinical psychologist Meg Jay. Since college-educated women who marry in their twenties also tend to have their first baby earlier,forcing them to take a break from their careers. But getting hiched at a younger age tends to be a good career move for men,perhaps because married men are more sure of themselves and they have more responsibility for their family compared to single men ,leadng to more productivity,suggests Business Insider. The study also found that while college-deucated women profit from delayed marriage,those without a degree do not. In fact,among women who drop out of high school, 83 percent of first births are to unmarried mothers,according to the study.

He had already passed sixty of the stages leading to it, and he had brought from his journey nothing but errors and remorse. Now his health was poor, his mind vacant, his heart sorrowful, and his old age short of comforts.

Some report feeling as if they are floating above their own bodies, while others find themselves drawn towards a blinding light. But out-of-body experiences are nothing more than a trick of the mind, scientists claim. They say that common spooky scenarios, such as floating above a hospital bed or walking towards the light at the end of a tunnel, can be explained by the brain trying to make sense of the process of death. Scientists from the universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge reviewed studies into changes in the brain that cause certain strong feelings associated with near-death experiences. Researcher Caroline Watt said one common vision -- that of people seeing a bright light which seems to be drawing them into the afterlife -- is probably produced by the death of the cells we use to process the light picked up by our eyes and turn it into pictures. \"It is simply your brain trying to make sense of the unusual experiences you are having,\" Dr Watt said. Feelings of being out of the body can also be explained by the brain's behavior, the journal Trends in Cognitive Science reports. \"If you put on a virtual   reality headset   showing an image of yourself three feet in front, you can trick your brain into thinking that is you over there, and get the sense you are outside your body,\" Dr Watt added. The scientific evidence suggests that all aspects of the near-death experience have a biological basis. In another example, the hormone noradrenalin, which is released when we suffer from stress and injuries, could be behind the feelings of love and peace that many experience when they seem to be approaching death. However, other scientists say we should not be so quick to dismiss (stop considering) people's accounts (descriptions). Sam Parnia, of the University of Southampton, stressed that being able to trace something back to the brain does not mean it is not real. Dr Parnia, who is close to completing a three-year study of hospital patients' recollections of their near-death experiences, said, \"Every experience, whether near-death or otherwise -- such as depression, happiness and love -- is mediated   by the brain.\" \n Answer: they are seeing a bright light", "output": "According to the passage, when people are dying, some may have the following feelings except that   _  .", "category": "Question Generation 1276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Two days later, Albert was told to go to the customs office, where an officer told him he had been caught on camera crossing the border illegally.

Then, as the first black president he fought to unite the country and organize the government. Now Nelson Mandela has set his sights on a new enemy, AIDS. On March 19 the 82-year-old, former president, hosted his second AIDS-awareness concert. He warned that 25 million people in Africa were already infected with the fatal disease. Mandela was born in a small village in South Africa in 1918. He was adopted   by the chief of his tribe   and could have been a chief himself and lived a happy country life. But he refused to be a chief when his people lived under racial discrimination ( ). He decided to fight for equal rights for all the people in South Africa. Before 1990, under the country's Racial Segregation Law  , colored and white people lived separately. Black people were treated unfairly even when taking a bus. Blacks had to stand at the back of the bus to make room for white people even when there were only a few of them on board. For his opposition   to the system Mandela was arrested   and spent 27 years in prison. He was freed in 1990 and become the president of the country after the first elections were held in which everyone could vote. Mandela was not only a political fighter who attacked with speeches. He was also a trained boxer   and fought in the ring when he was young. \" Although I did not enjoy the violence of boxing, I was interested in how one moved one's body to protect oneself, how one used a strategy both to attack and retreat  ,\" he wrote in his autobiography. As a skilful fighter, he chose music as his weapon against AIDS.

So it's not hard to tell that people are divided into different classes. British society has changed a lot since the days of Downton Abbey, but the division still exists and the funny accents do, too. Nowadays, what divides Britons is the so-called \"North-South divide\". As you make your way north from the south coast of England, the accent begins to change. The posh \"How are you\" in parts of the South becomes \"Ahhdu\" (how do you do) in the Midlands, \"reeit\" (are you all right) in the North West, \"eyyup\" (what's up) in Yorkshire, and \"hou's it gaun\" (how's it going) in Scotland. Besides accents, the economy also changes. The rich southern city of London slowly becomes the North where people general have less money. So where does the \"South\" stop being the \"South\" and the \"North\" start being the \"North\"? Well, depending on where someone comes from in Britain, you'll get a different answer. \"Anywhere above London is 'the North',\" you might hear a Londoner say. Or if you're in Scotland, you might hear, \"Southern softer!\", talking about a person from Lancashire or Yorkshire, who think of themselves as \"hard (tough) Northerners\". \"Anywhere south of Manchester is not northern,\" you might hear a person from Manchester say. Many stereotypes   have come from the \"North-South Divide\", too. Often, southerners are seen as being rude and snobbish   by northerners. And northerners are often seen as uneducated by southerners. Today, the career you have and the person you marry don't depend on where you were born or what class you are from. But as London is getting richer and people are moving to the South for work, the North-South divide is getting bigger.

The chances of women having successful marriages were not affected by whether they were educated in mixed or single-sex schools.Separate research by the IOE found that going without boys was beneficial for women in other ways since there was a \" statistically significant positive association between single-sex schooling and wages for women\". The study into marital success interviewed 17,000 adults who were taught in a range of schools including private boarding schools to state comprehensives.It found that single-sex education does not compromise the chances either of men or women of getting married. However, researchers found that boys educated on their own were more likely to divorce in later life.While for women, there was no significant link.The research also found men taught in boys' schools were more likely to suffer from depression by age 42--perhaps because of their increased chances of marital breakdown.But Professor Leonard's team was unable to identify why those men educated in a single-sex environment were more likely to divorce. The study asked married and  _ g couples where men had attended both single-sex and mixed schools to rate how happy they were and found no marked difference in their happiness levels or willingness to share domestic chores.

We use electricity, gas and oil to light and heat our buildings and run our cars. The demand for power is growing. But we may not need to build new power plants or find more oil. The best way to increase our supply of energy is to be more efficient. Did you know that when you leave your video-game console   on, it consumes more electricity than two refrigerators? Or that those funny-looking, twisty bulbs   use 75% less power than traditional light bulbs? We have the tools to save money, reduce pollution and even help our planet, simply by wasting less energy. As President, Barack Obama plans to make energy efficiency in American a major goal. He has promised to cut 15% of all energy used by the Federal Government. In a speech, he called for 75% of government office buildings to be updated for better efficiency. He pointed out that energy-efficient buildings and homes will save consumers billions of dollars on energy bills. An \"extra benefit\", he added, will be \"a cleaner, safer planet.\" Gas, coal and oil are called fossil fuels. Fossil fuels have been the world's main source of energy for hundreds of years. But burning them releases dirty gases, which cause pollution. There are two main ways to save energy. The first is to use more efficient machines. Hybrid cars use less gas. New appliances are designed to use less electricity. Today's refrigerators are three times more efficient than those before 1973. Laptop computers consume much less energy than desktop computers. The second is to use machines more productively. According to the US Department of Energy, in the average home, 75% of the electricity used to power electronic equipment is standby power   . That means power flowing to plugged-in appliances whether or not they are being used. Homeowners can avoid wasting power by pulling the plug on appliances when they are not in use. Efficiency experts argue that today's best techniques could cut US oil and gas use in half, and reduce our electricity use by three-fourths. \n Answer: the US is determined to improve energy efficiency in the whole America", "output": "By referring to Obama's plan, the author mainly intended to say that   _", "category": "Question Generation 1276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Although campers and hikers are warned not to feed the bears, many people ignore these warnings and feed the beasts anyway. When bears are used to people's food, problems soon arise. Bears like to eat a large variety of things, both meat and vegetable. Without human assistance, bears live nicely on roots, twigs, leaves of trees, insects and small animals. With people around, the bears' tastes quickly expand to include sandwiches, hot dogs, hamburgers, and anything else they can temp humans into giving up. Bears often develop clever strategies for getting people to let go their food supplies. More often than not, an unsuspecting hiker has taken off his or her pack for a rest only to have a bear charge out of the woods, grab the pack and quickly disappear into the underbrush with it. Hanging the pack on a tree branch won't help. Bears have been known to climb up, jump off, and catch the pack on the way down. One mother bear stretched up with her baby on her shoulders to reach a pack stored on a pole. Many bears threaten people into giving up their supplies. Although a bear is unlikely to attack a person and would probably run away if screamed at, few people are willing to do so. Most people drop the pack and run the other way. This, of course, delights the bear. In some places, the Park Service installed some metal barrels with lids to help campers keep their supplies safe from bears. Although the bears were unable to open these containers, the effort was less than successful. Most campers, unable to tell the metal drums from rubbish cans, never used them for the intended purpose. \n Answer: can cause problems", "output": "Feeding bears on people's food_.", "category": "Question Generation 1276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Tear, whether they are of sorrow, anger, or joy, typically make Americans feel uncomfortable and embarrassed. The shedder of tears   is likely to apologize, even when a great tragedy was the cause. The observer of tears is likely to do everything possible to put an end to the emotional tears. But judging from recent studies of crying behavior, _ to tears are often inappropriate and may even be counterproductive  . Humans are the only animals clearly known to shed emotional tears. Since evolution has given rise to few purposeless physiological responses, it is logical to assume that crying has one or more functions that enhance (increase) survival. Although some observers have suggested that crying is a way to ask for assistance form others (as a crying baby might from its mother), the shedding of tears is hardly necessary to get help. Vocal cries would have been quite enough, more likely than tears to gain attention. So, it appears, there must be something special about tears themselves. Indeed, the new studies suggest that emotional tears may play a direct role in alleviating stress, University of Minnesota researchers who are studying the chemical composition of tears have recently isolated two important chemicals from emotional tears. Both chemicals are found only in tears that are shed in response to emotion. Tears shed because of exposure to cut onion would contain no such substance. Other researchers are investigating the usefulness of tears as a means of diagnosing human ills and monitoring drugs.

One day, this approach threw me into embarrassment In Mrs. Totten's eighth-grade math class at Central Avenue School in Anderson, Indiana, we were learning to add and subtract decimals  . Our teacher typically assigned daily homework, which would be recited in class the following day. On most days, our grades were based on our oral answer to homework questions. Mrs. Totten usually walked up and down the rows of desks requesting answers from student after student in the order the questions had appeared on our homework sheets. She would start either at the front or the back of the classroom and work toward the other end. Since I was seated near the middle of about 35 students, it was easy to figure out which questions I might have to answer. This particular time, I had completed my usual two or three problems according to my calculations. What I failed to expect was that several students were absent, which threw off my estimate. As Mrs. Totten made her way from the beginning of the class,I desperately tried to determine which math problem I would get. I tried to work it out before she got to me, but I had brain freeze and couldn't function. When Mrs. Totten reached my desk,she asked what answer I'd got for problem No. 14. \"I...I didn't get anything,\"  I answered,and my face felt warm. \"Correct,\" she said. It turned out that the correct answer was zero. What did I learn that day? First, always do all your homework. Second, in real life it isn't always what you say but how you say it that matters.

Soon after that, alertness declines, and sleepiness may set in by mid-afternoon. Your short-term memory is best during the morning--in fact, about 15 percent more efficient than at any other time of day. So, students, take notice: when you are faced with a morning exam, _ to review your notes right before the test is given. However, long-term memory is different. Afternoon is the best time for learning materials that you want to recall days, weeks or months later. Politicians, business executives or others who must learn speeches would be smart to do their memorizing during that time of day. You should try to do most of your studying in the afternoon, rather than late at night. Many students believe they memorize better while burning the midnight oil because their short-term recall is better during the early hours of the morning than in the afternoon. But short-term memory won't help them much several days later, when they face the exam. By contrast, we tend to do best on tasks related to the process of knowing, understanding, and learning numbers during the morning hours. What about sports? During afternoon and early evening, you're able to react the quickest to an outside stimulus--like a baseball speeding toward you. Studies have also shown that late in the day, when your body temperature is peaking, you will consider PE easier and less tiring--whether it actually is or not. That means you are more likely to work harder during a late afternoon or early evening workout, and therefore benefit more from it. In fact, all of your senses--taste, sight, hearing, touch and smell--may be at their keenest during late afternoon and early evening. That could be why dinner usually tastes better to us than breakfast. While all of us follow the same general pattern of ups and downs, the exact timing varies from person to person.

The nature of critical thinking is thinking beyond the easily seen--beyond the pictures on TV, the untrue reports in the newspapers, and the faulty reasoning. Critical thinking is an attitude as much as an activity. If you are curious about life and desire to dig deeper into it, you are a critical thinker. If you find pleasure in deep thinking about different ideas, characters, and facts, you are a critical thinker.

Sadly, biological facts prevent us ever accomplishing such a thing without artificial aid--we simply weigh too much, and all our mass pushes down through our relatively small feet, resulting in a lot of pressure that makes us sink. However, several types of animals can walk on water. One of the most interesting is the common basilisk. Basilicus, a lizard   native to Central and South America. It can run across water for a distance of several meters, avoiding getting wet by rapidly hitting the water's surface with its feet. The lizard will take as many as 20 steps per second to keep moving forward. For humans to do this, we'd need huge feet that we could bring up to our ears in order to create adequate \"hitting. \" But fortunately there is an alternative: cornflour. By adding enough of this common thickening agent to water (and it does take a lot), you can create a \"non-Newtonian\" liquid that doesn't behave like normal water. Now, if the surface of the water is hit hard enough, particles  in the water group together for a moment to make the surface hard. Move quickly enough and put enough force into each step, and you really can walk across the surface of an adequately thick liquid of cornflour. Fun though all this may sound, it's still rather messy and better read about in theory than carried out in practice, if you must do it, then keep the water wings handy in case you start to sink--and take a shower afterward! \n Answer: have biological limitations", "output": "Walking on water hasn't become a reality mainly because humans   _  .", "category": "Question Generation 1276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

There are said to be one billion people learning English now and about 80% of the information on the Internet is in English. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing?

In a recent study of 46 babychimpanzee orphans, Kim Bard of the University of Portsmouth in England and her colleagues demonstrated that primate babies that have tight relationships with mother figures do much better oncognitive tests than babies who receive only food, shelter, and friendship with peers. But this is not breaking mews. In fact, it's old news. In the 1950s, Harry Harlow conducted a series of experiments with baby monkeys that showed, without doubt, that lack of love and comfort makes for a crazy monkey. Harlow constructed a cage that included a wire monkey \"mother\" topped with a plastic face. In this wire he fixed Mom with a milk bottle. The cage also held another wire mother covered with terry cloth. The baby monkeys spent all their time with the cloth mother and only went to the wire mother to feed, demonstrating that a soft touch beat something to eat any day. Harlow's monkey work was important because, at the time, child care \"experts\" and everybody's grandmother had a \"no touch, no comfort\" policy toward children. They advised parents not to respond to crying babies, felt babies should sleep alone to grow up independent, and for God's sake put those kids down. But Harlow's work changed all that. Mothers were soon permitted to have their newborns next to them in the hospital. The current chimp research based on Harlow's work shows that mother love not only makes for a psychologically well-adjusted child, but also makes for a smart kid. Bard and her colleagues evaluated the abilities of the chimps when they were 12 months old with standard human tests for children of that age, tests that ask little kids to imitate some action. The highly raised chimps did better than the ones that were not loved, and what do you know, the well-raised chimps did even better than human kids on this small IQ test. So we hear it once again. We are primates, social animals which need care and love. We need to be held and talked to and made to feel that at least one person wants to be with us all the time.

Asian and Spanish students took between five and ten years to reach native speaker performance in English-only schools. Fluency obviously doesn't happen overnight. But time can definitely make you a better speaker. After testing his own memory, German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered that humans forget most of what they learn in the first 20 minutes. So cramming right before a speaking exam is not likely to be as effective as practicing regularly over time. The more you practice, the more familiar new words will become. In the classroom, studies have also shown that repeating oral tasks improves a speaker's performance. One of the best repetition exercises is the 4/3/2 technique. Speakers give the same talk to three different listeners with a progressive decrease in delivery time, starting at four minutes, then three, and finally two minutes. This exercise has been proven to help learners speak faster. It can also result in less hesitation and more grammatical accuracy. While time dose make a difference when it comes to speaking perfect English, it would not hurt to brush up on your other language skills. Studies have also shown that reading can increase your speaking vocabulary. After one month of an extensive reading program, a 27-year-old student of French became more familiar with 65 percent of the new words.

Richard A Vargus, chief of the law enforcement branch at CENTCOM told the Military Times in September.\"Some dogs move right through it and it doesn't affect them.Some dogs, it takes some retraining, and some dogs just refuse to work.\" Like humans, military dogs exhibit a range of changes in temperaments  when they develop PTSD.Some become aggressive, others retreat.But because dogs can't express what the problem is, soldiers can be put at risk if their partner simply stops doing his job without warning. \"If the dog is trained to find improvised explosives and it looks like it's working, but isn't, it' s not just the dog that' s at risk,\" Dr.Walter F.Burghardt Jr., chief of behavioral medicine at the Daniel E.Holland Military Working Dog Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base, told the Times.\"This is a human health issue as well.\" And searching for such devices has become a key responsibility for military dogs.Even after spending six years and nearly $ 19 billion on experimenting with innovative ways to detect bombs, the Pentagon admitted in 2010 that its most sophisticated technology was no match for a dog' s nose. \"Electronic equipment is great in the laboratory, but out on the battlefield, you can't beat the dogs,\" Bill Childress, manager of the Marine Corps working dog program told the Los Angeles Times. Just as physicians have yet to find a safe way to treat PTSD among humans, so too are veterinarians weighing a wide range of options when it comes to helping their canine patients But offering dogs the same innovative treatments that their human counterparts get, doesn't guarantee a full recovery.It's a fact that fears once learned are never unlearned. \n Answer: stop their partner in a strange way", "output": "When military dogs develop PCSD, they will  _  .", "category": "Question Generation 1276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Early last season, I wrote a column about an art of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the stadium.After it ran,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs.He said,\"I read what you wrote about Jordan.but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw.\" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice. A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Had Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood? \"Not two boys,\" Jordan said. \"But four.\" And he named them. He said four names. And what did they talk about? \"Everything,\" Jordan said. \" Anything. I've asked to see their grades so that I can check to see if they're paying attention to their study. If it turns out that one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.\" It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life,one more thing that no one knows about, and one more thing Jordan does fight for. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do J! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come.
