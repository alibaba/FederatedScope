But all overseas job candidates, especially those who lack practical experience, are gradually losing their advantages among a trend of pay increases in China.        In 2010, the country recorded the greatest rise in wages in Asia.Of all Chinese employees surveyed that year, 68 percent said they had received a raise worth 3 percent to 10 percent of their salaries, according to the survey.        Moreover, 51 percent of the Chinese surveyed were expecting to get raises of 6 to 10 percent in 2011, and 33 percent thought their income increase will go beyond 10 percent.        \"Now it's common in many companies to see overseas candidates earning the same salaries as their Chinese coworkers,\" said Emma.\"Even some experienced expatriates, on average, earn only 20 percent more than their Chinese peers.\"        Emma said overseas workers with little work experience no longer enjoy a great advantage over graduates of Chinese universities.But those with two to three years of work experience are still \"red-hot\".

Yet childhood bullying   really can damage your long-term health. Gone are the days when bullying was considered an unavoidable and finally harmless part of growing up -- just last month we learned that childhood bullying can lead to poorer mental health even into middle age. Now William Copeland at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and his colleagues have shown that it can have lasting physiological effects too. They tracked 1,420 nine-year-olds right through their teens. Each child was seen up to nine times during the study and asked about bullying. The team then measured levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in their blood. CRP is a marker of inflammation   linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease   and problems like diabetes. \"Because we were collecting biological samples throughout, we were able to look at CRP levels in subjects _ their bullying involvement.\" says Copeland. \"This really gives us an idea of the changes bullying brings about.\" Although CRP levels naturally rise in everyone during adolescence, levels were highest in children who reported suffering from bullies. Even at the ages of 19 and 21, children who had once been bullied had CRP levels about 1.4 times higher than peers who were neither wrongdoers nor victims. In a cruel twist, the bullies had the lowest levels of all, suggesting they didn't suffer the same health risks. They may even see a benefit from their behavior, though Copeland stresses it doesn't defend their actions. \"The goal would instead be to find other ways to produce this protective effect without it being at someone else's expense.\" he says. Andrea Danese at King's College London has before shown that ill-treatment during childhood can lead to high levels of inflammation in adult life. \"This new study is a helpful addition in showing that these effects extend to another important childhood stressor.\" he says. He suggests that care workers monitor levels of CRP in children having psychotherapy to see if it is helping to reduce the stress of being bullied. \n Answer: It is a sign of the inflammation.", "output": "What do you know about CRP?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

But some teachers think the changes are not all for the better. Eleanor Johnson, an English professor, thinks that text messaging has made students believe that it is far more acceptable than it actually is to just make terrible spelling and grammatical errors. And she says her students over the past several years have increasingly used less formal English in their writing. Words and phrases like \"guy\" and \"you know\" now appear in research papers. Professor Johnson supposes there is a strong relationship between the rise of informal online communication and an increase in writing mistakes. But she says there may not be much scientific information, at least not yet. David Crystal, a British linguist , says the actively changing nature of the Internet makes it difficult to keep up-to-date in studying its effects. But he believes its influence on language is small. The main effect of the Internet on language is the way it has added to the expressive richness of language, providing language with a new set of communicative tools that haven't existed in the past. Erin Jansen is founder of NetLingo.com, an online dictionary of the Internet and text messaging terms. She says the new technology has not changed existing language but has greatly added to its vocabulary. Basically it's freedom of expression. And what about those teachers who find these new kinds of mistakes in spelling and grammar in their students' work? What is her message to them? Erin Jansen said, \"I am always on the students' side and won't get angry or upset about that. If it's helping the kids write more or communicate more, that's great. That's what teachers and educators want--to get kids communicating.\" But Erin Jansen and David Crystal agree with Eleanor Johnson on at least one thing.

The seemingly harmless items have been responsible for more than 13 million crashes and near misses on Britain's roads. While men were responsible for the greater number of accidents reported, women played their part by driving in high heels. Putting fashion over function meant 44 percent of female motorists had been prevented from using the pedals correctly by their high heels--with those aged 25 to 34 accounting for most of the incidents reported. Those keen for a caffeine kick while driving can also create an accident if they leave empty coffee cups lying around their vehicle. Twenty percent of those surveyed admitted they had crashed their car or had a near miss after a deserted coffee cup or empty drink bottle rolled under their brake pedal . However, it is not just wearing and eating that cause a threat from inside the car, man's best friend could also cause a catastrophe if not safely secured. One in eight motorists claimed to have had a scrape or near miss on the road due to their dog's wandering freely, climbing into the front seat or trying to escape through the windows. The accidents meant drivers took their eyes off the road for more than three seconds each time, according to the poll of 2,000 British motorists. The survey has found drivers will pick up an average bill of PS261.47 for the damage caused by every crash. Londoners were the most at risk of an accident closely followed by motorists in the West Midland and Wales. Janet Connor, a managing director, said many accidents could be avoided if people cleaned their cars regularly, as one in ten drivers involved in crashes admitted to driving inside a mountain of debris.

Most countries also have private  education. This means that parents can pay to send their children to certain schools.

Other people think that private schools give the children who go to them an unfair advantage over other children. At the age of three, many children go to nursery school.

A new working paper finds that, March and August are the months in which divorce filings peak. For the paper, the University of Washington's Brian Serafini and Julie Brines analyzed the most recent years of divorce filings in Washington and drew their conclusion: divorce rises sharply in March and August. The result is supported by some nation-wide, anecdotal evidence. Online searches for \"divorce\" and \"child custody\"  dramatically grow early in the year, peaking in March, they point out. The authors guess that unhappily married couples schedule their divorce filings around both the winter holidays and Valentine's Day, as well as summer vacations. (More Americans vacation m July than any other month.) There are a few explanations why people might time their marital dissolutions this way, It might just be too difficult to announce a divorce around family-oriented Christmas time, especially if there are kids involved, so many couples weigh the decision to divorce around the new year and progress from there. February is a period in which couples tend to look around for representation on legal sites. And by March, they're prepared to file for divorce. But the authors think the more likely reason is that people decide their differences are irreconcilable right after a big trip. It could be that people don't want to ruin a family getaway, or that vacations are so stressful that they drive the already-dissatisfied to divorce. (\"I told you to pack your suitcase last night; now we've missed the train!\") Then there's the \"broken promise\" theory. \"6People are discontent with their marriages, they look at vacation as an opportunity to give it one last shot, and what they were hoping would happen didn't occur,\" explained Brines, an associate professor of sociology.

Taking steps to become physically fit does not have to mean acquiring expensive training equipment or a gym membership. Exercise can include simple walking and running, gardening, cleaning the house, swimming, tennis, bicycling (stationary or on the road) and so on. The key is to do it on a regular basis.

American football is a unique sport with its own rules, regulations, and fans. Being a football fan means something different than being a fan in other sports; football fans have their own culture and customs. Since football is a violent, contact sport, its games are played infrequently. Usually fans have to wait an entire week before they can see their favorite team play again. This means that football fans take advantage of the days they can cheer for their teams. One custom that football fans have is called tailgating. Tailgating describes when a big group of people gets together before a game and has a small party. Tailgating usually lasts a few hours and involves lots of good food and beverages. It is most common to grill food at a tailgate, especially hamburgers, hotdogs, sausages, and any other type of meat. It is not unusual to see people drinking lots of beer, throwing footballs around, talking to (or arguing with) other fans, etc. Tailgating happens for other sports too, but it is much more important to football fans. Sports fans in every country have unique and strange ways to celebrate their favorite teams and players.

Common reasons for not eating breakfast include having no time, not feeling hungry, traditional dislike and dieting. Breakfast simply means \"break the fast''. Your body spends at least 6 to 12 hours each night in a fasting state. In the morning your body needs energy for the day's work ahead. A good breakfast should provide 1/3 of your total calorie needs for the day. On average, we eat 400 less calories for breakfast than for dinner. If breakfast doesn't appeal   to you in the morning, try eating a lighter dinner earlier in the evening or save half of your dinner for breakfast in the morning. If you still aren't hungry in the morning, start with something small like juice or toast or have a nutritious   mid-morning snack   later when you are hungry. So, you say you are on a diet. Some people fear that eating breakfast will make them hungrier during the day and they will eat more. It is true that eating breakfast is likely to make you feel hungry throughout the day. That is because your body is working correctly. Although you may feel as if you are eating more all day long, in reality you are probably not. Not eating breakfast can also cause you overeat, since a fall in blood sugar often makes you feel very hungry later. To make matters worse, since your body is in a slow state, it will not be able to burn those extra calories very efficiently  . If you feed your body healthy snacks and meals throughout the day, you are less likely to become hungry and stuff   yourself as soon as you begin to eat. Since breakfast is the first and most important meal of the day, choosing the right food is important. The best breakfast foods are fruits, juice, lean meat and grain products such as bread, rice, noodles and cereals. \n Answer: going without food", "output": "What is the meaning of the word \"fast\" in the phrase \"break the fast\"?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

About 50 students participated in a 30-minute workout after school on Friday in the school's gym. This was a Fit Fridays program introduced at the school by Families Plus, a non-profit group that provides programs to enrich the lives of families and children in Frederick County. The free program aims to encourage students from kindergarten through fifth grade to be physically active by having them participate in various age-appropriate activities designed to promote a love of exercise, according to Kim Ragan, head of the program. The program, which started at the school on Nov.9, 2012, has since become a hit, Ragan said. Emily Liston, 37, said the program allows students to focus on fitness as a priority in their lives. \"There're so many things to stop them from being active,\" she said. \"So, anything to keep them moving is good, especially in the winter months\". Jennifer Mitchell, 40, whose daughter Alexandra, 7, participated in the Fit Fridays program, said that learning the importance of being active isn't the only thing students are learning from the new program. \"It's a great opportunity for them to get some exercise and also to learn to get along and socialize, to learn teamwork,\" she said. \"In school they have to do activities like this but they want to do it.\"  Riley Glynn, 9, a fourth grader at the school, said his favorite part of the program is getting to spend more time with his friends. \"It's fun to play with people,\" Riley said. \"It's like physical education after school but it really helps you.\"   \"You learn how to make yourself stronger,\" said Megan Hummel, 7, a first grader.

The book tells the story of a man who is shipwrecked  . He spends 28 years on an island near Venezuela. The book tells the story of everything that happens to Robinson Crusoe. He hopes someone will rescue him, but he has been there for so long on his own that he also begins to fear being rescued. Robinson Crusoe was published in 1719. Most experts believe the story is based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, who was a Scottish sailor. On an expedition   in 1704, Selkirk had an argument with his ship's captain. Selkirk thought the ship was not safe and was about to fall apart. When the ship stopped at a remote island to get fresh water, Selkirk got off. He tried to get the other crew members to leave with him, but nobody would. The shop then sailed away without him. Selkirk spent four years and four months on his own on the island, known as Aguas Buenas. Selkirk was finally rescued by a ship that visited the island in 1709. The ship's captain was grateful to Selkirk because he provided food for the crew when they arrived. Now archaeologists think they have found the remains of Selkirk's camp on Aguas Buenas. They found two deep holes that would have held wooden posts. The archaeologists say this is evidence that Selkirk built a shelter there. The post holes are near a fresh water stream. They are located quite high up, which would have meant that Selkirk was able to watch out for the ships coming close to the island. The most interesting evidence, the archaeologists say, is part of a piece of equipment used by sailors to navigate  . Historians believe Selkirk was a navigator, so the instrument could have belonged to him. Robinson Crusoe was published ten years after Selkirk was rescued. Most experts think Daniel Defoe heard and read stories about Selkirk, which inspired him to write the book. \n Answer: Because he thought the ship he was on was in danger.", "output": "Why did Selkirk choose to land on the remote island?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

The World Bank knows it. The education of girls is the surest way to reduce poverty. The reason is simple. All the evidence shows that taking girls out of the fields and homes, and putting them behind desks, raises economic productivity, lowers infant and maternal  death rates, reduces birth rates, and improves environmental management. Why, then, are 90 million primary school-age girls around the world not in school? For the same reason that when Charles Dickens was writing David Copperfield 150 years ago girls were absent from the British education system: Men in power mostly prefer _ that way, or are not interested enough in changing the situation to commit energy and money to doing so. The countries with the poorest record for having women in positions of power or influence have the worst figures for girls' education. High-profile intervention  by organizations such as the World Bank has begun successfully with several countries, and more of the same will probably be needed to bring change in conservative, male-run states. Even if there were no development payoff from gender equality in schools, the education of girls would still be a cause worth fighting for. Education is a human right, and the denial of it to girls is a scar on the community in the twenty-first century. To be born a girl in a rural area in Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Morocco, Togo, or Sudan -- half a dozen of the most shameful performers -- means being condemned to a life without school, education, or clean water, marriage and babies coming too early, too many births, children who die of preventable diseases, backbreaking work in the fields, subordination  to husband and his family, and an early death. Every year, almost 12 million children under the age of five needlessly die of infectious diseases associated with poverty. But each additional year spent by their mothers in primary school lowers the risk of premature child deaths by about 8 percent. In Pakistan, an extra year of school for 1,000 girls could prevent sixty infant deaths. With women and girls being the main farmers in Africa and southern Asia, their education offers a chance to develop more efficient farming practices, improve output, and raise awareness of the ecological needs of the land with tree planting and farming. Therefore, the world community cannot afford to ignore this avenue of change. \n Answer: It lowers maternal death rates.", "output": "Which is Not the reason why educating girls reduces poverty?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Human-resource management is not traditionally seen as central to the competitive survival of the firm in the United States. Skill acquisition is considered an individual responsibility. Labour is simply another factor of production to be hired--rented at the lowest possible cost--much as one buys materials or equipment. The lack of importance attached to human-resource management can be seen in the corporate management. In an American firm the chief financial officer is almost always second in command. The post of head of human-resource management is usually a specialized job, off at the edge of the corporate hierarchy. The executive who holds it is never consulted on major strategic decisions and has no chance to move up to Chief Executive Officer(CEO). By way of contrast, in Japan the head of human-resource management is central--usually the second most important executive, after the CEO, in the firm's hierarchy. While American firms often talk about the vast amounts spent on training their work force, in fact they invest less in the skills of their employees than do either Japanese or German firms. The money they do invest is also more highly concentrated on professional and managerial employees. And the limited investments that are made in training workers are also much more narrowly focused on the specific skills necessary to do the next job rather than on the basic background skills that make it possible to absorb new technologies. As a result, problems arise when new breakthrough technologies arrive. If American workers, for example, take much longer to learn how to operate new flexible manufacturing stations than workers on Germany (as they do), the effective cost of those stations is lower in Germany than it is in the United States. More time is required before equipment is up and running in production, and the need for extensive retraining generates costs and creates bottlenecks that limit the speed with which new equipment can be used. The result is a slower pace of technological change, and in the end the skills of the bottom half of the population affect the wages of the top half. If the bottom half can't effectively make the processes that have to be operated, the management and professional jobs that go with these processes will disappear. \n Answer: They see the gaining of skills as their employees' own business.", "output": "Which of the following applies to the management of human resources in American companies?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Before then, the law in many states said that black children could not attend the same schools as white children. People of different races also had to use separate public restrooms. It was called segregation. That is when people of different races are kept separate. U.S. leaders worked to end segregation. They helped bring civil rights to all Americans.

They need less care, which means less work for you. Water: A  small pond, birdbath, or  even  a  shallow dish  of  clean water  in  the ground will attract birds. Other small animals like insects may visit as well. Shelter: Bushes and trees make great escapes for birds. Tall grass and \"weeds\" are home to grasshoppers, garter  snakes,  and  some  ground-nesting birds. You  can  also  add  stone  piles  and brush piles. Places to Raise Young: Butterflies need special plants to lay their eggs on. Frogs and toads lay eggs only  in shallow water. Many birds use birdhouses; others nest  in  trees and bushes.  In fact, nearly all your shelters may become homes for wild young. Put It on Paper Using the map you made of your area, draw in the changes you want to make. Mark where the plants, nest boxes, and other items will go. Remember, this is a long-term plan--you don't have  to  do  everything  this  spring. Maybe  you  could  put  up  a  few  birdhouses  and  plant  some butterfly bushes now and save the trees and bushes for next year. Even a small start is a big step for wildlife. Reach for Resources To make the habitat happen, you'll need lots of plants, seeds, and other supplies. You'll also need to buy or borrow tools and maybe even some heavy equipment. Now's the time to reach out for donations. Start by asking your parent-teacher organization. Then go to garden clubs, garden stores (they might give you a discount), local government agencies, and businesses. If they can't donate supplies or money, ask if they can donate workers! The workers can help build  the habitat. You'll also need people  to help maintain  it. Some schools ask their students' families to take turns during the summer. Each family maintains  the habitat for a couple of weeks. Build Your Design Now you can dig in.

This is the first clear demonstration that, in a primate species, we' re inducing a slowdown of the aging process -- showing increased survival, resistance to disease, less brain atrophy and less muscle loss. \"This predicts humans would respond similarly,\" added Weindruch, professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin and an investigator at the Veterans Hospital in Madison. Another expert noted that, despite some highly publicized studies in certain species, the link between restricted eating and longer lifespan has been far from proven. \"The idea that dietary restriction extends lifespan in all species is not true. Many strains of rats and mice do not respond. In some strains, it' s actually deleterious,\" explained Felipe Sierra, director of the biology of aging program at the US National Institute on Aging (NIA), which supported the new study. \"The fact that it doesn't work in some mice but it does seem to work in monkeys is surprising and it gives us hope.\" But there's a larger question: how to change humans' increasingly careless eating habits. \"This finding doesn't give me hope that humans are going to go into dietary restriction,\" added Marianne Grant, a registered dietitian at Texas A&M Health Science Center Coastal Bend Health Education Center in Corpus Christi. \n Answer: This experiment indicates restricted diets could extend humans' lifespan.", "output": "Which of the following statements about Weindruch is true?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Developers would drain them with ditches ,fill them in with tons of soil,and build houses,schools,and parking areas on them.Then scientists began to realize the important role wetlands played in the environment. Wetlands act like giant sponges  during storms.They soak up extra storm water and afterward release it slowly back into the water cycle.This helps prevent flooding. Towns where people have drained wetlands have found that in a big storm,their streets and homes are often flooded because there are no wetlands to soak up the excess water. Wetlands also act as giant filters where pollutants are absorbed and dissolved over time.Though wetlands can become polluted from dumping,wastewater,and fertilizer runoff from farm fields,they are able to process some pollutants over time because of all the microorganisms and plants living there. Wetlands are especially important for providing homes and breeding grounds to millions of birds,fish,and amphibians worldwide. Many wetlands have become national wildlife refuges ,where you can go to take pictures and look at birds and animals. The Everglades are a huge wetland that once covered more than four million acres of southern Florida. Sometimes called the \"river of grass\",the Everglades are a shallow sheet of water that slowly flowed across a grassy plain. In the late 1800s people began draining parts of the Everglades for development. Roads were built and towns sprang up.The Everglades shrank to half its original size. Cities like Miami grew up where once there was a thriving wetland. Sewage and waste from the cities were pumped into the remaining wetlands. Over time scientists began to see the importance of the Everglades. Even with its smaller size,the Everglades filtered the pollutants coming from the cities,absorbing the worst of it like a sewage treatment plant.

This is creating problems for polar bears that make their homes off northern Alaska and in Hudson Bay. Polar bears off Alaska normally hunt and raise their young on ice sheets that float on the ocean. But as the ice has melted, the polar bears have been forced to spend more time on land. There, they have begun to frequent beaches, feeding on the remains of whales caught by native hunters. For polar bears, this food is less nutritious than seals that they normally catch on ice sheets. The shrinking  ice has also forced more polar bears into the ocean. In the past, they only had to swim short distances between ice sheets. But as the ice has shrunk, polar bears have been forced to swim longer and longer distances in the open ocean. This poses a severe danger during rough weather, and an increasing number of drowned polar bears have been observed. In Hudson Bay, the ice breaks up three weeks earlier in the spring now than it did 20 years ago. Polar bears on Hudson Bay fast  during the summer, waiting for ice to form in the fall to hunt. Every year, the summer gets longer, and the bears get skinnier. Over the past 25 years, the average weight of the female bears has dropped 68 kg.

The inventions of modern technology seem to be cutting us off from communicating with our fellow human beings. The world of business is one area in which technology is separating us. Experts say, for example, that many people will soon be able to work at home. With access to a large central computer, employees such as office clerks, insurance agents, and accountants could do their job at display terminals in their own homes. They would never have to actually see the people they're dealing with. Also, the way employees are paid will change. Workers' salaries will be automatically paid into their bank accounts, making paper checks unnecessary. No workers will stand in line to receive their pay or cash their checks. Personal banking will change, too. Customers will deal with machines to put in or take out money from their accounts. Another area in which technology is changing is entertainment. Music, for instance, was once a group experience. People listened to music at concert halls or in small social gatherings. For many people now, however, music is an individual experience. Walking along the street or sitting in their living rooms, they wear headphones to build a wall of music around them. Movie entertainment is changing, too. Movies used to be social events.

At the time they are made, they may seem innocent enough. But let's not kid ourselves. They have been known to influence behavior in such a way as to lead to real bloodshed. Volumes have been written about the way words affect us. It has been shown that words having certain connotations   may cause us to react in ways quite foreign to what we consider to be our usual humanistic behavior. I see the term \"opponent\" as one of those words. Perhaps the time has come to delete it from sports terms. The dictionary meaning of the term \"opponent\" is \"adversary\" \"enemy\"; \"one who opposes your interests.\" Thus, when a player meets an opponent, he or she may tend to treat that opponent as an enemy. At such times, winning may dominate one's intellect, and every action, no matter how gross, may be considered justifiable. I recall an incident in a handball game when a referee refused a player's request for a time out for a glove change because he did not consider them wet enough. The player proceeded to rub his gloves across his wet T-shirt and then exclaimed. \"Are they wet enough now?\" In the heat of battle, players have been observed to throw themselves across the court without considering the consequences that such a move might have on anyone in their way. I have also witnessed a player reacting to his opponent's international and illegal blocking by deliberately hitting him with the ball as hard as he could during the course of play. Off the court, they are good friends. Does that make any sense? It certainly gives proof of a court attitude which departs from normal behavior. Therefore, I believe it is time we elevated   the game to the level where it belongs there by setting an example to the rest of the sporting world. Replacing the term \"opponent\" with \"associate\" could be an ideal way to start. The dictionary meaning of the term \"associate\" is \"colleague\"; \"friend\"; \"companion.\" Reflect a moment!

Volcanoes erupted, sending ash and poisonous gases into the atmosphere. When people appeared on the scene and began their conquest of nature, they also began to pollute the air. They cleared land, which made possible even larger dust storms. They built cities, and the soot  from their hearths filled the air. The Roman author Seneca wrote in A.D. 61 of the \"stink, soot and heavy air \"of the imperial city. In 1257, the Queen of England was forced to move away from the city of Nottingham because the heavy smoke was unbearable. The industrial revolution brought even worse air pollution. Coal was burned to power factories and to heat homes. Soot, smoke, and sulfur dioxide  fill the air. The good old days? Not in the factory towns. But there were large rural areas unaffected by air pollution. With increasing population, the entire world is becoming more urban. It is the huge cities that are most affected by air pollution. But rural areas are not unaffected. In the neighborhoods around smoky factories, there is evidence of increased rates of spontaneous abortion  and of poor wool quality in sheep, decreased egg production and a high death rate in chickens. Traffic police in Tokyo have to wear gas masks and take \"oxygen breaks\" --breathing occasionally from tanks of oxygen. Smog in Athena at times has forced factory closings and traffic restrictions. Acid rain in Canada is caused by air pollution in the United States, contributing to strained relationships between the two countries. Sydney, Rome, Tehran, Ankara, Mexico City, and most other major cities in the world have had frightening experiences of air pollution. One of the two major types of smog--consisting of smoke, fog, sulfur dioxide, sulfuring acid (H2SO4), ash and soot--is called London smog. Indeed, the word smog is thought to have originated in England in 1905 as a contraction of the words \"smoke\" and \"fog.\" Probably the worst case of smog in history started in London on Thursday, 4 December, 1952. A large cold air mass moved into the valley of the Thames River. A temperature inversion placed a blanket of warm air over the cold air. With nightfall, a dense fog and below-freezing temperatures caused the people of London to put coal into their small stoves. Millions of these fires burned throughout the night, pouring sulfur dioxide and smoke into the air. The next day, Friday, the people continued to bum coal when the temperature remained below freezing. The factories added their smoke and chemical fumes to the atmosphere. Saturday was a day of darkness. For twenty miles around London, no light came through the smog. The air was cold and still. And the coal fires continued to bum throughout the weekend. On Monday, 8 December, more than one hundred people died of heart attacks while trying desperately to breathe. By the time a breeze cleared the air on Tuesday, 9 December, more than 4,000 deaths had been caused by the smog. Soot and ash can be removed by electrostatic precipitators . Unfortunately, they use large amounts of electricity, and the electrical energy, which is hardly affordable for most of us, has to come from somewhere. Fly ash removed from the air has to be put on the land or water, although it could be used in some way. The elimination  of sulfur dioxide is more difficult. Low-sulfur coal is rare and expensive. Although sulfur can be washed from finely pulverized  coal, the process is expensive. There are also processes for changing dirty coal into clean liquid and gaseous fuels. These processes may hold promise for the future, but they are too expensive to compete economically with other fuels at present. They also waste a part of the coal's energy. \n Answer: The concept and examples of pollution.", "output": "What is the passage mainly talking about?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Previous research suggests that the ability to control energy intake may be affected by the speed at which we eat, and a high eating rate may damage the relationship between the sensory signals and processes that control how much we eat. In order to learn more about the link between eating speed and energy intake, researchers examined how eating speed affects calories consumed during a meal in both normal-weight subjects as well as overweight or obese subjects. In the new study, a group of normal-weight subjects and a group of overweight or obese subjects were asked to consume two meals in a controlled environment. All subjects ate one meal slowly, took small bites, chewed thoroughly, and paused and put the spoon down between bites, and ate a second meal quickly, took large bites, chewed quickly, and did not pause and put the spoon down. At the conclusion of the study, the researchers found only normal-weight subjects had a statistically significant reduction in caloric consumption by eating slowly. \"A lack of statistical significance in the overweight and obese group may be partly due to the fact that they consumed less food during both eating conditions compared to the normal-weight subjects,\" Professor Meena Shah said, \"it is possible that the overweight and obese subjects felt more self-conscious, and thus ate less during the study.\" Despite the differences in caloric consumption between the normal-weight and overweight and obese subjects, the study found some similarities. Both groups felt less hungry later on after the slow meal than after the fast meal, which indicates that greater hunger suppression among both groups could be expected from a meal consumed more slowly. Also, both the normal-weight and overweight or obese groups consumed more water during the slow meal. \"The higher water intake during the slow eating condition may have affected food consumption,\" said Shah.

One end of the lamp wick  is immersed(............) in oil and the other end is not immersed. When you light the end which is not immersed, it  will burst into flame . This is because the oil is able to rise up the lamp wick thus helping it to burn.     In the same way, if you immerse the end of a piece of chalk into a glass of water, the water will soon climb up the chalk making it wet. If a piece of ordinary glass tubing is heated in a gas flame until it becomes soft,it can be pull into a tube of a very small hole. Immerse the tube into water or any other liquid which wets glass, you will find that the liquid rises to a height of several centimeters. This is known as capillary action. The liquid rises because there is an attractive force between the liquid and the glass. The attractive force depends on the diameter of the tube and the type of liquid used. \n Answer: Because there is oil climbing up the wick.", "output": "Why can an oil lamp work?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

From clothing and hairstyles to activities and expectations, earlier generations of parents and children often appeared to move in separate orbits. Today, the generation gap has not disappeared, but it is getting narrow in many families. Conversations on subjects such as sex and drugs would not have taken place a generation ago. Now they are comfortable and common. And parent--child activities, from shopping to sports, involve a feeling of trust and friendship that can continue into adulthood. No wonder greeting cards today carry the message, \"To my mother, my best friend.\" But family experts warn that the new equality can also result in less respect for parents. \"There's still a lot of strictness and authority on the part of parents out there, but there is a change happening,\" says Kerrie, a psychology professor at Lebanon Valley College. \"In the middle of that change, there is a lot of confusion among parents.\" Family researchers offer a variety of reasons for these evolving roles and attitudes.

When people hoard a massive amount of objects, it takes over the inhabitable spaces of their home. As the collection grows, they are unable to do simple , _ activities such as cooking a meal or watch TV. Sometimes the hoarding is so severe that parts of their homes become inaccessible. But among the many problems that such behavior brings about, the most significant are the health risks. Once hallways and windows are blocked, hoarders are at the risk of dying in a fire, since they no longer have a clear path of evacuation . Things that are piled up high can fall on top of the homeowner, or a person trying to climb over a pile of objects can experience a fall. There is also the problem of sanitation . Areas where food can't be properly cleaned begin to attract insects, and bathrooms that are full of many possessions can no longer be washed. Unfortunately, the serious effect of the problem can become worse for two reasons. One is that since the behavior progress behind closed doors, people can accumulate collections of objects for years before friends or family members become aware of the problem. A second reason is that hoarders often don't recognize that they have a problem, and will continue to live in denial until they get professional help. When attempting to make a diagnosis, psychologists don't regard hoarding as a disorder in itself. Instead, it's often seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder  , depression, or anxiety.

Her fans in China are also deeply saddened. Temple is just one example of movie stars that China adored, and still adores. Here's our editor's pick of the top movie stars who have influenced China. 1. Sylvester Stallone Oh, Rambo! The first strong American man that China knew. His accented English, easily recognizable even for someone who doesn't speak English, and his eyes that never seemed to smile, makes him someone whom cannot be forgotten. He represented the strong American image, and even stirred a boxing and bodybuilding fever in China. 2.Charlie Chaplin (April 16, 1889 - December 25, 1977) In the 20th century, it is not too much to say that Einstein made the greatest contributions to science, and not many would disagree that Chaplin did the same for film. He was the first actor that introduced comedy to most Chinese viewers, and politically, he was also a close friend of China's. His silent films broke the barrier of language and his form of art was recognized by all. It will be a difficult task to find a person in China who does not recognize Chaplin, even today. 3. Shirley Temple ( April 23, 1928 - February 10, 2014) When Chinese audiences saw this adorable child star for the first time on screen, Shirley Temple had already lived for more than half a century. In her movies, she was always alone or in trouble, but this adorable little blonde  could always resolve anything with her kindness, push away the fogginess and bring about light. The brand \"Shirley Temple\" was a product of the Great Depression. People watched her act to forget their hardships as Temple entertained the poor, the rich, adults and children alike. Several decades later, when her films were screened in China, the effects were the same. 4. Audrey Hepburn( May 4, 1929 - January 20, 1993) She will forever be the princess in Chinese people's hearts. Even to this day, a large number of tourists go to Rome to visit the Mouth of Truth with their lovers and eat ice cream on the Spanish Steps. Her sense of style seems to never go out of style.

They were self-published, at the cost of $400 by Ben's parents.

But others see self-publishing as a lost opportunity to teach children about hardship and perseverance.

If you have then you're not alone. When and where dogs first began living side-side with humans are questions that have stirred hot debate among scientists. There are a few hard facts that all agree on. These include that dogs were once wolves and they were the first animal to be domesticated  by humans. They came into lives some 15000 years ago, before the dawn of agriculture. Beyond that, there is little agreement. The earliest bones found that are unquestionable dogs and not wolves date from 14,000 years ago. However, 30,000-year-old skulls have been discovered in France and Belgium that are not pure wolf and some scientists think could be dogs. With such puzzling evidence, many scientists are now turning to DNA to find out when and where dogs were first domesticated. In one research project, tens of thousands of blood samples have been taken from street dogs around the world. The plan is to compare them with those of wolves. It's even possible to analyse DNA from ancient bones. Tiny pieces of the 30,000-year-old skulls mentioned earlier are currently being studied, and another DNA study has already shown that ancient dogs preserved in the Alaskan ice-fields evolved from Asian wolves, not American ones. Indeed, the ancient DNA may turn out to be more informative than the DNA of living dogs. Because dogs have accompanied humans around the world for thousands of years, their current distribution may tell us very little of their origins. This is why different groups of scientists believe that dogs variously originated in eastern Asia, Mongolia, Siberia, Europe or Africa. But why were the animals domesticated in the first place? The most recent theory is that dogs domesticated themselves, initially living in and around our ancient villages to eat any food thrown out. Today, this is a way of life still shared by three -quarters of a billion unowned dogs worldwide. \n Answer: They were the first animal to be kept as pets", "output": "Which is the only statement generally agreed on by scientists studying dogs?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Rui Yao, an assistant professor of personal financial planning at MU, says that this large growth in such a small amount of time has positive and negative implications for the Chinese economy. \"With more and more people taking advantage of credit in China, it certainly increases potential consumer buying power,\" Yao said.\"However, we found that more than 90 percent of non-credit card users were unaware of safety issues existing in credit card use and more than 60 percent had little knowledge of the consequences of credit card debt.Thus lack of knowledge could create problems as credit card ownership is expected to grow at a rate of I percent a year.\" Yao found that would 72 percent of Chinese credit card holders were never late on their payments, only 55 percent were able to pay the full balance.She also found that 70 percent of Clones credit card holders said that credit cards contributed to overspending.

Metcalf has found that because some e-mails get lost in cyberspace, important documents are     increasingly likely to be asked by clients and colleagues to send all important documents both by e-mail and by fax or \"snail mail\" - through the post.This highlights a further potential problem with e-mail in today's offices - it is taking up time rather than saving it.\"With e-mail, communication is much easier, but there is also more room for misunderstandings,\" says psychologist Dr David Lewis.Generally, much less care is taken with e-mails than with letters or faxes and the sender will probably print the document and reread it before putting it in an envelope or sending it by fax.
