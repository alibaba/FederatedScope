He has been from the start. Yet, here we are poised to throw him billions more. Ten years of the GET will produce more than he's saying will be needed to complete the project, which of course he is lying again saying it's only $10 bilion. This is why the city doesn't want the forensic audit, it will show billions more needed to complete. The Leg should also demand the city's plan to fund operation and maintenance...where the heck is that plan? Rail is looney tunes people. You wanted it you got it.
