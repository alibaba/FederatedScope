Both presented the complete clinical pattern (oral, genital, and eye lesions) of Behcet's syndrome. In both, esophageal lesions were associated with other gastrointestinal manifestations, in the first a transient episode of ulcerative ileitis, and in the second patient colitis. In both, the differential diagnosis with inflammatory bowel disease was very difficult. Histology of esophageal lesions was nonspecific; no vasculitis was found. Both patients improved on steroid therapy. Esophageal lesions also improved endoscopically and histologically with steroid therapy. When there is obvious gastrointestinal involvement in Behcet's syndrome, the differential diagnosis from inflammatory bowel disease is very difficult. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Diploidy 3)Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

On day 1, after baseline spirometry, they underwent four histamine inhalation tests with functional recovery between each test. The provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was obtained after each test. On days 2, 3, and 4, after baseline spirometry, active and placebo ascorbic acid (2 gm) was administered orally, double-blind, according to a 4.3.1 two-treatment crossover study design. One hour later, spirometry was performed, and PC20 was reassessed. We found no significant changes in FEV1 and FVC after ascorbic acid as compared with placebo administration. There was no difference between PC20 on days 2, 3, and 4 and by standardizing for the four PC20 results obtained on day 1. We conclude that ascorbic acid has no acute bronchodilator effect and does not alter bronchial responsiveness to histamine in subjects with asthma. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Creatine Kinase 2)Exertion 3)Female", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

These tumors are known more for their local invasiveness rather than distant metastasis. This would appear to preclude meningeal involvement, but close proximity to multiple cranial nerves may provide an access to the meninges. Six cases of head and neck cancer with meningeal invasion are presented. All six cases had malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid. Three cases had malignant cells recovered from a ventricular specimen after lumbar punctures were negative. The most common clinical finding on presentation was cranial nerve involvement. The optic nerve was involved most often with nerves VI and V the next most frequent. Headache was present in four patients and seizures occurred in two. No patient had meningismus. Our current treatment plan involves insertion of an Ommaya Reservoir and intraventricular methotrexate. Only patients whose primary head and neck tumor shows a response to systemic therapy undergo Ommaya placement. Meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer may be more prevalent than previously thought and the likely mechanism is via direct extension rather than hematogenous spread. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aged 3)Carcinoma 4)Case Report 5)Female 6)Head and Neck Neoplasms 7)Human 8)Male 9)Meningeal Neoplasms 10)Tomography, X-Ray Computed.", "output": "Yes", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

This variant of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma contains either vacuolated or eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions that squeeze the nucleus to one side of the cell. In this case, the inclusions were eosinophilic and stained positively for PAS, immunoglobulin M (IgM) heavy chain and kappa light chain. Electron microscopy showed granular electron-dense material trapped within distended loops of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Twenty-two cases of signet-ring cell lymphoma previously reported elsewhere in the body are reviewed, and their clinical significance is discussed. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Case Report 2)Cellular Inclusions 3)Cytoplasm 4)Female 5)Human 6)Lymphoma 7)Microscopy, Electron 8)Middle Age 9)Orbital Neoplasms", "output": "Yes", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}]
