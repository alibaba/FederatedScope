The results of this study confirm previous reports that NSE and S100 protein are useful markers for malignant melanoma. NSE staining intensity in the cases of malignant melanoma was significantly higher than that in benign naevi (p = 0.011). Intensity of staining for S100 protein was not significantly higher in the malignant melanomas. There was, however, a significant S100 gradient when comparing superficial and deep intradermal portions of these tumours (p = 0.003). This feature was not seen in benign naevi. The greatest intensity of S100 protein staining was found in the deeper portions of the malignant melanomas. This gradient difference was not seen with staining for NSE. Although it seems that the overall intensity of staining for NSE is more effective in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions, the difference in staining intensity between the superficial and deep portions of the tumour may be the better indicator of adverse behaviour in lesions in which the diagnosis of malignancy is uncertain. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Absorption 2)Animal 3)Comparative Study", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

It has long been known that arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreases during unsupplemented, non-pressurized flight. In this study, the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen (cjO2) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers. Arterial PaO2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjO2 at ground level, 5,000 feet, and 10,000 feet altitude. Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis). The relationship between cjO2 and PaO2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147. The authors conclude that the transconjunctival O2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients. The results of study also support the use of supplemental oxygen in all patients subjected to helicopter transport. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aircraft 3)Altitude 4)Blood Gas Monitoring, Transcutaneous 5)Conjunctiva 6)Female 7)Human 8)Male 9)Monitoring, Physiologic 10)Regression Analysis 11)Transportation of Patients", "output": "Yes", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

The occurrence of both phenomena in the same patient made it possible to study cross-reactivity patterns of potato antigens. An 11-year-old girl, exclusively breast-fed for her first 4 months, developed anaphylactic symptoms after ingestion of potato at 5 months of age when she was fed potato for the first time. Subsequently, she developed urticaria, angioedema, and respiratory and systemic symptoms on contact with potatoes, ingestion of potatoes, and exposure to cooking potatoes or potato pollen. Three allergenic extracts from potato pulp, peel, and pollen were prepared. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectrofocusing of the three extracts were performed. IgE-mediated allergy to these extracts was demonstrated by means of immediate skin test reactivity, positive passive transfer, RAST, RAST inhibition, and leukocyte histamine release. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the pulp extract followed by electroblotting and autoradiography demonstrated specific IgE antibodies directed against several proteins ranging from 14,000 to 40,000 daltons. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Case Report 2)Eosinophilia 3)Human", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

In addition, we noticed a cumulative prolongation of bleeding time by a combination of quinidine and aspirin. We postulated that because both quinidine and aspirin inhibit epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, a cumulative effect of the two drugs might be responsible for the hemostatic defect. In studies using normal human platelets, we confirmed a marked reduction in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation by the combination of these two agents. To further study the potential mechanism of this cumulative effect, platelet lysates were incubated with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist tritiated yohimbine in the presence of quinidine and aspirin. On the basis of the radioligand binding data, the dissociation constant (KD) of alpha 2-adrenoceptors was observed to increase in the presence of quinidine as well as aspirin. The combination of these two agents caused a marked increase in the KD of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors without alteration in the number of receptor sites. These data suggest that the cumulative effects of quinidine and aspirin on platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor KD may relate to the significant reduction in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation. This phenomenon, coupled with other well-known effects of aspirin on the platelet release reaction and arachidonate metabolism, may lead to bleeding problems in some patients receiving this combination. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Human 3)Research Support", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

To identify angiographic characteristics of coronary stenoses that may affect the incidence of these complications, the diagnostic pre-PTCA coronary angiograms of 38 consecutive patients (group I) undergoing emergency coronary surgery for dissection or occlusion were reviewed and compared with the angiograms of a random sample of 38 patients (stratified for left anterior descending and right coronary arteries) from a group of 1151 who did not need emergency coronary surgery (group II). Stenosis morphology before angioplasty was considered \"complicated\" if at least one of the following criteria was present: irregular borders, intraluminal lucency, and localization of stenosis in curve or at bifurcation. Baseline characteristics, maximum inflation pressures, types of balloon catheters used, and routinely registered angiographic stenosis properties (severity, length, eccentricity, and calcification) were similar in both groups. Irregular borders before PTCA were present in 22 of 38 patients in group I vs 10 of 38 in group II (p less than .05), intraluminal lucency in 22 of 38 vs nine of 38 (p less than .05), localization in curve in 27 of 38 pts vs 16 of 38 (p less than .05), and localization at bifurcation in 11 of 38 vs 15 of 38 (NS). Complicated angiographic morphology of coronary stenosis may represent a risk factor for dissection or occlusion. Therefore, although the predictive value of these findings is low, detailed evaluation of angiographic morphology of coronary stenoses may improve patient selection and reduce complication rates of PTCA. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Angioplasty, Transluminal 2)Comparative Study 3)Coronary Disease 4)Coronary Vessels 5)Emergencies 6)Human 7)Prognosis 8)Time Factors.", "output": "Yes", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Limb preference and efficiency were evaluated, as well as the relationship between limb use, spontaneous, and methamphetamine-induced rotation bias, both preoperatively and postoperatively. To induce use of the nonpreferred limb, a bracelet, which prevented reaching but not other movements, was attached to the forearm of the preferred forelimb. Whereas small cortical lesions of the forepaw area of the sensorimotor cortex mildly influenced limb preference and use, larger lesions changed preference. Furthermore, medium-sized sensorimotor cortex lesions impaired contralateral limb use, although surprising recovery occurred on the forced tests with the bracelet. Large cortical lesions abolished effective reaching even on the forced tests. Impairments similar to those following sensorimotor cortex lesions were also obtained following small and large caudate-putamen lesions. By contrast, unilateral dopamine depletions not only blocked use of the limb contralateral to the depletion but also impaired use of the ipsilateral limb. There was recovery in use of the ipsilateral forelimb but not the contralateral forelimb. Correlational analysis showed a weak relation between methamphetamine-induced rotation and limb preference preoperatively but no significant relation between these two variables postoperatively. The similarity in the deficits following sensorimotor cortex lesions and basal ganglia lesions suggests that skilled forelimb use depends upon a shared neural organization within the two systems. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Corpus Striatum 3)Dopamine 4)Female 5)Forelimb 6)Methamphetamine 7)Motor Cortex 8)Psychomotor Performance 9)Rats 10)Rats, Inbred Strains 11)Stereotyped Behavior 12)Substantia Nigra 13)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.", "output": "Yes", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

When indomethacin was applied immediately after irradiation, UVR (ultraviolet radiation) dose-dependent suppression of erythema was demonstrated for both wavelengths until 36 h after irradiation when both indomethacin and control gel base-treated sites were equally erythematous. Suppression of erythema also occurred when application of indomethacin was delayed until 24 h after irradiation, showing that for both wavelengths prostaglandin synthesis remains increased throughout this period. The degree of suppression at any time, however, was no greater than that achieved by a single application immediately after irradiation, indicating that the eventual equal erythema of indomethacin and gel base-treated sites was not due to tachyphylaxis or inadequate dosage. Construction of dose-response curves for the indomethacin-responsive and indomethacin-unresponsive components of erythema shows that in human skin the difference in erythemal response to UVB and UVC radiation is not due to the formation of different mediators at these wavelengths. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Administration, Topical 2)Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation 3)Erythema 4)Human 5)Indomethacin 6)Models, Biological 7)Skin 8)Ultraviolet Rays", "output": "Yes", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Follicles are freed from the surrounding connective tissue by shearing, which is effected by repeated cutting with a loosely fitting pair of scissors, and collected individually under liquid using gentle aspiration. Ultrastructural analysis indicates that the follicles are sheared away from the surrounding dermis in the region of the connective tissue capsule which encircles the hair. The follicles appear viable by light and electron microscopy and, within 2 h of isolation, retain the capacity to incorporate [3H]thymidine into DNA and [35S]methionine into proteins as judged by autoradiography. A histologic comparison indicates that the structural integrity of follicles isolated by this new method is significantly superior to those plucked from the animal at the same time. The method affords the isolation of large numbers of hair follicles, without resort to enzyme treatments, suitable for biologic studies in the absence of other skin appendages and dermis. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Health Education 3)Human", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Adherent human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as human and guinea pig alveolar macrophages were found to contain bombesin.

In the interval between 3 and 10 to 12 months, mean myocyte cell volume per nucleus increased 53 and 26% in the left and the right ventricle, respectively. The total number of myocyte nuclei remained constant in either ventricle. In the following period, between 10 to 12 and 19 to 21 months, a 39% further cellular hypertrophy on the left side of the heart was found in association with an 18% loss of cells in the ventricle. Cell loss was accompanied by discrete areas of interstitial and replacement fibrosis in the subendocardium. In contrast, no myocardial damage was observed in the right ventricle, and the measured 35% additional enlargement of myocytes occurred without a change in cell number. Thus, the aging left ventricle is composed of a smaller number of hypertrophied cells. Cellular hypertrophy may explain the unaltered cardiac function of the aged myocardium. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Collagen 2)Epistaxis 3)Gelatin Sponge, Absorbable", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Dust exposure was estimated by personal and area sampling for total dust during a work shift and cumulative exposure by duration of employment. Seven percent of the workers had an elevated RAST, and 20% had nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Elevation in RAST was associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Almost half (46%) of the workers with RAST elevation had bronchial hyperresponsiveness compared to 18% in workers with no RAST elevation. The association was unaffected by total IgE level or by limiting the analysis to workers without respiratory symptoms and was most apparent in younger workers. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was associated with increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as with lower levels of pulmonary function. The likelihood of bronchial hyperresponsiveness increased with increasing age but was unrelated to the dust-exposure concentration. RAST elevation was unrelated to employment duration or dust exposure and was not associated with an increased prevalence of symptoms or lower levels of pulmonary function independent of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We conclude that plicatic acid-specific IgE and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness are associated in western red-cedar workers and that this association may reflect a causal connection. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Electrophoresis 2)Electrophoresis, Starch Gel 3)Human", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Here we report that colloidal gold solutions conjugated with SpA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), or gelatin bind selectively to structures in glutaraldehyde-fixed, plastic-embedded epidermis of rabbit, mouse, and human. Two types of keratohyaline granules are present in epidermis, a phosphorus-rich (PR) and a sulphur-rich (SR) type. The PR keratohyaline granules were strongly labeled with gold particles, whereas SR keratohyaline granules or other structures in the living cells of epidermis were unlabeled. The PR keratohyaline granules are assumed to be precursors of the matrix protein of cornified cells, and intense gold labeling occurred over the lower layer of cornified cells (i.e., stratum lucidum). More superficial cornified cells were weakly labeled or unlabeled. The gold labeling pattern was identical whether SpA, BSA, or gelatin was used to stabilize the colloidal gold solution. The mechanism of binding of protein-conjugated gold to PR keratohyaline granules and matrix protein of cornified cells is not clear. It is speculated that the charged gold particles are not completely coated by the stabilizing protein, allowing for an electrostatic interaction with charged proteins in sections of cells. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Africa 2)Human 3)Models, Genetic", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Vessel edges were measured by use of catheter calibration and an automated computer algorithm yielding two \"absolute dimensions\" (mean and minimum diameters) and two measurements (percent stenosis and atheroma area) that required a \"normal reference\" diameter. The coefficient of variation for repeated segment measurements was less for mean and minimum diameter than for percent stenosis and area of atheroma. The best measure of progression of coronary disease as determined by t test comparison of different methods was the change in mean diameter over time (6.7 +/- 14.1% decrease), whether calculated on a per coronary segment or per patient basis (p less than .001). Based on this measurement and its standard deviation of progression of coronary disease in this patient subset with relatively benign disease, it is estimated that 470 patients per group would be required for an interventional study to demonstrate a 33% reduction in disease progression (207 patients for 50% reduction) at a 95% confidence level and 90% power. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Cineradiography 2)Comparative Study 3)Coronary Disease 4)Coronary Vessels 5)Evaluation Studies 6)Follow-Up Studies 7)Heart Catheterization 8)Human 9)Image Processing, Computer-Assisted 10)Methods 11)Random Allocation 12)Retrospective Studies 13)Risk 14)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 15)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 16)Time Factors.", "output": "Yes", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

The AGN cases were both postpharyngeal and postpyodermal in origin. Despite the fact that ARF and AGN were occurring in the same neighborhoods and among families of equivalent size and socioeconomic status, the pharyngeal isolation rates of group A streptococci were significantly lower among patients with ARF and their household contacts than among patients with AGN and their contacts. Moreover, the streptococcal throat colonization rates and geometric mean anti-streptolysin O titers were similar in ARF families and the families of noninfected controls. Streptococci of M-type 5, a highly rheumatogenic type, were isolated from three patients with ARF (representing 36% of group A isolates from this group) and one ARF contact but never from patients with AGN, control subjects, or their respective contacts. These observations suggest possible differences in the streptococcal milieus from which ARF and AGN cases emerge. The nature of such differences requires further exploration. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accidents 2)Hungary 3)Nuclear Reactors", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Twenty-five patients were anaesthetized with halothane at least 10 times in a year. No patient developed postoperative jaundice. Sixty-nine children were exposed to two halothane anaesthetics within 28 days on 149 occasions and serial estimations of serum liver enzyme concentrations were obtained. Minor increases in the concentrations of serum AST and ALT were recorded in 10.6% and 4.7% of patient entries, respectively. Postoperative GGT and SAP concentrations were increased in 2.7% of patient entries. Patients in whom enzyme values were increased before the first anaesthetic were no more likely than other subjects to develop further changes. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Anesthesia, Inhalation 3)Child 4)Child, Preschool 5)Female 6)Halothane 7)Hepatitis, Toxic 8)Human 9)Infant 10)Liver 11)Male 12)Postoperative Period 13)Prospective Studies 14)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 15)Time Factors.", "output": "Yes", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Fourteen hybridomas producing antibody against TSST-1 were isolated independently. The culture supernatant and ascitic fluids from each were analyzed to determine the mAb isotypes. Seven of the mAb were IgG1, and the remaining seven were IgM; all the mAb had kappa light chains. Immunoglobulin was partially purified from hybridoma-generated ascitic fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation and tested for the ability to block TSST-1-induced mitogenicity and immunosuppression. Three mAb (all IgG1) were shown to block both the toxin-induced mitogenicity and the suppression. None of the mAb tested inhibited just one of the two toxin activities. The neutralizing mAb were then used in Western analysis with previously mapped cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-generated toxin fragments to localize the aforementioned biologic functions. The Western blot analysis showed that the mitogenic and the suppressive functions of TSST-1 were located on a 14,000 dalton internal CNBr fragment. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accidents 2)Adult 3)Body Burden", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Reports so far suggest that it is a progressive or at least a stationary condition. There are no detailed reports on recommended therapy. A prospective clinical study was conducted to show regression of LK following extracapsular cataract extraction. Seventeen black patients (26 eyes) with LK and mature cataracts underwent extracapsular cataract extraction. The severity of the LK was recorded photographically pre- and postoperatively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to fifteen months. Twenty-four eyes (92%) showed regression of the LK. The reduction in exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of aphakic photophobia could be one of the factors which have led to the regression of the LK. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Aged 2)Cataract Extraction 3)Cornea 4)Corneal Diseases 5)Female 6)Human 7)Male 8)Middle Age 9)Ultraviolet Rays 10)Visual Acuity.", "output": "Yes", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

The concentrations of 21 elements sampled at 54 places on 30 human bones in each of 5 skeletons indicated that the magnesium/zinc ratio was the most reliable and that the zinc/sodium, magnesium/sodium, and chromium/sodium ratios could be used as supplements to help reassemble human bones belonging to the same individual after all standard techniques had been used. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Nomenclature 3)Phylogeny", "output": "No", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1250.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.
