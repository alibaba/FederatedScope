POST : I've been seeing a guy for a few weeks now, we've been on a few dates but haven't done anything sexual except from making out. I always like to take things slow because in the gay community there are a lot of purely sexual relationships, but I personally prefer monogamy and want to know someone is interested in me and not just my genitals.\n\nAfter a few weeks, this guy and I got on really well together and we were clearly both attracted to each other, I felt comfortable enough with him that I thought we could take our relationship to \"the next level\" (which he wanted to do on our first date so I knew he would also want to\u2026 this is sort of relevant later on!). We were texting and I pretty much said that I was fine with moving the relationship forward and he then told me that he is HIV-positive, but is on medication which means it can't be passed onto sexual partners.\n\nI know this is bad to say but all my sexual attraction to him disappeared in that very moment. I know that if I had sex with him, I would be worrying the whole time about HIV transmission. I also know it's illogical because it's not transmissable but I just wouldn't feel safe. I'm very very very careful with sexual activity because I know HIV is a bigger problem in the gay community than for straight people and it's something I really don't want in my life, even though I know people can live completely fulfilling lives and normal lifespans with it.\n\nI didn't have the courage to tell him that I didn't want to have sex with him because of his HIV status so I sort of wrapped up the conversation and then deliberately brought up politics (which I know is a big issue for a lot of people) a few days later and pretended to end things with him over that saying that \"we just didn't see eye to eye\". In reality I couldn't care less about his political beliefs, I just can't see myself being intimate with someone who has HIV.\n\nI told my sister about this and she said I was being judgemental and ruining what could be a great relationship. It's sad but I see her points in some ways. This guy was really respectful of my wishes to not have sex which can sometimes be rare to find in the gay community, he's really attractive and intelligent and very caring + kind. But I just can't seem to get past his HIV, and I wish I could but I can't. Also, on our first date he wanted to hook up and I'm 99% sure he wasn't even going to tell me he was HIV positive which makes me question if he's the person I thought he was.\n\nI know no one is obligated to have sex with anyone else, consent is important and I think rejection for any reason is fine, but I can't help feel like I have a stigma in my mind and I feel really guilty about even thinking like this\u2026 am I the asshole?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

My friend group is amazing and i\u2019m very lucky to have them i would be lost without these people. \n\nHowever a friend and i recently had a disagreement and they told me they hated my significant other (in an effort to hurt me i guess). We are back on talking terms even though our friendship took a hit after that. They (the friend) is back to coming over and hanging out.\n\nMy problem now is that my s/o and i are about to move in together-from all indications it seems like my friend group is expecting my new place to be the hang out spot again since it\u2019s not too far from my old place and has all the benefits sans my mom\u2019s cookies :,)  \n\nI am uncomfortable with the idea of my friend coming over to my new apartment if they do not like my s/o. It\u2019s not just my place anymore-it\u2019s my s/o\u2019s home as well. personally, i would be upset if my s/o brought someone into my home who does not like me/would be glad if we broke up so I am trying to extend the same courtesy.\n\nThis friend and I have been friends for many many years and this fight is one of maybe a handful we\u2019ve ever had. It feels strange to be moving somewhere know my house wont have that open door policy we\u2019ve always had anymore. \n\nI have not spoken to anyone about this as I feel like I am being forced to choose between two people i love very much and don\u2019t know how to relay this story to others verbally without sounding biased towards one side or the other. \n\nWIBTA if I shirked hosting duties?

Prior to that we had always been very close.  She is married but separated they have three children.  I divorced her biological father when she was six months old. Her paternal grandmother and I were extremely close (important) closer that my bio mother and I.\n\nLast weekend my daughter asked if the oldest grandson could spend the weekend with us (my husband and I) while the two other kids (boy and girl) went to visit their dad. Naturally we said yes.  Our rule of thumb is that we never ask questions we just go with the flow.  My daughter does not like questions and has a quick temper.  We surmised from a few comments dropped by the kids that the oldest son does not enjoy being around her father nor does he like his father's one bedroom apartment.  We reside two houses away from my daughter and the children.  (kids ages 16,14,11).\n\nYesterday afternoon my SIL called me to thank me for mailing him his birthday card and Christmas card (both had $$). My daughter's grandmother always remembered me on every holiday with a card, sweet note and a check.  She was very good to me and was a wonderful example of the perfect MIL. My goal has always been to emulate her in every aspect that I can. Due to the volatility of my daughter's pending divorce I have been kind to my SIL but have kept my distance. After thanking me for the cards and money he explained that the oldest son was sick with a cold. He further advised that he felt it would be best if said child did not have to be cramped into the 1 bedroom with the two siblings and father for the weekend.  He asked if the boy could spend the weekend with us again.  I assured him we would be fine with it.  He asked if it should be kept a secret from daughter I advised she should absolutely be advised of the situation. Phone call ended with plans for him to drop off boys and pick up dinner I had made for all of them.\n\n5:00 rolled around the front door slammed open and I heard screaming \"where the Hell is she?\"  I ran from the back of the house. My daughter was there as I came to a halt she was yelling about me inserting myself into the middle of her family. My husband tried to stop her and explain what had happened but she kept yelling and swearing. Finally my husband said \"that's it, you get the eff out of my house!\". I stood there with my jaw hanging. Not usually a guppy this time I was completely dumbfounded, flat footed gob smacked. She whirled and slammed out the door.\n\nWithin ten minutes SIL called. Come to find out that moron had only told daughter that son was \"going to a clean safe place\" and then proceeded to drive from daughter's house two driveways down to our house.  Daughter became enraged and they had a verbal altercation in the street.  Oldest son who is a great kid was livid and cussing his father out (completely out of character I swear) standing on the porch of his father's apartment in the rain and refusing to come inside.  I spoke to him on the phone and calmed him down.  SIL wanted to bring son over to my house I said I could not get in the middle of it.   SIL brought all three kids over to pick up the food I had made for them. oldest son sat in car. I went out and hugged him, kissed his cheek told him everything would be okay sorry this was happening. This sweet straight A Honor Roll boy had tears in his eyes. My heart is breaking for him. \n\nMy husband and daughter are normally close. He walked over to talk with her.

The reason, which I didn\u2019t reveal to the group chat but did to a friend who also happened to be in the group later in DMs, was my mother. \n\nBackstory time: I took Latin for 2 years, which was required for all students at my school that was a \u2018University Prep\u2019, during the height of my mom\u2019s \u2018Stereotypical Chinese Mother\u2019 phase. I literally had the words \u201cIf you don\u2019t get into Harvard, go back to China\u201d written in Chinese in my notebook by my mom. Now, my mom is no longer as crazy (just in a different way but I\u2019m also no longer her obedient little drone that wants to be a surgeon), but during this time, there was a lot of yelling, etc. she never hit me, but being an antisocial Chinese kid with only my mom, I valued her opinion above anyone else\u2019s, and it crushed me when she screamed at me for my shortcomings.\n\nOne notable memory was when she ripped the cover off of a novel she got for me at TJMaxx during one of these screaming episodes, throwing it and scattering some of the pages into the backyard (dog chewed on it). \n\nSo, whenever something makes me remember that time, I get severe anxiety. I\u2019ve never gone to get any kind of diagnosis or anything because, while I believe and want to enforce the importance of mental health, I\u2019m still a little too Asian to try and take care of that aspect for myself. But, I\u2019d get rapid heart beat, this cold, overwhelming fear that makes it feel like I\u2019ve got fish bones stuck in my throat, start trembling, a weird detached feeling to myself, amongst a list of other symptoms. \n\nNow, about what happened in the present: One person that I maybe spoke 3 times to on this server, after I offhandedly said that I get a little bit of a ptsd flashback whenever I read Latin, said, \u201cYou know using the term PTSD in a non traumatic way is hurtful to those who have actual PTSD\u2019 and I just???\n\nI felt a rage go through me, which was weird because I\u2019m so used to feeling only dull sensations of emotions nowadays, and I had to put down my phone for a few minutes because earlier listed symptoms haven\u2019t stopped trying to tombstone pile-drive me into a full blown mess. But, after I calmed down a little, I replied, \u201cAight, but you don\u2019t know me like that\u201d and haven\u2019t talked to her since.\n\nWhenever she speaks in chat, even if I\u2019d been active af previously, I wouldn\u2019t respond to what she said. This was from like, the tail end of January, and I can\u2019t help feeling like I\u2019m being sensitive and overreacting a little....\n\nAITA?", "output": "yes", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

POST : For context, my friend \"alex\" and I are 30. \n\nSo I've been friends with my buddy, Alex, for a while now. Maybe 10 years. We've always been friends but we didn't really hang out that much until a mutual friend, Bill, moved away a few years back. After that I'd say he was one of my 10 closest friends. \n\nHe dated a girl, Kendra, for roughly two years and it ended about 14 months ago. Kendra ended it with him and Alex didn't take it well for a while. I had gone through a bit of a break up around the same time and we both confided in each other. \n\nI met Kendra through Bill, our mutual friend who moved away. We knew each other before she and Alex dated but I didn't really become good friends with Kendra until they started dating. That said, If he hadn't asked her out first I was 100% going to. They ended up getting together and, besides an occasional passing attraction to her that was easily squashed, everything was great in the friend group. However, we were friends outside the context of their relationship i.e. we'd talk and hang out with mutual friends even if Alex wasnt around. \n\nIn the year since they broke up, Alex had a brief one or two month fling with a mutual friend. After this he dated another mutual friend for about 3 months. Recently, he had a month long fling with one of Kendra's estranged friends. Kendra and this girl were good friends and had a feud recently which has caused them to no longer speak. He also had a one night stand with a girl from a bar. I felt it was necessary to the story to know he'd been actively dating since the breakup, and not just moping over Kendra. \n\nSome context for how I ended up asking Kendra out... we reconnected over Thanksgiving just through small talk. She asked if I had plans for the rivalry game that is big in my area. Since my house is well known as the usual gathering spot, I said I had no plans but figured people would show up and said she'd be more than welcome to join. Two days later, the day of the game, she asks if I was still doing something. I said no one I knew of was coming over and ixd probably just watch until it got ugly. She replied that she didn't really care and just wanted to get out for a while. Honestly, this felt a little flimsy considering it's a 45 minute drive from her place and this is the first time I saw her since August, over 3 months before. But she came down with no hesitation. For most of the game my roommate was present and some mutual friends stopped by as well. We were alone for roughly 20 minutes while my roommate was out at the store. Also, she hadn't eaten so we made a fast food run together. I didn't feel this would be viewed as inappropriate by Alex. All in all, we had a great time catching up. We laughed about old times and reminisced about past adventures. It just felt like nothing had changed and we went right back to being good friends. \n\nLater that night, when we were alone, she asked me to go with her on a day trip to Asheville which is about 2 hours from my town. So far as I know I'm the only one she had asked. I said no as I though this may upset alex. I don't believe this was intended as anything other than friendly. But in two days Kendra had driven down to watch the game with only me (so far as she knew) and asked me to accompany her to Asheville, who's tourist slogan is \"Asheville is for lovers.\" So I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider the possibility she was hinting at something or even asking me out directly. \n\nAs the next day comes and goes I see snapchats that she did go, with another mutual friend of Alex and myself. At this point I got to thinking that I really wished I had gone. I panicked a little at the thought of missing an opportunity with Kendra. At this time I started planning to take her to our mutual team's championship game the following weekend. I was fairly sure she would accept considering we talked about how she had never been to a game and really wanted to go. \n\nBefore I went through with this plan I wanted to ask the opinion of our long time mutual friend, Bill, and another mutual friend, Tyler, who's opinion I trust. Both said they thought I should go for it and they wouldn't blame me. Although, our close mutual friend did say Alex would defintely be mad, but that Alex had made advances on one of his ex girlfriends. And if he had been in my position he would definitely go for it. \n\nSo I went for it on Monday. I did know I wanted to tell Alex the truth, but I didn't call him specifically to tell him the situation. I asked her and she was very excited as was I. Once she got work off (tuesday) and confirmed we were going she asked how much tickets were and if anyone else was going. I told her I intended it to be my treat and that it was just us (which I though was a pretty clear message it was a date). She said nothing negative and we just gushed about how excited we were. \n\nThursday night we are texting and she asks me if it was a date. I told her that was my intention. She responded: \n\n\"I love hanging out with you, I think you're awesome!!! You are smart, adventurous, funny, and considerate. It's just super weird because you are best friends with my ex, who I'm pretty sure still has feelings for me. I can't do that. I feel like it's kind of fucked up and I don't want to come in between y'all.\" \n\nI need to point out here that when I had my closest friend read that message he said \"best friend? Did you know about that?\" \n\nI told her I understood completely and had really struggled with deciding whether or not to ask. With that in mind we decided to go to the game anyways, on the understanding it was just as friends. \n\nThe day of the game Alex sends me a text asking what I am doing that day (this is the first time we've talked since before Thanksgiving when I reconnected with his ex). I was straight forward and told him I was going to the game with our mutual friend (one who's opinion I asked), his girlfriend, and Kendra. He said \"Kendra? Kinda random... how'd that happen?\" I told him the brief story, including that I had asked her as a date, but after talking we decided it was best we just go as friends. \n\nI tried explaining and responding as well as I could. I called him the next day but he was with family so we couldn't talk. The next day he picked up and I went over to discuss it with him to try and clear the air. \n\nHe was more hurt than I expected. I knew it wouldn't be easy to come to terms with but I thought 14 months and 3 flings later it wouldn't be anything that jeopardized a friendship. Nevertheless, he seemed pretty hurt and I don't know what will happen from here. I'm torn up about it. One minute I'll feel so ashamed and guilty. But the more I think about it the less I think my actions were so terrible given the context. \n\nThanks for reading! I hope my ramblings were at least enjoyable to read. This is the most dramatic or controversial thing I've done in my living memory and I'm losing my mind a little. Even typing it out was therapeutic but I'd love opinions. I'd rather clearly be the asshole than be drowning in confusion.

She just shrugs no matter what I ask(her language skill is good enough to understand the short sentences I organized to be as simple as possible).\n\n Last week, we set up a meeting to discuss one of the most important interim report of the semester. It'd be a long meeting so it was a little hard to find out when would be ok for everyone. Since it was impossible for everyone to meet up the same time, we set up the meeting for the day when Y wasn't available and told her we'd share the meeting result to her via email.\n\n I'm not sure how did she feel about that. Anyway the meeting was successful; the hardest part was to decide which assignment should we give to Y(She gotta do something we can write down on the report). We made up an easy assignment that we don't really need to avoid any trouble in case she screws up.\n\n Now I want to tell Y that she doesn't have to waste her time texting to her friends while other teammates discuss and we won't tell the professor.

So after the 3 months it turned out he was going to be moving in, even though they\u2019ve only known each other for around 4 months at this point.

Since I was new, I didn't have many friends which is why I chose to join a project of theirs. I was assigned to a team with people I barely knew so I decided to talk to the friendliest face there. We got to chatting and seemed to vibe pretty well. We'd grab food and just hang out after talking about project work. Through her, I got to befriend other people in the org and wasn't as shy as before. In my mind, Im thinking \"this is going great thanks to her.\" She was also a person I was very open with as I told her about my problems, and thought she could be that stable friend to be there for me. It all changed when her feelings came. We went to catch a movie that we've both been waiting for alone because our two friends couldn't make it. It was fine and dandy until she kept insisting on resting her head on me and hold my hand. It was weird. I left that night with a bad feeling of what was to come. \nA day later, she ended up messaging me to meet up because she had to tell me something. I went, and she told me she liked me a lot. I said I didn't, (and I really did not). She was fine at first but I heard from her friends that apparently she thought all this time that I was hitting on her. That all the friendly acts I've been doing like walking her to her friend's car in the rain after she got drunk was because apparently I had feelings for her. That me also saying \"love ya man\" when she seriously helped me out was leading her on. I'm a guy that genuinely thinks you can have a non romantic love or \"philia\". That me asking her to grab food (because our breaks coincided a lot) was me \"making the moves\". This whole shebang ends up blowing up as I couldn't talk to her about project stuff without her getting mad at me. What makes it worse is that her friends called me a fuck boy for not \"manning up\" and for playing with the feelings of their friend. It sucks that they told other people about this too. This effectively destroyed any hope of me ever coming back to the org, and had severed a lot of my relationships with those group of people.\n\nTldr: Girl I befriended thought I was going for her.

For a while we only needed one as I was working from home but that changed late last year. We have been borrowing a truck from my father in law for the past few months but that is only a temporary solution and he told us in January that we needed to start saving for a vehicle. He gave us 6 months of use of his truck and then he is going to need it back.\n\nAbout a month ago, my father in law approached us and told us that he had found a car that he felt we should purchase. Its a 2004 Cadillac DTS with 88,000 miles on it. Its not currently running as it has a blown head gasket, that we know of, but my father in law can fix that. He's worked on cars his whole life and is not worried about the repairs, but there will be additional cost to get the vehicle in working order. At the time my wife and I didn't really have the money to purchase a car, especially when there were potential unknown costs to fix it. We both were also imagining an old boat with a bench seat in the front and the ability to fit a smart car in the trunk. Not something either of us wanted. So we said no, but he went ahead and purchased the car for $600.\n\nMy sister in law and her boyfriend have been living with my wife and I for the past few months because they were unable to afford moving into a new apartment when their lease ended at the end of last year. They have two cars, her Prius which is newer but has quite a few miles on it, and a POS Honda Accord coupe that he purchased a while back. When I say POS, I mean it. The entire roof is falling apart on the car. It leaks when it rains, etc. There are definitely issues. Last month when she heard that my wife and I didn't want to buy the car, she decided that she wanted it to replace the accord that she drives. She called her dad and told him she wanted the car.\n\nMy wife and I recently found out that I am going to be getting an extra paycheck next month which is significant as I get paid monthly and this would allow us to go buy a $2000-3000 car without much issue. This past weekend my wife and I went out to visit my in-laws and my father in law told us to take a look at the car.

Well,  I am a vet and so was my late husband and it happens I won!  Two days later he came over to my house. I had ceiling fans that I wanted wired and hung in the bedrooms.  He said that that would be easy and then he went on about how he was going to put recessed lighting downstairs and Bluetooth speaker light fixtures in all the bathrooms... I was absolutely thrilled.  \n\nWell months went by and he didn't answer my calls occasionally he would tell me he was going to come out and then he wouldn't.  Well on Veteran's Day Sunday he texts me out of the blue and says he wants to come Monday and do the work. I spent the entire day cleaning (look I have 4 kids and work full time)  He came in Monday built the ceiling fans but didn't install them... just left them in the middle of my kids rooms, he said he'd be back Weds, but he didn't. Some of his crew stopped by unannounced today to install them, but it's very clear I'm not getting any of the recessed lighting or the Bluetooth speakers. \n\nI mean I'm super excited to get the ceiling fans put in, but I'm kind of bummed that he would come to my house and say he was going to do a bunch of things that he had no intentions of doing.

I don't think these ideas are helpful in terms of reality and will often join in the conversation by explaining how experimentation and science works and always cover myself with the knowledge that I don't know everything - they seem to be offended by my mere mentioning of the fact that for example. candida, which most everybody has in their gut, can be treated with anti-fungal cream when causing thrush in the mouth or... you know where - then I further explained that if it was in their blood that it would be a legitimate medical emergency.  \n\n\nThis is where the potential assholery comes into play.

POST : This may get long, but I'll try condense it as much as possible.\n\nA couple of years ago, my then girlfriend (22 at the time) moved in with me (24 at the time) and my two engaged housemates. We'd been dating for about 8 months at the time and she'd been wanting to move out of her parent's place as she had issues with them. What started as a trial move just became her staying permenantly and everyone seemed ok with it. I was having a great deal of mental issues with work and figured it'd be a good thing to have my partner close by to support me (in hindsight not the healthiest plan on either of our parts, but that's a whole other story).\n\nLess than a month later, she starts hinting at wanting a dog. I should mention that the house already had a dog and a cat owned by my housemates, but she wanted a dog for \"us\". She was aware of my issues and thought having a dog would help alleviate them. Problem is, she wanted a puppy. I told her many times that I was simply not in the right frame of mind to train a puppy as it required a lot of patience and time. Not to mention that we'd be forced to keep a puppy inside 24/7 until it got its vaccinations, the issues with my work causing me not to get paid much, and the fact we'd need to account for my housemates pets. \n\nUnfortunately, and against my better judgement, she eventually convinced me after several weeks of pleading and taking me to see a litter of puppies our friend's dog had recently birthed. My only condition was that she ask the housemates. As it turns out, they both told her that she needed to ask the other two if it was alright, so she took that as a \"yes\" from everyone and went forward with the adoption.\n\nWhat followed was easily some of the worst months of my life. Just as I'd predicted, I was not able to cope with training a dog, and she barely lifted a finger to discipline him. Because of that, the pup would misbehave and act aggressively, then go to my ex for protection, which she'd enable. I ended up taking a lot of my frustration out on the poor pup, which I freely admit were not my finest moments (nothing overly abusive, but a lot of shouting and some harder-than-necessary smacks). \n\nThe worst day was easily my housemate's wedding day when, after an amazing day out celebrating their union, I come home to find the dog had chewed up a whole bunch of stuff in our room, pissed and shit all over the bed, scratched up the carpet, and thrashed his food and water bowl around. I actually couldn't do anything but stare despondantly at the mess as my ex picked the dog up and said something to the effect of \"Oh dear, you've made quite a mess. You must've missed us so much!\".\n\nAs a few more months passed, my health got much worse to the point I needed an intervention, a week after which my ex broke up with me since she couldn't handle it. She ended up taking the dog with her back to her parents. Lo and behold, after 3 days of constantly being upset over it all, it was like a spell broke and I was starting to be back to my old self. I got the help I needed and started to fix my life. \n\nAfter a few more months, I hear that my ex is having troubles with the dog being overly aggressive and just not getting along with the other 2 dogs at her parent's. Apparently her mum threatened to take the dog to the pound while she was at work if my ex didn't start disciplining him. A couple of weeks after that, she followed through on that threat, and honestly, I felt happy. Happy that she got the comuppance she deserved, at least in that aspect. Not happy for the dog, obviously. He's the true victim in all of this and I can only hope he went on to find a better home with people who can give him the love he deserves.\n\nBut in any case, am I an asshole for feeling happy that she got what she deserved?

I suggested having John take her since she trusts him, even though I don't really care for me. She said \"I thought you didn't like him?\"\n\nI replied \"I don't, but I trust you\"\n\nShe then panned the camera around to him, shirtless in her bed. They were both fully clothed otherwise. I freaked out a bit. I hung up on her, and when she called back I was pretty upset. She apologized, sent him home, and explained that he was helping her wash the dogs (Shes 5' 100lbs, they are both pitbulls) and his shirt got wet, so she put it in the drier. I said \"Well, we have different morality of what's okay in a relationship.\" She tried to joke it off commenting on my having something to eat saying \"Well you have a snack in bed too\" and that's when I lost it. \n\nMy Fiance has problems sleeping. I often tell her little stories to get her to bed. I told her \"How about next time you can't sleep you call John too!\" and hung up. She called until I picked up and apologized after sending him home, and cried about how she acted. All was good until I went to work.\n\n\nDuring my work shift, it just ate at the back of my head. My fianc\u00e9 usually calls about an hour after I get off before I go to bed. When she called I told her I needed a nights rest to really get over what happened. She called me a dick and hung up. That was two minutes ago. \n\n\nReddit, AITA?\n", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

Whenever my dad got remarried to my now SM I tried to be friendly, making casual remarks I thought were funny, playing off mistakes I made as being a goof, and looking past her mistakes. Despite that, SM always had a seemingly bias opinion of my brother and I. She would crack her own \u201cjokes\u201d daily (which consisted of mocking my brother and I\u2019s weaknesses). Whenever my brother and I would voice our displeasure, she would get incredibly defensive and reply, \u201cI was only joking\u201d, \u201cIt was just sarcasm!\u201d Sometimes the jokes wouldn\u2019t even be about our weaknesses, but just plain out lies about our hobbies, habits, etc. Recently SM has even been testing us.

POST : If you read the title you might be thinking: \u201cof course, you are cheating.\u201d And while i agree with that, this is a bit more complicated.\n\nSo my friend is not dating this girl. They haven\u2019t done anything together, they talk quite often but they say they are not in a relationship with each other. I have no idea if they have kissed or anything(i dont think so, but there is a chance). And they haven\u2019t done more than that (if they have done it).  My friend tells me sometimes about her, but he says that he doesn\u2019t want a relationship EVERYTIME. \n\nSo last friday night he asked if someone wanted to hang out. I said i wanted to but all the other people in the chat said they didn\u2019t want to or didn\u2019t have time. So we were together, and this girl was coming too. We decided to meet up at a supermarket and drink something or whatever. \n\nFast forward an hour or so, we have talked a bit and were sitting in a playground. We had a bottle of Bacardi Razz and 0,8 grams of weed. We drank something and smoked the spliff (weed with tobacco). We talked more and decided to go to a lake, drank some more (already tipsy and stoned). In the end we finished the entire botlle with three people, i had drank the most even though i never drink and never have been drunk. Might be important. \n\nFast forward even more, (here comes the \u2018bad\u2019 part for me) after we chilled at my friends house me and the girl left. Talked some more and then went to out own house. This has been quite some time, we met up at 2230 and now it was 300. We had to split up on a road, but we went to a little park and then talked some more. In the end i asked for a goodnight kiss, this was mostly meant ironically, but she had no problem so we kissed each other on the cheek and hugged for a bit. \n\nThe next morning i got a message from my friend who heard it from the girl and wasnt really happy with it. I kind  of denied it but he said i shouldnt do it. It sounded like he really didn\u2019t like it. So i am kind of stressed if this is going to be bad for our friendship and if i am really wrong so be fair.\n\nA short explanation or tl;dr:\n-friend is close friends with a girl but doesnt have/want a relationship (yet). \n- we were pretty drunk, my first time drinking a lot.\n- kissed the girl when we cycled to our homes, not very intimate.\n- the girl is very nice and looks very good, but i am not really interested in having a relationship. \n- the friend isn\u2019t very happy, for understandable but also weird reasons. \n\nPlease be fair, i really want to know if i am wrong or if my friend should just say he doesn\u2019t want me to be intimate with this girl and be more clear.

POST : Two nights ago I was going to a quick drink before dinner organized by a friend of mine who I hadn\u2019t seen or heard from in a long time; we used to be very close, but then she got engaged and started building on her career and I had to focus on mine.\nSo I was pleased to know she was planning something for the evening for our group of friends and decided to attend.\nUnfortunately, due to a few work related issues I had to call in and tell them I was gonna be around 25 minutes late.\nThankfully, another friend of mine was late as well and offered to drive me to the place.\nAs we\u2019re driving to the location we receive several audio messages from our friend, saying she wasn\u2019t happy at all of us being late and that since there weren\u2019t any seats to the pub, \u201cthey\u201d had decided to have dinner to a nearby Chinese restaurant, out of nowhere.\nI only had 10\u20ac as I had forgot to withdraw, enough for a drink but too little for a full dinner, and since we were already late I decided to go to the restaurant anyway and order only a few small courses.\nWhen we got to the place, neither me or the friend who had driven me were happy for the last minute change, but since we were 20 minutes late we decided to just go with it, since we didn\u2019t want to piss her off anymore.\nAs we enter the restaurant we discovered that our friend had brought with herself her fianc\u00e9e (generally a nice guy but can get pretty tiring and obnoxious with his usual array of sexist and lame jokes) and a friend of her fianc\u00e9e, a guy who I recognized from a previous night out and whose antics are much worse than those of the fianc\u00e9e.\nMy other two friends, who had got there on time, seemed to just be going on with it and try to have a good time, despite not being fans of that particular individual.\nMy jaw locked (this wasn\u2019t the first time she had invited him to our nights out without telling anything to anyone, despite criticizing others in the past who brought their SOs with them) and i tried my best not to look uncomfortable, despite one lame \u201cjoke\u201d from the fianc\u00e9e that was something like \u201c5 minutes more and I would have beaten you to a pulp\u201d which really isn\u2019t a kind of humor I appreciate and felt more like a passive aggressive stance to prove I don\u2019t know what. But again, we were late so we just laughed and took our seats.\nI sat near one of the other two friends and since one of them had been left by his fianc\u00e9e the day before I tried to ignore the Fianc\u00e9e and Friend and focus on how he was doing.\nHowever, as expected, they soon started to act in a most despicable manner. \nThey started speaking loudly, calling the waiters with subtle racial slurs and cursing out loud.\nThey weren\u2019t particularly offensive but just plain vulgar while the cursing itself was just too much, in a restaurant with full tables.\nI tried to look for my friend, the girl who had organized the night out, on the other part of the table but she just smiled at me as if everything was going fine.\nShe knew perfectly well that his fianc\u00e9e was more than welcomed to join us in our night outs (despite calling her, in front of everyone during the dinner, \u201ca shovelful of shit\u201d something I already pointed out to her in the past, despite her seemingly not caring beyond wearing a distressed look on her face), but that guy was certainly not, from past situations.\nShe used to be a pretty smart woman and when we previously pointed out her friend\u2019s behavior she just apologized but kept inviting him to our nights out. \nSince everyone seemed to just roll with it I just decided to continue ignoring them and focus on a friend of mine who was cracking up subtle jokes about them.\nOne of these jokes made me laugh a bit and apparently the girl who had organized the night noticed it.\nThe evening kept getting worse; the friend of mine who had driven me there got nervous from the guys\u2019 behavior and we ended up fighting for a frivolous and unrelated issue.\nLater, when I tried to pay my order (below the 10\u20ac) the waiter informed me she was gonna split the bill between us, reaching 16\u20ac each, as they didn\u2019t accept payments per order.\nI told the girl I only had those 10\u20ac and she berated me in front of everyone saying \u201cwe always split, but DON\u2019T WORRY we\u2019ll PAY your part\u201d.\nI got so angry at that point that I just yelled \u201cWhatever, AU REVOIR SHOSHANNA\u201d and left the restaurant cause I just couldn\u2019t care less about leaving a good impression after all that had happened.\nI later called the friend I had argued with (she apologized for her behavior and blamed the overall uncomfortableness of the evening for making her nervous) and told me our Friend was angry at me for laughing at those subtle jokes about her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s guy saying I was very rude and \u201cthe only one who wasn\u2019t having a good time\u201d.\nNow, I decided I\u2019m not ever participating to another evening organized by her. I\u2019m more than happy to see her in other situations or things organized by other people in our group, but if I\u2019m ever seeing that guy again I\u2019m gonna turn around and leave, maybe without quoting fictional nazi generals this time.\nI\u2019m not even planning on texting her or ask her to talk about what happened; she is already aware of our feelings on that awful guy, but it seems like she has more of a selective memory/perception when things about her fianc\u00e9e or his friends are discussed even privately with her and frankly I have better things to do than trying to fix the behavior of grown men.\n\nMy other friends told me it would be a bit harsh for me to actively avoid nights out organized by her but at this point, I really just don\u2019t care.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not caring about making a good impression with her vulgar friend? Should I have been more upfront and confront them again? \n\nTL;DR Friend of mine invited a well known trashy friend of her fianc\u00e9e to a gathering of my group of friends, despite knowing our feelings about him, I ended up looking like the only one who couldn\u2019t stand him and left the restaurant we were eating in, quoting a Christoph Waltz character.", "output": "no", "category": "Text Categorization 1128.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.
