Reread the directions and confirmed we had used properly. Ran it again during a swampy, buggy time for roughly 72 hours and it caught ZERO bugs.

I watched all of the available videos before I ordered the sharpening system, when it arrived I read the manual a couple of times while looking at the system and then I watched all of the videos again as I set the sharpening system up. When I put my first knife on it I had a video playing so I could listen to it as I was going through the motions. I attempted to sharpen 6 Victorinox knives that are HC stainless and one carbon knife the carbon knife stained the stone so bad it no longer looks white it is red.

This is disappointing and inconvenient, as I was hoping there was a cheaper alternative to HP inks. Also, when I do print an image, it is very poor quality with streaks, etc. I\u2019m attaching some pictures, of the streaks on the left side of the page, the leaky cartridge which I just opened, and a printout of an image, which is printing with lots of streaks.
