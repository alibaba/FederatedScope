Previously, we have established a protocol of sensitisation and subsequent ovalbumin (Ova) inhalation challenge in guinea-pigs which induced these 4 features (Smith & Broadley, 2007). However, the responses of guinea-pigs to Ova challenge have recently declined, producing no LAR or AHR and diminished EAR and cells.

Airway function was measured in conscious guinea-pigs by whole-body plethysmography to record specific airway conductance (sGaw). Airway responsiveness to aerosolized histamine (0.3mM) was determined before and 24h after Ova challenge. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed for total and differential inflammatory cell counts. Lung sections were stained for counting of eosinophils.', 'Lack of AHR and LAR with the original protocol was confirmed. Increasing the Ova challenge concentration from 100 to 300 \u03bcg/ml restored AHR and eosinophils and increased the peak of the EAR.

Recently, data from empirical research became available to advance the discussion. It was shown that children's competence to consent to clinical research could be accurately assessed by the modified MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research. Age limits for children to be deemed competent to decide on research participation have been studied: generally children of 11.2 years and above were decision-making competent, while children of 9.6 years and younger were not. Age was pointed out to be the key determining factor in children's competence.

The findings may help to do justice to the capacities children possess and challenges they may face when deciding about treatment and research options. We discuss advantages and drawbacks of standardized competence assessment in children on a case-by-case basis compared to application of a fixed age limit, and conclude that a selective implementation of case-by-case competence assessment in specific populations is preferable. We recommend the implementation of age limits based on empirical evidence. Furthermore, we elaborate on a suitable model for informed consent involving children and parents that would do justice to developmental aspects of children and the specific characteristics of the parent-child dyad. Previous research outcomes showed that children's medical decision-making capacities could be operationalized into a standardized assessment instrument. Recommendations for policies include a dual consent procedure, including both child as well as parents, for children from the age of 12 until they reach majority. For children between 10 and 12 years of age, and in case of children older than 12 years in special research populations of mentally compromised patients, we suggest a case-by-case assessment of children's competence to consent.

It was shown that Ang II can activate Ca/Calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) by oxidation via a NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)-dependent pathway leading to increased arrhythmic afterdepolarizations. Interestingly, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) which regulates similar targets as CaMKII has recently been shown to be redox-sensitive as well.', 'This study aims to investigate the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying Ang II-related cardiac arrhythmias with an emphasis on the individual contribution of PKA vs. CaMKII.', 'Isolated ventricular cardiac myocytes from rats and mice were used. Ang II exposure resulted in increased NOX2-dependent ROS generation assessed by expression of redox-sensitive GFP and in myocytes loaded with ROS indicator MitoSOX. Whole cell patch clamp measurements showed that Ang II significantly increased peak Ca and Na current (ICa and INa) possibly by enhancing steady-state activation of ICa and INa. These effects were absent in myocytes lacking functional NOX2 (gp91phox(-/-)). In parallel experiments using PKA inhibitor H89, the Ang II effects on peak INa and ICa were also absent. In contrast, genetic knockout of CaMKII\u03b4 (CaMKII\u03b4(-/-)) did not influence the Ang II-dependent increase in peak ICa and INa. On the other hand, Ang II enhanced INa inactivation, increased late INa and induced diastolic SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum) Ca leak (confocal Ca spark measurements) in a CaMKII\u03b4-, but not PKA-dependent manner. Surprisingly, only the increase in diastolic SR Ca leak was absent in gp91phox(-/-)myocytes suggesting that Ang II regulates INa inactivation in a manner dependent on CaMKII- but not on NOX2.

Spores (alpha(-)beta(-)) lacking most DNA-protective alpha/beta-type small, acid-soluble spore proteins were less resistant to the KMT reagent than wild-type spores but were also not mutagenized, and alpha(-)beta(-) and alpha(-)beta(-)recA spores exhibited nearly identical resistance. Spore resistance to the KMT reagent was greatly decreased if spores had defective coats. However, the level of unsaturated fatty acids in the inner membrane did not determine spore sensitivity to the KMT reagent. Survivors in spore populations killed by the KMT reagent were sensitized to killing by wet heat or nitrous acid and to high salt in plating medium. KMT reagent-killed spores had not released their dipicolinic acid (DPA), although these killed spores released their DPA more readily when germinated with dodecylamine than did untreated spores.

Fetal and neonatal Notch2-cKO livers were devoid of cytokeratin19 (CK19)-, Dolichos-biflorus agglutinin (DBA)-, and SOX9-positive ductal structures, demonstrating absence of prenatal cholangiocyte differentiation. Despite extensive cholestatic hepatocyte necrosis and growth retardation, mortality was only ~15%. Unexpectedly, a slow process of secondary cholangiocyte differentiation and bile-duct formation was initiated around weaning that histologically resembled the ductular reaction. Newly formed ducts varied from rare and non-connected, to multiple, disorganized tubular structures that connected to the extrahepatic bile ducts. Jaundice had disappeared in ~30% of Notch2-cKO mice by 6 months. The absence of NOTCH2 protein in postnatally differentiating cholangiocyte nuclei of Notch2-cKO mice showed that these cells had not originated from non-recombined precursor cells.

We show that positively or negatively charged lipoplexes enter cells cells using both temperature-dependent and -independent uptake mechanisms. Specifically, positively charged lipoplexes predominantly use a temperature-dependent transport when cells are incubated OptiMEM medium. Anionic lipoplexes favour an energy-independent transport and show higher ON activity than cationic lipoplexes in presence of serum.

The population growth rate (\u03bb) of hybrids indicated decreases in both habitat types, and in a semi-natural habitat hybrids became extinct at two sites. Elasticity analyses indicated that seed bank survival was the greatest contributor to \u03bb. In agricultural habitats, hybrid populations were projected to decline, but with persistence times up to 20 years. The seed bank survival rate was the main driver determining persistence.

Little is known about the mechanism behind these phenomena.', 'Serum cytokine levels during conditioning and during the first month after SCT were analysed in 30 patients. Of the 21 patients who became full T-cell DC from the first analysed sample, 12 developed grade II-IV acute graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and the other nine, mild or no acute GVHD. Another nine patients were T-cell mixed chimeras (MC). All MC patients had no or mild acute GVHD.', 'During the pretransplant conditioning, DC patients had higher levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and lower levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and interleukin (IL)-10, compared with MC patients. During the first week after SCT, lower levels of TGF-beta and IL-10 and higher levels of soluble Fas (sFas) were found in DC patients compared with MC patients. During the second and third weeks after SCT, increased levels of TNF-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma and sFas were found among DC patients compared with MC patients. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe acute GVHD had higher levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10 and sFas at 2 weeks post-SCT than in those with less GVHD. Patients homozygous for the TNFd microsatellite alleles 3 or 4 had significantly higher TNF-alpha levels during conditioning and more often developed acute GVHD grades II-IV.\\Question: Do serum levels of cytokines correlate to donor chimerism and acute graft-vs.-host disease after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation?", "output": "These results indicate that an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and immune- modulating cytokines are involved in the development of chimerism and acute GVHD after allo-SCT.

Previous studies in T-cells have suggested that ASM is involved in CD28 signalling, T lymphocyte granule secretion, degranulation, and vesicle shedding similar to the formation of phosphatidylserine-exposing microparticles from glial cells. However, whether ASM affects the development of Treg has not yet been described.', 'Splenocytes, isolated Naive T lymphocytes and cultured T cells were characterized for various immune T cell markers by flow cytometery. Cell proliferation was measured by Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dye, cell cycle analysis by Propidium Iodide (PI), mRNA transcripts by q-RT PCR and protein expression by Western Blotting respectively.', 'ASM deficient mice have higher number of Treg compared with littermate control mice. In vitro induction of ASM deficient T cells in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2 lead to a significantly higher number of Foxp3+ induced Treg (iTreg) compared with control T-cells. Further, ASM deficient iTreg has less AKT (serine 473) phosphorylation and Rictor levels compared with control iTreg. Ceramide C6 led to significant reduction of iTreg in both ASM deficient and WT mice. The reduction in iTreg leads to induction of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-17 but not IFN-\u03b3 mRNA levels.\\Question: Is acid Sphingomyelinase ( ASM ) a Negative Regulator of Regulatory T Cell ( Treg ) Development?", "output": "ASM is a negative regulator of natural and iTreg.", "category": "Question Answering 1473.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context.

While microsized CdS did not trigger ROS elevation, CdS QDs increase ROS by 20-30% over control levels. However, they both deplete cellular GSH significantly at the medium concentration of 20 microg/ml. In the presence of NAC, cells are partially protected from CdS QDs, but not from microsized particles. Additionally, nearly 20% of cadmium was released from CdS nanoparticles within 24h, which also accounts for QDs' toxicity.\\Question: Do intracellular oxidative stress and cadmium ions release induce cytotoxicity of unmodified cadmium sulfide quantum dots?", "output": "Intracellular ROS production, GSH depletion, and cadmium ions (Cd(2+)) release are possible mechanisms for CdS QDs' cytotoxicity.

Despite intensive mapping efforts to localize the culprit 11q tumour suppressor gene, this search has been unsuccessful thus far as no sufficiently small critical region could be delineated for selection of candidate genes.', \"To refine the critical region of 11q loss, the chromosome 11 status of 100 primary neuroblastoma tumours and 29 cell lines was analyzed using a BAC array containing a chromosome 11 tiling path. For the genes mapping within our refined region of loss, meta-analysis on published neuroblastoma mRNA gene expression datasets was performed for candidate gene selection.

We hypothesized that endotoxin stimulates carrier-mediated arginine transport by the pulmonary endothelium.', 'The relative contributions of the various transport systems to total arginine transport by porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) was determined by assaying the uptake of 3H-L-arginine in the presence or absence of Na+. PAECs were then incubated with various concentrations of Escherichia coli endotoxin, and y(+)-mediated arginine transport was measured at different time points thereafter. Kinetic studies were performed over a range of arginine concentrations to determine changes in transport affinity and maximum rate of metabolism. To address the role of RNA and protein synthesis in the increased transport, uptake was measured after exposure of cells to the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide.', 'Most (75%) of arginine transport by PAECs was mediated by the high-affinity Na(+)-independent transport system y+. Endotoxin stimulated y(+)-mediated arginine transport by PAECs twofold to fivefold, a response that was time and dose dependent.

However, some subtype A and C viruses exhibit an unusual gene arrangement in which the first exon of rev (rev1) and the vpu gene are placed in the same open reading frame. Although this rev1-vpu gene fusion is present in a considerable fraction of HIV-1 strains, its functional significance is unknown.', 'Examining infectious molecular clones (IMCs) of HIV-1 that encode the rev1-vpu polymorphism, we show that a fusion protein is expressed in infected cells. Due to the splicing pattern of viral mRNA, however, these same IMCs also express a regular Vpu protein, which is produced at much higher levels. To investigate the function of the fusion gene, we characterized isogenic IMC pairs differing only in their ability to express a Rev1-Vpu protein. Analysis in transfected HEK293T and infected CD4+ T cells showed that all of these viruses were equally active in known Vpu functions, such as down-modulation of CD4 or counteraction of tetherin. Furthermore, the polymorphism did not affect Vpu-mediated inhibition of NF-\u043aB activation or Rev-dependent nuclear export of incompletely spliced viral mRNAs. There was also no evidence for enhanced replication of Rev1-Vpu expressing viruses in primary PBMCs or ex vivo infected human lymphoid tissues.

Since an organic compound, locostatin, was reported to bind RKIP and inhibit cell migration by a Raf-dependent mechanism, we addressed the role of RKIP in locostatin function.', 'We analyzed locostatin interaction with RKIP and examined the biological consequences of locostatin binding on RKIP function. NMR studies show that a locostatin precursor binds to the conserved phosphatidylethanolamine binding pocket of RKIP. However, drug binding to the pocket does not prevent RKIP association with its inhibitory target, Raf-1, nor affect RKIP phosphorylation by Protein Kinase C at a regulatory site. Similarly, exposure of wild type, RKIP-depleted HeLa cells or RKIP-deficient (RKIP(-/-)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to locostatin has no effect on MAP kinase activation. Locostatin treatment of wild type MEFs causes inhibition of cell migration following wounding. RKIP deficiency impairs migration further, indicating that RKIP protects cells against locostatin-mediated inhibition of migration.

During biofilm formation, bacteria secrete a species-specific matrix; in Bacillus subtilis biofilms, the matrix consists of protein polymers and exopolysaccharide. Many domesticated strains of B. subtilis have a reduced ability to form biofilms, and we conducted a two-month evolution experiment to test whether laboratory culturing provides selective pressure against biofilm formation in B. subtilis.', 'Bacteria grown in two-month-long batch culture rapidly diversified their biofilm-forming characteristics, exhibiting highly diverse colony morphologies on LB plates in the initial ten days of culture. Generally, this diversity decreased over time; however, multiple types of colony morphology remained in our final two-month-old populations, both under shaking and static conditions. Notably, while our final populations featured cells that produce less biofilm matrix than did the ancestor, cells overproducing biofilm matrix were present as well. We took a candidate-gene approach to identify mutations in the strains that overproduced matrix and found point mutations in the biofilm-regulatory gene sinR.

Interestingly, we observed a significant local and systemic increase in the fraction of CD4+ T cells expressing the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), the phenotypic marker for murine Treg, at day 21 post-irradiation. The accumulation of Treg was associated with increased levels of T cells expressing surface proteins characteristic for recruitment and immunosuppressive activity, e.g. CD103, CTLA-4 and CD73. Importantly, Treg isolated at this time point were able to suppress CD4+ effector T cells to a similar extent as Treg isolated from control mice.\\Question: Does thorax irradiation trigger a local and systemic accumulation of immunosuppressive CD4+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells?", "output": "The response of the adaptive immune system to whole thorax irradiation is characterized by local immunoactivation and systemic immunosuppression.

Similarly, the DHA concentrations (< or =10 microM) used in combination with 5-FU were lower than those widely used in vitro and known to cause peroxidative effects in vivo.', 'Whereas the cells showed different sensitivity to the growth-inhibitory action of 5-FU, DHA reduced cell growth independently of p53 cellular status. DHA synergized with 5-FU in reducing colon cancer cell growth. The potentiating effect of DHA was attributable to the enhancement of the proapoptotic effect of 5-FU. DHA markedly increased the inhibitory effect of 5-FU on the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCL-XL, and induced overexpression of c-MYC which has recently been shown to drive apoptosis and, when overexpressed, to sensitize cancer cells to the action of proapoptotic agents, including 5-FU.\\Question: Does docosahexaenoic acid enhance the susceptibility of human colorectal cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil?", "output": "Our results indicate that DHA strongly increases the antineoplastic effects of low concentrations of 5-FU.

To monitor the Phlebotomus-borne viruses spreading, field studies are in progress using different sand fly collection and storage methods. Two main sampling techniques consist of CDC light traps, an attraction method allowing collection of live insects in which the virus is presumed to be fairly preserved, and sticky traps, an interception method suitable to collect dead specimens in high numbers, with a risk for virus viability or integrity. Sand flies storage requires a \"deep cold chain\" or specimen preservation in ethanol. In the present study the influence of sand fly collection and storage methods on viral isolation and RNA detection performances was evaluated experimentally.', 'Specimens of laboratory-reared Phlebotomus perniciosus were artificially fed with blood containing Toscana virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus).

Following habituation to vehicle injections (VEH; 20% w/v beta-cyclodextrin; i.p.) administered 22-hour prior to drinking sessions with water only, mice were divided into 3 treatment groups: vehicle control (VEH), 50 mg/kg FIN (FIN-50), and 100 mg/kg FIN (FIN-100). Twenty-two hours after the first treatment, mice were permitted the inaugural 2-hour limited access to a 10% v/v ethanol solution (10E) and water. The acquisition of 10E consumption and underlying drinking patterns were assessed during FIN treatment (7 days) and subsequent FIN withdrawal (13 days) phases.', 'FIN dose-dependently blocked the acquisition of 10E drinking and prevented the development of ethanol preference, thereby suggesting that the GABAergic neurosteroids may be important in the establishment of stable drinking patterns. FIN-elicited reductions in 10E intake were primarily attributable to selective and marked reductions in bout frequency, as no changes were observed in bout size, duration, or lick rates following FIN treatment. FIN-treated mice continued to exhibit attenuated ethanol consumption after 2 weeks post-treatment, despite a full recovery in brain ALLO levels. A second study confirmed the rightward and downward shift in the acquisition of ethanol intake following 7 daily FIN injections.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between variants in the SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD genes and familiar PTC in a large Brazilian family.', 'Four patients with PTC, 1 patient with PTC and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), 1 patient with GIST, and their relatives - several of them with different thyroid problems - from a large Brazilian family were screened for genetic variations of SDHx genes with the use of polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing.', 'Only one rare variation in SDHA was found in some of the family members, but not segregating with the disease. No other genetic variants of these genes were detected in the family members that presented with PTC and/or GIST.\\Question: Is familiar Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma in a Large Brazilian Family Associated with Succinate Dehydrogenase Defects?", "output": "Familiar PTC and a GIST were not associated with SDHx mutations; additional genetic defects, yet unknown, may be responsible for the development of tumor.", "category": "Question Answering 1473.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context.

We examined the associations between implicit (automatic) cognitions and exercise behavior and self-efficacy in endometrial cancer survivors.', 'This was a longitudinal study to examine predictors of exercise behavior in female endometrial cancer survivors who all received an exercise intervention. Participants (N = 100, mean age of 57.0) completed questionnaires to assess self-report exercise-related measures (outcome expectancy and attitudes about and identification with exercise) and reaction time (RT) tasks to assess implicit exercise cognitions (expectancy accessibility, implicit attitudes about exercise, and implicit self-identification with exercise) at baseline and at 2, 4, and 6 months at follow-up. Exercise behavior was measured using accelerometers and self-report. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models.', 'Expectancy accessibility was associated with exercise duration independent of the corresponding self-report measure.

The role of the BET family in the development of intimal hyperplasia is not known.', 'We investigated the effect of BET inhibition on intimal hyperplasia using a rat balloon angioplasty model.', 'While BRD4 was dramatically up-regulated in the rat and human hyperplastic neointima, blocking BET bromodomains with JQ1(+) diminished neointima in rats. Knocking down BRD4 with siRNA, or treatment with JQ1(+) but not the inactive enantiomer JQ1(-), abrogated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB)-stimulated proliferation and migration of primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells. This inhibitory effect of JQ1(+) was reproducible in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells. In human aortic endothelial cells, JQ1(+) prevented cytokine-induced apoptosis and impairment of cell migration. Furthermore, either BRD4 siRNA or JQ1(+) but not JQ1(-), substantially down-regulated PDGF receptor-\u03b1 which, in JQ1(+)-treated arteries versus vehicle control, was also reduced.\\Question: Does bET Bromodomain Blockade mitigate Intimal Hyperplasia in Rat Carotid Arteries?", "output": "Blocking BET bromodomains mitigates neointima formation, suggesting an epigenetic approach for effective prevention of intimal hyperplasia and associated vascular diseases.", "category": "Question Answering 1473.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context.

In the present study, we investigated plasma apoAV level and its relationship with TG and C-reactive protein (CRP) in ACS patients.', 'A total of 459 subjects were recruited and categorized into control group (n = 116), stable angina (SA) group (n = 115), unstable angina group (n = 116) and acute myocardial infarction group (n = 112). Plasma apoAV level was measured by a sandwich ELISA assay.', 'Compared with controls ((100.27 +/- 22.44) ng/ml), plasma apoAV was decreased in SA patients ((76.54 +/- 16.91) ng/ml) but increased in patients with unstable angina ((330.89 +/- 66.48) ng/ml, P < 0.05) or acute myocardial infarction ((368.66 +/- 60.53) ng/ml, P < 0.05). Inverse correlations between apoAV and TG were observed in the control or stable angina groups (r = -0.573 or -0.603, respectively, P < 0.001), whereas positive correlations were observed in the patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction (r = 0.696 or 0.690, respectively, P < 0.001).

Nonhuman primate models may help to determine the effects of DMPA on acute HIV replication.', 'We defined a physiologic dose of DMPA in macaques and assessed the impact of DMPA on acute simian HIV (SHIV) replication.', 'Pigtail macaques received 1-30 \\u200amg of DMPA intramuscularly followed by measurements of progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Vaginal epithelial thickness, number of cell layers and density of intraepithelial CD3 cells were measured. The effect of DMPA on SHIV viremia and genital virus shedding was investigated in six pigtail macaques infected during monthly treatment cycles with 3 \\u200amg DMPA. Six DMPA-untreated macaques were controls.', 'Plasma MPA concentrations directly correlated with changes in epithelial thickness (correlation = 0.84; P < 0.001) and density of intraepithelial CD3 cells (correlation = 0.41; P = 0.02). A 3 mg DMPA dose recapitulated plasma MPA concentrations and changes in vaginal epithelial thickness seen in women. DMPA-treated and untreated macaques showed similar peak plasma viremia and RNA area under the curve values over 12 weeks (P = 0.94), although treated macaques had higher odds of having virus being detected in plasma (odds ratio 6.6, P = 0.02).

However, hand or face temperature contributes only a few percent to control of shivering. Thus, it seems unlikely that manipulating hand or facial skin temperature alone would be sufficient to permit induction of therapeutic hypothermia. We tested the hypothesis that focal arm (forearm and hand) warming or lower facial warming, combined with inhalation of heated and humidified gas, only minimally reduces the shivering threshold (triggering core temperature).', 'We studied 8 healthy male volunteers (18 to 40 years of age) on 3 days: (1) control (no warming), (2) arm warming with forced air at approximately 43 degrees C, and (3) face warming with 21 L/min of air at approximately 42 degrees C at a relative humidity of 100%. Fluid at approximately 4 degrees C was infused via a central venous catheter to decrease tympanic membrane temperature 1 degrees C/h to 2 degrees C/h; mean skin temperature was maintained at 31 degrees C. A sustained increase in oxygen consumption quantified the shivering threshold.', 'Shivering thresholds did not differ significantly between the control (36.7+/-0.1 degrees C), arm-warming (36.5+/-0.3 degrees C), or face-warming (36.5+/-0.3 degrees C; analysis of variance, P=0.34) day.
