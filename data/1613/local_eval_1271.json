It's a late 19th century euphemism which first appeared in Harper's Magazine in 1895.\\n\\nIt is thought that the term French is employed in this sense as it already had a history of association with things considered vulgar.  As far back as the early 16th century, French pox and the French disease were synonyms for genital herpes, and French-sick was another term for syphillis.

The discs look the same and are both supported by most DVD-ROM drives and DVD burners. The only difference between the formats is the way they determine the location of the laser beam on the disc. DVD-R discs use tiny marks along the grooves in the discs, called land prepits, to determine the laser position. DVD+R discs do not have land prepits, but instead measure the \"wobble frequency\" as the laser moves toward the outside of the disc.\\n\\nThe DVD-R format was developed by Pioneer and was released in the second half of 1997. DVD+R was developed by Sony and Philips and was introduced in 2002. Companies that support DVD-R include Pioneer, Toshiba, Hitachi, and Panasonic, while companies that support DVD+R include Sony, Philips, Hewlett-Packard, Ricoh, and Yamaha.\\n\\nHowever, most of these companies now develop hybrid DVD drives that support both DVD-R and DVD+R formats. They are known as DVD\u00b1R or DVD\u00b1RW drives. When looking for media for your DVD drive, make sure it ends in \"-R\" if you have a DVD-R drive or \"+R\" if you have a DVD+R drive. If you have a DVD\u00b1R drive, you can use either format.

You are the one who's going to have to do the job.\\n\\nFirst: get your credit report. Most states now have a law on the books that requires all of the credit reporting agencies to give you a credit report once a year. Check it over. Make sure that there are no *mistakes* on it - late payments that were not late, disputed accounts, etc. \\n\\nLate payments and charged-off accounts stay on for 7 years, bankruptcies for 10. Generally, lenders are looking for patterns of behavior rather than once-in-a-way problems. If you find something wrong (and it's likely, unfortunately), write a letter to the credit bureau, providing documentation that you're right. They have to respond in 30 days; if the creditor can't prove that the negative item is indeed true, it comes off your report.\\n\\nNow you're down to real debt. If you can't afford the payments, contact the lenders and negotiate reduced payments. They will prefer to be getting something rather than having to write off the debt. Once you can afford to pay everything, commit to paying off the worst (i.e., highest-interest) items first. They cost you the most money that isn't going toward paying off the debt. Once you've killed one, the money you were spending on that one can be applied to the next-worst debt, and so on. The amount you can pay any given creditor snowballs rapidly when you follow this pattern. You have to remember, though, that when the first one is paid off, you don't have \"more money\". You still need to be committing that to killing your debt.\\n\\nIf you're out of debt, but your credit is lousy, get a secured card, use it, and pay it off every month. This will do a lot for your credit rating. In addition, open a savings account, and make regular deposits.

Daylight savings is a human invention, not a natural phenomenon.\\n\\n...because leap seconds are not being added to compensate for the Earth's rotation slowing down.\\n\\nThe amount of time it takes for the earth to revolve around the sun is 365.2425 days.\\n\\nEven that is an approximation, the decimal digits can keep going on.\\n\\nSo initially, the calendar was divided evenly in 365 days. But about every 4 years, you'd be off 1 day. A century later, you've drifted off by a whole month!\\n\\nSo, leap years came into effect. Febuary has another day every 4 years. \\n\\nBut now you've approximated a year to 365.25 days, when in reality, its 365.2425 days.\\n\\nEvery century, you'll be off 1 day.\\n\\nSo that's where the next rule comes into play: \"If the year is divisible by 4, but not by 100, its a leap year.\"\\n\\nNow we've approximated it to 365.2425, but because its always going to be an approximation, our calendar days are always slipping. All because the earth doesn't take exactly 365 days to go around the sun.\\n\\nThis is why leap seconds are added, and not to account for the slowdown of the earth's rotation.\\n\\nAs to why days are divided in exactly 24 hours, I'm not sure. But I would think the time difference is WAY less than 20 minutes, or we'd notice that soon enough, its dark at noon! :)  Time was divided a long time ago, and a simple system was sought for keeping track of it, so the minuts/hour/year thing is a nice division thats easy to do math with. The lost time, if its accounted for by leap years and such, could be easier to manage.\\n\\nFirst, I never said the earth is not slowing down. I said its not why leap seconds exist.
