Ambulance staff discovered the bodies in the unit just over an hour later at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays. The lorry driver, named locally as Mo Robinson, 25, from Portadown, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, is being questioned by police. Deputy Chief Constable of Essex Police Pippa Mills said the vehicle had been moved to a secure site at Tilbury Docks so the bodies of the 38 adults and one teenager could be \"recovered while preserving the dignity of the victims\". She said identifying the deceased remained a \"priority\" but was expected to be a \"lengthy process\". Meanwhile, officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland have carried out raids on two houses associated with the arrested man - one in Markethill, County Armagh, and another in nearby Laurelvale. Police said the tractor unit (the front part of the lorry) came from Northern Ireland and picked up the trailer from Purfleet. The tractor and trailer then left the port shortly after 01:05 and officers were called around 30 minutes later when ambulance staff made the grim discovery. Police have appealed for witnesses and anyone with information about the lorry's route to contact them. The National Crime Agency said it had sent officers to assist and identify any \"organised crime groups who may have played a part\". A spokesman for the Bulgarian foreign affairs ministry said the truck was registered in the country under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen. He said it was \"highly unlikely\" the deceased were Bulgarians. At the scene By Ed Thomas, special correspondent, BBC News, Grays Police officers bowed their heads in silence as the lorry was slowly moved from the industrial estate with all 39 people still inside the container. I've seen senior detectives visibly upset at what they've witnessed here. Detectives said their priority now was providing all the victims with dignity and respect as they try to identify them and inform their loved ones. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was an \"unimaginable tragedy and truly heartbreaking\". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, he said: \"I know that the thoughts and prayers of all members will be with those who lost their lives and their loved ones. \"I'm receiving regular updates. The Home Office will work closely with Essex Police as we establish exactly what has happened.\" During Thurrock Council's full council meeting, councillor James Halden said the authority would put in place any support enforcement agencies needed. The Conservative councillor urged people not to speculate about what may have happened and said there was a book of condolences for members of the public to sign in the civic offices. Tricky task of catching the people smugglers Since the Calais migrant camps were shut three years ago and security measures were increased at Dover and the Channel Tunnel, people smugglers have increasingly moved to other routes. Asked which ports are being used, the National Crime Agency told me: \"All of them.\" More dangerous methods are being used to get human cargo through. The most common one is being hidden in the back of a lorry, but increasingly commercial shipping containers are being used, sometimes even refrigerated ones of the type seen on the back of the truck in Essex. Risks are substantial for the migrants, who can pay \u00a310,000 or more for a space on these vehicles. Read more: Tricky task of catching the people smugglers How many migrants have died in transit? The number of migrants who die in transit has been recorded by the UN since 2014. Since then, five bodies of suspected migrants have been found in lorries or containers in the UK: Data was not collected in the same way before the migrant crisis began in 2014, but such deaths are not new. In 2000, 58 Chinese migrants were found suffocated to death in a lorry at Dover. In 2015, the bodies of 71 people were found in an abandoned lorry on an Austrian motorway. Police suspected the vehicle was part of a Bulgarian-Hungarian human trafficking operation. Essex Police has set up a casualty bureau for anyone concerned about relatives to call. The British Red Cross has confirmed staff and volunteers were helping \"those dealing with this terrible tragedy\". Are you in the area?

They had fewer connections between this and the rest of the brain, reported Science Translational Medicine journal. Brain research has just begun to reveal autism's roots, a UK expert said. One-third of the population carry the CNTNAP2 gene variant, so it does not guarantee that autism will develop, but just slightly increases the risk. Different pathways However, scientists at the University of California in Los Angeles believe it may influence the way the brain is \"wired\". They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look for communication between different brain regions, and to measure the strength of these connections. They scanned the brains of 32 children as they performed learning-related tasks - half had autism, and half did not. Regardless of their diagnosis, those carrying the CNTNAP2 variant had differences in the connections within the frontal lobe of the brain itself and between the frontal lobe and the rest of the brain. Dr Ashley Scott-Van Zeeland, who led the research, said: \"The front of the brain appears to talk mostly to itself - it doesn't communicate as much with other parts of the brain and lacks long-range connections to the back of the brain.\" The researchers also spotted differences in the \"wiring\" between the frontal lobe and the left and right sides of the brain. In children with the version of the gene not linked to autism risk, the pathways were linked more strongly to the left side of the brain. In those with the \"risk variant\", the pathways were different, linking the lobe strongly to both sides of the brain. This, said the researchers, could explain why the gene variant had been linked to children who are slow in starting to talk. Dr Scott-Van Zeeland said that if the gene variant did predict language problems, then it might be possible to design therapies which helped to \"rebalance\" the brain and encourage normal development. Professor Margaret Esiri, a neuroscientist from Oxford University, said that researchers had so far \"barely scratched the surface\" of understanding the interplay between genes and brain development. Her own research closely analyses a scarce supply of donated brains from both autistic and non-autistic adults and children to look for differences in structure and function. She said: \"If you understand these subtle differences, there may be ways of 'tweaking' them earlier in life, and bringing them back into a normal trajectory of development. Of course, this would be many years away.\" Carol Povey, from the National Autistic Society, said the study was interesting because it began to link genes thought to be involved in autism to actual changes in brain function. She said: \"The causes of autism are as yet unknown, but we do know there are likely to be many factors involved, so we hope this will contribute to our understanding of this complex condition.\"", "output": "Differences in the brain structure of people carrying an \"autism gene\" may offer clues to how the condition develops, say US scientists.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Sarah SmithScotland editor@BBCsarahsmithon Twitter It may be very frustrating to her that the UK government need to give their consent to another vote, but she does accept that it is the reality. The first minister also knows that it is extremely unlikely that any incoming prime minister would give their approval for another indyref. We may not know who the next Tory leader is going to be - but you can be sure that any candidate who wants to secure the votes of Conservative members in Scotland will need to firmly rule out allowing a second referendum anytime soon. So why is Ms Sturgeon going ahead with preparations for a referendum that seems unlikely to happen within her preferred timescale of the second half of next year? She says that the UK government is currently in such chaos it is not possible to predict what their future policy on anything might be. And she warns that denying Scottish voters the right to make a choice about whether they want to live in an independent country is not only undemocratic but also politically unsustainable And that is the argument you will keep hearing from the SNP. That to deny a vote exposes what they describe as the \"democratic deficit\" facing Scotland. They hope to stir frustration and anger amongst voters, even those who don't currently support independence, that they should not be told what they can and cannot do by a prime minister in London. Amongst those who do passionately support independence there is impatience to get on with it. Huge marches demanding another referendum are a reasonably frequent occurrence in Scottish towns and cities and Nicola Sturgeon needs to give some hope to her most enthusiastic foot soldiers that another vote is coming. Or at least that she is doing everything she can to hasten the day that they will get to have their say. The risk is that while she may be able to gradually build the case that Westminster should not be allowed to block another independence vote, she may not be able to do so quickly enough to satisfy many of her grassroots.

In 2009, they called for a major cull of the birds ahead of the following summer's harvest of grain crops and grass. The Uist Goose Management Scheme offers fireworks, kites and special fencing to frighten geese away from pastures and arable crops. Fourteen people are also employed to scare geese from August through to October. Mr Allan said he had been encouraged by the scheme but said crofters still needed more help. He said: \"What is important, I believe, is that this is an issue which has united crofters and environmentalists alike, recognising that many other wild bird species in the islands depend on crofting for their habitat. \"There is still a lot more that could be done by way of shooting to solve the problem and I am keen to engage with local estates to see if this can be facilitated. \"Indeed, although it may seem surprising initially, this is a solution which even the RSPB are very open to.\" Mr Allan said he would make representations to the Scottish government over the future of the scheme once the Machair Life+ project ends in two years' time.

But it wants Welsh government help, saying the county deals with more wind farm projects than most councils. The Welsh government said it had given Powys over \u00a3130,000 to help it cope with wind farm applications since 2010. The council confirmed it had received the government money, but said it was not for funding public inquiries. It said planning inquiry costs were considerable and would be an additional burden on its budget at a time when it was under \"huge financial pressure\". Opposition to wind farms has grown in Powys since plans were unveiled to build an electricity sub-station in the county. Cefn Coch, near Llanfair Caereinion, was chosen as the preferred site for the sub-station in July. About 1,500 campaigners gathered at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay in May last year against the plans, which includes a corridor of pylons from 10 planned wind farms. The five public inquiries follow the council's rejection of large wind farm applications in Llaithdu, Carnedd Wen, Llanbadarn Fynydd and Llandinam, and a National Grid connection from Llandinam. Council cabinet member for planning and regeneration, Graham Brown, said as a consequence of the Welsh government's Tan 8 policy Powys had a higher proportion of wind farm applications than other authorities in Wales. The technical advice note (Tan) 8 policy was introduced in 2005 as guidance on wind farms. It allows councils to decide on wind farms up to 50 megawatts in size. Mr Brown said the authority had been \"forced to set aside \u00a32.8m to fund legal action to defend the county council's interests\". He added: \"We are appealing to current governments both in Cardiff and Westminster to recognise this unfair situation and provide additional resources to councils like Powys who have been placed in this very difficult position.\" The council said more than 12 other wind farm applications were in the pipeline, so more public inquiries could follow. Earlier this week it rejected plans for two wind farms at Pentre Tump, near New Radnor, and Mynydd-y-Cemmaes near Llanbrynmair.

David Burch, Essex Chambers of Commerce \"A crossing is most definitely needed. The cost to Essex business is extreme and congestion is a real problem. Doing nothing is not an option and Essex needs to lead the way with important transport links. \"Members are continually having to deal with late deliveries, extra fuel costs, tolls and if we do nothing Essex will lose out on inward development and investment. \"London Gateway is also going to cause more traffic problems. We must have a new crossing.\" Paul Carter, Conservative Leader of Kent County Council \"A third crossing is essentially needed. The growth projections for the Thames Gateway will create hundreds of thousands of new homes and hopefully hundreds of thousands of new jobs. \"We have to have a competitive economy and commerce has to get from A to B.\" Natalie Chapman, the Freight Transport Association \"We have discussed the options available extensively with our members and option C - linking the M2 in Kent with the M25 between junctions 29 and 30 - seems to be a clear contender. It would provide a much shorter and more direct route for lorries travelling up from the Channel ports and East Kent to the Midlands and beyond. \"This would lead to extensive savings in fuel and drivers' hours as well as reducing emissions from freight. However, it is by far the most expensive option to construct, so we are concerned that it may lead to potentially high tolls - which, if set at too high a level, could erode any time and fuel cost savings.\" John Kent, Labour Leader of Thurrock Borough Council \"We don't want or need another crossing in Thurrock.

Journalists from across the media have also signed an open letter raising concerns about the way FoI requests are handled. 'Policies not clear enough' The government has now been given three months to draft an action plan to improve its practices. The commissioner's report criticised the practice of referring FoI requests for clearance by ministers simply because they come from journalists, MSPs and researchers. Mr Fitzhenry said this was inconsistent with the principle that, \"in most cases, it should not matter who asks for information\". His report also found: The commissioner has made seven recommendations for further specific improvements. The areas highlighted are clearance procedures, quality assurance of FoI responses, training, case handling and case records management, monitoring FoI requests and review procedures.

Statistically, it is a relatively trivial disease, killing a few thousand people since its discovery in 1976. In contrast, malaria and tuberculosis each kill several million people each year. Measles killed 122,000 in 2012. Yet, Ebola has captured the public imagination. We do not know which animal harbours the virus although bats have long been suspected, and this makes prevention and control difficult. The clinical manifestation is dramatic, with rapid progression from infection to cell death and symptoms that can include bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea. The fatality rate is high, ranging from 50% to 90%. Stigma A common feature of Ebola epidemics is stigma. Sufferers and survivors are often stigmatised by the community, and so too are hospital workers. In past outbreaks, some survivors were not welcomed back into their community, some were unable to find work, and some were abandoned by their partners. In the Ugandan outbreak of 2000/2001, the possessions and homes of some survivors were burned. Volunteers trained by the Red Cross visited villages to dispel myths and persuade them to accept the return of survivors. One survivor of the 1995-1997 outbreaks in Gabon described how people would walk backwards away from him, taxis would not stop and, at roadblocks, police would wave him through for fear of touching his identity card. Hospitals, often ill-prepared to deal with Ebola, have played a role as amplifiers of epidemics in the past. Many victims since 1976 have been healthcare workers. This gave rise to rumours. In the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo, the link between the hospital and those dying of Ebola was such that it generated a popular rumour: doctors were murdering workers who had smuggled diamonds out from the nearby mines. Hostility In the Ugandan outbreak, locals believed white people sold the body parts of the victims for profit. Western medical staff were viewed with suspicion, and sometimes suspected of bringing in the disease in. Every major outbreak of Ebola has been met with local resistance and hostility. In January 2002, an international team of experts fled a village in Mekambo, Gabon, when the villagers threatened them with violence. It is not just the locals who are frightened, but the medical staff too. Medical historians have documented the cultural disdain for local African customs shown by the colonisers of the early 20th century, for example in the response to the sleeping sickness epidemic that afflicted the Belgian Congo. This sometimes led to revolt on the part of villagers, who were forced to take drugs whose efficacy they doubted and who were touched and prodded in unfamiliar ways. Funeral practices have also played a role in spreading the disease, but interfering with these has led to discontent. In past epidemics, locals have simply ignored the recommendations not to bury the dead as before, or not to hunt bush meat. Some communities have relied on more accessible and familiar traditional healers, and these could spread the disease by cutting the skin or performing other invasive procedures. The health infrastructure in some of the countries afflicted by the disease is poor. Informed consent It is against this complex historical, cultural and social background that the ethicists this week will need to make a decision. The norms of medical ethics, such as informed consent, may also be different there, and there is a danger in transposing Western norms into different cultures. A well-known saying in ethics is that \"good ethics starts with good facts\". Ideally, sitting around that table will be medical historians, anthropologists, clinicians, epidemiologists, logisticians and other specialists. Only then can a nuanced appreciation of the likely risks and benefits be determined. This will include anticipating what might happen if the drug is introduced and proves ineffective or even harmful, how the media and the local community will react and the consequences of this reaction for victims, healthcare workers, and others, and how the selection process for candidate drugs should take place. Without this input from other disciplines and an understanding of the situation \"on the ground\", the views of the ethicists may be of limited practical value.

She was first trolled after posting body positive photos and messages on social media. And she reckons the pandemic made things worse. A photo Phoebe posted to mark International Women's Day in March last year sparked a torrent of abuse and attracted \"hundreds of comments\" about how she looked. 'It's every single day' \"This kept happening across the whole of 2020. It got to the point where from July, I have not had a week's break from any online abuse. \"In these last couple of months, it's been every single day, there will be something or some incident or some comment.\" Phoebe has been reporting abusive posts and blocking accounts that were sharing them. Half of women and non-binary people polled by online abuse charity Glitch and the End Violence Against Women Coalition say they've experienced online abuse since the pandemic began. And a poll of 2,000 people for the National Children's Bureau, which was published in November 2020, suggests that more people were experiencing and reporting online abuse as bullying in schools decreased - because most people were learning from home. Phoebe says comments and DMs led to her making a suicide attempt in December. \"It got to the point where the comments made me feel like I couldn't be here anymore, really. I ended up in hospital.\" When she later posted about her suicide attempt online she received more abuse. \"It was horrific. I just logged off for the rest of Christmas and New Year to just enjoy it and not think about what's being said online,\" she says. \"I'm not in that place now, but I can't say I'm not going to be in that place again from trolling because, I didn't think that would ever happen to me, I never thought it would reach that point.\" 'Hyper-disgust' during pandemic Imran Ahmed is the CEO of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate. He says there has been an \"industrial level of trolling\" during the coronavirus pandemic, and part of this has included online bullying. \"Right now we are primed to think of things that aren't like us as being dangerous,\" he tells Newsbeat. \"Think about literally what Covid is - someone you love could kill you, just by coming near you. \"So we're primed to think, I don't want to see people, I don't want to get too close. We are in a hyper-disgust phase.\" He says people who troll others online don't get a thrill from the abuse they send, but from seeing the reaction from their victim. \"If you give them what they want and show anger and pain that incentivises them to gain that pleasure again. \"By taking away the possibility of gaining that pleasure, by blocking them, they'll stop.\" He also says defending someone against trolls can sometimes do more harm than good because you \"rebroadcast, compound and worsen the abuse.\" He says blocking and reporting abusive posts and accounts is still our best option, but also to remember that extreme cases may be against the law. 'I shouldn't have to step away' When Phoebe reported the death threats to her local police, they recommended she log off social media. She did that in the short term for her mental health, but it isn't something she wants to do permanently. \"This is becoming part of my life more especially because we're all virtual now,\" Phoebe says. \"I don't want to have to censor myself, I think that's the other thing. I tried to be a positive person for others and for my teenage self. I'm trying to be the woman that my teenage self never had. \"It gets tough but I don't feel like I should have to step away because some people don't want me to be existing in that space.\" Avon and Somerset police, who Phoebe reported her situation to, says on its website that its officers will deal with online abuse only in the most extreme cases. These include a threat to someone's life, targeting specific individuals and persistent harassment and ongoing abuse. Phoebe's decided not to pursue matters with the police. But she does want social media companies to make it harder to set up fake account on their platforms - which is where a lot of the abuse she experienced came from. She's set up an organisation called The Speak Up Space, where victims of sexual violence and harassment can share their stories and look for help and advice. And despite the abuse she receives, still feels like the positives of being social media outweigh the negatives. \"It was nice when I had a break, I just stuck to WhatsApp to stay in touch with friends and it felt like a weight lifted. But I also love the community I'm in and I love all these friends I've made and all these people who reach out to me and say these lovely things,\" she says. \"I don't want to be pushed out or something. And if I choose to leave, that's going to be my decision. \"We're all going through this at the moment, and of course, everyone's reaction is going to be different to the pandemic, but being abusive to people online is not a viable response.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

The bomb was examined by Ammunition Technical Officers and they declared it to be a \"viable improvised explosive device\". \"It is very fortunate that this device was detected before it exploded and that no one was killed or seriously injured,\" Mr Wright added. \"In placing such a device, terrorists have also put the officer's family, neighbours and members of the public at serious risk.\" The alert began on Saturday afternoon and the golf club was evacuated. Club member Alan Paterson said the man who owned the car spotted the device after playing a round of golf on Saturday morning. \"He was leaving the course and he actually noticed something under the car and immediately informed the police and the members in the clubhouse at that time,\" Mr Paterson said. \"I was actually in the clubhouse at the time when the person came in to tell us that there was a possible device.\" He added: \"Within several minutes the police arrived and identified the object and said that they felt it was viable and that they should immediately evacuate the clubhouse and surrounding area, and also get everybody else off the golf course. \"We are delighted that if it was a viable device the person concerned was not injured or worse, so that is a big plus for everybody. \"We are a very mixed club. It is east Belfast, yes, but it is a mixed club and this sort of thing should not happen - it just should not happen.\" Police also attended a further security alert in Strabane, County Tyrone, on Saturday afternoon. A suspicious object caused a number of homes to be evacuated after it was discovered in the St Mary's Drive area of the town, close to the junction of Beechmount Avenue. The police said the object was a hoax. From the scene: BBC reporter Mark Simpson: There was a sense of shock in this leafy part of east Belfast on Saturday. Residents whose homes back on to the golf course car park were told by police to stay at the front of their homes. The golf club was busy, with an estimated 70 people on the course at the time of the alert, and at least 50 in the clubhouse. Saturday is the busiest day of the week at any golf club. It's likely that dozens of people walked past the device before it was discovered.

The TaxPayers' Alliance said it was a stealth tax but councils said money was put back into the transport budget. Twelve of the 22 councils contacted by BBC Wales in a freedom of information request were unable to provide figures about car parking overpayments and three said they did not operate meters. Newport council did not respond. Between 2014-2017, Swansea received \u00a3231,000 in overpayments out of \u00a312.2m in parking charges, Carmarthenshire had \u00a3146,000 out of \u00a37.7m and Caerphilly had \u00a374,000 out of \u00a31.8m. Merthyr Tydfil recorded \u00a352,000 from \u00a31.4m and Neath Port Talbot had just \u00a3654 out of \u00a32.8m in parking fees.

But Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said that did not help \"the significant number of people - not least elderly motorists - who still don't own a mobile\". \"Some will say why all the fuss about a few pence here and there, but these numbers soon add up to the point where drivers might reasonably ask whether this isn't more of a money spinner than a means of managing traffic for some councils,\" he added.

Increasing the \"personal allowance\" is something they've pushed for in government - managing to get it up to \u00a310,500 next April. The Lib Dems are now saying the allowance should go up again - to \u00a311,000 in April 2016. The ambition? An allowance of \u00a312,500 by 2020. Sounds familiar? The Conservatives are promising the same thing. The rich would pay more tax..... The Lib Dems would like to introduce a new tax on expensive property. They've championed a mansion tax for years - initially it was a one per cent tax on houses worth over \u00a32m. The latest version would involve adding higher \"bands\" to existing council tax rates to capture \u00a32m properties. It's outrageous, Lib Dems say, that people living in a house worth \u00a3500,000 pay the same council tax as someone with a \u00a350 million mansion. The money raised - an estimated \u00a31.5bn - would go towards getting rid of the budget deficit (the gap between the nation's spending and income). Sounds a bit familiar? Labour is now offering a form of mansion tax too. A few other ideas to extract cash from the wealthy There are plans to increase capital gains tax - paid on profits from selling things including a second home or shares - from 28% to 35%. The money would be used to fund that \u00a311,000 personal allowance pledge (see above). The deficit is huge though - any other ideas? The party admits tax rises for the wealthy aren't enough. They say spending on welfare would have to be kept under control. The Lib Dems are choosing their words carefully though. Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits WITHOUT taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether. How would they keep benefits \"under control\"? One proposal is to stop giving winter fuel payments and free TV licences to the wealthiest pensioners. There'd be a \"yellow card\" system to deal with claimants breaking the rules. If they don't put things right sanctions would follow. Don't forget the economy... There would be \"strict new fiscal rules\" to ensure the deficit has gone by April 2018. They are: 1) Once the deficit's gone, start paying off the nation's debt. 2) A balanced budget but with scope to spend money on roads and housing. 3) \"Fairness\", with the wealthy contributing the most to deficit reduction. Everyone has an eye-catching plan for the NHS... what about the Lib Dems? The big plan for the health service in England is the introduction of targets for treating people with mental health problems. At the moment, there aren't any targets at all for mental health. The Lib Dems say people who need therapy - for conditions such as depression - will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For patients experiencing psychosis - a disorder characterised by delusions and hallucinations - treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April and Nick Clegg said if the Lib Dems are in government again there will be extra money to introduce similar targets for conditions such as bipolar disorder and eating disorders. By the way.... The Lib Dems also promise to find \u00a31bn more for the NHS every year. It would be funded by scrapping a few tax breaks. One in their sights is the \"shares for rights\" scheme. It was set up to encourage workers to accept shares in return for giving up employment rights. But it turns out executives are using it to cut their tax bills - because tax on shares is lower than tax on income. More cities... The plan is to build 300,000 houses a year. The Lib Dems have even identified possible locations. They're proposing up to five garden cities - developments with plenty of green spaces - in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. The Lib Dems say that new cities would get their own stations if built along the proposed railway line linking the two university towns of Oxford and Cambridge. Staying with green issues... the Lib Dems are flagging up their environmental credentials... The party is calling for five green laws on issues ranging from saving energy to installing a network of charging points for electric cars. As Nick Clegg colourfully put it: \"It's not green crap to us.\" A reference to comments reportedly made in private by David Cameron But when it comes to airports... U-turns can be dangerous The Lib Dems have traditionally been opposed to airport expansion. Nick Clegg is trying to change policy to allow for a new runway at Gatwick. But the conference voted against him. Lib Dem party members do have a lot of influence over policy but it's not a hard and fast rule. The \"party of education\" There are promises to protect the education budget from cuts. And there's a parental guarantee of qualified teachers and a curriculum set by independent experts. There would be more money for disadvantaged school children and free childcare for all two year olds. For young people travelling to school or college the Lib Dems are offering discounts on bus fares.

He said: \"If we don't manage to secure these buildings, they are under threat if they get into the wrong hands. \"They need to stay as fishing buildings to support the fishermen.\" The Winch House, as its name suggests, has a winch inside which is used to pull boats back up on to the beach and dates back to the 18th Century, according to Historic England. The parish council is currently trying to get approval from central government to buy it. John Tham, a trustee for the charitable trust, which owns the Winch House, said the building was bought and restored 26 years ago. He said it was time to sell it and if the council could buy the building it would be \"a good result all round\". He added that the money from the sale would go to other charities, including one which saves hedgehogs. Vice chairman Nigel Green said: \"The council unanimously supports both the purchase of the buildings and the holding of the freehold by the council in perpetuity. \"The council is fortunate to be a body that never dies, and so is a safe pair of hands to hold prized community assets in perpetuity.\" The other two buildings are used by fishermen for storing their catch, mending nets and pots and also house an art gallery and two shops selling fresh fish.

Only 650 of the total 3,599 elderly patients discharged from hospital during the period had been tested. Nicola Sturgeon, however, said there was \"no statistical evidence\" hospital discharges led to care home outbreaks. The analysis found the size of care home played a bigger role, with the largest much more likely to have outbreaks than smaller ones. Deaths in care homes account for about half of Covid-related deaths in Scotland, with about 2,000 resident deaths. The first minister has previously said she only became aware from media reports that Covid-positive patients had been sent to care homes. Quoting from the PHS report at her daily briefing Ms Sturgeon said: \"The analysis does not find statistical evidence that hospital discharges of any kind were associated with care home outbreaks.\" But she added: \"Nothing in it detracts from the tragedy of the deaths that have occurred in care homes over the course of the pandemic, and nothing ever will detract from the heartbreak of those bereaved.\" The delayed PHS report said nearly 5,000 individuals were discharged from NHS hospitals to care homes until the end of May, and about a third of care homes have had Covid outbreaks. Of 78 patients discharged before 21 April after having had a positive test result, only 10 had been retested and found to be negative prior to discharge. But the analysis found the biggest link in outbreaks was the size of the home itself - with possible factors including greater movement of staff at the larger homes, or a higher average age of residents. It found that more than 90% of homes with more than 90 residents had an outbreak, compared to under 4% of homes with fewer than 20 residents. While there were some indicators that suggested hospital discharges did increase the risk of an outbreak, the study was relatively small in statistical terms and the authors found no \"statistically significant\" evidence. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman: \"The data from this report gives us a better understanding of the impact of discharges on outbreaks in care homes. \"We will be taking forward the recommendations that PHS make in their report, and we will continue to adapt our guidance and the steps we are taking to protect care home staff and residents.\" The Scottish government introduced a new policy on 21 April that required patients to have two negative Covid tests before leaving hospital, and all new care home admissions to be isolated for 14 days. The report said a further 1,605 hospital discharges took place after this date, and 93% were tested in line with clinical guidance. However, another 45 patients were discharged to care homes having had one positive test but without a second test result to confirm they were negative. The report noted there were valid clinical reasons for not testing some individuals prior to discharge such as \"capacity to consent to testing and avoiding causing distress, and to appropriateness of testing\" - for instance in cases of end of life care. 'My mum had more living to do' For relatives who lost elderly loved ones in the early weeks of the pandemic today's report does little to answer their questions. Jackie Marlow's mother, Helen McMillan, died during an outbreak at a care home which she's convinced began when another elderly woman was discharged from hospital, developing a cough and later dying with suspected Covid. This resident was one of nearly 3,000 hospital discharges at the time who were never tested, so the uncertainty remains. \"That's not her fault, it's not her family's fault - they lost her too,\" says Jackie. \"Had she been kept in hospital, had she been tested then maybe she'd still be here today because maybe she would have got the treatment that would have kept her alive - and my mum would still be here today.\" She says there was no offer of her mother being transferred to hospital or getting oxygen. Visiting was suspended at the time and she was unable to be with her mother to hold her hand. \"They say it was unprecedented times - but does that mean because you're old you don't matter anymore, you don't count. It's horrific - my mum had so much more living to do.\" Rodney Laing said his 80-year-old father, Rodger, was handed a \"death sentence\" when he was moved from Midlothian Community Hospital to a care home in May. The dementia patient caught Covid and he died 22 days after moving into the home. His son told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie: \"He was fit and healthy, within three weeks and one day he passed away, he had to die alone with a bunch of strangers. It was just terrible.\" Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care which represents private sector care homes, said the report was a \"robust statistical analysis\" but did not \"tell the whole story\". He said: \"The whole story can only really be told, and to be fair the report acknowledges this, when we talk to people at ground level - that's the staff, the managers, the operators of care homes - to see what their experience is. \"Behind each statistic there is a human story and behind each incident and outbreak there are the experiences of staff, some of whom are convinced in some cases that the infection arrived in the care home as a result of discharge. \"That's a minority but we need to hear that story and need to hear that as part of the evidence.\" He repeated his call for a \"human rights-based inquiry\" into the experiences of care homes during the pandemic. Opposition politicians said the report highlighted grave failings and called for ministers to be called to account. Scottish Conservative Holyrood leader Ruth Davidson said: \"The SNP government's response to this report is wholly inadequate and will give little comfort to those grieving families still trying to find out how and why their loved one died. \"Thousands of patients were transferred without a test and over 100 people, who were known to have coronavirus, were sent to care homes alongside some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\" For Scottish Labour, Monica Lennon said: \"The decision to move patients with Covid-19 into care homes was reckless and SNP ministers must be held to account for this Russian roulette strategy. \"The combination of knowingly transferring the virus into care homes and not bothering to test hundreds of other patients before moving them, is unfathomable.\" Scottish Greens health spokesperson Alison Johnstone said the \"scandal\" had been known for some time but the scale of it was \"astonishing\". She said: \"Care homes are supposed to be safe havens for some of the most vulnerable people in our communities and it is an absolute tragedy that so many people have been fatally let down in this way. \"That so many families have lost a loved one due to systematic policy failures is an appalling reflection on the handling of this crisis.\" And Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, said: \"Our care homes had a monumental challenge keeping residents safe from the virus but the government made that task even harder by failing to stop people with the virus from entering the homes and not even finding out if thousands more had the virus. \"It's easy with hindsight to see the sense in testing all people before admission to care homes but you don't need hindsight as I warned the first minister repeatedly at the time.\"", "output": "Dozens of patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 were transferred from Scottish hospitals to care homes, a report has revealed.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Sir Michael, who made his fortune investing in firms including Google, PayPal and Yahoo, is now worth \u00a31.95bn.

Add in the fact that the squad is also inexperienced and one of the youngest in the tournament, many saw this World Cup as a lost cause. However, following two wins, including an emphatic 6-1 defeat of Panama, and the sight of the Germans - who have often prevented England's progression in major tournaments - failing to reach the last 16, suddenly expectations are high again.

And so crosses of St George can be seen fluttering across the land as England enjoys both warm weather and the giddy thrill of World Cup expectation. In Oldham, Wales Street has been unofficially renamed England Street and its residents have decorated the road in honour of the Three Lions. Perhaps they knew something others didn't, as this patriotic effort was made before Gareth Southgate's men had kicked a ball in anger. In Bermondsey, south London, England fan Chris Dowse, 39, has organised for hundreds of flags to be displayed at the housing estate he lives on. While in Cherhill Close, Clifton, Nottingham, Ryan Beales, has promised his neighbours he will put up more flags on their street every time the Three Lions win. Covering Albany Towers in Hove, in East Sussex, is an England flag that was hung on scaffolding while building work is carried out. Plenty of pubs are also getting in on the action, like the Tom Hoskins in Leicester, which appears to have put up the flag of every World Cup team, as well as plenty of crosses of St George. On a hillside in Chelmorton, Derbyshire, stones have been sprayed white and moved to create a St George's flag and the word \"England\". The landowners have put the display in place for every major tournament England have played in since 2006. And so while lots of might be dreaming of World Cup glory, England could of course only have two more games to play - and we'll have to wait four more years for another chance at sporting immortality.

Public health director Dominic Harrison said there would be a sharper focus on testing in areas with high cases. The government previously said mass rapid testing schemes, which will ask all residents with or without coronavirus symptoms to take a test, would be rolled out to 67 more areas in England. The scheme was piloted in Liverpool, which is now set to drop down into tier two restrictions after Health Secretary Matt Hancock praised the city's \"remarkable\" fall in infection rates following its introduction.

Council leaders had asked for the county to be split into two tiers, reflecting these different rates, but the idea was rejected. Mr Harrison said the government would formally offer Lancashire \"a mass testing option\" on Wednesday, which he expected to be a reduced version of Liverpool's model. He said he expected \"some Army support\" for any testing regime, adding the county would \"do something similar [to] but not the same as Liverpool\" and \"target some of our mass testing\" on groups \"where we know the infection rates are highest\" such as a ward within a local authority \"or a group like the homeless\".

As the North Korean players were being introduced before the match against Colombia, South Korean flags were mistakenly displayed in the video package.

The Indian Missionary Council (Cimi), an organisation backed by the Catholic Church, said more than 600 Indians, fishermen and locals occupied the site and the road leading to it. Cimi called on the government to send representatives to negotiate with the indigenous groups, who they say would suffer from the building of the dam. \"In the face of the government's intransigence and its insistence on disrespecting us, we now occupy the Belo Monte construction site and block access to it from the Transamazon highway,\" Cimi said on its website.

It was a peaceful protest to draw attention to this project that spells death for the Amazon,\" Cimi spokesman Eden Magalhaes told the AFP news agency. Legal battle Building work on the dam was halted last month after a judge ruled against it on environmental grounds, but the construction of accommodation blocks for the project's workers was allowed to continue. Judge Carlos Castro Martins barred any work that would interfere with the natural flow of the Xingu river. He ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the Belo Monte dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing. Judge Martins barred the Norte Energia company behind the project from \"building a port, using explosives, installing dikes, building canals and any other infrastructure work that would interfere with the natural flow of the Xingu river, thereby affecting local fish stocks\".

Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has just announced new coronavirus restrictions. They will mean all licenced pubs and restaurants in the central belt - including Glasgow and Edinburgh - will be shut for more than two weeks. But Maja, for one, is feeling relatively calm about the whole thing: \"I think it's probably necessary because the virus has spread so fast here lately. \"It is a shame, though, because it leaves us with not very much to do, especially at uni.\" The closures affect around 3.4 million people. In the rest of Scotland, pubs will be allowed to stay open, but can only serve alcohol outdoors. Nicola Sturgeon has described it as a \"short, sharp action to arrest a worrying increase in infection\". Maja thinks it's justified, too - even if it does mean traditional uni life will be stalled. \"Most of us turned 18 during lockdown so we've never had experience going to clubs, so it'll just be a new thing for us when they open again,\" she says.

A spokesperson for the couple said the comments did not refer to any specific political party or candidate, but were instead \"a call for decency\". Voting for the next US president, with candidates including Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, is on 3 November. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex appeared in a live video in what appeared to be their California home as part of the Time 100 - a list compiled by Time magazine to celebrate the world's most influential people. It was their first joint TV appearance since they ceased being working members of the Royal Family in March. \"As we approach this November, it's vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity,\" the duke said as he sat on a bench alongside Meghan. He also reminded Americans to be discerning in the content they consumed online. \"When the bad outweighs the good, for many, whether we realise it or not, it erodes our ability to have compassion and our ability to put ourself in someone else's shoes,\" he said. \"Because when one person buys into negativity online, the effects are felt exponentially. It's time to not only reflect, but act.\" 'You deserve to be heard' The 36-year-old duke said he would not be voting in the election because he was not a US citizen, adding that he had never voted in UK elections either. Members of the Royal Family traditionally do not vote, and the Queen is politically neutral. Although UK law does not ban royalty from voting, it is considered unconstitutional for them to do so. Harry and Meghan stepped aside from their roles as senior working royals in March in a bid for personal and financial freedom. They now live in the US but are still members of the Royal Family. Analysis By Sarah Campbell, BBC News royal correspondent When Harry and Meghan ceased to be working royals back in March, the official \"divorce\" statement read: \"While they can no longer formally represent The Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty.\" It is Harry's contribution to the Time video message which seems to have attracted the most comment. His spokesman is clear that the duke was making a \"non-partisan call for decency\". But with the Trump administration commonly accused of the traits called out by Harry - \"hate speech, misinformation and online negativity\"- his contribution has been widely interpreted as party political. The expectation is that royals remain neutral and the question troubling many people today is whether that means Harry's words are incompatible with the statement issued by the palace in March. It was always going to be difficult to work a way through their royal/non-royal status to the satisfaction of the Sussexes and the Royal Family, as this latest episode once again makes clear. Reacting to the couple's remarks, Royal biographer Robert Jobson said: \"They are not carrying out public duties, live abroad and are really completely detached from our monarchical system now so what difference would it make? \"Meghan, after all, holds American citizenship and has always voted. The business about royals not getting involved in politics is less clear when it comes to Meghan or what the protocol should be in this case. \"But as she is now back living in her country I am sure many would think it wrong that she is not allowed to exercise her democratic right to vote.\" However, Mr Jobson said \"it would be better\" for Prince Harry to withdraw from the line of succession \"to avoid further confusion\". And if they were to leave their royal titles behind it may set the duchess \"free to pursue a political career,\" he added. But former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker said Prince Harry should not have remarked on the US election as he is still a \"representative\" of the UK. There was \"no problem\" with a \"private citizen\" expressing their views, he said, \"the problem is Harry still has his HRH status\". \"He wants his foot in both camps,\" said the author of the book And What Do You Do?

It could become part of the European Economic Area (EEA), a deal between Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and the European Union. These countries are not full members of the EU but have accepted EU regulations and its so-called four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, people and capital (although the EU and Liechtenstein agreed an immigration quota so incomers did not affect the national identity of its tiny population). Or it could take the example of Switzerland, which has its own bi-lateral agreement with the EU because its people rejected membership of the EEA in a referendum. However, Switzerland's agreement also requires the free movement of people but has less access for the services industry, a vital part of the UK's economy. Some have suggested that the UK could take the example of Turkey, which is part of a customs union. That means it faces no tariffs (taxes or duties on imports and exports) or quotas on industrial goods it sends within the European Union but it has to apply the European Union's common external tariff, a set rate of tariffs on goods from outside the EU, on those goods too. However, we've concluded that what a new deal would look like remains one of the biggest questions over a vote to leave the EU. The UK's current tariff-free, unrestricted trade deal with the EU would remain in place for at least the first two years of negotiations. But no non-EU countries have negotiated tariff-free unrestricted trade with the EU without contributing to the EU budget and allowing unlimited EU migration. In terms of the effects of a possible Brexit on the economy, we've checked the report issued by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) which suggested the UK leaving the European Union could lead to austerity being extended by two years. We concluded that, if - like the IFS - you accept predictions that leaving the EU would cut economic growth, it is hard to imagine that would not hit the public finances. We've also looked into what the ratings agencies have said. Standard and Poor's have said it would probably lower the UK's long-term credit rating. Fitch said it would review the UK's credit rating but did not now anticipate a downgrade in the immediate aftermath. Moody's said a vote to leave could lead to a negative outlook because of greater uncertainty and a weaker economy. We have answered some specific questions about trade and the economy that BBC Radio 4's PM programme listeners asked us below. The question: Margaret asks: \"How are trade agreements negotiated and how long might they take? We presumably have little experience in this as it is done through the EU and has been for many years. Might one look south of the equator for their experiences or to BRICS (the grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) for example?\" The answer: Trade agreements can vary considerably in depth and breadth. Some are very comprehensive while others are much lighter, offering less market access. Consequently, the time it takes to negotiate trade deals can vary considerably. For example, the EU first opened trade deal negotiations with the regional group Mercosur (which includes the countries Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela) in 2000 but negotiations are still ongoing. By contrast, negotiations for a free trade agreement between the EU and the Republic of Korea were launched in 2007 and the agreement was signed in 2010. Currently, 52 countries are covered by existing EU trade deals. If the UK left the EU and wanted to retain preferential access to the markets of these countries, it would have to renegotiate trade deals with all of them. Some could take longer than others and it would not be up to the UK only, but also to the other countries which would base their negotiating positions on their own interests. The question: Kath asks: \"Would the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreements still apply to the UK if we left the EU?\" The answer: TTIP is the EU-US agreement and it applies only to the EU countries. If the UK ceased to be an EU member, it would not apply to it. The UK could seek its own trade deal with the US post-Brexit, but that would have nothing to do with TTIP. The question: Paul asks: \"What is the current state of the EU's trade relations with major Commonwealth economies?\" The answer: The EU has already agreed, or is in the process of negotiating, trade deals with a majority of Commonwealth states. In 2015, 22% of imports to the EU came from Commonwealth countries and over 30% of EU exports went to the Commonwealth. Since the UK became a member of the EU, UK trade with Commonwealth countries has fallen, while trade with EU countries has increased. A 2012 House of Commons Library report states that in 1973, UK trade in goods with the Commonwealth constituted roughly 18% of the UK's total trade in goods. By 2011, this figure stood at roughly 10%. In that year, the Commonwealth accounted for an estimated 10% of all UK goods exports and 12% of all UK services exports. With regards to imports, the Commonwealth accounted for an estimated 7% of all UK goods imports and 10% of all UK services imports. The UK's main trading partners (in terms of goods) within the Commonwealth are Canada, India, South Africa, and Australia, accounting for more than 60% of goods imports and exports from the Commonwealth in 2011. The question: Bernard asks: \"Do companies in Germany and France grumble about red tape making them uncompetitive?\" The answer: German and French businesses have expressed the need to cut bureaucracy and regulations within the EU. In 2015, governments of both countries were part of a joint call of 19 EU member states to the European Commission to reduce the burdens of EU regulations for businesses. However, there is a general understanding that leaving the EU may do more harm than good to businesses and the economy. Germany, in particular, benefits from the single market as the largest member state both in terms of EU internal and external trade in goods. In 2015, Germany's share of EU exports to other member states was 22%. In France, the figure was 9% compared to UK's 6%. In a recent survey of more than 700 British and German companies by the Bertelsmann Foundation, 83% of participating German businesses said that the UK should remain part of the European Union compared to 76% of British companies that took part in the poll. Close to 30% of German businesses with operations in the UK said that they would decrease their capacities in the UK in case of a Brexit.

The purchasing managers' index (PMI) produced by IHS Markit/CIPS fell to 47.4 in August, down from 48 in July. A figure below 50 indicates the sector is contracting. New orders fell at the fastest pace for seven years, and business confidence fell to its lowest level since the survey first began to track the measure in 2012. \"High levels of economic and political uncertainty alongside ongoing global trade tensions stifled the performance of UK manufacturers in August,\" said Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit. \"The global economic slowdown was the main factor weighing on new work received from Europe, the USA and Asia. \"There was also a further impact from some EU-based clients routing supply chains away from the UK due to Brexit.\" The UK economy contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of the year - the first time it has shrunk since 2012. If the economy contracts in the current July-to-September period, then it will deemed to be in recession as it will have shrunk for two quarters in a row. Mr Dobson said the PMI survey's results suggested the manufacturing sector - which accounts for about 20% of the UK's economy - was contracting at a quarterly pace of \"close to 2%\". However, Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said that could be too pessimistic. \"With the CIPS surveys tending to be overly sensitive to political uncertainty and carmakers maintaining production in August (having brought their annual summer shutdowns forward this year), the sector's performance is unlikely to be that grim,\" he said. \"But with global and domestic headwinds showing no sign of easing, the remainder of 2019 is set to remain a difficult period for manufacturers.\" Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the latest PMI survey was weak, \"we still doubt that manufacturing will pull the economy as a whole into recession\".", "output": "Activity in the UK's manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace for seven years in August, a closely-watched survey has suggested.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "A group of attackers, dressed in black, burst into the station in the south-west city of Kunming and began stabbing people at random.

Plans for a new \"super-prison\" in Port Talbot were withdrawn after strong local objections. Mr Buckland said he was also \"very interested\" in developing a women's centre in Wales. The five prisons currently in Wales - HMP Berwyn, HMP Cardiff, HMP Parc, HMP Swansea, and HMP Usk/Prescoed - are all for men. Speaking to the BBC's Politics Wales programme, Mr Buckland accepted there was a \"problem\" with female prisoners from Wales having to serve sentences in England but said he had to balance the idea of a women's centre \"against all the other competing priorities\". Last summer, Boris Johnson announced plans to create 10,000 new prison places in Wales and England. Mr Buckland, the second Llanelli-born Lord Chancellor after Lord Elwyn Jones (1974-1979), said he \"would love\" an extra Welsh prison to be part of the programme. A new category C super-prison for up to 1,600 prisoners was planned for Port Talbot before UK ministers withdrew the plan after strong local opposition. Asked if the UK Government still had plans for a similarly-sized facility, Mr Buckland said: \"We still want to build an extra prison in Wales. \"I'm not so much interested in the glib titles, I want to make sure that we have a facility that is the right size and the right model, and that actually delivers purposeful prison activity. \"I'm not going to commit myself to a particular size prison now. \"What I do commit to is a real concern about the fact that I think having an extra prison in Wales would be good for the local population. \"I've got to get on with that apace. I want to deliver it by the middle of the decade, so my officials will do whatever they can to identify sites in England and Wales that fit the bill, and that can deliver those extra places,\" he added. Research published by Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre in January 2019 claimed Wales has the highest imprisonment rate in western Europe. 'Obsessing' Mr Buckland also signalled opposition to transferring full control of the justice system in Wales to the Welsh Government. A commission chaired by Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd called for the devolution of policing and prisons because people in Wales are \"let down by the system in its current state\". Mr Buckland, the Conservative MP for South Swindon, said: \"I think the question you've got to ask yourself is 'what is the outcome?' \"It's all very well obsessing about process, working out which desk is going to be responsible for what. \"What is more important I think from the point of view of residents is outcomes.\" \"Making our streets in Wales safer, I find that's what the public would expect me and the home secretary and the prime minister to be concentrating on, rather than worrying about who holds the pen,\" he added. A Plaid Cymru debate called for the devolution of criminal justice at the Senedd on Wednesday. \"For a fraction of the amount that we are spending keeping people in prison we could invest in a really good quality probation service,\" said Leanne Wood, Plaid AM for Rhondda, in an interview on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement. Her comments come after a coroner at Conner Marshall's inquest criticised the probation service's \"woefully inadequate\" management of a case worker supervising a man who beat the 18-year-old to death. \"These are the things that we need to tackle,\" said Ms Wood. \"They are not being tackled at the moment and we could tackle them if devolution of criminal justice was seen through.\" After Friday's inquest, the National Probation Service in Wales said it had taken responsibility for managing all offenders on licence in Wales from the Community Rehabilitation Company.", "output": "UK ministers remain committed to building a new prison in Wales, according to the justice secretary.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "A man aged 20 and a 17-year-old boy are being held following the stabbing of James Brindley, 26, in Aldridge High Street, West Midlands, on 23 June.

He was one of Britain's most loved and enduring radio and TV personalities. His death on 31 January came as a surprise to many people since he had kept his illness out of the headlines. Leading figures from the worlds of showbusiness and politics were quick to pay tribute to him, with Prime Minister David Cameron saying he was \"someone millions came to feel was their own special friend\".

Scotland's biggest teaching union, the EIS, claimed the situation is at crisis point. It argued the main reason is a cut to the amount some supply teachers are paid. Another reason may be that more young teachers are now getting full time jobs so are not available for supply work. Whatever the precise cause, the practical impact can be a serious challenge. At Marr College, a secondary school in Troon, three of the eight English teachers are currently off. It has proved impossible for South Ayrshire Council to get adequate supply cover. So first, second and third year students are not getting as many English lessons from an English teacher as they should be. Instead other teachers - such as modern language teachers - are looking after some English classes as a temporary solution. English teachers The council hopes to recruit three full-time English teachers - who'll initially be used to cover the gaps at Marr College - within the next few weeks. Most supply teachers are called in to cover for a few days when a regular teacher falls sick or goes on a training course. Protracted problems quite as severe as the one at Marr College are likely to be relatively uncommon although the EIS said it has \"significant anecdotal evidence\" from members about secondary schools where children are not being taught by subject specialists. Nationally the EIS believes more than a third of supply requests and are not being met and that students are losing out. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: \"That means that pupils are not being taught by subject specialists or they're in extended assemblies or sometimes they're sitting in the canteen being supervised because no teacher is available.\" Mr Flanagan believes a substantial cut in the rate of pay for supply teachers who are engaged for less than 5 days has had a significant impact. They get around half the daily rate given to teachers called in for longer. Problems providing cover can be most acute in rural or remote areas or with specialist subjects at secondary schools. BBC Scotland contacted all 32 Scottish councils and a number said they had noted a drop in the number of supply teachers registered with them. Edinburgh said there had been a reduction in their ranks from about 950 last August - to 775 this year. But the council says it has been actively trying to find replacements for the registered and doesn't expect problems this year. Subject specialisms Stirling Council said: \"We are currently experiencing difficulty in the primary sector and also in with subject specialisms such Physics, Maths and Home Economics in secondary sector.\" Perth and Kinross Council said: \"The change in terms and conditions for supply staff has reduced the numbers that are available and we are currently trying to recruit supply staff. The availability of supply staff has further been restricted by providing cover for a higher than normal number of maternity leave. \"The main impacts are the amount of time head teachers and deputes are spending covering primary classes, and in secondary schools that subject classes may not always have a subject specialist available.\" East Ayrshire said it had experienced some difficulties, particularly in remote rural areas and some specific subjects. West Dunbartonshire said: \"Over the last few years we have noticed that there is less availability on our teacher supply list. As a result of this we advertised last year and also refreshed our list to ensure that it reflected people available for work. \"As with all other authorities we are experiencing difficulties in obtaining supply staff - especially within particular subjects in the secondary sector.\" As well as pay, there are several possible reasons for the drop in the number of supply teachers - one of them the unfortunate by-product of what most would see as a positive development. More newly-qualified teachers are now securing permanent positions so cannot do supply work. In the past, more may have joined the supply register because they could not get a full-time teaching job. 'Impact of pay agreement' Another reason may be changes to the curriculum. Some supply teachers may have dropped out because of these. And, of course, some supply teachers have simply retired. But what might help solve the problem? Many councils are actively trying to recruit more supply teachers while improvements to workforce planning could help sort out gaps caused by planned absences such as maternity leave. Neighbouring councils might also be able to work more effectively to co-ordinate their banks of supply teachers. Education Secretary Michael Russell said: \"The Scottish Government has tackled teacher unemployment by cutting student teacher numbers, leading to an improving picture across the country. \"However, we recognise that there are challenges in relation to supply teachers, including the impact of the last pay agreement negotiated through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT). \"We continue to involve teaching unions and other stakeholders in workforce planning discussions with a view to ensuring that we have the right number of teachers for our schools the length and breadth of Scotland. \"I am on record as having said that the SNCT needs to look at the supply situation again, and I understand that, while negotiations are on-going, there is a new pay agreement on the table which will address this specific issue.\" The current pay offer from Cosla means supply teachers would start to be paid at a higher rate after three days instead of five.

In an extract from his memoir, the ex-Labour leader says \"we were not just misinformed, but misled\". Mr Brown says he became aware of the \"crucial\" paper after leaving office. The Iraq War - which divided British public opinion - began in March 2003, with the conflict and its aftermath claiming the lives of 179 UK troops. The UK joined the US-led invasion after both countries jointly accused Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction and having links to terrorism. British intelligence from 2002, seen at the time by the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and Mr Brown, suggested the country was capable of having such weapons. \"I was told they knew where the weapons were,\" Mr Brown writes. \"I remember thinking at the time that it was almost as if they could give me the street name and number where they were located.\" But, Mr Brown says a report commissioned at the time by the then-US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld \"forcibly challenged\" this view. 'War unjustified' He said it suggested other intelligence had relied \"heavily on analytic assumptions\" rather than hard evidence, and disproved Iraq's capability to make weapons of mass destruction. \"If I am right that somewhere within the American system the truth about Iraq's lack of weapons was known, then we were not just misinformed but misled on the critical issue,\" he writes in My Life, Our Times. A seven-year inquiry into the UK's involvement in the Iraq War found Saddam Hussein posed \"no imminent threat\" when the US and UK invaded.

The study is being presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in London. By 2050, 131 million people could be living with dementia globally. There are estimated to be 47 million people with the condition at the moment. Nine factors that contribute to the risk of dementia These risk factors - which are described as potentially modifiable - add up to 35%. The other 65% of dementia risk is thought to be potentially non-modifiable. Source: Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care \"Although dementia is diagnosed in later life, the brain changes usually begin to develop years before,\" said lead author Prof Gill Livingston, from University College London. \"Acting now will vastly improve life for people with dementia and their families and, in doing so, will transform the future of society.\" The report, which combines the work of 24 international experts, says lifestyle factors can play a major role in increasing or reducing an individual's dementia risk. It examines the benefits of building a \"cognitive reserve\", which means strengthening the brain's networks so it can continue to function in later life despite damage. Eve Laird, from Dumfries, is worried about dementia because her mum is living with the condition. She has decided to make some changes to her lifestyle. \"I'm terrible for eating processed foods and takeaways and I've really been trying to cut back on that. \"I definitely drink a lot more water than I used to - and I don't drink as much coffee now. \"I actually took part in the Edinburgh marathon. For that I joined the Dumfries running club - I go there once a week.\" She says she felt so much better for the exercise, and for improving her diet. \"I felt a lot healthier and mentally sharper as well. It's something I'd really like to continue, but it is hard to stay on track.\" \"I just think the small changes can make such a big difference.\" Failure to complete secondary education was a major risk factor, and the authors suggest that individuals who continue to learn throughout life are likely to build additional brain reserves. Another major risk factor is hearing loss in middle age - the researchers say this can deny people a cognitively rich environment and lead to social isolation and depression, which are among other potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia. Another key message from the report is that what is good for the heart is good for the brain. 'Positive changes' Not smoking, doing exercise, keeping a healthy weight, treating high blood pressure and diabetes can all reduce the risk of dementia, as well as cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The researchers say they did not have enough data to include dietary factors or alcohol in their calculations but believe both could be important. Dr Doug Brown, director of research at Alzheimer's Society, said: \"Though it's not inevitable, dementia is currently set to be the 21st Century's biggest killer. We all need to be aware of the risks and start making positive lifestyle changes.\" Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Alongside prevention research, we must continue to invest in research to find a life-changing treatment for people with this devastating condition.\" Follow Fergus on Twitter", "output": "One in three cases of dementia could be prevented if more people looked after their brain health throughout life, according to an international study in the Lancet.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The scientists have adapted the \"Moneyball\" approach, which uses the principles of advanced statistical and data analysis to speed up research.

The University of Dundee researchers are trialling the system on the creation of drugs to treat infectious diseases. Evolved solution Chair of Medicinal Informatics at Dundee Prof Andrew Hopkins said: \"One of the things that makes drug discovery so hard is that you're trying to improve several different properties at the same time. \"Evolution is a mechanism that can be applied to solving these kinds of problems, and the iterative (repeating) process of adaptation and selection of hundreds of thousand of possible solutions can be simulated in a computer. \"We have effectively proved the concept of automated design of new compounds showing that by using algorithms to process massive amounts of data, we can tackle problems of huge complexity.\" Prof Hopkins said there were very real implications from the research.

I wasn't a trader. But my job involved me interacting with traders on a daily basis. I started by contacting Bruno Curnier. In 2002 he trained me, along with about 200 other fresh-faced graduate recruits, in the basics of financial markets - something he has been doing for well over a decade. \"A trader is someone whose focus is on achieving short-term profit,\" he tells me. \"That focus is so potent that sometimes the ends justify the means.\" Profit motive? This tallies with my own experience. For many traders, their sense of self-worth is defined almost uniquely by their \"P&L\" - the profit and loss they make for the bank - and, by implication, the size of their bonus. Making a profitable trade shows that they are right. And the bigger the profit, the more right they are. As for the enormous bonuses (and for many, Adoboli's, at \u00a3250,000, was not so enormous), their importance is not so much in the material wealth they bring, so much as the recognition of the trader's status and success. I have known horrendously overpaid traders become very angry when they discovered they were not getting as much as an allegedly less successful colleague. My boss once sent round an article about a monkey test that illustrated the point nicely. Adoboli specifically denied being motivated by personal gain in the form of a bonus, and the jury appear to have believed him. But he does nonetheless seem to have suffered from a fixation on profit above all else, which he claimed was because he felt under pressure to produce results. This fixation seems evident from the confessional email he sent to his risk controller when he realised he could no longer hide his losses. In it, he claimed that he had almost managed to succeed in recouping his losses at one point, before the market turned against him. By that logic, it was as if he were saying he had been unlucky, as if this mitigated the fact that he had been behaving totally irresponsibly. 'Gekko syndrome' So why do banks recruit these gamblers in the first place? \"What I have observed is a big emphasis in banks on technical competence - high cognitive ability or IQ,\" says Mr Curnier. \"When it comes to EQ [Emotional Quotient], my sense is that people are not spending a lot of time focusing on that.\" EQ is a measure of individuals' ability to manage their emotions and their relations with others, developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman. Mr Curnier says many traders suffer from \"Gekko syndrome\", like the \"greed is good\" anti-hero of the film Wall Street. They lack self-awareness - the ability to understand their own emotions and how they affect others. The aggressive, risk-taking, boundary-pushing, \"high-roller\" image of the trader tends to attract exactly that kind of applicant. This self-selection effect can then be reinforced by a recruitment process in which the successful candidates are ultimately picked by the traders they will work for. \"I don't think some traders have any clue how to manage people. They recruit people they like - if they see the same drive,\" says Mr Curnier. Indeed, many traders actively avoid promotion to managerial posts - something that would take them away from the buzz of winning in the market they know and love. And many of the most successful traders end up being paid a lot more than their managers, sometimes even more than the head of their bank. Aggressive Of course, not all traders are alike, and Mr Curnier is at pains to point out that he has also met many traders with very high ethical standards. My personal experience is that they come in three main varieties, and the variety depends very much on the type of market they work in. The most stereotypically aggressive are the \"flow\" traders - people who work in the simplest, most competitive and fast-moving markets, such as currencies or shares. Where I worked, the currency trading desks resembled an arcade. The traders had rigged their computers to blare out noises or tunes every time they bought or sold. Then there were the \"quant\" traders - those dealing with financial options or complicated transactions know as synthetic CDOs. They were brainy types, who needed to have an intuitive grip on the complex maths involved, and occasionally blew up when they got their maths wrong. Finally, there were the \"elephant hunters\". These characters might spend months on one big transaction earning millions of dollars in profit. They too were deep thinkers, but their thoughts were turned to negotiating tactics, complex legal documents and accounting issues. They also seemed to be mostly likeable family men. Testosterone Nearly all of the traders that I have heard of losing millions or billions (including two minor cases that never became public) fit somewhere between the first two types. They dealt in products that were not too complex (by investment banking standards) and could be traded in large volume. But their products were complicated enough to create risks that were poorly understood - either by the trader himself, or by the people who were supposed to be overseeing him. Oh, and by the way, I say \"him\" for a reason. The vast majority of traders are men. At spread-betting firm City Index, the male-to-female ratio of punters is 10:1. The reason is to do with male physiology. According to research in 2007, traders are more successful when they are high on their own hormones, including adrenalin, cortisol and testosterone. It physically gears them up for battle, making them more persistent and more willing to take risks. Success in trading then leads to higher hormone levels and even more risky behaviour. It becomes a feedback loop, called the \"winner effect\". The same effect is evident in nature - animals that win fights for alpha male status experience a testosterone rush that makes them even more willing to fight and push their way to the top. It is also well documented among athletes ahead of a game or a race. \"What I firmly believe is that financial risk-taking is a profoundly physical act,\" says John Coates who jointly ran the study and is himself a former bank trader. \"It's a bit like an army gearing up for a cavalry charge. If we are doing well, the body tells us: 'Go for it, there's fruit everywhere'.\" The downside is that it makes the winner stupidly reckless - Mr Coates says that when traders blow up, it typically comes at the end of a long winning streak. And this is what seems to have happened with Adoboli. Having successfully hidden a permissible, albeit embarrassing, $400,000 loss in 2008, Adoboli went on to take bigger and bigger bets, ultimately resulting in a loss 5,000 times bigger in 2011. Away from the bank, he was even taking extra bets with his own money, leading the prosecution to accuse him of being \"addicted to gambling\". Doubling down The last piece of the psychological puzzle is the mental trap that a rogue trader finds himself in once the losses start stacking up and he faces an impending deadline at which point the game will be up. It presents him with a classic game of double or quits. He can either: The problem for the bank is that, beyond a certain point, the trader's losses are in effect capped: He knows that the worst that can happen to him is that he loses his job and faces criminal charges. Meanwhile, the billions in losses will have to be picked up by the bank - although this did not stop Societe Generale successfully (at least on paper) winning damages against Jerome Kerviel for the entire 4.9bn euros he had lost. In the first scenario, the trader's worst case happens with 100% probability, whereas in the second, it is only 50%. Unsurprisingly, he goes for option 2. If he is really unlucky, he keeps having to double up again and again, until the losses become astronomical. In Adoboli's case, he changed his bet twice, and both times the market changed direction against him. It just makes you wonder how many lucky rogue traders there have been that never came to light.", "output": "Why do traders go rogue? Is it just a few bad apples?

In an internal email obtained by the website 9to5Mac, chief executive Tim Cook told Apple employees that the FTC's proposals were in line with the company's own intentions. \"The consent decree the FTC proposed does not require us to do anything we weren't already going to do, so we decided to accept it rather that take on a long and distracting legal fight,\" he said. Promise He also explained that Apple began setting out a process to refund customers last year. \"We wanted to reach every customer who might have been affected, so we sent emails to 28 million App Store customers - anyone who had made an in-app purchase in a game designed for kids. \"When some emails bounced, we mailed the parents postcards. \"In all, we received 37,000 claims and we will be reimbursing each one as promised.\" Apple's App Store offers many games for children, a large number of which allow in-app purchases to be made. These purchases can include virtual items or currency, and typically allow faster progression in the game.

He was ordered to spend at least 10 and a half years in prison, following a second trial allowed under new double jeopardy laws. His minimum term was later reduced by two years. On Friday the Parole Board said Baker \"was suitable for release\". But he \"will be on licence for the rest of his life\", a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesman added. Baker, now 63, beat and raped Mrs Backwell at her home in Stratford, east London, in 1997. During the court case it was heard that Ms Backwell was found by chance by a neighbour the following evening after Baker locked her in a cupboard. The attack left her too afraid to continue living alone or go out by herself and she died in 2002 \"with a very sad and broken heart\", her family said. Baker was found not guilty in 1999 when a judge wrongly ruled his trial could not proceed. The introduction of the double jeopardy law in 2005 allowed a person cleared of a serious offence to face a retrial in certain circumstances. A review in 2007 found much of the evidence had been lost or destroyed, and the case was reopened two years later. Baker, from Walthamstow, north-east London, was arrested in 2011. The trial of Wendell Baker was one of the most disturbing I've reported on. The brutal nature of the attack was distressing enough, but it was compounded by Baker's failure to show any remorse. His defence to the overwhelming scientific evidence against him was that police had planted semen from a used condom. A judicial error in 1999 and the later loss of vital police case-files meant Baker almost escaped justice. It must be galling, therefore, for those who worked so hard to secure his conviction that he's being let out at the first time of asking. He gave further DNA samples matching those found on swabs taken from Mrs Backwell. In 2014, Baker had his minimum jail term reduced by two years. He became eligible to be considered for release on 15 March. The Parole Board, which held a remote hearing to consider the case, said Baker would be subject to strict licence conditions including a curfew and an \"enhanced form of supervision or monitoring\", once released.

On the runway he boarded Air Force One with his wife, Melania, and the plane took off at 16:12. He is due to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday. Earlier he played a final round of golf at the resort on the Ayrshire coast amid tight security. Despite the high police presence, on Friday evening a protester managed to paraglide over Turnberry. Police Scotland said a 55-year-old man has been arrested and charged in connection with the incident. He is expected to appear at Ayr Sheriff Court on Monday. Mr Trump has been staying at Turnberry during the private leg of his four-day UK visit. He was heckled by protesters as he played golf on Saturday afternoon after they gathered around the perimeter of the resort. He waved as they heckled him from a hill overlooking the Ailsa championship course. In Edinburgh thousands of people marched through the city in a demonstration against the president's controversial visit to the UK. They waved placards as they gathered in the capital's Meadows, where two giant nappy-clad baby Trump balloons were inflated. In a tweet on Saturday, Mr Trump said he was at Turnberry \"for two days of meetings, calls and hopefully some golf\". \"The weather is beautiful and this place is incredible,\" he added. \"Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin.\" There have been calls for Monday's meeting between the US and Russian presidents to be cancelled, after the US charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with election interference. But White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has said the meeting will go ahead as planned in Helsinki. And Mr Trump used Twitter to criticise the administration of his predecessor Barack Obama over alleged Russian hacking to help him win the 2016 presidential election. \"Why didn't they do something about it?\" he tweeted, adding that Mr Obama had been told about it before the vote. Police estimated that about 9,000 people took part in the march through Edinburgh, which they said \"passed without incident\". They gathered at the Scottish Parliament, before walking to the city's meadows area for a \"carnival of resistance\". At Turnberry, protesters climbed a hill near the golf course to ensure the president could see their placards and banners. As he took to the golf course with his son, Eric, they branded him a \"racist\", shouting: \"No Trump, no KKK, no racist USA.\" The president and his wife Melania arrived in Scotland on board Air Force One on Friday evening, before travelling by motorcade to the Trump Turnberry resort - one of two Scottish golf courses he owns. There is a massive security operation in place at the complex on the Ayrshire coast but shortly after he arrived a paraglider flew over the area with a sign claiming Mr Trump was \"well below par\". It comes after the president spent Friday meeting both Theresa May and the Queen on what is Mr Trump's first visit to the UK as president.

Any of those contacts deemed at risk of infection will be told to isolate for 14 days, even if they are not sick. Those who have already had the virus will also be asked to self-isolate. The aim of the system is to lift blanket lockdown restrictions and move towards more localised, targeted measures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was confident that the \"vast majority of people\" would participate in the voluntary system. \"In this war on the virus, ultimately we are all on the same side and we've all got a part that we can play,\" he said. The launch came as it was announced that some restrictions are to be eased in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The 25,000 tracers working for England's NHS Test and Trace team started by contacting the 2,013 people who tested positive for the virus on Wednesday. However, shortly after launching, some tracers said they were struggling to access the system. In a statement, the Department of Health insisted it had not crashed, adding: \"Some staff did initially encounter issues logging on to their systems and these are rapidly being resolved.\" Trish Mannes, who leads a team of tracing specialists for Public Health England in the South East, told the BBC there had been a \"technical glitch\" but that overall the \"system seems to be working well\". She compared the contact tracing process to \"detective work\", using both \"technical knowledge\" and \"people skills\". \"The things that are important to me are empathy and ability to speak to people and get a rapport - remember we're asking people for a lot of detailed information, it takes time to get that information,\" she said. Two MPs said they were told England's system would not be fully operational \"at local level\" until the end of June. Labour's Ben Bradshaw and Lib Dem Daisy Cooper both tweeted after a call with Baroness Dido Harding, the chairwoman of NHS Test and Trace. Downing Street said the test and trace system would \"improve\" over time but rejected suggestions the scheme had been launched early. But Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said hospital trust leaders were questioning the risk being run by easing the lockdown without having local systems in place. He also said it was \"never going to be the case\" that the UK would have a \"world-class\" test and trace system in place by June - in reference to a previous pledge made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Hopson said while work was progressing \"at pace\", the UK was \"weeks behind where we really ought to be\". An app to automatically alert people they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight but the government hopes to have that system up-and-running in England \"in the coming weeks\". The launch of Scotland's new Test and Protect system comes as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced people from two different households will be able to meet outdoors from Friday. Northern Ireland has its own version of the test and trace programme already. Wales' scheme is due to start in early June. Meanwhile, a further 377 people have died with coronavirus across all settings in the UK, daily figures released on Thursday showed. The total number of deaths in and outside of hospitals is now 37,837, the Department of Health said. What will I have to do now? Anyone who develops symptoms of coronavirus - a persistent cough, fever or a sudden loss of taste or sense of smell - has to isolate for seven days and the rest of their household for 14 days. This is in keeping with rules already in place. But from now on, everyone with symptoms should ask for a test online or phone to arrange a test by calling 119. If the test comes back negative, everyone in the household can go back to normal. But if the test comes back positive, the contact tracing team or local public health teams will get in touch - via text, email or phone call - to discuss whom the person has come into close contact with and places they have visited. Any of those contacts deemed at risk of catching the virus will be emailed or texted with instructions to go into isolation for 14 days, whether they are sick or not. They will be tested only if they develop symptoms. The rest of their household does not have to isolate, unless someone becomes ill. Mr Hancock said people would have to self-isolate on more than one occasion if told to do so by the NHS. Those who have already had the virus must also self-isolate, as it is not known whether they can still transmit it. What is a close contact? Only people who have been \"close\" to an infected person will be contacted by tracers. Close contacts are: The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. Do I have to do as I'm told? Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in the daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday that it is the public's \"civic duty\" to follow the instructions of the NHS Test and Trace team. \"This will be voluntary at first because we trust everyone to do the right thing. But we can quickly make it mandatory if that's what it takes,\" he added. Scientists, including those advising the government, have warned that it will be harder to get public support for such measures in the wake of the row over the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. Mr Cummings was accused of breaking lockdown rules after driving 260 miles from London to County Durham because, he said, he was concerned about childcare for his son when his wife became ill. What about work? Those instructed to self-isolate will be eligible for statutory sick pay - \u00a395.85 per week - but there are fears that many workers will not be able to live on that amount and will be forced to keep working. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to introduce \"enhanced\" sick pay, saying: \"There will be people whose work conditions and employment conditions make [self-isolating] difficult for them so they need that security.\" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called on the government to extend sick pay to everyone and raise it to the \"real living wage\" - \u00a3260 per week. She said the entire test and trace system would be \"undermined\" if workers were \"pushed into hardship\" when they were required to self-isolate. Will it work? The success of the scheme will depend on how quickly contacts can be found and whether members of the public follow instructions, a report published by the Royal Society said. It concluded that between 5% and 15% of infections could be prevented. But the 15% figure depends on finding contacts within three days and 80% of people reporting their symptoms or going into isolation when asked. By comparison, isolating cases and quarantining members of their household is thought to cut infections by 50%. Prof Anne Johnson, one of the report's authors, said the system \"is an important part in bringing the pandemic under control, but we're very clear it is not a magic bullet\". The national coordinator of NHS Test and Trace said the system requires rapid testing in order to be successful. However, after the prime minister said on Wednesday there was now a target to get test results in less than 24 hours, Prof John Newton added it would be \"very difficult\" to get home testing kit results in less than 48 hours. What will the system achieve? At the moment coronavirus is being suppressed by lockdown restrictions applied across the whole of society. Baroness Harding said the scheme was designed to allow national lockdown restrictions to be \"traded\" with individual isolation - allowing \"the vast majority to get on with their lives in a much more normal way\". Test and trace will also give far more detail on how and where the virus is spreading. Mr Hancock said this information could lead to local lockdowns to tackle flare-ups. Baroness Harding said data from an NHS contact tracing app being piloted on the Isle of Wight - which is not yet ready to be rolled out more widely - suggests people have been within 2m of fewer than five others for more than 15 minutes.

He said: \"On current forecasts average earnings will be no higher in 2022 than they were in 2007. Fifteen years without a pay rise. This is completely unprecedented.\" The latest data showed that wages are growing at the slowest rate since April of last year. \"This weakness was broad based, with wage growth moderating in the financial and business services, distribution, construction and public sectors,\" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Interest rates impact Wage growth is one of the most important pieces of data that the Bank of England takes into consideration when it makes decisions about interest rates. The Bank holds its next interest rate policy meeting on Thursday. Mr Tombs said he expects the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to keep interest rates on hold at 0.25%. \"All told, the combination of meagre wage growth despite very low unemployment supports the MPC's view that enough slack remains in the labour market to warrant keeping rates on hold during the imminent period of high inflation.\" Zero hours up The ONS said there are 1.58 million people out of work in the three months to January, 31,000 fewer than the previous three months. The unemployment rate was last at 4.7% in 2005 and has not been below that since the summer of 1975. The ONS also released data on the number of people on zero hour contracts in their main job, which rose by 101,000 between October and December to 905,000. This is equal to 2.8% of all people in employment. Number crunching The unemployment figures are based on the Labour Force Survey in which the ONS talks to about 40,000 households, or 100,000 individuals, every three months. As it is a survey, the results are estimates and have a margin of error. For example, the unemployment rate of 4.7% is the best estimate from the ONS, but it is 95% confident that the actual rate is between 4.5% and 4.9%. Similarly, the fall in unemployment was 31,000, but could be 80,000 above or below that number, so the drop is described as not being statistically significant.", "output": "UK unemployment fell in the three months to January but there was a sharp slowdown in wage growth.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The victim was found with stab wounds on Kingsland Road, Hackney, at 06:29 GMT by police.

But it potentially excludes shared ownership buyers. Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey said: \"It's not fair. These are the people that this stamp duty relief should be there for and it isn't.\" What is shared ownership? Shared ownership helps people who can't afford to buy a house outright. It allows you to buy a share in the house and then pay rent on the rest. You can then increase your share, by buying more of the house as time goes on. There are around 200,000 shared ownership properties in the UK. First time buyers qualify as long as their household earns less than \u00a380,000, or \u00a390,000 in London. There are some different rules in Northern Ireland and Scotland. What is stamp duty? Stamp duty is the tax you must pay if you buy a house in England, Northern Ireland or Wales. In its last budget, the government scrapped stamp duty for first-time buyers purchasing a home of up to \u00a3300,000. It also reduced stamp duty for properties costing up to \u00a3500,000. As a result the average first-time buyer would save about \u00a31,700. Do you pay stamp duty on the shared ownership scheme? Thousands of first-time buyers using shared ownership scheme may miss out on the stamp duty exemption. That's because stamp duty is calculated on the property's full value, not the share being bought. So, if you were buying a 50% share in a \u00a3500,000 home you would still have to pay stamp duty. That amount you would have to pay would be \u00a310,000. This is a particular problem in places with high property prices, like London. What do Labour want to change? Labour's housing minister John Healey wants all first-time buyers using the shared ownership scheme to qualify for the stamp duty exemption. \"I want to see them (the government) applying to shared ownership, the same rules as they apply to people buying a full house for the first time,\" he told Newsbeat. \"It's inconsistent. It's not fair. These are precisely the people that this stamp duty relief should be there for and it isn't.\" What does the government say? The government argues it already gives \"special stamp duty treatment\" to shared ownership purchases. Buyers on the scheme can make a one-off stamp duty payment based on the total value of the property. Or they can pay stamp duty in stages. So what does that mean? Before the budget, if a first-time buyer wanted to buy a \u00a3500,000 house outright they would have to pay \u00a315,000 in stamp duty. That has now been cut to \u00a310,000. But a first-time buyer on a shared ownership scheme buying part of a property valued at the same price would also have to pay \u00a310,000 upfront. That's despite them only buying a share of the house which could well fall way under the \u00a3300,000 stamp duty exemption. This is a problem for many on the shared ownership scheme who struggle to raise the initial cash for homeownership - such as the deposit and stamp duty costs.

That dysfunctional state of affairs goes a long way towards explaining the weak pace of the global recovery from recession. Financial analysts at Vanda Securities reckon that jobs growth of 180,000 in the month would equate to rising US and emerging market stocks, as the prospect of a rate rise receded, but a rise of 250,000 would see asset prices fall. In other news, for the markets at least, \"bad news would be good news.\" Taking assets prices first, on a simple view, rising employment should be good news for US equities - it heralds more consumer spending and hence stronger demand. Indeed, one could argue that a rise in US interest rates would be a sign that policymakers are optimistic about the US recovery and should even be a sign that corporate profits will continue to rise, boosting stocks. That's an argument I've heard before from central bankers but one that is rarely popular with market participants. To understand why higher interest rates are being equated with weaker stock prices, one has to understand that Western stock markets have been as reliant on cheap money for growth as they have on improving corporate performances. Low interest rates not only make stocks look attractive on a relative basis (the relative returns from stocks appear high when interest rates are low - why keep money in the bank or sick it into bonds when the returns look so low?). In the US there has been an additional - and powerful - link between low borrowing costs and higher equities. Cheap borrowing has allowed companies to take on debt in order to buy back their own stocks pushing up their price. Such buy-backs have been a big driver of the large Wall Street rally since 2009. The economic recovery in the US - and the UK - has not just been accompanied by a big rise in asset prices but even, to an extent, led by that rise. But an asset price-led recovery underpinned by low interest rates is far from ideal. The fact that good news for the real economy may prove to be bad news for assets gives some clues as to the topsy-turvy world we are living in. Then there is the global picture. While a rise in interest rates might be appropriate for the US, it almost certainly isn't for much of the rest of the world where its impact will be felt just as much. Hence the IMF today calling on Western policymakers to hold their fire on rate rises. Economic performance has diverged across the globe - the US and UK recoveries look robust, Europe's growth is moderate but the big emerging economies look to be in trouble. As economies have diverged so too has monetary policy - with rate cuts across the developing world this year and further quantitative easing (electronically creating money) likely from both the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank in the months ahead. All at a time when the US Fed (and possibly the Bank of England) look set to start tightening policy. That monetary divergence is playing out in the currency markets, where the story of 2015 has been a strengthening US dollar. Historically periods of rising US interest rates and a strengthening dollar have heralded a tough time for the emerging world. While the Fed takes into account conditions abroad when setting policy, it does so in a second order manner - the question it asks isn't \"what will a hike do to emerging market economies?\" but \"how would a slowdown in emerging markets affect the US?\" Given the Fed is the United States' central bank and not the world's (even if its policy has a major global impact] this is fair enough question. But it goes to the heart of one of the factors that led to the crisis of 2008 - the lack of global policy co-ordination. The monetary, fiscal, trade and exchange rate policies of each country can have a major impact on its neighbours. But with each country setting policy in its own (often short-term) interest, the bigger picture can be, to say the least, sub-optimal. The global economy suffers from a lack of co-ordination and co-operation. The mechanisms to make it work simply don't exist. Even in the eurozone - an example of a dozen-and-a-half countries choosing to pool their economic sovereignty - the toolkit is bare. Debtor states - such as Greece or Spain - that run into trouble can be forced, through strict conditionality on loans, to make changes to their policy, but the creditor states (such as Germany) are subject to just an attempt at moral persuasion. Even though it takes both a debtor and creditor to make a debt problem happen. A 0.25% rise in US interest rates is highly unlikely to derail the world recovery. But when good news is bad news, you know there is a bigger problem.", "output": "The all-important US jobs figures for August are released on 4 September.

BBC Wales revealed members of staff had been involved in offers to help overseas students cheat their way to UoW degrees and UK visas. The UKBA said the college would remain suspended while it investigated. Further documents obtained by BBC Wales also reveal that at least one cohort of around 90 overseas students were set to benefit, having sat exams in early August for which the answers were available for sale. The exams were held at Lampton College, Hounslow, west London, which the UKBA has also suspended. The exam board, Professional Qualifications Management, was run by Irvin Harris, who was registrar at Rayat London College, also in Hounslow, which offers UoW-validated courses. In a secret recording he claimed he could help overseas students cheat their way to UoW degrees in order to qualify for sought-after graduate work visas, which are being abolished in April 2012. An undercover reporter purchased answers to PQM exam papers but did not sit the tests. BBC Wales understands a lecturer on UoW courses at Rayat London College, Surya Medicherla, was also the chief examiner of PQM. The questions and answers to all eight modules of the 15 month course were handed out in a revision class Mr Medicherla ran, which the reporter attended. He told students how to complete the tests and what to say under interrogation from the UK Border Agency. Word for word BBC Wales has now obtained documents which show the papers were the same as those sat by around 90 overseas students just a few days later, with the candidates all submitting virtually identical answers. Some students received a pass for submissions which included phrases such as \"answers should include\" and \"this questions requires students to\", indicating they simply copied out the answer sheets word for word. The diploma entitles students to entry on university MBA courses with exemptions from up to two thirds of the work. The lecturer encouraged students to use the diploma to enrol on a UoW MBA course at Rayat London College. Mr Harris has resigned as registrar of the college and as chief executive of PQM, and the college has suspended the lecturer Mr Medicherla and admissions officer, Jalak Mody, who all deny any wrongdoing. Direct entry The UoW has refused to answer questions about its links with Rayat London College and PQM, saying it would be inappropriate to comment while UK Border Agency and police investigated. In a statement issued four days after a BBC Wales' investigation earlier this month it said: \"The non-UoW certificates allegedly acquired by students allowed them to claim credit in order to enter degrees at any university in the UK.\" BBC Wales has also obtained a letter from the UoW to Rayat London College giving it the right to enrol students who have PQM qualifications on its MBA course with exemptions from most of the work. The letter, dated 1 September 2011, was from David Orford, who was employed as the university's moderator, responsible for overseeing the partnership with the college. It is understood Mr Orford, who was associate dean of the Business School at the UoW Newport, was a member of the panel which re-validated courses at Rayat London College for a further five years in July 2011. He wrote: \"I can confirm that the UoW does accept PQM as an acceptable qualification for direct entry onto the latter stages of the MBA, with students normally expected to study two modules plus the dissertation in order to complete the award. \"The awarding/validating body must be recognised and seen as have (sic) appropriate quality and standards. PQM fits this criterion.\" No response The letter was dated the same day Mr Orford ended his duties with the UoW and took up a new role as academic director at Rayat London College. Neither Mr Orford nor the college have responded to BBC Wales' questions about the letter. In an earlier statement the college said it wished to disassociate itself from any alleged wrongdoing. Meanwhile, the UK Border Agency says its investigation is ongoing after it raided a number of premises in response to BBC Wales' story. A spokesman said: \"We have carried out visits to Rayat and Lampton Colleges and they are currently unable to bring in new students while our investigations are ongoing.\" The vice chancellors of six of the 10 Welsh universities want the UoW brand to be scrapped while three of its five full member institutions plan to award their own degrees as soon as possible. Education Minister, Leighton Andrews has said the university needed a \"decent burial\" and has called on its chairman D Hugh Thomas to resign. The UoW, which is the second largest in the UK with 70,000 students in 130 colleges around the world, said it would adopt a new international strategy and promised to build a \"transformed university built upon strong governance\".", "output": "A University of Wales (UoW) partner college at the centre of allegations of a visa scam has been suspended by the UK Border Agency (UKBA).", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The Met Police issued 3,282 Traffic Offence Reports to drivers suspected of exceeding the limit in April, compared with 1,922 in April 2019.

The firm was run by Lex Greensill - a former unpaid adviser to the ex-PM during his time in No 10. The texts show Mr Sunak told Mr Cameron his request for access to government-backed loans was being examined. Mr Cameron's messages to Mr Sunak have not been released. In a document detailing the messages, officials said Mr Cameron had sent the messages as a Greensill employee with an expectation that they would remain confidential. It also revealed that the former PM had contacted two other Treasury ministers - Jesse Norman and John Glen - about the company. A source close to Mr Sunak said Mr Cameron had messaged the chancellor \"multiple times\" on his personal phone. The source added Mr Sunak had chosen to publish the messages \"in order to reassure beyond doubt that there was no wrongdoing and that he acted with integrity and propriety\". But Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the messages \"raise very serious questions about whether the chancellor may have broken the ministerial code\", saying they suggested the firm \"got accelerated treatment and access to officials\" and Mr Sunak \"pushed officials to consider Greensill's requests\". After leaving office, Mr Cameron got a job as an adviser from his own former adviser, Mr Greensill. When advising Greensill Capital - which has now gone bust - the former prime minister texted Conservative ministers within the Treasury to appeal for access to emergency loans for Greensill Capital. But the requests were rejected by Treasury officials. Mr Cameron was investigated by a watchdog over whether he broke rules by not registering as a lobbyist for his work at Greensill - but he was cleared in March. However, critics have continued to question his access to ministers and the role Mr Greensill played in Downing Street when Mr Cameron was prime minister. Who has access to those in power, how is that access used - and how do those in power respond? These are the questions that matter at the heart of this, or any other political row about lobbying; the attempt to exert influence on politicians. Labour is demanding what it calls \"a full, transparent and thorough investigation\" into Greensill Capital's connections at Westminster. David Cameron was working for Greensill Capital, a firm run by Lex Greensill, who had previously worked in Downing Street... when Mr Cameron was prime minister. Former politicians have two marketable assets when they leave politics: 1.) They know how government works. 2.) And they know who works in government. Mr Cameron had served the two-year lobbying ban imposed on former ministers when they leave office before he worked for Greensill. And seeking to make your case to government - as an individual, charity, trade union, or business - is an integral part of politics in a democracy. But would someone who didn't happen to be a former prime minister be able to text the Chancellor, and get a reply? What is tricky in any story about lobbying is trying to prove whether the intervention of the lobbyist made any difference. While the rules on lobbying are more transparent than they were, plenty think they need to be much more so. In Mr Sunak's reply to a text from Mr Cameron on 3 April 2020, the chancellor said: \"Hi David, thanks for your message. I am stuck back to back on calls but will try you later this evening and if gets too late, first thing tomorrow. Best, Rishi.\" In the second reply on 23 April, Mr Sunak said: \"Hi David, apologies for the delay. I think the proposals in the end did require a change to the Market Notice but I have pushed the team to explore an alternative with the Bank that might work. \"No guarantees, but the Bank are currently looking at it and Charles should be in touch. Best, Rishi.\" What do the texts reference? The 23 April message relates to Greensill Capital's desire to be part of a government-backed Covid loan scheme. The \"Bank\" Mr Sunak refers to is understood to be the Bank of England, which was running the Corporate Covid Financing Facility - a scheme to help big firms through the crisis. And it is understood that \"Charles\" refers to Charles Roxburgh, the second most senior civil servant at the Treasury. The Treasury said the firm's requests were eventually rejected by officials. Ms Dodds added: \"The Chancellor's decision to open the door to Greensill Capital has put public money at risk. \"There must be a full, transparent and thorough investigation into the chain of events that saw Greensill awarded lucrative contracts, the freedom of Whitehall and the right to lend millions of pounds of government-backed Covid loans.\" The SNP's Stewart Hosie accused the government of \"stumbling from one scandal to the next\", adding: \"Tory ministers and former prime ministers casually texting each other over government access utterly reeks.\" He called on Mr Sunak to \"come before Parliament and set the record straight\".

Fear of flying Air travel has slumped this year as countries shut their borders and people remain concerned about potentially becoming infected on flights or while travelling. The cancelation or postponement of major events - including the Olympic Games in Japan, industry conferences and music festivals - has also had a major impact on demand for flights. Last month the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned that 2020 will go down as the \"worst\" on record financially. The global industry group said the plunge in travel caused by the coronavirus will drive airline losses of more than $84bn (\u00a365bn) this year, as revenues fall by 50% compared to 2019. The collapse in demand has already forced carriers around the world to cut flights and layoff or furlough tens of thousands of workers. Less than three weeks ago, the president of Emirates told the BBC that his company is set to cut as many as 9,000 jobs because of the pandemic. Tim Clark said the airline had already cut a tenth of its staff but said: \"We will probably have to let go of a few more, probably up to 15%.\" Prior to the crisis, Emirates had 60,000 staff.

The Osmo Action uses image-stabilisation software to smooth out its video, rather than using the electronic motors found in the Osmo Pocket and other handheld gimbals. This mirrors the approach of GoPro's Hero 7 Black. But DJI's model has the advantage of a colour front-screen. The 1.4in display should help frame selfie photos and videos, while its rear 2.25in touchscreen is also slightly larger than that of the GoPro. Otherwise the devices are closely matched, both offering: Camera reviewer Kaiman Wong is one of the first people to have carried out a side-by-side comparison of the competing products. \"With stabilisation, the DJI seemed a lot smoother across all five axes of movement - the footage seemed to glide along, you almost don't need a gimbal now,\" he told the BBC. \"And the front screen is pretty good. It doesn't show the full width of the shot, but it's good to know when you are in frame. For vloggers, myself included, it's a very useful feature to have.\" He added that so far he had found few downsides to the newer device. \"There is a slight lag in the DJI's display when using the stabilisation, but you can live with it and it may not be an issue [after a software update].\" Other reviewers have noted that the Osmo Action lacks GPS location-tracking and has more basic facilities to share images to social media. It is also unable to live-stream footage via a smartphone app, which the GoPro flagship can do. Action sports GoPro has become synonymous with the market for action cameras, which are targeted at snow-boarders, surfers, sky divers, and other extreme sports enthusiasts as well as professionals who do not want to risk more expensive equipment in high-risk shoots. As smartphones have become more rugged and waterproof, this market has become squeezed. The Hero 7's built-in stabilisation had become a key driver to convince existing owners to upgrade. DJI will sell the Osmo Action for \u00a3329 when it begins deliveries this week. That is \u00a350 below the cost of the Hero 7 Black. However, GoPro is currently bundling a microSD card, which helps narrow the difference. Under pressure The seventh-generation Hero helped the US firm post its first quarterly profit in more than a year in February, although it subsequently fell back into a loss over the following three months. Having ditched its own drone business last year and not updated its 360-degree Fusion camera since it was unveiled in September 2017, GoPro is now heavily dependent on its action cameras to drive revenues. As a private company, Shenzhen-based DJI does not release equivalent financial data of its own, and has a wider portfolio of products to fall back on. In its favour, GoPro has established widespread distribution deals with physical retailers, making its cameras a common sight in high street stores. But Mr Wong said DJI's entry into the market would put the American firm under pressure ahead of its next product cycle. \"The changes made to the last three to four evolutions of GoPro's action cameras have not been groundbreaking,\" he explained. \"And anything that GoPro does now may almost seem like a 'we-can-do-that-too' response to DJI.\"", "output": "DJI has launched its first action camera posing a challenge to the market leader GoPro.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Chris PageBBC News NI Some Assembly members leave Stormont mid-term for a variety of reasons, and their party selects the successor. A total of 22 current MLAs had their first taste of Stormont through a co-option - one fifth of the 108-member assembly. These include some high-profile MLAs, like the DUP's junior minister Jonathan Bell and Sinn F\u00e9in's Health Committee chair Maeve McLaughlin. 'Quite cynical' Fearghal McKinney of the SDLP, the UUP's Danny Kinahan and Chris Lyttle from the Alliance Party also first arrived at Stormont by being co-opted. Several co-optees have gone on to win a seat at an election - such as the DUP's Paul Givan and Sinn F\u00e9in's Raymond McCartney. But there have been 13 co-options since the present assembly term began in 2011. Nine of them have been Sinn F\u00e9in MLAs. This has mainly happened because the party has reshuffled its representatives to end \"double-jobbing\", where members held more than one elected post. However, Sinn F\u00e9in's latest co-option moves have been described by one academic as \"opportunistic, but quite cynical\". Alex Maskey, who has represented South Belfast since 2003, is moving back to represent his former constituency of West Belfast. He is replacing his Sinn F\u00e9in colleague Sue Ramsey, who recently stood down as an MLA due to health reasons. 'Chessboard pieces' Mr Maskey's seat in South Belfast is being taken by the former Lord Mayor of Belfast M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Muilleoir. Mr \u00d3 Muilleoir will also run for Sinn F\u00e9in in the Westminster election next May. Rick Wilford, professor of politics at Queen's University, Belfast, said: \"It's a cynical move by Sinn F\u00e9in to move the pieces on the chessboard. \"But it looks even more cynical because M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Muilleoir can't hold on to the assembly seat and the Westminster seat, should he be successful.\" But Sinn F\u00e9in denies it is exploiting the co-option system. 'Very unfair' Mr Maskey said: \"A co-option only allows a party to replace one representative with another, so there's no gain per se. Other parties have used the same methodology. \"Another side of the argument is that some people are elected as a member of a party. Then they leave the party, and they stay on as an independent, even though they weren't elected as an independent. I think that's very unfair.\" Mr Maskey added that he was \"very conscious\" that he has not been elected to West Belfast during the current assembly session. But he added: \"I did serve West Belfast as an elected representative for around 20 years. \"I feel the public in South Belfast will welcome M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Muilleoir. He topped the poll in his ward there in the local elections last year.\" On Monday at Stormont, Mr Maskey will officially become an MLA for West Belfast again and Mr \u00d3 Muilleoir will sign the members' register. 'Values' There is one recent co-optee who is not in a party. Independent Unionist Claire Sugden replaced David McClarty after he died in January of this year. She had worked for him, and Mr McClarty indicated in a letter that he wanted her to take his seat. Ms Sugden said it made sense. \"Should we put in place someone who is completely new to the whole process, or someone who can hit the ground running?\" she asked. \"There are very few things I and David McClarty disagreed about. \"I know the beliefs which got him elected, and I'm representing the values he believed in.\" 'Costs' Prof Wilford said that although he believes the co-option system has problems, it is difficult to see an alternative. \"We have to have a proportional system. One of the costs of that, with multi-member constituencies, is that it creates the opportunity for the rules to be fully exploited. \"Give politicians a tool, and invariably they will use it,\" he added. Co-option may be controversial sometimes, but there is no suggestion that anyone will opt to change the system.

Across the country, celebrating Trump supporters will toast his swearing-in with a drink while others will numb their nerves with booze. Around the world, alcohol will help with this historic transition. In north London, for instance, the Old Queens Head pub is throwing an Armageddon-themed party to mark the start of Donald Trump's presidency. But the man himself will not be boozing through his first hours as the most powerful politician in the world. In fact, he won't touch a drop of alcohol on Friday night or on any day of his presidency. \"I've never had a drink,\" Donald Trump told Fox News after his election last November. Unlike George W Bush, who was teetotal in office after giving up booze on his 40th birthday, Mr Trump has eschewed alcohol his whole life, making him a first among modern US presidents. The reason for Mr Trump's sobriety is because his adored older brother Freddie died of illness stemming from alcoholism at the age of 42. \"It was a very tough period of time,\" he said, that convinced him never to drink. \"If you don't start you're never going have a problem. If you do start you might have a problem. And it's a tough problem to stop,\" Mr Trump told Fox. What is fascinating is his view that one drink could spiral into addiction. He discussed his fear that he might have a gene that would make moderate drinking impossible. His approach to alcohol is also a window into a personality that appears to crave control over others. Mr Trump ordered his children to follow his example. Every day he would drum the message into them: No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. \"I've been very tough on my children with respect to drink,\" he said. So how do the teetotal presidents compare with those who enjoyed the pleasures of a drink? George W Bush went dry after years of heavy boozing and swapped a compulsion for drink for an obsession with fitness. Remembered largely for the invasion of Iraq, George W's foreign policy record might not be seen as the best advertisement for a teetotal presidency. Nor might the idealistic but muddled foreign policy of Jimmy Carter, another teetotal president. Life in the Carter White House was drearily dry and a chore for its more sociable visitors. Senator Ted Kennedy remembered arid evenings of earnest discussion. \"You'd arrive about 6.00 or 6.30pm, and the first thing you would be reminded of, in case you needed reminding, was that he and Rosalynn had removed all the liquor in the White House. No liquor was ever served during Jimmy Carter's term. He wanted no luxuries nor any sign of worldly living,\" Kennedy wrote. The moderate drinkers fare better. Franklin D Roosevelt frequently tops the list of America's greatest presidents, the commander-in-chief who defeated the Great Depression and led the US through World War Two. Throughout these turbulent years, FDR kept a martini close at hand and prized the rituals of cocktail hour, when he mixed stiff drinks for friends on his White House study desk. The conviviality of cocktail hour undoubtedly helped FDR unwind and briefly relieved the immense pressure he was under. John F Kennedy would occasionally sip a daiquiri but preferred women to wine and kept a clear head through the brinkmanship of the Cuban Missile Crisis. But other presidents were more reckless with their drinking. Lyndon Johnson was well known in Washington for his capacity to guzzle Cutty Sark whisky and soda when he was Democratic majority leader in the Senate, a habit he took to the White House. Johnson, who told his doctor after a heart attack that the only things he enjoyed in life were \"whisky, sunshine and sex\", enjoyed entertaining at his Texas ranch where the booze flowed. LBJ's special assistant for domestic affairs, Joseph A Califano, remembered a ride around the ranch with the president: \"As we drove around we were followed by a car and a station wagon with Secret Service agents. The president drank Cutty Sark scotch and soda out of a large, white, plastic foam cup. \"Periodically, Johnson would slow down and hold his left arm outside the car, shaking the cup and ice. A Secret Service agent would run up to the car, take the cup and go back to the station wagon. There another agent would refill it with ice, scotch and soda as the first agent trotted behind the wagon.\" But the most disturbing picture of presidential drinking is provided by Richard Nixon, a man prone to morose self-pity who medicated his moods with booze. According to his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, Nixon's trouble was that a small amount of drink would set him off and late-night threats of military action were made when the president was the worse for wear. When North Korea shot down a US spy plane in April 1969, an enraged Nixon allegedly ordered a tactical nuclear strike and told the joint chiefs to recommend targets. According to the historian Anthony Summers, citing the CIA's top Vietnam specialist at the time, George Carver, Henry Kissinger spoke to military commanders on the phone and agreed not to do anything until Nixon sobered up in the morning. By the early 1970s, Watergate was beginning to choke Nixon's presidency and the president was relying more on drink and sleeping pills to cope with the pressure. On the evening of 11 October 1973, he was incapable of speaking to the British Prime Minister Edward Heath on the phone. Heath was keen to discuss the latest developments of the Arab-Israeli War but a transcript of the conversation between Henry Kissinger and his assistant Brent Scowcroft revealed the president was too drunk to talk to the prime minister. Richard Nixon was a warning to future presidents on the danger of mixing hubris with drink. He is a reminder too of the awesome executive power a US president has when it comes to conducting foreign affairs. With no previous political or military experience, Donald Trump is unlike any incoming president. His hubris is clear to all and his (sober) stream of excitable tweets prove an impetuous temperament. Nixon's example might make us grateful booze is not in the mix too.

Problems at Melbury Lodge, which treats people with severe mental health problems, have been known about for years but it is only in recent weeks - following a Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection - that remedial action has been taken. The revelations come as the chair of Southern Health announced his resignation and ahead of a CQC report to be published on Friday. Southern Health said managing the risks posed by patients was difficult. Staffing problems Of the 12 Melbury Lodge patients who managed to gain access to the roof and jump off it over the past five years, two did so in the last six months. Neither of those two men died, but one was seriously injured. Patients at Melbury Lodge, many of whom are detained for the safety of themselves or others, have been accessing the roof or absconding from the unit for years as a combination of staffing problems and the physical layout of the building has led to repeated problems. Work is now under way to secure the building after the CQC demanded improvements following the inspection earlier this year. The patient who is currently missing was sectioned under the Mental Health Act but managed to escape and flee to France. He was discovered by police and brought back to Melbury Lodge in Winchester - only to escape again. 'Blame culture' Concerns about Southern Health's ability to improve patient services across the trust were first raised by the regulator in 2011, according to a letter seen by BBC News. Monitor, the precursor to NHS Improvement, hauled the management and board of Southern Health to London over concerns that the trust \"may not have the leadership and management expertise within its mental health services\" to make sufficient improvements while ensuring safe and effective services. Around the same time, one director wrote to the board and management expressing concern that a \"blame culture\" was developing at the trust, quoting staff as feeling that: \"We are reverting to carrot and stick in style and that you're either in the tent or outside.\" The trust is under intense scrutiny after an official investigation found it had failed to investigate hundreds of unexpected deaths. The CQC issued a warning notice last month and an external director has been placed at the trust by NHS Improvement. The full CQC report is expected to severely criticise the leadership of the trust. An official review of deaths at the trust published before Christmas blamed leadership and governance failures for the problems. 'Continuous learning' Despite mounting pressure from dozens of families, and the extent of failings at Southern Health, chief executive Katrina Percy has refused to resign. It's understood she continues to have the support of both NHS England and NHS Improvement. In a statement to BBC News, Southern Health said: \"At all our units there is a balance to be struck between providing effective security and a therapeutic environment for our service users. \"Our staff are the most important safety feature we have, and they assess any risks associated with the building alongside understanding the risks associated with individual patients. \"These daily decisions are very challenging and occasionally we may not get it right, which is why continuous learning is so vital to how we operate.\" On the issues identified in the internal documents, the trust said: \"A culture of blame or 'carrot and stick' is not one that we recognise in our organisation.\"", "output": "Ahead of a report into scandal-hit Southern Health, the BBC has uncovered new failings at the mental health trust.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The round wooden structure has been built at the Cors Dyfi nature reserve near Machynlleth, Powys, with help of nearly \u00a31.4m worth of grants.

The move follows a March report by the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) that found ice posed the highest risk to communities of any illegal substance. PM Tony Abbott said use of the drug was a growing problem around Australia. \"As a citizen and as a parent I am appalled at what is happening on our streets and in our homes,\" Mr Abbott said at a press conference on Wednesday. \"Ice is far more addictive than any other illicit drug. It does far more damage than any other illicit drug,\" he said. \"The propensity for violence, the propensity to subsequent, very serious mental illness, the propensity to disfigurement which ice produces means that this is a drug epidemic way beyond anything that we have seen before now.\" High price According to a 2013 National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 7% of the Australian population aged 14 years or older have reported using amphetamine or methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. In the same survey, 2.1% reported recent use. These figures remain unchanged from those reported in 2010. The reported use of powder methamphetamine fell significantly between 2010 and 2013 but the reported use of ice more than doubled. People are also using ice more frequently, with many people using it daily or weekly. The crime commission report found that the purity of the drug available in Australia had increased over the past few years, making it even more dangerous. It said the price of crystal meth in Australia was among the highest in the world, driving the country's organised crime gangs to trade increasingly in the drug. More than 60% of Australia's major organised crime figures now deal in crystal meth. It said that, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the average street price per gram of methamphetamine in China is $80 (A$105, \u00a354), whereas in Australia it is $500.

Samsung said it intended to appeal. There has been speculation that the news could encourage handset makers to install the rival Windows Phone system. Google released its statement late on Sunday in the US. \"The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims,\" it said. \"Most of these don't relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the US Patent Office. \"The mobile industry is moving fast and all players - including newcomers - are building upon ideas that have been around for decades. We continue to work with our partners to give consumers innovative and affordable products, and we don't want anything to limit that.\" Apple v Android Apple has indicated it will seek sales bans on eight of the phones at the heart of the lawsuit at a hearing on 20 September. The models include the Galaxy S 4G, Galaxy S2 AT&T model, Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, Galaxy S2 T-Mobile model, Galaxy S2 Epic 4G, Galaxy S Showcase, Droid Charge and Galaxy Prevail. The list does not include Samsung's current flagship handset, the Galaxy S3, which was not involved in the case. However, Apple could now also try to use the verdict to try to halt sales of other Android-based models it believes infringe its patents. There has been speculation this could work to Microsoft's advantage. During the patents court case Apple revealed it had licensed some of its technologies to Microsoft. Its lawyers also showed pictures of Nokia's Lumia - which runs Windows Phone 7 - as an example of a handset that looked distinctive from its own. In contrast, Apple continues to be involved in lawsuits against two other Android-handset makers: Motorola - which is owned by Google - and HTC. Microsoft's opportunity Following the Samsung verdict, Bill Cox, marketing director for Microsoft's Windows Phone Division tweeted: \"Windows Phone is looking gooooood right now.\" Dell, HTC, Samsung, LG and ZTE have already created Windows Phone 7 devices, but only Nokia has concentrated its efforts on the system. One analyst said that the US ruling presented Microsoft with an opportunity to convince others to put their weight behind the next version of its mobile system. \"I think this will force a reset on Android products as they are re-engineered to get around Apple's patents,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the tech consultancy Enderle Group. \"[It should also] provide a stronger opportunity for both of Microsoft's new platforms - Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 - because they come with indemnification against Apple, suddenly making them far safer.\" However, manufacturers will have to weigh up Android's popularity before making a move. Cross-licensing According to recent data from analysts at IDC, Android had a 68.1% of the global smartphone market between April and June. Apple's iOS had 16.9% and Windows Phone/Windows Mobile had 5.4%. The data was based on shipments rather than sales. In case Apple's patents hold up under appeal, Google could recode Android to ensure there was no potential infringement, or handset makers could seek to pay their rival a licence fee. And there is another alternative: Apple could ultimately seek a patent cross-licensing deal with Google despite its late chief executive Steve Jobs' vow to \"destroy Android\". Part-way through the Samsung case, Google filed its first lawsuit versus Apple since taking over Motorola. It alleged seven patent infringements, one of which involves the technology used in the iPhone's Siri voice-activated search tool. Were Google to succeed it could call for a import ban on Apple's iOS products, potentially forcing its rival into a deal. The case is driving share prices in related technology stocks. Samsung's shares fell 7.5% in Seoul on Monday - their biggest drop since October 2008, wiping about $12bn off the companies value. Nokia's shares closed 7.7% higher on the Helsinki Stock Exchange.

A number of top Republican senators have called on 70-year-old Mr Moore to step aside following claims he molested or harassed teenage girls as young as 14 while he was in his 30s.

It supports predictions that a changing climate could damage global production of coffee - the world's second most traded commodity after oil. Wild Arabica is important for the sustainability of the coffee industry because of its genetic diversity. Arabica coffee and Robusta coffee are the two main species used commercially, although the former provides about 70% of production. The Arabica crops grown in the world's coffee plantations are from very limited genetic stock and are thought to lack the flexibility to cope with climate change and other threats such as pests and diseases. The researchers from the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, UK, and the Environment and Coffee Forest Forum (ECFF) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, examined the future distribution of wild Arabica using climate modelling. They looked at how wild Arabica might be affected under three different carbon emission scenarios and over three time intervals (2020, 2050 and 2080). When the researchers looked at what would happen in the locations where Arabica was currently grown, the best-case outcome was a 65% reduction in suitable sites by 2080. The worst-case outcome was a 99.7% reduction by 2080. A different analytical approach yielded a 38% reduction as the most favourable outcome and a 90% reduction as the least favourable by 2080. Cause for concern Aaron Davis, head of coffee research at the Royal Botanic Gardens, said: \"The extinction of Arabica coffee is a startling and worrying prospect. However, the objective of the study was not to provide scaremonger predictions for the demise of Arabica in the wild. \"The scale of the predictions is certainly cause for concern, but should be seen more as a baseline, from which we can more fully assess what actions are required.\" The researchers said the results should be regarded as \"conservative\", because the modelling does not factor in the large-scale deforestation that has occurred in the highland forests of Ethiopia and South Sudan (the natural home of Arabica coffee). Moreover, because of the lack of suitable data, the models assumed intact natural vegetation, whereas the highland forests of Ethiopia and South Sudan are highly fragmented due to deforestation. Ethiopia remains a big producer of the Arabica variety, but Brazil and Colombia are now the two largest countries for commercial Arabica growing.

It is only the second time Mr Trump has used his presidential veto since he took office in 2017. Opposition in Congress to his policy on Yemen grew last year after Saudi agents killed the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The resolution passed the House of Representatives in April and the Senate in March, the first time both chambers had supported a War Powers resolution, which limits the president's ability to send troops into action. \"This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,\" Mr Trump said in the veto message. The House Speaker, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, was among those to condemn President Trump for the move. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in March 2015, when the rebel Houthi movement seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by regional Shia power Iran, Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states began an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government. The US has provided billions of dollars of weapons and intelligence to the coalition. The UN says at least 7,000 civilians have been killed in the country, with 65% of the deaths attributed to air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition. US senators have accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of ordering the murder of Mr Khashoggi, but Saudi prosecutors have insisted it was a \"rogue operation\" and that the agents were not acting on his orders.

He told the leaders that the US did not \"want anybody interfering in their country\", and asked them to protect US troops in Iraq. The visit came days after the US deployed an aircraft carrier, USS Abraham Lincoln, to the region. Officials said the deployment was in response to threats to US forces and its allies from Iran. On Tuesday it was revealed the US was sending B-52 bombers. The US has given little information about the exact nature of the reported threat, which Iran has dismissed as nonsense. John Bolton, the US national security adviser, said only that the US was acting \"in response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\" on announcing the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln on Sunday. Mr Pompeo is also due to visit London on Wednesday, where he is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Theresa May and British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Why was Mike Pompeo in Iraq? While in Baghdad, the US secretary of state met the Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi and President Barham Salih, and explained the US's security concerns to them. He also asked them to protect US troops and citizens in the country. Mr Pompeo later said that the leaders \"provided assurances that they understood that was their responsibility\". \"We wanted them to know about the increased threat stream that we had seen, to give them a little bit more background so that they would have enough information that they could ensure that they were doing all that they could to provide protection for our team,\" he said. \"They understood, too, it's important for their country. We don't want anybody interfering in their country, certainly not by attacking another nation inside of Iraq, and there was complete agreement.\" Speaking to reporters after the meeting, he also directly linked the visit to the recent escalation with Iran, which neighbours Iraq. Mr Pompeo said that he wanted to \"speak with the leadership there [in Iraq], to assure them that we stood ready to continue to ensure that Iraq is a sovereign, independent nation\". He also said that he wanted to help them become less dependent on energy deals with Iran. Why is the US sending bombers to the region? Acting Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers said in a statement that the US did \"not seek war with the Iranian regime, but we will defend US personnel, our allies and our interests in the region\". \"The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force are considered a prudent step in response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests,\" he added. Officials first announced that the aircraft carrier was being sent to the Gulf on Sunday. Mr Bolton said at the time that it was to send \"a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interest or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force\". What has Iran said? In response, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted that \"the #B_Team is at it again\". \"From announcements of naval movements (that actually occurred last month) to dire warnings about so-called 'Iranian threats',\" he added. \"If US and clients don't feel safe, it's because they're despised by the people of the region - blaming Iran won't reverse that.\" Iran's state-run broadcaster Press TV also dismissed the deployment as \"a 'regularly scheduled' one by the US Navy, and Bolton has just tried to talk it up\". Why is there so much hostility between Iran and the US? Tensions between the US and Iran can be traced back to Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the pro-Western Shah and established a radical anti-US regime in its place. But relations have been particularly fraught between the two nations since President Trump took office in 2017. This most recent escalation comes on the eve of the anniversary of Mr Trump unilaterally withdrawing from a landmark nuclear deal the US and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015. Under the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for relief from sanctions - sanctions that have since been reinstated. And last month, the White House said it would end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil. At the same time the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group. The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a \"new deal\" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its \"malign behaviour\" across the Middle East. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests.

It estimates each will receive a payment of about \u00a350. It has also set up a \u00a31m customer compensation fund for customers who believe they have been mis-sold to. Scottish Power said the failings identified had now all been rectified. It stopped doorstep sales in 2011 and has also put in place independent checks on the conduct of its telephone agents. Ofgem said the size of the fine reflected Scottish Power's cooperation during the investigation. \"Ofgem's investigation found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers,\" the energy regulator said in a statement. Scottish Power said it would write to the 336,000 people who could have been affected and could be in line for compensation. \"We accept Ofgem's findings and we apologize unreservedly to those customers affected,\" said Neil Clitheroe, of Scottish Power. \"This arose as a result of new regulations which were introduced in 2009. I am sorry to say that we didn't implement these properly at that time. \"However, I am pleased that Ofgem has made it clear that they found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers. \"Since 2011 we have taken determined steps to resolve the problem: doorstep selling was stopped; and all telephone sales staff are properly trained and monitored.\" Scottish Power is not the only energy supplier to have been in trouble with the regulator over doorstep selling.

Ofgem says the changes are aimed at ensuring customers get the best energy deal for them. \"Ofgem is going to make it easier for consumers to 'vote with their feet'\", said Ofgem chief executive Andrew Wright. The rules are part of a series of reforms, relating to new standards of conduct for energy firms. \"Our reforms seek to give consumers the tools they need to find the best energy deal for them,\" added Mr Wright.

Amika George, founder of the #FreePeriods campaign, called the latest move \"fantastic news\". Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said: \"No-one should be held back from reaching their potential\". When Mr Hammond made the original announcement in his Spring Statement last month campaigners argued that it should also include primary schools. \"We're so glad that the government has extended this pledge to primary schools,\" said Ms George, 19, a student at Cambridge University. \"Period poverty should never be a barrier to education.\" The next tampon She said it meant that every student could go to school without \"worrying where their next pad or tampon will come from\" and could \"fully participate in lessons and focus in class\". Ms George began campaigning two years ago, while still at school, after reading about period poverty in the news. She described herself at the time as \"shocked\" to find out girls were missing school because of not having sanitary products. The campaign began with a petition and a protest outside Downing Street and this year Ms George helped spearhead a legal campaign, in conjunction with the Red Box Project and The Pink Protest. Girlguiding says its own research has suggested almost a third of 11 to 21-year-old girls and young women have missed school or college because of their period. Isla, also 19, and a member of Girlguiding's panel of advocates, called the figures \"unacceptable\", adding that \"giving primary school girls access to tampons and pads will help break the taboo of periods from a young age\". A Department for Education spokesman said officials would begin talking to school and college leaders on the quantities of sanitary products likely to be needed from early next year, and how best to deliver them. He said they were likely to be bought in bulk and distributed locally.

Mr Alder, a former Parachute Regiment soldier, died in Queens Gardens police station while handcuffed and lying face down and unconscious in a pool of blood.

The competition is powered by Apple's former partner Google, whose Android operating system for smartphones is rapidly gaining marketshare. Mobile phonemakers, long suffering under Apple's smartphone dominance, have embraced Android with gusto and are jostling to add software and hardware touches that trump Apple's offering. The iPhone rivals Samsung's Galaxy S II, for example, is already slimmer and lighter than both the old iPhone 4 and the new 4S and arguably has a better screen. Taiwanese competitor HTC, meanwhile, hopes that a clever user interface dubbed HTC Sense will help it to beat Apple. Instead of the iPhone's static icons, HTC has improved Android to offer a raft of rich, dynamic widgets that bring information and functionality directly to the smartphone screen. HTC's Sensation, for example, is currently hard to best in terms of ease of use, not just when compared to the new iPhone but Android rivals as well. For its top-end phones HTC also throws in a free service that allows owners to track and remotely manage their phones, probably one of the reasons why Apple recently stopped charging for a similar service. Android has even allowed Sony Ericsson to get back into the game. For several years the company and its lacklustre range of phones have been losing market share; now the company is back with the Android-based Xperia Arc S - a well-built and user-friendly phone that can compete with most rivals. Apple also lags in terms of hardware innovation, with several competitors pushing phones that sport 3D cameras and glasses-free 3D screens - like the Sharp 3D Aquos, the HTC Evo 3D and the LG Optimus 3D. Google is also constantly updating Android, and provides the software free to manufacturers. This is not charitable behaviour, of course. Google search is deeply integrated into Android phones, providing healthy profits from clicks on sponsored search results (although a few network operators have begun to point customers to different search engines). The rise of Android The rise and rise of Android is reflected in the market share. According to research firm Gartner, during the second quarter of 2011 Android captured a massive 43.4% of the global smartphone market - up from 17.2% just a year ago. In contrast, Apple's iPhone software iOS gained just four percentage points to 18.2% - mainly by entering 15 new countries and signing up 42 new network operators to sell the iPhone. The big losers are Nokia's Symbian smartphones, Blackberry maker RIM - and Microsoft who is struggling to gain traction for its new mobile operating system Windows Phone 7. Advantage Apple Despite Android's advances, Apple still dominates the \"mindshare\" of the smartphone market. This is less a function of the many Apple fans amongst tech journalists. It's more a question of first-mover advantage and, most importantly, branding. Dozens of manufacturers are now selling numerous Android phones, ranging from the cheap and cheerful to the high end of the market. Apple and its network partners can focus all marketing around a single brand and - now - two devices. No wonder that the iPhone is still seen by many as the benchmark against which other smartphones have to be measured - even though the new iPhone 4S has arguably failed to raise this benchmark in a significant manner. Some of the new features on the 4S have been standard on Android phones for many months. The lack of a big \"and one more thing\" unveiling by Apple's new chief executive will have been greeted with loud sighs of relief by rivals. Still, any move by Apple creates headaches for competitors. Internal documents of a mobile phone maker seen by the BBC last week showed how worried this company was that an iPhone 5 could steal all attention from the forthcoming launch of its top-end Android smartphone. Microsoft, meanwhile... Amidst all the Android and iPhone frenzy, spare a thought for Microsoft. A year ago and to considerable acclaim the software giant launched an all-new mobile phone software, Windows Phone 7. The operating system broke new ground in terms of usability, with a fresh look and many clever little features that neither Google's nor Apple's developers had thought of. Considering this was version one of the software, it was surprisingly polished. So far, Microsoft has had little commercial success in return for its efforts. But Microsoft hopes that it can still challenge both Android and iPhone. After ironing out a few software wrinkles it has just launched Windows Phone 7.5, also known as Mango. It's a compelling offering. The software delivers a deep integration with social networks like no other phone. Short messages exchanged with a friend - whether on SMS, Facebook or Twitter - will show up in one thread chronicling the conversation, regardless of which service was used. A contact stored on the phone shows not just address and phone number but the most recent Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn status updates too. And the diary is easier to use than any other. However, Microsoft's fresh assault on the smartphone market is slow out of the starting blocks. Mango was presented to the public many months ago. A few handset makers have announced a handful of new Windows phones. The first HTC phones running Mango are only now - slowly - arriving in the shops. Microsoft's new best friend, struggling Finnish phone company Nokia, won't launch its first Windows phone before 26 October, at Nokia World in London. Apple, in contrast, is set to bring the iPhone 4S to market in less than two weeks. The ecosystem As operating systems and mobile phone makers jostle for position (don't forget RIM's Blackberry, about to roll out a range of handsets with a new operating system) it may be neither clever software nor stunning hardware that decides who will win the smartphone war. The clincher will be the services connected to smartphones.

To overcome her condition she used treatment developed in the US where flashing lights and other stimulants help patients deal with images that have stayed with them. While serving with the RAF, Ms Horton was responsible for dealing with the bodies of six members of the Royal Military Police who were murdered at a police station in the south-eastern town of Amara. Traumatic memories Recalling the experience, Ms Horton said: \"The whole day had been horrific from the beginning and then in the afternoon I hear that I'm to receive the bodies of these gentleman. \"The sight was so horrific, that I stood alone for a while with them because I couldn't bear the nurses to see them. I struggled for some while, trying to make the site so that we could cope with it as a team.\" Ms Horton and her fellow nurses had to care for the soldiers before their bodies were taken to Basra hospital. A year later, while working as an occupational health nurse back in the UK, she began to suffer flashbacks. Five years later, she was diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress disorder and referred to St Georges Hospital in Stafford. The treatment that helped Ms Horton is called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and helps people to process traumatic memories. 'This is bonkers' It is a form of psychotherapy that includes eight phases of treatment and involves focussing on a moving image while thinking about a painful memory. It helps the patient to process the difficult emotion. Ms Horton said: \"When I first saw the flashing light, and the vibrating things in my hands, I thought 'this is bonkers - how is this going to help me?' \"I went into it with enthusiasm, realising that I was quite ill psychologically.\" The therapy sessions with Dr Shirley Timpson, consultant psychologist at St George's Hospital, were initially \"difficult and very painful\", but they helped Ms Horton to develop memories instead of nightmares. She said: \"The combination of the focussing on the lights seemed to do something to my brain, because although I could still see the four walls in the room and Dr Timpson, very realistically my mind and my thoughts were back in Iraq and it was important that we identified trigger points and talked through them. \"Interestingly, I was able to remember some of the funny and happy times.\" Dr Timson said: \"We process things during rapid eye movement sleep and when we dream, so we process what we experience on a daily basis. \"If something is too emotionally charged, too traumatic, we can fail to process and therefore, what EMDR does is try to emulate what happens during the natural process during sleep.\" She feels that there are other servicemen and women, and people in the emergency services, who do not like to ask for help because they believe they are just doing their job.

He is a pacifist who has spent much of his career speaking out against British military intervention in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was, until recently, chairman of the \"Stop the War Coalition\". But as Labour leader he is now having to accommodate the views of others, and even moderate his own; he now says he will wear a red poppy, as opposed to a white one on Remembrance Sunday. On matters of key defence policy though he is still at odds with much of his party. He is no fan of the Nato alliance or of the current military strategy to defeat so-called Islamic State. He has suggested he will not support expanding UK military air-strikes to Syria. On both these issues there appears to be room for compromise. The Labour leader is, so far, not imposing his will on others. That will prove harder when it comes to the vote, next year, on renewing Britain's nuclear deterrent. Jeremy Corbyn, a former leading light in CND, is opposed in principle to replacing Trident. Many in his party worry that position will be their undoing - just as it was for Michael Foot in 1983. Environment: By BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin Beard, sandals, pacifism, vegetarianism\u2026 Jeremy Corbyn would look at home in the Green Party. In fact, he is frank about the need for Labour to attract environmentalists to help it back to Downing Street. Corbyn's views sit happily with what used to be called red/green politics. He distrusts nuclear. He instinctively dislikes corporations, fears the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (trade negotiations between the US and EU) and says Conservatives have allowed unsustainable exploitation of resources and people by protecting the interests of a rich few. He yearns for an energy system powered by renewables owned by communities, as many are in Germany. He would ban fracking. He wants a massive programme of home insulation to end fuel poverty and says new homes should be able to generate their own power. He wants children to connect with the countryside. Under Ed Miliband's leadership Labour sometimes seemed reticent of taking a strong environmentalist line, but this is already changing. Among Corbyn's team are Lisa Nandy (energy) and Kerry McCarthy (environment) and both have made strong speeches on climate. One big question: how far will the green love affair go? Some Greens would like an electoral pact. That would be a big move indeed for both parties. Housing: By BBC Home Editor Mark Easton Labour describes housing as its \"top domestic policy\" and, with the government's controversial Housing Bill due for debate later this year, the party leadership says the issue is its \"top legislative priority\" too. Labour has no formal policy position on housing as yet, but both Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow housing minister, John Healey, are known to favour a major state-funded building programme. A figure of 100,000 \"council houses\" a year by 2020 is being talked about, a return to the level of government house-building not seen since the 1950s and 60s. Labour sources tell me that increasing the supply of social homes, with rent levels below \"affordable housing\" and the private rented sector, construction costs can be recouped from the savings made in the housing benefit bill. It sees housing as a policy area in which it can mark out a radically different approach from the Conservatives. While the Tories enjoy much greater support than Labour among older home-owners, the Corbyn opposition look to be courting Generation Rent. Health: By BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle Compared to some areas, the Labour leader's approach to the NHS might be less radical. After all, it's a nationalised sector that already attracts significant amounts of public funding. Saying that, it's widely seen in the party as a weak spot for the government. Despite promises to increase the budget demand is rising so quickly that performance is suffering in many parts of the NHS - so expect to hear Mr Corbyn and his shadow health secretary trying to make political capital out of that. He has already spoken out against the involvement of the private sector in the NHS and floated the idea of a need to bail out trusts struggling to pay their PFI bills (accrued from using private money to redevelop hospital buildings). There are also likely to be some headlines - indeed there already have been - about his leaning towards homeopathy, which is only rarely available on the NHS because of a lack of evidence it works. Education: By BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan Education policy under Jeremy Corbyn will be expected to be more old school than new Labour. There have been signals that academies, created in the Blair years and rapidly expanded under the coalition government, would be brought back into England's local authority education systems. It would be a symbolic departure from two decades of Labour modernisers. While Ed Miliband's Labour promised to cut tuition fees to \u00a36,000, Mr Corbyn would go further and scrap them altogether and reintroduce maintenance grants. And Mr Corbyn has proposed a National Education Service that can help people improve their skills throughout their lives. The resurgent left will have a long shopping list of expectations on topics such as free schools, grammars, independent schools, tests, academy trusts, admissions, school autonomy, league tables, teachers' pay and Ofsted. But will there really be a return to old Labour and old battles? Or will Mr Corbyn want a new kind of education policy for his version of new politics? Transport: By BBC transport correspondent Russell Hotten Transport will be central to Labour's policy programme. Jeremy Corbyn wants to use it to \"stimulate the economy by increasing investment in new high speed rail, creating jobs and connecting more town and cities\". He plans to re-nationalise the railways \"line by line\", a proposal which seems to have a measure of support in the country. But details of how to re-nationalise, compensation, and investment have still to be worked out. That will be the job of Lilian Greenwood, Labour's new shadow transport secretary. The former shadow rail minister has been a strong critic of government rail policy, and is expected to support moves to decentralise more powers over transport to the regions. Where does this leave the huge high-speed rail project, HS2, linking London with the Midlands and North of England? Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell voted against the legislation paving the way for the line, but the issue of whether to continue or cut the rail link is now under review. On that other great infrastructure project, a third Heathrow Airport runway, Labour's leader was pretty clear in the Financial Times last month, saying: \"I'd vote against it in this Parliament.\" There are, though, plenty of Labour MPs who support Heathrow expansion. Mr Corbyn has also promised to encourage cycling; a keen two-wheeler, he extols its benefits for health and the environment. Benefits and tax: By BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, come into this conference with the clear intention to fight welfare cuts and shift more of the burden for dealing with the deficit onto companies and the rich. The new leadership has come out solidly against the benefit cap, while others on the shadow front bench say the party should be opposing the lowering of the cap to \u00a320,000 a year per household (\u00a323,000 in London), rather than campaigning against the principle of a cap. Corbyn's Labour would bring in higher income tax for the wealthy - not to 60%, it now appears, but there is still a debate to be had over whether a return to 50% would be right. Then there is tax on the City. The European tax on financial transactions - the so-called Robin Hood tax - is firmly favoured by the new leader. But Sadiq Khan, Labour's candidate for London mayor, is opposed to additional taxes on business. One thing they can happily agree on is that tax avoiders should be made to pay up. John McDonnell believes there is \u00a3120bn to be gained. Get that and the other problems might wither away. Foreign policy and Europe: By BBC correspondent Bridget Kendall Not everyone on Labour's shadow front bench shares their new leader's positions, and Mr Corbyn is ambiguous on some issues. But overall he says the country needs a \"radically different foreign policy\". His position on whether to stay in Europe or leave was not initially clear. He said he had mixed feelings, though he later clarified he would campaign for an \"in\" vote. He is opposed to the EU's planned TTIP trade deal with the US and says Britain should push for better working and social conditions. Mr Corbyn is opposed to \"military interventions\" on principle, including the \"disaster\" of the 2003 Iraq invasion. He says he will oppose any new vote in Parliament for airstrikes in Syria. Instead of military options, he argues the UK should use political tools and focus on reducing inequality. Hence his opposition to Nato membership or increasing defence spending - and his call to \"talk to everyone\", even groups prepared to use violence, like Hamas and Hezbollah. On Russia, the Labour leader argues the eastward expansion of Nato is also to blame for the Ukraine crisis, as well as Russia's violation of Ukrainians' sovereignty by taking over Crimea. Argentina has welcomed his suggestion that the UK should think of sharing sovereignty of the Falklands. And at odds with previous Labour leaders, he supports the idea of a united Ireland, a stand described by Unionists as \"unhelpful\".", "output": "What direction will Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party take?

The parade in the south Tyrone village of Augher had Orangemen getting in the mood for the forthcoming Open golf championship being played at Portrush on the north coast. The \"Orange Golf Open\" saw members competing in a \"nearest the pin\" competition. The weather in Northern Ireland on Friday was dry but at times cloudy, with a few showers mainly in the north. Brighter spells developed towards the southeast and parts of the east coast. Temperatures ranged from 15C or 16C on the north coast to 18C or 19C in more sheltered parts of the south. The Orange Order was formed near Loughgall in County Armagh in 1795, when its founding members pledged their loyalty to the royal family and swore to defend the Protestant faith. Senior Orangeman Edward Stevenson said the parades were a custom that had been handed down for over 200 years. \"Surely there is no other event on these islands that can bring such vast numbers of people onto the streets to enjoy our processions, either by taking part or simply to watch them go by,\" the grand master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland said. While the Twelfth is the traditional pinnacle of the marching season, thousands of people have already enjoyed one of the annual pre-Twelfth highlights. The sun shone brightly at the parade at the seaside village of Rossnowlagh in County Donegal on Saturday. Orange Order members from both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland took part in the march, which is traditionally held a few days before the main Twelfth of July events. About 50 lodges from counties Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan, as well as the host county of Donegal were on parade.

Gates told the court on Monday that Mr Manafort ordered him to commit fraud. This is the first criminal trial to come from the Department of Justice-led inquiry into alleged Russian meddling. Mr Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and tax fraud. Gates, 46, struck a plea deal with prosecutors in February, admitting two charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI. The case arises from the pair's consultancy work for Russian-backed Ukrainian politicians. Sex, lies and taxes Mr Manafort's legal team sought to undercut Gates' credibility on Tuesday, day six of the trial. Defence attorney Kevin Downing asked about the witness's co-operation with special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. \"After all the lies you told you expect this jury to believe you?\" Mr Downing asked Gates. \"I'm here to tell the truth,\" the witness replied. \"Mr Manafort had the same path. I'm here.\" The defence lawyer pointed out Gates had lied to investigators before entering his guilty plea. \"Have they confronted you with so many lies that you can't remember?\" Mr Downing added. The defence lawyer also pressed Gates on his adultery. \"There was another Richard Gates, isn't that right?\" Mr Downing asked. \"A secret Richard Gates?\" The witness responded that he had had an extramarital affair over 10 years ago. Gates acknowledged keeping a flat in London for two months during those trysts, and listing luxury hotels as a business expense. He also said he had possibly submitted personal expenses to President Donald Trump's inaugural committee for his work on the election campaign. And he conceded he had penned a fraudulent letter to prospective investors for a movie project. One text exchange drew laughter from the court when a message was read out revealing Mr Manafort's dismay at his high tax rate. Beginning with an expletive, he wrote: \"You told me you were on top of this... This is a disaster.\" What's the background? The two former business partners were indicted last October for hiding millions of dollars they made lobbying for Russian-backed Ukrainian politicians. The charges relating to the pair's political consulting largely predate the Trump 2016 election campaign they worked on together. Gates told the Alexandria, Virginia, court on Monday he was helping prosecutors in the hope of leniency. Gates still faces up to six years in prison under the terms of his plea deal. He has avoided all eye contact with Mr Manafort in his two days of testimony, according to reporters in court. Key background 'There's tears in your eyes' Tensions are running high in the courtroom, and not just on the witness stand. On Monday the judge accused the prosecutor of getting weepy as the pair argued, according to a court transcript. The dispute began as Judge TS Ellis told Greg Andres his line of questioning was not relevant. \"Look at me when you're talking to me,\" the judge reprimanded Mr Andres, out of earshot of the jury. The prosecutor protested that he did not \"want to get in trouble for some facial expression\". Judge Ellis said: \"There's tears in your eyes right now.\" Mr Andres denied it. \"Well, they're watery,\" Judge Ellis said. \"Look, I want you to focus sharply on what you need to prove - to prove the crime. \"And I don't understand what a lot of these questions have to do with it.\"", "output": "Ex-Trump aide Paul Manafort's lawyer has told a court his deputy led a \"secret life\" and told so many lies he could not keep track of them all.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Desmond Codona, 59, who has terminal cancer, was able to marry Christine Meaney, 60, at their home in Middlesbrough two days after contacting registrars.

Lord Prior said the IRA had tried to kill him.

The data also highlights 833 probable suicides - a small increase (6%) for a second year in a row. And a total of 2,726 accidental deaths were recorded, a rise of 8.5%, with the majority caused by accidental poisonings or falls. Pete Whitehouse, director of statistical services, welcomed the \"notable\" fall in the alcohol-specific deaths but said it was too early to tell if it can be maintained. Minimum unit pricing He said: \"Since our records began in 1979, there have only been three other occasions where we have seen a reduction in the number of alcohol-specific deaths of around 10% or more in a single year. \"However, although an annual decrease of this magnitude is notable, further data will be required to see if this reduction continues and whether we will see a sustained shift in alcohol-specific deaths in Scotland.\" Alcohol-specific deaths are those which are known to be a direct consequence of alcohol misuse, while alcohol-related deaths includes those which are only partially caused by abuse of alcohol. The drop in alcohol-specific deaths in Scotland is the first substantial decrease in that category since 2012. It follows the introduction of minimum unit pricing by the Scottish government in May 2018 a bid to cut consumption and save lives. In January it emerged the amount of alcohol sold in Scotland's shops fell during the first year of minimum pricing but sales increased south of the border. The NRS report also recorded the second successive annual increase in the suicide figures, following a downward trend since the early 2000s. And the data shows that, after adjusting for age, the death rate for people in the most deprived areas was 1.9 times that of those in the least deprived areas. This gap has gradually increased over time from a ratio of 1.6 in 2000. The 2020 annual report will include data from first 10 months of the Covid pandemic, which some experts fear will be responsible for an increase in alcohol abuse and suicides. Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, described the figures as \"very encouraging\". \"The evidence from the evaluation of minimum unit pricing so far has shown that it is having the intended effect on alcohol consumption, and now it looks like we may be beginning to see this translate into health benefits.\" She called for the 50p minimum price to be reviewed as it is likely to have been \"eroded due to inflation\" since MSPs passed the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act in 2012. 'Hidden in plain sight' Scottish Families Affected by Alcohol and Drugs said the new statistics meant more than 10,784 alcohol deaths had now been recorded between 2010 and 2019. Chief executive officer Justina Murray said: \"Scotland's ongoing unhealthy relationship with alcohol means that alcohol harm and alcohol deaths are hidden in plain sight. Last year, a report found Scotland has the highest rate of alcohol-specific deaths in the UK although rates have improved significantly in the past two decades. Meanwhile, the NRS figures show that men accounted for nearly three quarters (74%) of probable suicides in 2019 and nearly a third (32%) of the total were aged between 45 and 59. National Suicide Prevention Leadership Group chairwoman Rose Fitzpatrick said people need to be encouraged to talk about the issue and seek help. She added: \"Suicide prevention has never been more important. \"While today's figures predate Covid-19, the pandemic is likely to have a long-term impact on wellbeing and mental health as people's lives change.\" 'Source of shame' Scottish Conservative mental health spokesman Brian Whittle said the statistics should be a \"source of shame\" for the SNP. Scottish Greens health spokeswoman Alison Johnstone said there was an \"urgent need\" for the Scottish government to improve access to mental health services. And Scottish Liberal Democrats health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton called for a \"serious expansion\" in the number of dedicated NHS mental health staff and described the suicide figures as \"devastating\". Rachel Cackett, executive director of Samaritans Scotland, said: \"It's particularly concerning to see rates of suicide increase for almost all age groups and for rates among young people under 25 continuing to rise this year. \"And, as in previous years, people living in the most deprived communities in Scotland continue to be around three times more likely to take their own life, compared to those living in the wealthiest communities.\" 'Significant toll' The Scottish Children's Services Coalition said the situation had worsened due to the coronavirus crisis and warned that further cuts in services would create a mental health \"perfect storm\". And Councillor Stuart Currie, Cosla's health and social care spokesman, highlighted the link to poverty and the profound grief behind the statistics. Mental Health Minister Clare Haughey said: \"While these statistics do not reflect the period of the coronavirus pandemic, we know that this is taking a significant toll on many people's mental health and we are doing all we can to support people at this difficult time. \"We are not being complacent and, together with Cosla, we accepted the recommendations that the National Suicide Prevention Leadership Group put forward for a pandemic-specific suicide prevention response.\"", "output": "The number of deaths caused by alcohol misuse in Scotland fell by 10% last year, according to new statistics.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The total includes 45 fines of \u00a31,000 for failure to self-isolate.

The Chancellor could send a positive message to banks, saying that they are welcome in the UK and that regulation and the tax burden need to be \"proportionate\". That could pave the way to a reform of the bank levy so that it has less of an impact on the foreign operations of UK banks. That could be announced in the Budget on 8 July. The Chancellor could also decide not to raise the levy. Both would be welcomed by large global banks such as HSBC. BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed said the UK job cuts would come as a shock to staff: \"Global banking now is a far tougher business than it was pre-the financial crisis. It is hard to get profits.\" Mr Gulliver was \"running a bank that investors believe simply doesn't make enough money\", he added. Our correspondent said the bank was now looking to \"reduce its footprint in developed economies\". HSBC plans to sell assets in Turkey and Brazil, where it will continue to service large corporate clients. 'World has changed' The news came ahead of a presentation that Mr Gulliver gave to investors and analysts in his second major strategy plan since taking up the role in 2011. \"We recognise that the world has changed and we need to change with it. That is why we are outlining the following... strategic actions that will further transform our organisation,\" he said in a statement. The 10-point plan aims to cut costs by up to $5bn (\u00a33.25bn) and increase investment in Asia - particularly in China. \"Asia [is] expected to show high growth and become the centre of global trade over the next decade,\" Mr Gulliver said. \"Our actions will allow us to capture expected future growth opportunities.\" Shares in HSBC were down 0.9% at 614p in afternoon trading in London, and closed down 0.5% in Hong Kong. The company is valued at almost \u00a3120bn. Headquarters decision James Antos, analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia, said the plan would not restore investor confidence in HSBC. \"Slaughtering the staff is not necessarily the solution unless management makes the bank considerably less complex,\" he said. HSBC said it would make a decision on whether to move its headquarters out of the UK by the end of the year. There has been speculation that the British bank may relocate its headquarters to Hong Kong since it announced the review in April. Analysis: Robert Plummer, business reporter HSBC used to style itself as \"the world's local bank\", combining the heft of a global brand with the sophistication of local knowledge. Yet it started moving away from that business model as far back as 2011, hit by a combination of spiralling costs and setbacks in some of those local markets to which it was a latecomer. In fact, however much we hear about economic globalisation, global banks are having a tough time of it these days. Not only are they hard to manage, but they also face stiff competition from local banks in individual countries. In Brazil, for instance, where HSBC was unknown until 1997, it has been outflanked by local operators Itau and Bradesco. Unsurprisingly, then, it has decided to dispose of its subsidiary there and concentrate on the area where its expertise has always been clear: East Asia in general, and China in particular. Mr Gulliver laid out a number of criteria for the decision - including whether the UK government supported the growth of financial services industry. He insisted that any move would not be a response to any UK legislation affecting banks, but about deciding \"where the mind of the company should be\".

But when the Library of Birmingham opened in September 2013, in a ceremony hosted by Nobel-prize winning Malala Yousafzai, the coverage was almost feverish. Eighteen months later, interest in the building clearly has not dipped. The library has just been named as one of the top 10 most popular visitor attraction in the UK, according to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva). Alva said it was the first time any English attraction outside London had made it into the list. In getting there, the library pipped to the post other prestigious contenders such as London's British Library, which drew 1,627,599 visits compared to the Library of Birmingham's 2,414,860. Bernard Donoghue, chief executive of Alva, said Birmingham's library had exceeded all expectations. So what is the secret of its success? One of the primary reasons is its architecture. The building cost nearly \u00a3190m to build and was designed by Dutch firm Mecanoo. \"The most important thing was to bring a kind of coherence because it felt as if the city had many fragments of buildings from different periods,\" said architect Francine Houben. \"The architecture is compelling,\" said Mr Donoghue. \"That alone attracts a lot of tourists. When you go inside, it feels as if it's a temple to learning and education. It also gives you a platform to look out over the rest of Birmingham.\" The building missed out on the Riba Stirling Prize for best new building of the year, which went to Liverpool's Everyman Theatre. But it did win a BBC poll, in which 90,000 people voted, to find the public's favourite on the shortlist. A library spokesman said winning the public's backing was \"very gratifying\". Lydia Williams, 33, a charity worker from Birmingham \"I didn't like the building when it was being built. \"Birmingham is a big mish-mash of different architectural styles and I don't like how it looks. \"It's so different to everything around it and I think it will look really outdated in about 30 years. \"But the facilities are amazing. I work in a team and we come here for meetings and it's really good and the Shakespeare room is brilliant.\" Another reason for the library's success is what it houses - books. But the books here are not the battered copies of Catherine Cookson or C.S Forester you might find at your local lending service. \"The new building has put the value of libraries on the economic map,\" said Mr Donoghue. \"You can tell when you walk in how learning and intellectual curiosity is valued.\" It is the largest public lending library in Europe, with a series of rotundas housing its collection of more than 400,000 books. Special features include its nationally-important photography collection and archives and its Shakespeare Memorial Room, on the ninth floor. The architecture here is deliberately different - a restored, wood-panelled relic from Birmingham's 1882 Victorian library - and contains one of the largest Shakespeare collections in the world, including a First Folio. Harprit Bilkhoo, 32, a GP from Birmingham \"We come here quite often and bring the kids. It's a really good public space, on a par with the best of other cities. \"You'd expect most top attractions to be in London, as there's more investment there. \"But the library makes a statement that in the next 20 years or so Birmingham will truly take its place as the second city.\" It is not just the significance of its collections that make Birmingham's book bank \"more than a library\". It has a host of additional facilities include a digital gallery, a subterranean amphitheatre, an outdoor garden - or discovery terrace - and a gallery, which is used for visiting exhibitions and showcasing collections. Experts believe this mix of facilities is crucial to the library's wider appeal. \"The library is a bit of a phenomenon,\" said Richard Moss, editor of Culture 24, which promotes cultural venues across the UK. \"You can go and browse films and TV programmes from the British Film Institute national archive or visit exhibitions - it has elements of a museum, really. \"Of course, not all libraries can do what Birmingham has done, and a huge amount of money has gone into it. \"But I think it shows you what the 21st Century library can do - and maybe has to do in order to survive.\" Beck Millard, 23, an education mentor from Dudley \"I come here with my students most days and it's great to read and learn in such a nice environment. \"London is a number one city, so you would expect most attractions to be from there but Birmingham has good things too. \"Birmingham is maybe misunderstood. People need to come here and see what we have.\" If you were going to invest \u00a3190m in a huge new attraction, common sense suggests you would try to locate it in London. England's capital city routinely pulls in millions more visitors than anywhere else in the UK, as demonstrated in its dominance of the Alva survey. But recent surveys have suggested Birmingham's tourism stock is rising. It is now the UK's fourth most-visited city, behind London, Edinburgh and Manchester and has been extolled in the likes of the New York Times and the Rough Guides. \"The library is part of the renaissance of Birmingham - it's a place people are extremely proud of,\" said Mr Moss. \"Birmingham is buzzing,\" said James Smart, destinations editor at Lonely Planet. \"The city has outstanding museums and galleries, great restaurants, picturesque canals and reminders of its industrial past like the Jewellery Quarter. So is the library's success set to continue? Like other publicly-funded services, the library is set to make massive job cuts little more than a year after it opened. The Labour-led city council said 100 of the building's 188 staff would lose their jobs. However, the council's Conservative opposition said they were \"saddened\" by the cuts which they feared would threaten the library's legacy. \"What sort of message does that send out to the wider world? What does it say about us as a city?\" former council leader Lord Whitby, who helped spearhead the development said. Val Birchall, the council's assistant director of culture and visitor economy, said: \"Like so many other libraries and publicly-funded cultural organisations across the whole country, we are facing challenging times ahead.\" \"It's always the case that a new visitor attraction has a honeymoon period of about 18 months to two years,\" said Mr Donoghue. \"After that, the figures inevitably tail off. But I really hope the city council continues its imaginative and brave investment in the library as a place which celebrates Birmingham.\"", "output": "In an era when libraries across England are closing, due to lack of funding and declining attendances , one is standing head and shoulders above the rest.

Supporters of the EAW say Britain risks becoming a \"safe haven\" for criminals without its extradition powers. But some Conservative MPs see it as a threat to the liberties of Britons and the sovereignty of the UK. The government opted out of all 133 justice measures in 2013 and wants to rejoin 35, including the EAW. It has until 1 December to decide which ones to continue to adhere to. Writing in the Sunday Times, Conservative backbencher David Davis said claims by Mrs May and senior judges that without the EAW Britain would become a safe haven for criminals were \"scaremongering\". He is among the MPs expected to vote against the government plans on Monday, but the measures are likely to pass with Labour and Liberal Democrat support. 'Practical measures' In an article in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs May urged the Commons to give the authorities \"the powers they need to keep us safe\". In the past five years, she said, 5,000 people had been extradited from the UK under the EAW, including suspects wanted for 124 murders and 100 rapes. But Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan disagreed, telling the BBC's Sunday Politics: \"I know the security services want it, of course it makes life easier for them. \"But a state in which we automatically do what the police want is a police state and the role of politicians is to weigh the convenience of the police against the freedom of the subject.\" European Arrest Warrants Q&A: European Arrest Warrant Mr Hannan cited the case of five-year-old brain tumour patient Ashya King, whose parents were arrested in Spain after he was taken from hospital against medical advice, as an example of the \"disproportionate\" use of an EAW. Meanwhile, the chairs of three influential Parliamentary committees accused the government of a \"cavalier approach\" to the debate. The European Scrutiny, Justice and Home Affairs said Monday's vote had \"no direct relevance\" to the EAW and would not allow MPs to make any changes. The committees have previously called for an individual motion on each of the 35 measures, rather than one vote on the whole package. Home Affairs chairman Keith Vaz said: \"Members of the House are expecting a separate vote on whether or not to rejoin the European Arrest Warrant. \"Monday's debate, on an unamendable, take-it-or-leave-it package, will not give us that opportunity.\" Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Prime Minister David Cameron was \"running scared\" of a rebellion by not including the EAW in the package to be voted on. She said: \"We need the European Arrest Warrant and we should vote for it. All this tricky game playing means it's no wonder people don't trust David Cameron on Europe.\" In a letter to Mrs Cooper, Mrs May wrote: \"I shall be making very clear in the House on Monday - and am happy to do so now - that Monday's vote is a vote on the entire package of 35 measures.\" She said: \"The package includes the arrest warrant and other tools which are vitally important to our police and law enforcement agencies. \"It helps us to tackle cross-border crimes, deport foreign criminals, track down those who seek to evade the law, and bring them to justice. \"We are proud to bring it before Parliament on Monday as a package of measures which are in the national interest, but if Parliament rejects it, we will not join them. \"The government will be arguing loudly and clearly why it is so important that we do so.\"", "output": "Home Secretary Theresa May says she will argue \"loudly and clearly\" in favour of rejoining the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) in a Commons debate.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Dr Faye KirklandBBC News The British Medical Association said routine monitoring of long-term conditions could stop, so GPs could \"focus on the sickest patients\". There are also concerns about assessing patients, and supplies of protective equipment like gloves and masks. NHS England said protective kits would be delivered to GPs this week. Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the BMA's GPs committee, warned patients with mild health complaints should expect to wait longer to see their GP. \"We do expect cases to rise rapidly and over the coming weeks,\" he told the BBC. \"We will need to stop doing much of the routine work that we do week-by-week to enable us to focus on the sickest patients and prioritise those who most need us. \"Practices that are routinely doing routine health checks, assessing blood pressure, diabetic control, and long term problems with heart and lung disease. Those routine checks will need to stop.\" He added: \"We'll need to prioritise not only those with potential Covid infections, but also the sickest patients who will need to continue to receive our direct care. It does mean that some patients may have to wait longer than normal to see their GP. \"It's likely to continue for at least a few weeks, if not months. And it's quite possible that there will be more than one wave of infection.\" At the moment, there is guidance around testing patients who have been to a high-risk country in the past 14 days or have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus. However there are concerns around patients who report a fever, cough and shortness of breath - the main coronavirus symptoms - but do not meet those criteria. GPs said they were having to make difficult decisions about where to see patients, if they could not be managed on the phone, and there was a lack of guidance about what to do for them. Some described measures such as seeing patients in a designated room or at the end of surgery. Others said they were wearing \"catering aprons\", due to a lack of equipment. 'No online booking' Doctors also said they had contacted Public Health England (PHE) to find out more details of local diagnoses, but were unable to find out any more information than was already published online. Two GPs, Dr Jane Wheatley and Dr Shivangi Thakore, both GPs in Islington, London, said they were only aware of a diagnosed case of Covid-19 in a parent of a local school in London when told by other patients. The NHS 111 service had then asked a child at the school to come to the GP with symptoms of a cough and fever after a telephone triage. It took three calls to Public Health England to decide what to do - and the child was eventually managed over the phone. The GPs told the BBC: \"We have struggled with deciphering and managing the seemingly conflicting information given by PHE and 111. \"It has incurred a heavy time cost, restricting our ability to practise; several GPs have had to dedicate time to strategic planning and lengthy phone calls to PHE, NHS 111, as well as local infectious diseases specialists.\" Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the RCGP, said it was important that everyone in the NHS had \"clear, concise guidance\". \"GPs will increasingly be on the front line of dealing with Covid-19 - and we're already hearing from members that they are seeing more patients who are concerned about the outbreak and what steps they should take to protect themselves and their families.\" He welcomed advice issued by the NHS to GPs last week, including the suggestion patients should no longer be able to book appointments online without being spoken to first. But he added: \"We are aware that there is some confusion around triage and the appropriate steps that GPs and their teams should take, particularly for patients who don't fit all current criteria for Covid-19. \"We are also aware of some concerns around community testing and the information on cases being made available to GPs. We are feeding this information back to NHSE and PHE.\" An NHS spokeswoman said hundreds of protective kits would be sent out to GPs from this week. These will include general use aprons, examination gloves and fluid repellent face masks. Larger surgeries will receive repeat deliveries to ensure they have sufficient amounts. \"Almost all practices have no received protective equipment. As the supplies are used, more will be delivered,\" Mr Vautrey told the BBC. A NHS spokeswoman added: \"Anyone with concerns about coronavirus can use the NHS 111 online service, and while the 111 phone line is understandably busy, and people may have to wait longer than usual, all enquiries are being responded to, thanks to hard-working NHS staff.\"", "output": "GPs may have to stop carrying out routine health checks in order to focus on the sickest patients as the coronavirus outbreak worsens.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Simon JackBusiness editor@BBCSimonJackon Twitter It's a decision that, if taken (and it almost certainly will be), will mark a significant U-turn in the government's approach to procuring new nuclear power. In 2010, the government was adamant that the UK public should never have to run the risk of lengthy and costly overruns that have become a hallmark of nuclear plant construction. In the case of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, the government made much of the fact that come what may, the UK taxpayer would be insulated from the skyrocketing costs that the contractor, EDF, had incurred on a similar plant in France. But there was a price to pay for that taxpayer protection: very expensive electricity. In return for shouldering all the risk, EDF demanded a price for the electricity that Hinkley will (one day) produce that is double the current going rate. The National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee were critical of that deal and there was considerable pressure to significantly reduce the cost of power from the Wylfa plant. It's expected it will come in around \u00a377 per megawatt hour, compared to \u00a392.50/MWh for Hinkley. Cheaper borrowing Energy Secretary Greg Clark told the BBC: \"We listened to the NAO and PAC and thought it appropriate to explore a different way to deliver a project of this size.\" Environmental groups condemned the deal. The Greens' Caroline Lucas said: \"Taking a stake in this nuclear monstrosity would see taxpayers locked into the project and paying out for a form of electricity generation that's not fit for the future.\" However, Dieter Helm, professor of Energy Policy at the University of Oxford, told the BBC that the government shift made sense. \"The sheer cost of building new nuclear power stations means it makes sense for the government to help finance projects like this,\" he said. \"Governments can borrow much more cheaply that private companies and that lower cost of borrowing can drastically reduce the ultimate cost. Hinkley Point C would have been roughly half the cost if the government had been borrowing the money to build it at 2%, rather than EDF's cost of capital, which was 9%.\" There is another reason why the government feels more comfortable taking a construction risk this time around. The Hinkley Point Project is based on a brand new reactor design which is yet to go into service anywhere in the world. By contrast, the Hitachi design is relatively tried and tested. Whatever the merits of the new approach, or the old design, the government can be sure to face tough questions as to why new nuclear construction is worth spending billions on when there are so many other calls on the Treasury coffers.", "output": "The government has confirmed it is considering putting taxpayers' money into a project to build a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in North Wales.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The 42-year old from Merthyr Tydfil said he was \"beside himself\" after witnessing the attack on Sully the cat.

Churchill was chosen owing to his place as \"a hero of the entire free world\", said Bank governor Sir Mervyn King. The current face of the \u00a35 note is social reformer Elizabeth Fry. 'Truly great leader' A wide range of historical characters appears on the reverse of Bank of England banknotes, with Elizabeth Fry the only woman among the current crop. The Bank of England governor has the final say about who appears on a banknote, although the public can make suggestions. The latest addition has been announced by Sir Mervyn at Churchill's former home of Chartwell, in Westerham, Kent. \"Our banknotes acknowledge the life and work of great Britons. Sir Winston Churchill was a truly great British leader, orator and writer,\" Sir Mervyn said. \"Above that, he remains a hero of the entire free world. His energy, courage, eloquence, wit and public service are an inspiration to us all.\" Current plans, which the Bank said might be reviewed, are for Churchill to appear on the new \u00a35 note to be issued in 2016. Security measures The design includes a portrait of the former prime minister, adapted from a photograph taken by Yousuf Karsh on 30 December 1941. He is the only politician from the modern era to feature on a banknote. The artwork will also include: Sir Mervyn said that this was an appropriate choice given the country's economic difficulties. \"We do not face the challenges faced by Churchill's generation. But we have our own,\" he said. \"The spirit of those words remains as relevant today as it was to my parents' generation who fought for the survival of our country and freedom under Churchill's leadership.\" The Bank of England issues nearly a billion banknotes each year, and withdraws almost as many from circulation. Notes are redesigned on a relatively frequent basis, in order to maintain security and prevent forgeries. Other security features include threads woven into the paper and microlettering. The most recent new design from the Bank of England was the \u00a350 note, which entered circulation in November. This features Matthew Boulton and James Watt who were most celebrated for bringing the steam engine into the textile manufacturing process. While Bank of England notes are generally accepted throughout the UK, three banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland are authorised to issue banknotes. Pharmacologist Sir Alexander Fleming, poet Robert Burns, and tyre inventor John Boyd Dunlop are among those who appear on these notes. One commemorative \u00a35 note featuring football great George Best proved so popular that the limited edition of one million sold out in 10 days. In May, a new five-euro note will be put into circulation by the European Central Bank. It features an image of the Greek goddess Europa, which comes from a vase in the Louvre Museum in Paris. History The image of Churchill has featured on currency before. He was the first commoner to be shown on a British coin when he appeared on the 1965 crown, or five shilling piece. Churchill, elected as a Conservative MP in 1900, served as chancellor in Stanley Baldwin's government. He replaced Neville Chamberlain to become the wartime British prime minister in May 1940 until 1945. He returned to office in 1951, and retired in 1955, aged 80. \"The Bank is privileged to be able to celebrate the significant and enduring contribution Sir Winston Churchill made to the UK, and beyond,\" said Chris Salmon, chief cashier of the Bank of England, whose signature will also appear on the banknote. Sir Nicholas Soames, Churchill's grandson and MP for Mid Sussex, said: \"I think it is a wonderful tribute to him and an appropriate time.

Be warned though, the streets and parks will be extremely busy during these times. Cycling Road Race On 28 July (men) and 29 July (women) cyclists will race from the Mall to Box Hill and back. You need a ticket to watch it at The Mall, Box Hill and Hampton Court, but everywhere else on the 120 km route is free to watch. Constitution Hill (between Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park Corner), Richmond Park or Fulham Road are likely to be good spots to see the racing. Men's and Women's 20km Race Walk On 4 August (men's 20km) and 11 August (women's 20km and men's 50km) is a 2km circuit along The Mall up to Hyde Park Corner and back. Depending on the race, the athletes will do up to 25 laps. The Mall is ticketed, but you can still watch for free on Constitution Hill or Buckingham Palace. You will need to get there early and plan your journey. Triathlon The triathlon on 4 August (women) and 7 August (men) mostly takes place in Hyde Park, with the cycling route extending down to Buckingham Palace. The athletes will swim round the Serpentine and run four laps of a part of Hyde Park. The north side of the Serpentine will be ticketed but you could always try watching from the south side of the lake. This will be a very popular event so if you want to be at the front of the crowds you'll have to get there early. There's more scope to watch the cycle route. You could gather on South Carriage Drive in Hyde Park, in front of Buckingham Palace, along Constitution Hill or at Hyde Park Corner. The cyclists will do seven laps of the circuit. The marathon swim The marathon swim on 9 August (women) and 10 August (men) also takes place in the Serpentine where swimmers will do six laps of the lake. A part of the north side of the lake is ticketed but the rest is not. You could try getting a place on the south side of the lake near the Feeding Pontoon. This is where coaches hand the competitors food and drinks on the end of long poles as they swim past. The marathon The marathon on 5 August (women) and 12 August (men) takes in most of London's most iconic landmarks. It starts on the Mall, which is a ticketed area, along with Horseguards Parade. But you could position yourself at Trafalgar Square, Victoria Embankment, Buckingham Palace or Lower Thames Street. The runners make three circuits of the route so you will have more than one chance to see them. Live sites Another option if you do not have a ticket is to watch the events on big screens that will be set up at the Live Sites across the capital. The two biggest sites are in Hyde Park and Victoria Park. During the Paralympics these will move to Trafalgar Square. Access to these sites is free, except for Hyde Park on the 27 July and 12 August. If you want to be sure to get in you can reserve tickets in advance. At Victoria Park every sporting event will be streamed live. There will be family activities like water zorbing and a zip line. At Hyde Park you can watch artists and bands performing and members of Team GB will be there too. The three other Live Sites in London are at Potters Fields Park (next to Tower Bridge), Walthamstow Town Square and Woolwich. There are also two community live sites in Newham and Lewisham. You can just turn up and watch the events unfold on the big screens. It's also worth checking if your local authority has any plans for watching or celebrating the Olympic Games.

Doctors warn the authenticity of diazepam bought online cannot be trusted. It is illegal to possess without a prescription. The medicines regulator said selling such drugs was a \"serious offence\". Its figures, for tablets that tested positive for diazepam, do not include the number of fake pills being seized. One woman who was addicted to the drug for a decade - fuelled by pills bought online - said it had ruined her life. Diazepam - also known by one of its brand names, Valium - is a class-C drug in the UK. It is commonly used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and seizures, working to calm the brain and nerves. On the NHS, the medication is not recommended to be taken for longer than four weeks, while possessing the drug without a prescription carries a maximum prison sentence of two years. Some people turn to rogue online pharmacies and dealers to buy it when they are unable to - or do not want to - get it from a doctor. Hardyal Dhindsa, the national lead on drug and alcohol abuse for the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), said online sales needed better legislation and monitoring. \"It's hard to see how we'll tackle this because availability online is so easy,\" he said. \"More needs to be done through the health service, the enforcement agencies and public health departments.\" As part of its investigation, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme bought three batches of diazepam online and had them tested by experts at St George's Hospital in south London. Two batches were found to contain diazepam but one contained flualprazolam - an unlicensed drug that is more powerful and addictive. 'I don't remember most of my 20s' \"Emma\" was first prescribed diazepam in her early 20s during a serious bout of anxiety. \"I went to the doctor crying and wanting to kill myself,\" she says. \"I just remember being given these pills and they made it all go away.\" But Emma became addicted and doctors would not prescribe her the amounts she felt she needed. \"Instead of going to another GP and explaining the situation, I started buying them on the black market,\" she says. Emma says the addiction ruined a decade of her life, causing her to underperform in her degree and postgraduate degree. And she is only now beginning to recover after being clean for almost a year. \"I don't remember most of my 20s, I don't remember anything,\" she says. The issue of people self-medicating for their mental health with diazepam illegally bought online has become so serious the Addiction to Online Medicine Service (Atom) has been established by the Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust. Its consultant psychiatrist, Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, said the main drug used by patients at the clinic was diazepam. \"The internet has been a game-changer,\" he said. \"People are experiencing high anxiety or severe depression or sometimes chronic pain and they find that these drugs make them feel better and their dose just goes up and up and up.\" Dr Bowden-Jones said coming off high doses of diazepam could be more dangerous than heroin withdrawal. \"If people are addicted to it and they stop suddenly, then they are at risk of having a seizure and of course that could potentially be life-threatening,\" he said. It is not known how many people are buying illegal or fake diazepam online but it is significant enough for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to have made seizing it a priority in the past year.

Play is central to learning for under-fives and should feature heavily in the criteria, nursery groups say. There is no contradiction between teaching and play, the government says. The Department for Education has been consulting on two new flagship qualifications, the Early Years Educator (EYE) and the Early Years Teacher (EYT), designed to increase the skills of those working with babies and young children. They will be required by nurseries in England from September 2014. The A-Level-standard EYE qualification says the worker should \"deliver children's early education and development from birth to the age of five\" and \"have an understanding of how children learn and develop\". It also requires them to \"deliver effective teaching and learning\" enabling children to progress and be ready for school. While the EYT requires the teacher to have a clear understanding of synthetic phonics in the teaching of reading and appropriate strategies in the teaching of early mathematics, there is no mention of theories underpinning structured play. The Department for Education said: \"There is no contradiction between teaching children and play. Good nurseries do both - education and enjoyment go hand-in-hand.\" But the three major bodies representing nurseries, pre-schools and childminders say not mentioning play is a major omission. Pre-School Learning Alliance chief executive Neil Leitch said: \"Learning through play is the cornerstone of good practice in early years because play is how young children learn and make sense of the world. \"The ability of practitioners to support children's play in this way is an essential skill in promoting children's development and should be recognised in these qualifications. We are very disappointed that it is not.\" He said the role of the childcare practitioner was to create the right environment for young children to explore and learn in a way which extends their interests at their own pace. \"This is why we have concerns about the top-down pressure from government that could lead to the 'schoolification' of early years as a result of developmentally inappropriate practice such as having young children sit in rows and hold pencils.\" 'Explore and develop' He added: \"I have this fear that we are moving to a position where we are not wanting our children to be children any more.\" There was a growing culture of \"rushing children\" to a point where they could produce a return for the economy, instead of following academic evidence that learning through structured play and self-development was the best way to prepare children for a successful education, he said. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said \"play should be there in every line\" of the criteria. \"Children and babies are learning all the time and they are learning through play - even when they go on to schools. You just can't separate it,\" she said. While a spokesman for Pacey, the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, said: \"These qualifications contain no requirement to have an understanding of play theory or practice.\" This was of particular concern as the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), the official guidelines on how children under five are cared for and educated, is meant to be based on play, it said. \"Early Years Teachers (EYT) must be required to know that children learn through well-structured play, when they have opportunities to explore and develop their own ideas. \"The expectation that teachers will be able to provide adequately for play, without being given any formal knowledge or understanding during their qualifying years, will only set them up to fail children in their early years, when learning through play is a crucial part of their lives.\" And Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"Play is a fundamental and appropriate part of the early years phase of education and it is therefore disappointing, not to say incomprehensible, that the government has excluded it from their draft framework. \"Structured play is valuable to children in so many ways. Principally, it allows them to develop confidence and enjoy learning new skills. The government should stop sending a message that play does not contribute to child development.\" The National College for Teaching and Leadership, which has drawn up the criteria, said educators and teachers would be expected to meet the requirements of the EYFS. \"The EYFS has a requirement for planned, purposeful play and so is already included within the score of the standards and criteria.\"", "output": "The role of play is being sidelined in England's nurseries because of government shifts towards more formal learning, experts say.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent That has further stimulated a debate about whether Berlin should open the financial taps and spend more. Should Germany launch a programme of spending on, for example, its infrastructure? Should the government ditch the policy of balancing the budget, known as \"the black zero\" and the related legal restriction on borrowing called the \"debt brake\"? We had some clues about the impact of Germany's downturn with eurozone economic growth figures that showed growth of 0.2% in the third quarter of the year. That is sluggish though slightly better than many economists were expecting. We will have to wait two weeks for a read-out on Germany's own performance in the same period. The eurozone as a whole might not be in recession, but inevitably the downturn in Germany affects the country's neighbours. The question is what should policymakers - especially the German government and the European Central Bank (ECB) - do about the situation. The ECB has already taken steps. It has cut its interest rates to ultra-low levels (to below zero for one of its key rates) and it is about to re-start the policy known as quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly-created money But there are real doubts about how effective these measures will be. Many economists believe that monetary policy - what central banks do - has done about as much as it can in the eurozone. Many argue that governments should do more. The current president of the ECB Mario Draghi and his successor Christine Lagarde, who takes over this week, have both taken that view. In September, Ms Lagarde told the European Parliament: \"Some countries in the euro area can use some of their fiscal space [government spending and taxation] in order to improve broadband infrastructure and set in place the public spending that will help fight the recession.\" She didn't name the countries that could afford to take such action, but she did say it was now true of a majority of them. The most obvious example is Germany which has had a surplus in its public finances - with tax revenue higher than spending - since 2012. Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: The IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, was explicit on this point in the foreword to the IMF's recent World Economic Outlook. \"A country like Germany should take advantage of negative borrowing rates to invest in social and infrastructure capital,\" she wrote. Her reference to negative borrowing rates refers to the fact that Germany, and a number of other countries, can borrow at an interest rate of less than zero. In effect, the financial markets pay them to borrow. Prof Peter Bofinger of W\u00fcrzburg University, and a former member of Germany's economics experts council, agrees with Ms Gopinath that the country should take advantage of the these below-zero borrowing costs to invest in infrastructure and social housing. Currently he says net infrastructure investment - that is, after the wear and tear on existing infrastructure is factored in - is below zero. The idea that Germany has a problem in this area might come as a bit of a surprise. But Prof Bofinger says he often sees the evidence himself. He describes travelling by train in the country as \"a real adventure - whether the train will arrive, how many minutes and hours they are delayed, whether you get something to eat on the train\". \"Transportation is in extremely bad shape and it is a consequence of insufficient investment for many years.\" He says it is a \"tremendous mistake\" not to use the opportunity presented by those favourable borrowing costs to address some of these problems. Tax cuts for business? He believes the debt brake and black zero policies don't make sense. If every major government followed the black zero policy, \"the world economy would end up in a black hole,\" he says. Currently among the G20 group of leading economies only two others - Russia and South Korea - have government budgets with a surplus. But Prof Bofinger does not favour using the infrastructure programme in the short term as a stimulus for a flagging economy. The construction industry is already working at full capacity. What he favours is more generous tax treatment to encourage business investment, which he says is currently where German economic performance is weak. But there are many defenders of Germany's cautious approach to managing its government finances. Prof Clemens Fuest is the director of one of the country's leading economic research agencies, the IFO institute in Munich. He argues that Germany is not facing a serious downturn - though there might be a technical recession in the sense of two consecutive quarters of declining economic activity. Germany has full employment and does not currently need further stimulus, he argues. There would, however, be a case for allowing the government to increase its borrowing if there were a sharper decline in economic activity. He agrees that the country could benefit from infrastructure improvements but it is nonetheless in better shape than in many other European countries. The problem is not so much lack of money for projects, he says, but delays in implementing them often due to the objections raised by German residents. He argues the debt brake was an appropriate response in 2009, around the time of the global financial crisis, when the government's debt was higher in relation to GDP and it remains a useful restraint.", "output": "The eurozone has a problem.

The findings differ from an official preliminary examination carried out by the county medical examiner. It did not find evidence of \"traumatic asphyxia or strangulation\". The official examination also said underlying health conditions played a role in Mr Floyd's death. But the two doctors hired by the Floyd family found the death was a homicide, a statement from its legal team said. \"The cause of death in my opinion is asphyxia, due to compression to the neck - which can interfere with oxygen going to the brain - and compression to the back, which interferes with breathing,\" Dr Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner and one of the pair, said at a news conference. A video showing a white police officer continuing to kneel on George Floyd's neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe sparked outrage when it emerged a week ago. It has led to six consecutive days of protests around the United States and a level of civil unrest not seen this widely across the country in decades. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Floyd family, told Monday's news conference: \"Beyond doubt he would be alive today if not for the pressure applied to his neck by officer Derek Chauvin and the strain on his body by two other officers.\" He added: \"The ambulance was his hearse.\" Dr Baden said there was \"no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death\". The findings contradict those of a preliminary post-mortem examination that was included in the criminal complaint against Mr Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The medical examiner noted in that report that Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and said the combination of these, \"potential intoxicants in his system\" and being restrained by the officers \"likely contributed to his death\". The full official death examination is yet to be released by the office of the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. It says it is awaiting more results from laboratory studies. The Floyd family and their lawyers say the charge against Mr Chauvin should be increased to first-degree murder. They say the private post-mortem examination proves two other officers filmed kneeling on his back also contributed to his death. What's the latest on protests? More than 75 cities have seen protests over what happened to George Floyd, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus full of demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. The case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. On Sunday, mostly peaceful demonstrations once again gave way to violence in many cities, with clashes erupting between police and protesters. Police cars were burned, buildings were torched and shops looted in several places. Dozens of cities imposed curfews but they were defied. On Monday, President Trump told state governors they had been \"weak\" and had to get \"much tougher\", and utilise troops from the National Guard, thousands of whom have already been activated in two dozen states. \"You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again,\" Mr Trump said in a video conference call, according to US media. There have been scenes of violence in Washington DC in recent nights, including near the White House. Demonstrators lit fire to buildings including a historic church known as the church of the presidents overnight on Sunday. Many videos shared on social media from across the US appeared to show riot police responding disproportionately to demonstrators. Dozens of attacks targeting journalists have been reported. The curfew in Washington DC has been extended for another two nights and will start at 19:00 on Monday. A curfew starting at 23:00 had been in effect on Sunday. New York City is also imposing a citywide curfew on Monday from 23:00 until 05:00 on Tuesday. \"The violence and the looting has been bad for the city, the state and this entire national movement, undermining and distracting from this righteous cause,\" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.", "output": "George Floyd, the African-American man whose death has sparked civil unrest, died from asphyxia (lack of oxygen), a private post-mortem examination found.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Cars and livestock have been swept away over a large area around the coastal city of Townsville.

The trust was unable to confirm how many vaccines had been given out to those now ineligible. Department intervention The letter was sent on 21 January. A week later, the trust limited the offer to \"staff working with physiologically vulnerable adults\", for example those with respiratory conditions. The initial policy was reversed after an intervention by the Department of Health. The vaccination programme in Northern Ireland works within the approach agreed across the UK from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which determines the groups that should be prioritised for vaccination, largely based on age and clinical vulnerability. Belfast Trust is responsible for delivering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The first group vaccinated in Northern Ireland was care home staff and residents, then those 80 years old and over. The aim is to have 65 years and over vaccinated by the end of this month. In January, it emerged that back office healthcare staff, such as procurement, IT and accounts were able to register for the vaccine as part of the first phase of the rollout. 'Very hurtful' There has been pressure from some front-line workers to be prioritised for the vaccine, including teachers. Police officers and fire and rescue service staff have yet to be vaccinated. Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw, who sits on Stormont's health committee, said news of the letter \"will be very hurtful to those who are CEV (Clinically Extremely Vulnerable) and have shielded away from society for the last 11 months and carers (those who have cared for them) - very, very few from either group have been called forward as yet\". She also warned that this approach could lead to \"lobbying for many, many other professions, such as bus drivers, retail workers, especially those who work in shops based in hospitals, those who work in meat processing plants... those workplaces where there is a heightened risk of coming into contact with large numbers of people on a daily basis\". A number of organisations within the community and voluntary sector in Belfast had requested the vaccine for their staff. NICVA, which represents the sector, had asked for voluntary and community sector staff to get the vaccination if people in similar jobs in the public sector were being vaccinated.

Dr Mahathir, now 92, first put Anwar in prison on corruption and sodomy charges in politically charged circumstances in 1999. But he has now come out of retirement, won a second stint as prime minister - and provided the key to his former deputy's release nearly two decades later. Mr Anwar himself read all the volumes of Shakespeare when in prison after Dr Mahathir jailed him. Yet the chance for Dr Mahathir to assure the release and pardon of Mr Anwar allows the relationship to come full circle, where enemies become friends. And unlike many of Shakespeare's plays, the story is one where the villain becomes the hero. Riding the wave At the core of the story of the two men is political power, and the drive to secure and maintain it. Dr Mahathir first brought Mr Anwar into his government in 1982. Mr Anwar had risen to prominence as a dynamic, charismatic student leader, who mobilised opposition to the dominant incumbent party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), in the 1970s. Mr Anwar rode the rising waves of political Islam, capitalising on the space available to organise around religion and the growing international movement of Muslim empowerment surrounding the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The co-opting of Mr Anwar into UMNO was the first of many political moves in their relationship, as Mr Anwar became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who rose quickly up the ranks. Mr Anwar's charisma and ability to mobilise followers served to neutralise opposition to UMNO within Malaysian society. The 1980s and early 90s were a heyday for Malaysia, with rapid economic growth and gains in development. Dr Mahathir's leadership had put the country on the international stage, in an era where Asia was seen to be rising in influence. Mr Anwar's loyalty and role were an integral part of Malaysia's success in this period. In 1993, Mr Anwar emerged as the leading contender to replace Dr Mahathir, winning a decisive victory for himself within UMNO. At that time, Mr Anwar wrote his first book, The Asian Renaissance, picking up on the momentum and aspirations in the region and distinguishing himself as an Asian public intellectual. He began to openly discuss the need for political reform, showcasing a difference in the two men as one who wanted to hold on to power and another who aspired to win it through calls for reform. Crunch time The reckoning would come after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. In 1998 Mr Anwar challenged Dr Mahathir for control of the party. The challenge was filled with vicious personal attacks across the political divide, as ideological struggles over policy melded with allegations of corruption. Mr Anwar failed in his challenge, as Dr Mahathir proved adept at controlling the levers of power. Mr Anwar was beaten up, charged and convicted in events that shook Malaysia's political system to the core. Betrayal was viciously punished as power was retained at all cost. Dr Mahathir rejected calls for political reform and held on by winning the 1999 election. The reformasi movement calling for change was born, with Mr Anwar as its jailed leader. The 1998-99 cataclysm was to set a pattern that has shaped political contests for more than two decades, as every election was won by the person who personified political change. Even the mandates won by Abdullah Badawi in 2004 and then Najib Razak in 2013 were embedded with labels as reformers. Malaysians have closely identified with the need to improve governance. Mr Anwar remained in prison until 2004, released by Abdullah Badawi who became prime minister after Dr Mahathir stepped down in 2003. While initially popular, Mr Abdullah failed to meet the expectations of the public and stakeholders within his party, and lost decisively in the 2008 election. Dr Mahathir returned to political life to assure the political downfall of Mr Abdullah through open criticism and behind-the-scene manoeuvres within UMNO. The man who had released Mr Anwar faced Dr Mahathir's political wrath. In stepped another of Dr Mahathir's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s - Mr Najib - who assumed the mantle of leadership in 2009. Mr Anwar was now the leader of the opposition, having successfully brought together different groups to make gains in 2008. Mr Najib followed the Mahathir playbook and convicted Mr Anwar of sodomy in a tainted political trial. But Mr Najib made the same mistake as Mr Abdullah, failing at national leadership. Changing sides The 2015 1MDB scandal and ostentatious displays of wealth tied to perceived corruption provoked strong nationalistic responses by Dr Mahathir, who openly criticised Mr Najib's leadership. Mr Najib fought Dr Mahathir, engaging in personal attacks, purging him from the party and threatening charges. Mr Najib pushed Dr Mahathir back into Mr Anwar's fold. In 2016 Dr Mahathir began collaborating with the opposition and assumed its leadership in December. An integral part of this relationship involved turning power over to Mr Anwar, after securing his release and pardon. The 92-year old steered the opposition toward victory this month, calling for Mr Najib's removal, reinstating the rule of law and political reforms. Mr Anwar's agenda of the 1990s was co-opted by the target of those criticisms, the very person who had repudiated and punished Mr Anwar for his call for change. Today, with Mr Anwar's release, the two men are allies again. They both publicly attest a commitment to political reform. The betrayals of the past, however, are there, and how much these are put aside for a shared goal is not clear. The timing of the turnover of power and scope of political reform are likely to emerge as points of difference, as for both men power has been central in their trajectories. Now more than ever Malaysians hope these men focus on loyalty to the country as opposed to personal interest and work together as allies toward strengthening Malaysia.

Police said at the time they believed Noah may have sustained a head injury after falling off his bike in the vicinity of North Queen Street and York Street. The footage was recorded later on in Noah's journey on York Road and it appears to show Noah cycling on his bicycle in a normal way. The timings on CCTV pictures are not always precise.

According to police, the last confirmed sighting of Noah was at 18:11 close to the storm drain at the back of Northwood Road in north Belfast. While the CCTV timings suggest it took him 10 minutes to make the final leg of his journey, the distance can be made on bicycle in two and half minutes. It is not known what he was doing for the remainder of that time. There have been renewed calls for speculation about the death of the schoolboy to stop. In spite of assurances from the PSNI that there was no foul play - and praise from Belfast coroner Joe McCrisken for the north Belfast community who assisted the police - people living in the area have been targeted by anonymous online trolls - claiming the boys disappearance is part of a loyalist conspiracy. Belfast PUP Councillor Billy Hutchinson has called for the online abuse to stop. \"People - I don't know how to describe them - from the nationalist or republican community - started to make allegations about what happened to the young lad alluding that people in the loyalist community were behind this,\" he said. \"There was nobody in the loyalist community behind this. The loyalist community is behind Noah\u2026 and his mother.\" Unlocked storm drain hatch? More details have emerged on the access hatch to the storm drain which police believe he entered. Noah's body was found six days later a kilometre downstream. The cause of death was drowning. It is understood the hatch within the grille on the storm drain that allows access was not locked on the day Noah disappeared. According to a senior Department for Infrastructure source, the padlock currently on the grille was put there by officials on 24 June 2020 - after consultation with the police three days after the boy disappeared. The hatch was unlocked until then, sources said. When asked to confirm this, a DfI spokesperson said: \"The information that you have requested relates to ongoing police and coroner investigations. \"The department cannot release information into the public domain which would undermine the progress of such investigations. \"It will therefore not be possible to comment any further while these investigations are ongoing.\" Mystery remains as to why Noah was in the Northwood district in the first place and why he entered the storm drain. Politicians have called for more information. Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said on social media: \"Many questions remain unanswered. \"I will continue to support Fiona (Noah's mother) and the family to get answers to the questions surrounding the tragic loss of Noah.\" During a preliminary hearing ahead of the full inquest, Coroner Joe McCrisken said Noah wasn't seen interacting with anyone else at any of these sightings.

'Public outcry' In an update published on the university's website on Monday afternoon, Vice Chancellor Stuart Croft said: \"We are committed to ensuring the safety of our community. \"I have today spoken to the two young men concerned and confirm that neither of them will be returning to the university. \"I am continuing to listen to the views of students, staff and all members of our community here at Warwick and support them so that we can learn from this experience.\" The update came as one Warwick professor told student newspaper The Boar it would be \"completely untenable\" for them to resume their studies. Responding to the news of the men not returning, one of the women targeted in the Facebook group chat said: \"We still do not know how the men's leaving came about. \"It could simply be that they have decided not to come back amidst public outcry.\" Their decision to stay away is \"not a victory for the university,\" she continued, adding: \"A victory will be a complete re-examination of the disciplinary processes which allowed this failure to happen.\" The chat was first reported last summer by The Boar.

Dressed in black fatigues and baseball caps the police may look similar but their accents give away the fact they have come from across the UK. As we approached the resort's shore, all our boats became a honey pot for the worker bees in their ribs, but at this stage it was pleasantries and not stings. I ask the officers where they are from, one crew is from London and the last time they used their boat was at the Olympics. They are happy to swap pleasantries and to remind us that soon the area we are in will be out of bounds. Two others we encounter are operated by PSNI officers from the boat section and they were happy for us to film, once they had put their helmets on to hide their faces. All the crews are based at the Lough Erne Yacht Club on the opposite shore to the G8 conference site. When our skipper took us inshore, we saw a row of ten high-powered boats tied up, all ready to police the no access area, and moored in front of them a row of cruisers hired from a local company to provide sleeping accommodation. US Marines But of particular interest are two larger grey boats on trailers on the shore. We hear those are owned and manned by the US marines and are part of back-up plans, apparently factored into worst case scenarios in relation to the most high-profile G8 attendee, President Obama. Our boat is ushered away firmly as we outlive our welcome and it is back to the lough. The officers will patrol an inner and outer cordon marked by large yellow buoys put in place on Saturday, and enforced for three days over the conference period. The inner cordon, which is within sight of the golf course of the Lough Erne resort, is made up of a linked boom and net, but the main line of defence is the police boats. The net, it is rumoured, is to stop divers but it would be quite a swim for anyone planning that as a form of protest.

I didn't know how much a month I should be putting in but people kept telling me about this simple magic formula. Apparently you halve the age you are on the day you start paying in and that's the percentage of your wages you need to pay every month, until you retire. So in my case, 14% of what I earn every month until retirement. That's a workplace pension, and financial experts say small differences at the beginning of our careers can make a huge difference at the end. Matt Wain from Manchester started paying into his pension when he was 20 and hopes his financial forward-planning will help him to retire at 55. So how much should people save? State pension v workplace pension The state pension comes from the government and is based on your national insurance (NI) contributions. The age you'd start getting a state pension age has just increased to 66 years old, and that will go up gradually over the next two decades. You need to make ten full years worth of national insurance contributions to get some money from a state pension. To get the full state amount, currently \u00a3175.20 a week, you will need 35 years worth of NI contributions. Your workplace pension is what you pay through your employer, which they top up. So in theory when you look at your wage slip, there are two pensions going on. Use the government's calculator to find out your state pension age Matt, 23, says he started paying into his workplace pension three years ago because he didn't want to miss out on the \"free money\" from the top-up. He plans on upping his contributions every year. \"I like taking responsibility for my financial future,\" Matt tells Newsbeat. \"I've got my spreadsheets for how much I need [to retire] for when I'm 55.\" He's gone a step further and moved his pension into a private account - something his employer has agreed to pay into - so when he changes jobs keeping track of his savings is easier. What do his mates think of his attention to detail? \"It's important to do it young,\" he says. Since 2018, employers have to put their staff into a pension scheme. You can opt out if you like but, as well as the long-term benefits you'd get, you're unlikely to pay tax on the money you put in. Sarah Coles is a personal finance expert at Hardgreaves Lansdown. She tell us: \"If your employer puts in the equivalent of 3% of your salary and you put in 5%, that's much better than nothing but by no means enough.\" She thinks if you want a comfortable retirement you need to up the amount you put in. How much should I pay in? Sarah agrees that the magic formula I mentioned earlier is a strong starting point. She knows that when you are starting out there are a lot of costs, and housing is often thought of as the main big ticket to be saving for. \"Try to stick to between 12% and 15% throughout most of your career\" says Sarah. \"Even going up by 1 or 2% is going to make a major difference over the long run.\" Sade Taiwo from Essex runs a money advice service for millennials called The Penny Pal. She tells Newsbeat: \"I started paying into my pension at the age of 22, so basically as soon as I could. \" \"What many people don't understand is that if you opt out of a workplace pension you are literally missing out on free money.\" Sade wishes people would look to the long term, especially with interest rates so low at the moment - meaning you don't get so much for keeping your cash in savings accounts. \"With our generation's average house deposit being \u00a346k, I am really investing in my pension this early out of fear that I won't be able to afford retirement.\" It's so far off - I want the money now Is that holiday next summer top of your financial to-do list? Sarah Coles says you need to think of pensions as \"money for you\". She hopes this helps people balance access to money for a rainy day with money for your pension. Sarah thinks people shouldn't rely on their state pension alone. Anyone born after 1977 won't get their state pension till they are 68 and many reckon the age will be over 70 by 2035. What happens when you move job? It's thought people have an average of 11 jobs in their life. So it's important to take your work pensions with you. \"When you leave, talk to your [old] employer about what's in there, and make sure there is nothing really valuable like tax-free cash\", Sarah says. \"[Then you might] keep that where it is. Otherwise look at consolidating it. \"You might be able to move it to your current employers or to a personal pension where it is all in one place.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

But in August, separatists supported by the UAE seized control the city of Aden from Saudi-backed government forces. The UN said the deal was an important step towards ending Yemen's civil war. The conflict has devastated the country and claimed the lives of at least 7,000 civilians, according to the UN. Monitors believe the death toll is far higher. The US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) said last week that it had recorded more than 100,000 fatalities, including 12,000 civilians killed in direct attacks. The fighting has also triggered the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Four-fifths of the population - 24 million people - are in need of humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive. Separatists seeking independence for south Yemen, which was a separate country before unification with the north in 1990, formed an uneasy alliance with President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi four years ago to stop the Houthis capturing Aden. They subsequently drove the rebels out of much of the south with the help of the Saudi-led coalition, and Aden became the temporary seat of Mr Hadi's cabinet. But in August, the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) turned on the president, accusing his government of mismanagement and criticising his ties to Islamists. Following several days of deadly clashes, militia fighters aligned to the STC seized control of Aden from troops loyal to the government. When the government tried to retake the city, the UAE intervened with air strikes. Saudi Arabia brokered a truce before hosting talks that led to Tuesday's deal. A copy of the agreement seen by Reuters news agency calls for the formation of a new cabinet within 30 days with equal numbers of northerners and southerners. The STC will also be allowed to join any UN-mediated talks to end the civil war. Fighters from both sides will be placed under the command of the defence and interior ministries, and the Saudi forces will oversee security inside Aden, according to Reuters. The UAE, which has been withdrawing troops from Yemen since July, handed over control of Aden to them last month. \"This agreement will open a new period of stability in Yemen. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands with you,\" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said. The UN's special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, said it was an \"important step for our collective efforts to advance a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Yemen\". \"Listening to southern stakeholders is important to the political efforts to achieve peace in the country,\" he added.

The spacecraft, which left Earth seven months ago, had to make a braking manoeuvre to be sure of being captured by Mars' gravity. UAE scientists can now look forward to studying the planet's atmosphere. Their satellite carries three instruments that will observe, among other targets, how neutral atoms of hydrogen and oxygen - remnants from Mars' once abundant water - leak into space. In the process, Hope will return spectacular, high-resolution, full-disk images of the planet. Tuesday marked the most critical phase in the mission. Hope had been approaching Mars at over 120,000km/h (relative to the Sun) and needed to execute a precise 27-minute burn on its braking engines to scrub some of that speed or risk skipping off into ever deeper space. The manoeuvre, performed by six thrusters on the probe, commenced at about 19:30 GST (15:30 GMT), with confirmation received at Earth some 11 minutes later - the delay being the time it took for radio signals to traverse the 190-million-km separation between Mars and Earth. The official announcement on the burn's completion when it came was calm, and the applause relatively restrained. Perhaps it was the relief speaking after a nerve-shredding wait for the positive telemetry. \"Mars orbit insertion was the most critical and dangerous part of our journey to Mars, exposing the Hope probe to stresses and pressures it has never before faced,\" said Omran Sharaf, the Hope mission's project director at the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre \"With this enormous milestone achieved, we are now preparing to transition to our science orbit and commence science data gathering.\" The past few days have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm for Hope and its mission, with public monuments, buildings and heritage sites across the federation all lit up in red. Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the tallest human-made structure on Earth, had been flashing a countdown to Tuesday's big moment. Hope is regarded as a triumph for a small gulf nation that dared to think seven years ago that it could inspire the next generation by launching the first Arab interplanetary space mission. \"We wanted to arrive at Mars; (I'm) really grateful, and it's like a weight of seven years has been lifted from my shoulders,\" said Her Excellency Sarah Al Amiri, UAE minister of state for advanced technology and chair of the UAE Space Agency. \"On arriving at Mars. I'm now truly looking forward to the scientific discoveries. And I truly hope this mission will impact an entire generation to strive to do things that are even bigger,\" she told BBC News. Hope is now running in an initial ellipse around Mars that comes as close as 1,000km from the planet and goes out to almost 50,000km. Over the course of the next few weeks, this will be trimmed to a 55-hour, 22,000km-by-43,000km orbit that is inclined to the equator by about 25 degrees. \"It depends on what that initial orbit looks like but we would need around three manoeuvres to get into our science orbit,\" said propulsion engineer Ayesha Sharafi. This path is very different to those of previous satellites which have tended to operate with greater proximity to Mars to facilitate high-resolution imagery of the surface and communications with landed robots. But it's from this high perch that Hope plans to carry out some novel research. It's going to trace how energy moves through the atmosphere from the very bottom to the very top. A key influencer in this respect is dust which can on occasions blow up into storms that envelop the entire planet. \"Dust plays a hugely important role in the Martian atmosphere. There are a few places on Earth where the atmosphere can be that dusty, but they're localised and maybe for short times,\" explained Prof David Brain, a University of Colorado at Boulder planetary expert who is working with the UAE team. \"Dust absorbs a lot of energy; it can become very warm and radiate energy. And so when you're talking about energy transport, dust is a much larger part of the big picture at Mars.\" Hope is leading a wave of missions to Mars this February. On Wednesday, it will be the turn of China with its Tianwen-1 orbiter. Like Hope, it must complete a braking manoeuvre to be captured by the planet's gravity. Tianwen-1 is carrying a rover that will be despatched to the surface, most likely in May. Next week, on Thursday 18 February, the Americans will arrive at Mars with another of their big rovers.

But education sector groups said the government \"is wasting an opportunity\" to help university students. Ministers also set out plans to improve post-16 vocational education including student loans for adult learners. The DfE also launched a consultation on changing the timetable for applying to university - to a so-called \"post-qualification admissions\" system. This would mean admissions being based on the grades achieve by students, rather than not relying on predictions. Fees and grants The government outlined its plans for higher education reforms for over-18s in response to a landmark review, commissioned by the government from finance expert Philip Augar. Its recommendations were published in May 2019. Planned reforms include making \u00a32.5bn available for technical qualifications for adult learners through the National Skills Fund, a lifelong student loan entitlement for up to four years of higher education and the prioritising of funding for STEM subjects. But the Augar review's recommendations to reduce tuition fees to \u00a37,500, alongside implementing reforms to minimum entry standards and foundation years at universities, were not addressed in this latest response. The DfE said given the pandemic \"now is not the right time to conclude the review in full\". Any further reforms are expected to be announced at the next Spending Review. Mr Augar also suggested the return of maintenance grants for poorer university students as part of his review, but there was not mention of this in the interim response. University and College Union general secretary Jo Grady said: \"Sadly this interim response confirms that there will not be a radical change to the current system. \"The Westminster government is wasting an opportunity to make a real difference for students and institutions.\" Prof Julia Buckingham, president of Universities UK , welcomed the prospect of lifelong loans, saying \"it is encouraging to see government's commitment to making lifelong learning opportunities more accessible to all\". However, Prof Buckingham said \"government should provide maintenance grants for those who need them the most, including those considering studying shorter courses on a modular basis\". Meeting local needs As part of its Skills for Jobs White Paper, published alongside higher education reforms, the DfE said it wanted to \"put an end to the illusion that a degree is the only route to success and a good job and that further and technical education is the second-class option\". A white paper is a policy document produced by the government to set out their proposals for future legislation. The measures put forward include: In December, the government announced that tens of thousands of adults without an A-level or equivalent would be able to benefit from nearly 400 fully-funded courses from April. It was the first major development in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Lifetime Skills Guarantee (LSG) scheme, which was launched in September. Mr Johnson said it would mean \"everyone will be given the chance to get the skills they need, right from the very start of their career\". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: \"These reforms are at the heart of our plans to build back better, ensuring all technical education and training is based on what employers want and need, whilst providing individuals with the training they need to get a well-paid and secure job.\" British Chamber of Commerce director general Adam Marshall welcomed the plans to put the skills needs of businesses at the heart of further education. \"As local business leaders look to rebuild their firms and communities in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to ensure that the right skills and training provision is in place to support growth,\" he added. Funding concerns But organisations representing school and college leaders are also sceptical that there is enough funding for the further education sector to deliver on the proposals. In November, an the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said FE colleges and sixth forms faced significant financial uncertainty. Chief executive of the Association of Colleges David Hughes said: \"Colleges have been calling for this, after years of being overlooked and underutilised, but government has to not only recognise the vital college role, it also needs to increase funding.\"", "output": "University tuition fees in England will be frozen at a maximum of \u00a39,250 for the next academic year.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Newport Mind is one of the groups providing support to help people obtain \"settled status\" across Wales.

Those who have been here for more than five years can apply for settled status, if they can prove they have lived in the UK continuously. Downing Street has previously said EU citizens will not automatically be deported if they fail to sign up to the settled scheme by the 2021 deadline.

He said the demand for help has \"increased massively\" since the beginning of 2020. But figures show the number of eligible people in Wales who have yet to apply remains high, and Mr Fox said some of those were \"extremely vulnerable\". \"People who are quite elderly, people who live in care homes, homeless people, people where there's significant mental health conditions - all these kinds of people are going to struggle to know or understand that they have to make an application and that it's relevant to them,\" he said.

An A4 'day schedule' is shoved into the Oxford band's hands and a long day begins. Mercury Prize goes to trio The xx Meanwhile, many of the 12 nominated artists begin congregating in the hotel foyer. Paul Weller looks every inch the confident favourite (or he might just look cool because he's wearing sunglasses inside), The xx clutch their suit bags and Biffy Clyro chat with Wild Beasts. \"I'm feeling a bit jittery now. I think I'm quite nervous, or it could be the hangover,\" says Foals guitarist Jimmy Smith cupping a wine glass of water walking from the lobby to the basement venue where the awards take place tonight. \"I've got to perfect my losing face.

Taking to the stage after Biffy Clyro and Laura Marling the fivesome breeze through single Spanish Sahara for their television rehearsal and greet host Jools Holland. Now, normally the nominees would head back to their plush hotel rooms to get changed into their Tuesday-best at this point. Not Foals though. \"This is the first thing we've ever done like this so we weren't sure how to play it,\" confides Jimmy looking down at his T-shirt. \"We were going to go for the proper DJs. I'm glad we didn't. \"It's all about the music and about being yourself and looking like the band you are - which in our case is awful.\" Rehearsal complete, Jimmy looks to capitalise on a free minute. \"I'm going to go for a lie down,\" he says looking like he needs a lie down. Early evening An hour later, the five members reconvene in the hotel lobby preparing to be sent down the media shuttle run after Paul Weller, Villagers and Wild Beasts. \"Can we go to the bar?\" offers lead singer Yannis Philappakis. One shot each later, chests puffed out and they're being sprayed by the flashes of about 30 paparazzi bulbs before wandering down the red walkway in the hotel courtyard to chat to the assembled media. \"If we broke up tomorrow, getting nominated here would feel like a concrete achievement,\" says Yannis to a BBC colleague udring one of their many interviews trying to sum up what being nominated for the Mercury Prize means to them. Meanwhile, he's also the only person we've ever seen light up a string of cigarettes on a red carpet. Attendees Martine McCutcheon, Mr Hudson, Seasick Steve and Mat Horne all brush past them. Show time After the \"dazzling\" of the red carpet the band are guided through a warren of corridors into the venue and to their table - decorated generously with alcohol. Foals nervously wait their turn to play live on stage during the pre-recorded Mercury programme. \"Some pretty great performances so far,\" says Jimmy anxiously. \"Laura Marling was my favourite.\" Following on from jazz outsiders Kit Downes Trio, Foals take to the Mercury Prize stage and rattle through their track confidently to huge applause from the hundreds of guests seated in the room. Murmurs around them suggest the 14/1 outsiders could have swung the judges (not that they're supposed to take it into account). Post track Jimmy nips out for a cigarette: \"I feel pretty good now. I didn't realise how nervous I was. \"It's a different kind of show, just all these eyes staring. \"It's an hour and a half until we find out who the winners and losers are and we get dinner in the meantime.

In March, Sheffield Theatres had an 11% Arts Council cut in real terms. \"It is serious, of course it is,\" he said of the economic situation. \"At the same time, we in the arts know that we aren't some kind of sacred sector that can't be affected. \"All that needs to happen for theatre to happen is someone watching and someone doing something in front of them. \"I'm not saying that we'd want to do things with a cheap set because we pride ourselves on our production values, but there are ways of doing things, of being inventive, of telling these stories in inventive, challenging, new ways, that mean we can beat any cuts.\" Evans has been helped by the recent success of Othello, featuring The Wire co-stars Dominic West and Clarke Peters, which became the most successful production in the theatre's history, selling 31,000 tickets. Michael Grandage, who was artistic director from 2000-05 and now runs the Donmar Warehouse in London, recalled a relatively prosperous time when New Labour was putting money into the arts. \"As a result we were able to really do some exciting work,\" he said. \"Cast sizes and the epic nature of those classical works suddenly became possible. If ever there was a case for why subsidy is important in the arts, that was the period when it was proven. \"It steadied us and stopped us from going into liquidation. It gave us a bit of confidence.\" The theatre has used the anniversary to launch the Future 40 Fund, a campaign to encourage members of the public to donate money to secure its future. When the theatre opened in 1971, it was mired in controversy over its thrust stage, which was radical at the time as it is surrounded by the audience, rather than being a traditional theatre layout. Founding artistic director Colin George recalled how critics predicted \"no self-respecting actor would work here\".

The word \"Eurosceptic\" was not coined until the 1980s, to describe a rebellious band of Tory MPs, but hostility to closer European integration dates back decades. Britain voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Economic Community in 1975, but never joined the currency or the passport-free area, and a substantial body of public opinion had always believed the country was better off out. They rarely had a voice at Westminster. The campaign to leave the European Union - via another referendum - took root outside of Parliament. It was pursued by mavericks, political outcasts and a fair few eccentrics. It was a long, and often thankless, battle - and it began before Britain had even joined. 1961 - The birth of Euroscepticism With World War II fresh in the memory, and the Empire rapidly disintegrating, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan decided Britain's future lay in Europe. His, in the end unsuccessful, application to join the six nation European Economic Community enraged many in his party, who saw it as a betrayal of the Commonwealth nations, which were Britain's biggest trading partners at the time. Many in Labour viewed the EEC as a business-led Tory con trick. Both sides fretted about the loss of independence and status it would seem to entail. Most opponents of membership tended to be on the far left and right fringes, but there were big, mainstream voices in both the Labour and Tory parties that were also firmly against it. \"I'm not very keen on the Common Market. After all, we beat Germany and we beat Italy and we saved France and Belgium and Holland. I never see why we should go crawling to them,\" said former Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee. The first substantial campaign against British membership - The Anti-Common Market League - was formed in June 1961, by a bunch of disgruntled Conservatives. It had broadened out into a cross-party effort by the following September, when it staged a mass anti-Common Market rally at London's Albert Hall. 1967 - Keep Britain Out Euroscepticism has always attracted colourful characters. Major Oliver Smedley was a decorated World War II veteran and pirate radio entrepreneur, who was cleared of murder in 1966 after he shot a business rival in a dispute over a transmitter. Maj Smedley, who quit the Liberal Party after being slow-handclapped at the party's conference, believed joining the \"protectionist\" EEC would lead to higher food prices and poverty. His Keep Britain Out campaign merged with the Anti-Common Market League in the late 1960s and is still going today, as Get Britain Out. 1973 - Britain goes in On 1 January 1973, Britain officially joined the EEC, at the third attempt. Opinion polls suggested the nation was divided over Tory Prime Minister Ted Heath's decision. Eurosceptics, on the left and right, stepped up their calls for a referendum. 1975 - 'Out of Europe and into the world' There was widespread disbelief in Eurosceptic circles when voters opted by 67% to 33% to stay in the Common Market, in the UK's first nationwide referendum. The vote had been called by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson largely as a way to paper over the huge divisions in his party over Europe. Some polls suggested the unlikely alliance of Tony Benn, from the Labour left, and Enoch Powell, Ulster Unionist and former Tory, who emerged as the chief spokesmen for the No campaign, was a turn-off for voters. Whatever the case, the defeat was a body blow to the Eurosceptics. Many lean years followed, with poorly attended meetings, lost election deposits and pamphlets few read, even if polls suggested Britain was turning against the EEC. Labour campaigned to leave the EEC at the 1983 general election but went down to a heavy defeat and the Eurosceptics in its ranks were pushed to the margins. 1988 - 'A European super-state' Margaret Thatcher's Bruges speech was the moment Euroscepticism in the UK was reborn and it arguably set Britain on the path to Brexit. She had travelled to the Belgian city to fire a warning shot across the EEC's bows, over its ambitions to move beyond the single market to create a \"social Europe\", with new employment rights and regulations on business, as well as a single currency. It all smacked of socialism by the backdoor to Mrs Thatcher, rather than the free trade area she had enthusiastically championed in 1975. Britain's \"destiny is in Europe\", she stressed, but added: \"We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.\" It was a riposte to a speech Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, had given to the Trades Union Congress 12 weeks earlier. Which brings us to... 1990 - Up Yours, Delors In 1975, Britain's best-selling newspaper, The Sun, had told its readers: \"We are all Europeans now.\" In November 1990, it called on its front page for them to stick two fingers up to Jacques Delors - \"Up, Yours Delors\", said the headline - to \"tell the French fool where to stuff his ECU\" (the ECU was the forerunner of the euro). The rest of the right-wing tabloids were now just as Eurosceptic, if not as blunt. But calling for Britain to leave was still strictly off limits in the mainstream media and politics. 1991 - The birth of UKIP It began in a dusty office at the London School of Economics. European history lecturer Alan Sked founded the Anti-Federalist League to \"prevent the UK becoming a province of a united European superstate\". The tiny group, which included Nigel Farage among its early recruits, campaigned against the Maastricht Treaty, which would turn the EEC into the European Union, including a commitment to \"ever closer union\" and the free movement of people. The League soon changed its name to the more voter-friendly UK Independence Party and began calling for Britain's exit from the EU. But it was largely ignored, or ridiculed, by the media, and struggled to make an impact. Mr Sked, a former member of the Liberal Party, left in 1997, complaining that it had been taken over by right wingers and racists. 1993 - The Maastricht rebellion Conservative MPs fought a guerrilla war against their own government's support for the Maastricht Treaty. Some of the Maastricht rebels would go on to play leading roles in the 2016 Brexit campaign (before receiving knighthoods), including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Bernard Jenkin. But even the most Eurosceptic among them never spoke publicly about leaving the EU at this stage, preferring instead to talk about \"reform\" or, if they were in a daring mood, \"fundamental reform\". 1997 - Goldsmith weighs in The mercurial billionaire, and father of Conservative minister Zac, founded the Referendum Party to campaign for Britain to be given another say on Europe. He spent more than \u00a37m on the party's 1997 general election campaign - including a glossy promotional video mailed to five million households - for a 2.6% share of the vote. 1999 - Farage goes to Brussels In many ways, Nigel Farage owes his political career to a Belgian mathematician. In 1878, Victor D'Hondt devised the system of proportional representation adopted by the UK in 1999 for elections to the European Parliament. UKIP and other smaller parties, like the Greens, had stood no chance under first-past-the-post. Suddenly the door to a seat in Brussels was open, and Mr Farage and two other UKIP candidates were first through it, despite receiving virtually no national media coverage for their campaign. \"Brexit wouldn't have happened without proportional representation or, ironically, the European Parliament,\" Mr Farage told Channel 4 News this week. \"It was actually getting elected to that place that gave us some kind of platform,\" he added, and UKIP used the \"wherewithal\" provided by the Brussels parliament to \"build a UK political movement\". The same year saw the arrival of Dominic Cummings, future mastermind of the Vote Leave campaign, on the Eurosceptic scene, as campaign director of anti-euro pressure group Business for Sterling. 2004 - The BBC sacks a daytime TV presenter UKIP was still struggling for public recognition and credibility when, out of nowhere, Robert Kilroy-Silk joined it. A household name, due to his long-running daytime talk show, Kilroy, he had been fired by the BBC over comments he'd made in a newspaper column. Mr Kilroy-Silk's brief UKIP adventure - and the massive injection of cash that came with it, from self-made Yorkshire millionaire Paul Sykes - helped the party to the best results in its history in the 2004 European elections, gaining 2.6 million votes. UKIP - and its call for a referendum on leaving the EU - were now on the political map. 2006 - 'Fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists' It's possible to track the rise of UKIP in insults directed at its members by Conservative leaders, as they tried in vain to stem the flow of supporters to Nigel Farage's \"People's Army\". In 2004, Michael Howard - who would go on to be a Brexit supporter - called them \"extremists\" and \"cranks\". Two years later David Cameron refused to apologise for labelling them \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\", handing UKIP a publicity coup and a rallying cry. 2011 - Tory MPs call for a referendum Some 81 Tory MPs defied Prime Minister David Cameron to vote in favour of an EU referendum in October 2011. Mr Cameron easily won the vote, with Labour support, but leaving the EU - as one of a range of options - was now firmly on the agenda at Westminster. Mr Cameron would announce plans for a referendum just under two years later. 2014 - UKIP runs riot Nigel Farage had finally found a way to turn the latent Euroscepticism in large sections of the British public into electoral gold, as concerns about the flow of migrants from new EU states were added to the traditional cry for freedom from bossy Brussels bureaucracy. UKIP seemed unstoppable in 2014. It topped the poll in the European elections, with a massive 3.8 million votes - and made further gains in local elections to consolidate the breakthrough it had made in 2012. Then Mr Farage turned up the heat on David Cameron by unveiling two Tory defectors, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, in quick succession, with the threat of more to come. 2016 - Johnson joins the Leave campaign David Cameron had been stunned by the number of Conservative MPs who had joined the Leave campaign, not realising the depth of Eurosceptic feeling in his party. But he had not expected Boris Johnson to join the cause. The official Leave campaign wanted nothing to do with Nigel Farage over fears he would scare off floating voters. Its recruitment of Mr Johnson - one of the biggest, and most popular, names in British politics - was a game changing moment. Euroscepticism had finally shaken off its reputation as an eccentric fringe movement. Recalling UKIP's early days in the European Parliament in 1999, at a farewell press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Farage said: \"We were considered pretty odd. Perhaps we were, I don't know, certainly very eccentric. \"And as those years went by I did begin to wonder whether I might become the patron saint of lost causes.\" But now, he added, \"far from being a minority sport, Euroscepticism had become the mainstream, settled view in the United Kingdom\".", "output": "It used to be a fringe obsession ignored by the political mainstream.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "British comedian Brand voices EB, a young rabbit more interested in being a rock star than taking over as the Easter Bunny.

It would be a fairly significant milestone in the process, initiated by the European Commission after RBS and Lloyds were rescued by taxpayers in 2008, of increasing competition in the UK banking market. RBS is being forced to sell 315 branches, serving around 250,000 small business customers, 1200 medium size businesses and 1.8 million retail customers. What RBS is selling is a smaller business in the round than what Lloyds has been forced to de-merge (631 branches recently renamed as TSB, to be floated on the stock market next year) but it is bigger in the economically important small-business market. In the bidding process, the main rival to Corsair - whose vice chairman is Lord Davies, a trade minister in the last Labour government and ex-chief executive of Standard Chartered - was another private-equity group, led by Blackstone of the US. RBS's directors take the view that both private equity bids offer better value to RBS's owners - notably taxpayers with an 81% stake in the bank - than the bid from a large consortium of City investment institutions, chaired by the former Tesco finance director, Andy Higginson. \"The Higginson offer was way below Corsair and Blackstone on value\" says a source. I reported earlier this week that RBS had rejected the Higginson offer. Apparently in price terms, there is not a great deal to separate Corsair and Blackstone - which is not a great surprise, given that they have similar business models and are working with the same data. However Corsair is preferred because of its \"vision\" for the bank, said a source, and its \"controls\". RBS will retain a stake in the hived-off bank, as and when it is sold to Corsair, so that it will benefit from any increase in its value, as and when it is floated on the London Stock Exchange. It had planned to sell the whole thing to Santander, but that deal fell through a year ago.

The 55-year-old was dismissed for medical inefficiency in 2016. Since then, the Chief Inspector of Prisons has ordered the government to improve the jail. Ms Ward told an employment tribunal in London: \"In the two years since I've left it has gone into special measures, so everything I've been reporting has been played out in the media.\" She said in her witness statement that the \"real reason\" for her dismissal was \"a combination of all of the complaints that I made\". \"I think that I gained a reputation as somebody who would complain about things in the prison that were fundamentally wrong: we weren't addressing behaviour, we weren't protecting the people who were in the prison,\" the statement said. \"I think they wanted to get rid of me to silence me.\" How bad is Nottingham Prison? Ms Ward joined the prison service in 1985 and moved to Nottingham Prison in 1997. She said a lot of experienced staff left the jail \"very quickly\" in 2012 when the government introduced something called the Voluntary Early Departure Scheme, known as VEDS. She said this had a \"huge impact\" on the way the wings were run and discipline suffered. \"Many experienced officers who knew how to deal with prisoners left on VEDS,\" she said. \"We lacked officers with sufficient experience of dealing with prisoners and we also didn't have enough experienced officers remaining to do our jobs properly. \"There were some officers who didn't do their share and that put pressure on people like me who wanted to maintain a proper atmosphere in the prison.\" Ms Ward said the drug mamba started contributing to problems at the prison from 2014 onwards. It got in by being thrown over the wall, passed in during visits or through corrupt prison officers, she claimed. \"I soon began to encounter prisoners who were on this drug and my experience of it was that it was very dangerous,\" she said. \"On one occasion I saw a prisoner who was on mamba clutching his chest and I thought he was having a heart attack. \"More and more prisoners were taking the drug and had bad reactions, were passing out, getting aggressive without any apparent reason. I told Governor Langford but nothing was done.\" She said one prisoner threatened her on 31 December 2014 when she tried to get him back behind his door. \"Prisoner B was standing nose to nose with me and shouting, 'you're the only one who gives me any trouble',\" she said. \"Other officers were nearby and did nothing. He then went off to the gym.\" She claimed officers stopped challenging inmates when the prison introduced a policy that meant any touching had to be documented on a \"use of force\" form. \"The prisoners were fully aware of who had the upper hand and would taunt the officers and be openly disobedient, for example when being told to return to their cells,\" she said. \"This is a problem because it changes the balance of power in the prison if the prisoners know that the prison officers will avoid confrontations.\" She initially reported problems verbally but said this used to \"fall on deaf ears\", so she started putting them in writing, submitting about 100 \"security information reports\" in three years. One report in August 2014 involved a fellow prison officer who had been \"threatening and aggressive\" towards her. She was concerned he was being \"groomed\" by inmates to allow them to do what they wanted, such as being let out of their cells to deal drugs or exchange contraband. In October 2015, she was suspended from all duties for allegedly assaulting a prisoner the previous month, which she believed was \"entirely unjustified\". 'Troubled life' She had a disciplinary hearing on 24 February 2016 and all of the charges against her were dismissed. However, she was concerned about going back to work and was signed off sick with stress in March 2016. She returned to work six months later but was eventually dismissed for medical inefficiently in November 2016. \"I am devastated that after dedicating my career to helping people who have often had a troubled life themselves, I am ending it in the employment tribunal because I have refused to be silent about wrongdoing,\" she said.

She said those firms not actually trying to fill a recruitment gap \"are trying to retain staff so they don't go elsewhere\". Cardiff is facing competition from London and Bristol among other cities. Ms Jones, a patents attorney and partner at UDL in Cardiff, said: \"When I talk to software companies about what their biggest challenge is, nine times out of 10 it's recruitment. \"These are very skilled positions, needing skilled graduates with the right coding and development skills.\" She said there was a lure of working in London and firms in south Wales were having to be creative in trying to entice people \"in a candidates' market\". Some were finding it difficult, even when offering \u00a360,000 salaries. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has said fintech is the fastest growing sector in the UK. It covers a wide range of technology companies, from those involved in price comparison sites, to new ways of transferring, borrowing or managing money. Emma Williams, head of marketing at Credas in Penarth Marina, said: \"If you buy a financial product there's some sort of fintech involved. If you go for a mortgage or buy a house, you'll get exposed to some sort of technology that's up and coming.\" Cedas has been in business for about a year and has developed an app that uses facial recognition to check the validity of a person and their documents, for buying a house or getting work. Financial technology companies are often relatively small dynamic companies and, by their very nature, tend to be below the radar. For example, Active Quote employs 130 people in Cardiff and has helped 100,000 customers with products like health insurance. But most people have not heard of it because the firm works behind the scenes providing technology for well-known comparison sites. The team also started the online investment management venture Wealthify two years ago. Only 15 people work for it at the moment but a large investment from Aviva means it is planning rapid expansion. Chief executive Richard Theo said fintech was a \"real revolution taking off and we have a real hotspot of that in Wales\". While the technology means companies can employ fewer people, Mr Theo said the Welsh economy gains from people doing better jobs. \"It's the software guys, the marketing guys and the investment guys, it's not the menial work or the traditional call centre stuff, it's quality jobs,\" he added.

As yet, there are no official figures for numbers working in fintech in Wales. But Economy Secretary Ken Skates is examining the sector in his first task and finish group and said the Welsh Government was \"keen\" to support and develop it. Mr Theo said Cardiff's challenges were probably no different from other cities but it could still do more. \"We've got a great academic infrastructure but we've got to do a bit of work to get them turning out the skills we need - more people with digital marketing expertise, more software engineers, the kind of dot-net skills that financial services like us actually need.\"", "output": "Some of the fastest growing financial technology firms in Wales are at risk of being held back by skills shortages, a leading specialist lawyer has warned.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Conor MacauleyBBC NI Agriculture & Environment Correspondent The anaerobic digester is being built near Ballybofey in County Donegal and will treat 25,000 tonnes every year.

About 6,000 people work in the poultry meat sector in Northern Ireland and it is a major contributor to the economy. But finding a solution to the 270,000 tonnes of waste it produces a year has been a headache. Some of it is spread as fertiliser on fields, but it is high in phosphorous and Northern Ireland already has phosphorous-rich soils.

The BBC understands those missing could number about 70, with the 30 likely to be among that number. Three of those who died have been identified. There was nothing to suggest the fire was started deliberately, police said. Hundreds of mourners stood arm in arm at a vigil and held a two-minute silence for victims of the fire. Many wept openly as candles illuminated the road outside the Latymer Christian Centre, yards from the site of the blaze. The fire broke out shortly before 01:00 BST on Wednesday. It tore through all floors of the building and took more than 200 firefighters 24 hours to bring it under control. Mahad Egal, who escaped his fourth floor flat with his family, said: \"At first it seemed it was controllable, but really quickly the fire started to rise as the cladding caught fire. It is incredible we survived.\" Emergency services spent a third day searching for bodies in the burnt-out Grenfell Tower in North Kensington. The first protest began at around 15:00 at the town hall and scores later joined it. At about 16:30, people began to rush up the steps and make their way into the building. One member of the public said: \"Nobody knows what is happening. People are so angry. Those people shouldn't be sleeping in the street.\" Mustafa Al Mansur, who organised the protest, read a statement from the council which promised to re-house as many people locally as they could and to provide funding for those affected. But he called the response \"flimsy\" with \"no concrete answers\" - especially on the question of number of residents who lived in the flats. \"The people were not satisfied with the answers,\" he told BBC News. \"The people were getting frustrated and they walked towards the building. They did not force themselves inside. They got inside the main building and were in the foyer, just speaking.\" Police then arrived on the scene and formed a barricade, which Mr Al Mansur said led to \"physical confrontation\" between the two sides. There were then angry scenes outside the Clement James Centre, in North Kensington, where the meeting with the prime minister and residents of the tower had been held. Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance and there were scuffles outside as organisers appealed for calm. Mrs May had faced criticism for not meeting with survivors in the immediate aftermath, unlike Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Asked about the reaction of the crowd, Mrs May defended the government's response. \"What I am now absolutely focused on is ensuring we get that support on the ground,\" she said. \"The government is making money available, we are ensuring we are going to get to the bottom of what has happened, we will ensure that people are re-housed. We need to make sure that actually happens.\" Mr Corbyn wrote an open letter to the prime minister, calling for the public inquiry to ensure \"all necessary lessons are learned\". The Labour leader added: \"[The inquiry] must be empowered to consider all the steps that were, or were not, taken leading up to and contributing to this most terrible incident. \"It must also identify the urgent steps that need to be taken in relation to fire safety standards for other buildings of this nature.\" Large crowds of people also gathered in Westminster and made their way to Downing Street. The crowd was heard chanting, \"Justice for Grenfell\", along with \"May must go\" and \"blood on your hands\". A peaceful march started making its way down Whitehall and was halted by police outside Downing Street, before moving to Oxford Circus, where demonstrators carried out a sit-down protest. The march continued up Regent Street, where they held a minute's silence outside the BBC's headquarters, and continued towards Marble Arch and Notting Hill, ending at Lancaster Gate. The \u00a35m Grenfell Tower Residents' Discretionary Fund, announced by Mrs May, includes the aim to re-house residents within three weeks as close to where they lived before as possible, to pay for temporary housing in the meantime and to provide extra financial assistance. During her meeting with survivors, the PM also said they would be consulted on the terms of the public inquiry announced on Thursday and receive state funding for legal representation. Mrs May said: \"Everyone affected by this tragedy needs reassurance that the government is there for them at this terrible time - and that is what I am determined to provide.\" Royal visit The Queen and Duke of Cambridge also met volunteers, residents and community representatives during a visit to the Westway Sports Centre. The Queen paid tribute to the \"bravery\" of firefighters and the \"incredible generosity\" of volunteers now offering support. So far in the investigation: First victims named On Thursday, the first victim of the fire was named as Syrian refugee Mohammed Alhajali, 23. The Syria Solidarity Campaign said Mr Alhajali, a civil engineering student, had been in a flat on the 14th floor when the fire broke out, and had spent two hours on the phone to a friend in Syria. He had been trying to get through to his family while he was waiting to be rescued. His older brother, Omar, told the BBC he had lost Mohammed on the way out of the building.

Their appeal is attributed to having \"squashed\" faces and wrinkled noses. The British Veterinary Association said the surge in popularity of these dogs had \"increased animal suffering\". Sean Wensley, president of the British Veterinary Association (BVA), said: \"Prospective owners need to consider that these dogs can suffer from a range of health problems, from eye ulcers to severe breathing difficulties. \"We strongly encourage people to choose a healthier breed or a crossbreed instead.\" 'He scratches his bulging eyes' The warning has been echoed by the PDSA, the Royal Veterinary College, the RSPCA and the Kennel Club. Meanwhile, evidence suggests that an increasing number of the dogs - more correctly known as brachycephalic or short-muzzled dogs - are being abandoned by their owners. Six dog rescue companies told the BBC that the breeds were being given up in greater numbers. Battersea Dogs Home and Bluecross Animal Rescue received a total of 314 \"flat-faced\" dogs in 2015, compared to 226 in 2014, an increase of 39%. Both charities said they were carrying out more surgical procedures to clear the airways of the dogs they brought in - removing obstructive pieces of tissue and widening nostrils. Steve Gosling, a vet at Battersea Dogs Home, said one of their dogs, Winston the bulldog, was a typical example. He said: \"He's a lovely little chap, about eight years old. He was left with us by his owners and, like many dogs from this breed, he suffers from what we call brachycephalic obstructed airways syndrome. \"In other words, because he has a really short nose that we've bred into him, he has quite serious breathing difficulties.\" 'Tip of iceberg' Mr Gosling said the charity operates on dogs like Winston \"quite regularly\" because shortness of breath can be a very distressing condition. He added: \"And we don't want to re-home animals knowing that we can improve their quality of life.\" A recent survey by the Royal Veterinary College suggests many owners of brachycephalic dogs are not aware of the common underlying health problems. Caroline Reay, chief vet at Bluecross Animal Hospital in Merton, said: \"Most owners - and some vets - think airway noise, and consequently reduced activity, is normal, so the problems are rarely discussed. \"And I think the number of operations we are carrying out is really only the tip of the iceberg\". The extremely broad head shape seen in in pugs and bulldogs is not a natural look. It developed as a result of intense, selective breeding. It has led the RSPCA to call for an urgent review of the breed standards, which are decided by the Kennel Club, and specify how every type of dog should look. Caroline Kisko, the Kennel Club secretary, said: \"The breed standards were set many years ago. If you look back through history there are some dire things that went on, and undoubtedly we would accept all responsibility for that. \"But I would say that in the here-and-now, after all of the changes to the standards that were made in 2009, we would expect dogs to be far healthier if they are winning prizes at dogs shows.\" Mrs Kisko said the problems with brachycephalic dogs were being perpetuated in the main by disreputable puppy farms. She said: \"If we continue to allow dogs to be brought in from central and eastern Europe where there is no concern for how these dogs are bred, it is inevitable that pet owners will end up with dogs they can't deal with. \"These are breeds which aren't hugely suited to pet homes. If you want a pet that will run around and chase a ball and so on, don't go out and buy any short-faced breed based on what celebrities are walking around with under their arm.\" This summer the Royal Veterinary College opened the UK's first specialist clinic to address problems in flat-faced dogs.

He is hoping the October sun, and the charter flights that come with it, will bring in more customers to his seafood restaurant Betty's Place, on the banks of the Sal river in south Goa. This year, he is also hoping his favourite customers - the British holidaymakers - will return to the state. \"The British are adventurous. They go out every day, and want to try different activities. They were the main takers for our day-long dolphin, birdwatching and backwater cruises,\" says Mr Barreto. He remembers a time when the winter sunseekers from the UK were the largest group of foreign visitors to Goa. That was, of course, before recession hit Europe, the holiday market graph went south and Mr Barreto's business took a direct hit. The highpoint was the 1990s when some 190,000 Britons headed to Goa for 14-night seaside getaways before security issues post-9/11 threw the global travel sector out of whack. By 2014 though, Russian tour operators had managed to sell Goa holidays to 189,000 Russians, outnumbering the 129,000 British arrivals - both still the largest chunk of Goa's 513,000 foreign visitors, according to the Economic Survey of Goa. This year, though, Goa is waking up to the fact that the Russian market has also almost gone bust. Sanctions, low oil prices and the falling rouble have hit the Russian economy. As a result, charter flights have dropped to 895 in 2014-15 from 1,128 in 2013-14. Goa's tourism trade body (TTAG) and a state-level marketing committee went into a huddle and decided to step up efforts to bring back British and West European travellers. The issue figured in the state legislative assembly in August, when a legislator from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, Michael Lobo, said Britons were avoiding Goa due to rising incidents of bag snatching, the murder of British teenager Scarlett Keeling and Goa's inability to solve its garbage management problems. Another reason behind the drastic drop in visitors was India tightening its visa regime in 2008 after the Mumbai attacks. Single-entry visas replaced multiple-entry ones and long visa queues became the norm. Those exiting the country could only return after two months - now reduced to two weeks - and tourist visa holders still have to leave the country after 180 days. The TTAG concentrated on fixing the things it could. It lobbied the government in Delhi to extend e-visa and visa-on-arrival facilities to visitors from the UK, Scandinavia, and Western Europe. It petitioned the authorities to reduce visa fees for British visitors to \u00a340 ($62) for a one-month tourist visa from \u00a3105 ($163), sidestepping the reciprocity principle that normally underpins visa fees. TTAG also pushed for a rollback of proposed increases in aircraft landing fees and managed to secure three extra landing slots per week for Thomas Cook aircraft bringing British tourists from Gatwick, according to spokesman Ralph de Souza. \"It was only after we did an in-depth study and presented the economic spin-offs to the ministry, were we able to have the system eased,\" he said. Former construction professional Robert Drury, 62, who, since 2007, has been spending most of his year in Goa's Arpora, says the two-month rule has been particularly expensive. \"Now we just go back to the UK or maybe Thailand for two weeks after our 180 days are up. I don't think there's any place else I'd rather be. The cost of living is cheap, the sunny weather is perfect for my health, and there's a terrific selection of restaurants my wife and I can frequent.\" A former risk manager in London and Nigeria, Paul Gatward says that though Sri Lanka and Malaysia are also wooing long-term visitors, and Thailand and Vietnam may be marginally cheaper, \"Goa is perceived as a far easier place to come and spend time. English is widely spoken, it is peaceful, touristy, coastal, and the locals can be very helpful\". But the big question is whether Goa will be able to woo back the two-week holidaymaker who once headed there for a quiet soak in the sun. Britain's Monarch Holidays is already marketing the reduced visa fees. Guitry Velho, manager of the Heritage Village Club hotel in south Goa's Arrosim, is upbeat. \"We have always had a majority of British tourists. They appreciate us and what we provide for them, and tend to stay for a minimum of 14 nights just enjoying South Goa.\" Hotelier and TTAG head Francisco de Braganca said: \"The feedback is that they are the most preferred guests, the kind every hotelier and restaurant owner is most comfortable with.\"", "output": "Pamela D'Mello explains why India's western state of Goa is making a concerted effort to woo back tourists from Britain.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Lauren TurnerEntertainment & arts reporter But these were no dramatic visions of bright lights, accompanied by the sound of celestial angels. And nor is she particularly unlucky. Instead, she believes these near-misses are all part and parcel of the human experience - and she wants to \"normalise\" them for the sake of her young daughter, whose severe allergies necessitate hospital dashes several times a year. That's not to say that some of O'Farrell's brushes with death - as recollected in her unconventional memoir I Am, I Am, I Am - don't leave your heart in your mouth as you read about them. They included: They also leave you feeling that it could have been you. Or, that things could have been very different for O'Farrell. The fact that they weren't is why she wanted to tell her story, having previously vowed to never write about her private life. And when she did decide she wanted to write I Am, I Am, I Am (its title comes from a Sylvia Plath poem), she refused to take an advance, settling on a token \u00a31 when her agent insisted for legal reasons. She jokes she spent it all on a supermarket trolley. \"In a way, the format I chose - to describe a life through this one type of experience - allowed me to reveal almost as much as I conceal,\" she says from her home in Edinburgh, where she lives with her husband and three children. \"There's a lot I don't say in the book - even if I can join the dots between those things, others can't.\" The best-selling author has published seven novels to date. She has been nominated for the Costa Novel Award three times and won it in 2010 for her book The Hand that First Held Mine. Meanwhile, her novel The Distance Between Us won a Somerset Maugham Award. \"I'm in my 40s now. And I don't like the phrase mid-life crisis, but I do think that when you reach that point, you start to look back at things you didn't think about at the time, especially when you are bringing up children and what they're going to experience.\" It was especially the experiences of her middle child that sparked the idea for I Am, I Am, I Am. \"The book started as a project for her. She has a life-threatening medical condition. She has a lot of brushes with death herself. \"She has this very extreme allergic reaction which we can usually allay but sometimes we can't. She has an awful lot to cope with for someone her age. \"I wanted to make sense of it for her and for myself - the challenges of parenting a child. You have to metabolise the trauma and give it back to them in an acceptable form.\" O'Farrell says she wanted to tell her eight-year-old daughter: \"You can have a full life and be all you want to be, even with all this happening.\" And as to why she chose to write it as a memoir, she says there is a \"human need for narrative - a need to explain the inexplicable\". So when her daughter was in hospital, O'Farrell told her about the time she was in hospital as a child, with encephalitis - a condition the doctors feared would kill her, or at least leave her in a wheelchair. So does she think she has more near-death experiences than other people? Because 17 does sound like a lot. \"I think I've probably had more than most people,\" she muses. \"I thought it was quite normal but when I've told people the title (the full title being I Am, I Am, I Am - Seventeen Brushes With Death), they've said 'what??'. \"So maybe it's not normal after all. \"A lot of them are linked to the illness I had.\" She opens up about the aftermath of the condition, which caused issues relating to balance and perception. One that wasn't linked to the encephalitis, though, and which opens the memoir, is shocking - an encounter on a secluded path with a man who she feels has been waiting for her, who looms forward with his binocular straps. Before writing this book, she had only ever told her husband about it. \"It's a strange one - and it came out of a conversation with my daughter. She said she wanted to go walking, just her and me. \"At that point, I thought I'm going to have to tell her the story, to say I'd prefer you not to go hiking alone. So I dropped her off at school and came home to write it - but I didn't think I'd show it to anyone. \"Of the people who've read the book, it's amazing how many women say to me, not in as extreme a way, but 'yes' - they had a story that's the same. \"It's something that women have to develop a sense of, when they're safe and when they're not. You have to develop it at a young age.\" Feeling lucky But after all this - does she feel lucky? \"I feel immensely lucky! I have a job I love, three children I absolutely adore. I feel incredibly blessed and incredibly fortunate to have survived.\" Is she someone who takes risks? She says yes, but... \"I think I'm much less like that now I've had children. Especially the way we live, with my daughter's issues, where we have to be vigilant all of the time. I could never take her anywhere in the world that doesn't have first-class medical care. \"But I wouldn't say I'm a cautious or anxious person at all. I'm the one to say - 'Climb that tree!

Navalny was given a suspended sentence for embezzlement in 2014, a conviction widely seen as politically motivated.

Ms Williams shared her experiences with the National Assembly's Petitions Committee which found others had difficultly accessing some services. The Welsh Government said it would consider the committee's findings. Ms Williams, from Ely, Cardiff, who has three other children, said Leo's stillbirth in February 2016 put her in a \"dark hole\". She lost her mother and her sister at a young age but it was Leo's death that led to her seeking help for flashbacks and nightmares. She said a doctor gave her a leaflet with a phone number to access support services, but she wants GPs to organise help for patients, prompting her petition. She told the committee that it was eight months before she started to receive support and she continues to see a community psychiatric nurse. From next month, Ms Williams is also set to start support for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and she has also been diagnosed with other conditions including depression. \"Something needs to be done about mental health in Wales,\" she said. \"I shouldn't have to wait this long.

Ford said the film will show how \"the relationships between him and other characters have developed off-screen\". And he hinted that fans will see \"new aspects\" to Han Solo's personality. Ford and director JJ Abrams spoke to BBC News entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba about the film. HARRISON FORD Lizo Mzimba: What was it about the way Han Solo was written in this film that convinced you it was right to come back? Harrison Ford: I think it mostly lay in the telling of the stories of his relationships with other characters in the story. And the part he plays in the progression of the story, mostly through his relationships with the new young actors - Daisy Ridley and John Boyega principally in this new story. And it had to do with the opportunity to work with my friend JJ Abrams, whose work I have admired for a long time. LM: How much did you put nostalgia to one side and just concentrate on playing the role? HF: Completely. I don't think nostalgia is very useful to me. There is a story to be told, there's behaviour to create or to bring to the screen that will help tell that story, and nostalgia is just not really a big part of my emotional package anyway. LM: So it was easy when you met Chewbacca for the first time or walked onto the Millennium Falcon to put any emotion to one side and concentrate on being Han Solo and again after all these years? HF: Yeah, you're there to bring some aspect of truth or recognisability to the moment for the audience. LM: What is it about the character that has made him such a favourite over the decades, and how has he changed in this film? HF: Each of the characters has a part to play, and there are people in the audience for each of the characters. Princess Leia has people that relate to her more strongly than other characters. The same with Luke Skywalker. Of the character that I play, who had a kind of ironic distance from the mythology, I think many people identified with that point of view, and so embraced the character of Han Solo. This new opportunity to play the character again recognises a passage of time, and there are indications in the film about how he came to develop, how the relationships between him and other characters have developed off-screen and so it adds some degree of interest and there are new aspects of his nature, perhaps, which we'll see. JJ ABRAMS LM: When you started this project, you had a vision you wanted to put on screen and also a level of anxiety. How close to your original vision do you think you've got to, and how's the anxiety been? JJ Abrams: It's a lot of anxiety. It's an insane amount of pressure. But I will say that it is offset by the work that everyone has done. The amazing work that has - to answer the first question - not just helped realise a vision I had at the beginning of this process, but elevated it enormously and exceeded all expectations. Every day as it gets closer to this movie coming out, I'm more and more excited for people to see the work this cast has done - the new and the established - and the amazing vision effects, the music that John Williams wrote. The work is the thing that has been, if anything, a salve for the anxiety. LM: We're a few days away from release, yet so little is known about the movie. How hard has it been keeping that level of secrecy when you have got thousands upon thousands of people working on it over two years? JJA: Mostly it's just about threatening them! No. It's been a group of extraordinary artists, designers, actors, musicians, marketers, everything. It's been an amazing army of people on this campaign, but it seems like to a person... Everyone wants the same thing, which is for people to experience a Star Wars movie and not have it to be ruined like so many films are before it comes out. I can't tell you how excited I am for you to meet these new characters and see the story, and it's frustrating that you haven't gotten to see the movie yet because it would be so much easier to talk about aspects of it, but at the same time it makes me nuts when I go to see a movie and I feel like I already know what's going to happen. LM: How difficult has it been planning when you release bits of information and bits of footage, and has everything go according to plan? No bad moments? JJA: We had a general sense of a strategy going out, but every day there's a new opportunity, a new request, a new slip, a new leak. There's always something going on. Our focus has tried to be on making a movie that's worth people's time and not so much the selling of it, which I know a lot of people are doing full-time. LM: John and Daisy are two Londoners, two Brits in the lead roles - what was it about them that convinced you they were right? JJA: I was required to hire Brits... That's not true. They were just amazing. Daisy first of all is a revelation. She's unbelievable in this movie. John, I already knew from Attack the Block, who I just adored in that film. I think he was 17 when he acted in that movie and made me laugh and made me cry and was just so wonderful. I got to know him a little bit and we were all just lucky to find these actors, and our British casting director Nina Gold brought them in and we couldn't be more grateful.

Mr Farage, who has led opposition to allowing open immigration from Romania and Bulgaria in the new year, said refugees were \"a very different thing\". The UK government has no plans to accept Syrian refugees, saying it is better to offer financial help. Mr Farage said: \"I think refugees are a very different thing to economic migration and I think this country should honour the 1951 declaration on refugee status that was agreed. \"It was agreed with the UN and even through the European Court, which sadly has changed its role. \"But the original ideas of defining what a refugee is were good ones and I think, actually, there is a responsibility on all of us in the free West to try and help some of those people fleeing Syria, literally in fear of their lives.\" 'Miserably failing' He said it was time for \"a proper debate\" about \"the difference between a refugee - who fears for his or her life - or somebody moving simply for economic benefit\". While Mr Farage did not put a figure on the estimated nine million Syrians displaced by war who should be allowed into the UK, Labour wants to accept 400 to 500. On Saturday, the leaders of Britain's three main political parties issued a statement backing a UN appeal to raise \u00a34bn to help Syrian refugees. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg said the fate of a Syrian generation \"hangs in the balance\" with four million children caught up in the civil conflict. The leaders said the UK would add to the \u00a3523m it had already committed and urged other nations to do the same. The UK says its aid is providing support including food, medical care and relief items for people in Syria and to refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. The government said while it has no plans to resettle or provide temporary protection to Syrian refugees, it was giving \"as much help as possible\" to people in the region and its \u00a3500m pledge was \"more than the other EU member states combined\". It said more than 1,100 Syrian nationals had been granted asylum in the year up to September, and asylum claims would be considered \"on their merits and in line with the immigration rules\". Health minister Dan Poulter told the BBC: \"It's a very complex issue in Syria, as we know, and there are great concerns over the human rights issues there. The line the government is taking at the moment is the right one.\" But former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell told the BBC earlier this week the UK had a \"responsibility\" to help those affected. \"It would be entirely reasonable for the UK to take its share of responsibility for refugees and I think it's unfortunate - to put it as mildly as I possibly can - that we have closed our minds to that possibility, when other countries in Europe have taken a much more generous position,\" he said. Mark Pritchard, Conservative MP, told BBC Radio 4's The World this Weekend he expected the government to change its mind - either \"willingly or unwillingly\". \"Clearly we can't take all the refugees but we should play our part as an open-hearted, compassionate country,\" he said. \"There's real suffering and we need to do our bit along with the rest of the international community.\" Fellow Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told the same programme he believed Mr Farage's comments were \"political tokenism\". \"You're talking about a few hundred [people] out of a few million,\" he said. \"What criteria would we use to say who can come and who can't? \"What we need is a politically-negotiated solution to this problem.\" In a report released earlier this month, Amnesty International accused European Union leaders of \"miserably failing\" to provide a safe haven to Syrians. Ten member states have offered to take in refugees and only 12,000 people, it said. Italy - like the UK - has offered no places at all, the organisation said.

Its authority is challenged by an Islamist-led administration installed by a parliament whose mandate has long run out but which is in control of the capital, Tripoli. Some elements of the two rival groups have signed up to a United Nations-sponsored power-sharing deal but others remain opposed and peace remains elusive. It is the militias operating across the country, thought to number nearly 2,000, who are really calling the shots. Most recently, fighters from the so-called Islamic State (IS) have established a stronghold in the central coastal city of Sirte, and have advanced towards nearby oil sites in Sidra and Ras Lanuf, an attractive source of revenue for the militant group. NON-JIHADIST GROUPS Libya Dawn Libya Dawn is a grouping of pro-Islamist militias that in summer 2014 attacked Tripoli International Airport and went on to seize large parts of the capital. The militia alliance can be viewed as the \"armed forces\" of the General National Congress (GNC), the former parliament which has been reconvened in Tripoli. Libya Dawn, which has acquired military planes, controls virtually all coastal cities, from Misrata to the border with Tunisia as well as cities further south, including Gharyan, Nalut and Jadu in the mainly Berber mountain range of Nafusa. The name Libya Dawn originally referred to the militias' operation to seize Tripoli but soon came to refer to the armed group coming under its umbrella. Many of its fighters came from the city of Misrata, but in the last year the powerful militias based in that city appear to have drifted from the Libya Dawn coalition. There appears to have been a rift within the militia over support for the UN-sponsored talks and the proposed Government of National Accord, which seeks to unite the rival governments. Libya Shield The Libya Shield grouping is made up of several militias of the same name that operate in various parts of the country. The Central Libya Shield supports the defunct GNC and is viewed by the unrecognized Tripoli authorities as part of its \"Ministry of Defence\" forces. The Central Shield is further broken down into smaller groups. Its Third Force seized control of Birak al-Shati airport in central Libya, over 700km south of Tripoli. The Shield's Benghazi branch (known as Libya Shield Force 1) is led by prominent Islamist commander Wisam Bin-Hamid, who has fought alongside the now deceased commander of the hardline al-Qaeda-linked Ansar al-Sharia group, Muhammad al-Zahawi. Bin-Hamid is also a field commander in the Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council (see below). Other pro-GNC groups In addition to Libya Dawn, the GNC also relies on other armed groups that it deems to come under the control of its self-proclaimed \"commander-in-chief\", GNC Speaker Nuri Abu-Sahmain. These include Battalion 166, which alongside Libya Dawn forces, has engaged in clashes with IS in and around Sirte. The militias reportedly withdrew from Sirte ahead of IS's takeover of key swathes of the city in May 2015, prompting the internationally-recognised authorities in the east to accuse them of \"collusion\" with IS. For their part, supporters of the militias said they had not received enough support from the GNC to fight IS. The GNC continues to maintain that the chief of staff when the congress was in power, Maj-Gen Jadallah al-Obaidi, continues to hold the post and head the \"armed forces\". In recent months, the Libyan Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) has become more prominent due to regular clashes with IS militants. The group's politics are unclear, although it may be described as a parastatal force that is broadly supportive of the GNC. It is led by Ibrahim al-Jadran who has condemned IS, although his brother is said to be an IS commander. Early in 2016, the PFG distanced itself from the internationally-recognised government and launched a scathing attack on the commander of the Libyan National Army, saying that he and IS were \"two sides of the same coin\". Libya's rival power bases (as of August 2015) JIHADIST GROUPS Islamic State (IS) A major development on the ground in Libya in 2015 was the emergence of IS. IS built on an existing presence in the eastern city of Derna, a long-time jihadist hub, where groups active pledged allegiance to IS and took over local administration buildings. Although IS was driven out of most areas of Derna in July 2015 it went on to seize \"complete control\" of the central coastal city of Sirte, the birthplace of former leader Muammar Gaddafi. In June, the group's official radio station, al-Bayan, which is already operating in Syria and Iraq, reportedly began broadcasting from Sirte. IS has claimed that it has captured the coastal town of Bin-Jawad, as well as having a \"strong presence\" in Nofilia, Sidra and Ra's Lanuf, putting it significantly closer to installations in Libya's oil rich region, and leading to repeated clashes with the Petroleum Facilities Guard (see above). IS has managed to strike in Tripoli and Benghazi by launching high-profile one-off attacks, for example those targeting embassies and hotels in Tripoli in January and February 2015, and most recently on a police training base in Zliten, near the capital. The group is also present in Benghazi and has cells in Tripoli. IS has divided Libya geographically into three \"provinces\": Barqah (Cyrenaica) in the east, Tripoli (referring to wider Tripolitania) in the west, and Fezzan in the centre and south. According to a UN report issued in December, IS has between 2,000 and 3,000 fighters in Libya, including 1,500 in Sirte. The group seems to be attracting fighters from sub-Saharan countries. The main armed militias in the fight against IS in the city are the Derna Mujahidin Shura Council and the Abu-Salim Martyrs Brigade, which are known for their ties to Ansar al-Sharia (see below). Ansar al-Sharia Al-Qaeda's Libyan affiliate, Ansar al-Sharia, is most prominent in eastern Libya. In Benghazi, its militants have been present since the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011 and have been continuously battling the Libyan National Army (LNA) of the internationally recognized government based in Tobruk (see below). The group also has a presence in Derna and Sabratha in the west. The militia has been accused of involvement in the attack on the US consulate in September 2012 in which Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed and is listed by the United States as a terrorist organisation. It uses its Twitter account, which is routinely suspended and reopened, to advertise its attacks on army forces. Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council A coalition of Islamist militias, the Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council is made up of groups including Ansar al-Sharia, the 17 February Brigade and the Rafallah al-Sahati Brigade. As with its key component Ansar al-Sharia, the Benghazi Shura Council is another firm opponent of the LNA. It maintains strongholds in parts of the eastern city that army forces have struggled to seize. IS has criticized the Benghazi Shura Council for not pledging allegiance to the group, accusing it of being loyal to Libya Dawn and the \"forces of democracy\". IS has cited these as evidence of the council's \"apostasy\". Derna Mujahidin Shura Council Another al-Qaeda-affiliated group, the Derna Mujahidin Shura Council, is a coalition of Islamist militias formed in December 2014. It came into the spotlight particularly in July 2015, after driving IS militants out of most areas of Derna. Clashes between the two groups escalated significantly after IS killed two Islamist figures linked to the Derna Mujahidin Shura Council. Ajdabiya Revolutionaries Shura Council The Ajdabiya Revolutionaries Shura Council is an Islamist militant group based in Ajdabiya, a coastal town west of Benghazi and is led by Muhammad al-Zawi. Twice in January the IS-linked \"news agency\" A'maq reported that al-Zawi and a number of his men had pledged allegiance to IS. The council issued a statement, dated 2 January, saying it had nothing to do with the matter and the pledge represented an individual acts. The militia has been engaged mainly in fighting the LNA. PRO-GOVERNMENT GROUPS Armed forces and allied units On the side of the internationally-recognised authorities are various forces comprising the Libyan National Army (LNA) and units supporting it. Maj-Gen Khalifah Haftar, who in May 2014 launched Operation Dignity against Islamist groups, and had largely operated alongside but outside the military's official ranks, was appointed army commander by the House of Representatives in March 2015. The LNA is supported by various units, including militias (see below) and the Special Forces, al-Saiqa, which declared their support for Gen Haftar at the time of his announcement of Operation Dignity. Along with the government forces' Tanks Battalion, the al-Saiqa forces have been particularly targeted by Islamist militia attacks. Zintan, al-Sawaiq, al-Qaqa Battalions The Zintan, al-Sawaiq and al-Qaqa brigades are anti-Islamist militias that operate especially in the west of Libya. The powerful Zintan militia supports the internationally-recognised authorities and has clashed on numerous occasions with Libya Dawn. It continues to detain Saif-al-Islam al-Gaddafi, the son of the former leader who was sentenced to death in Tripoli last year, in the western city of Zintan, while most other Gaddafi-era officials are held by pro-Islamist forces in Tripoli. The al-Qaqa and al-Sawaiq battalions are also pro-official authorities and anti-Islamist. They attacked the GNC in Tripoli soon after Operation Dignity was announced in May 2014.

The man, who did not want to be named, said he heard a \"whomp\" so he looked out of an upstairs window and saw the body and \"blood all over the walls of the garden\". \"So I went outside, and it was just then the neighbour came out and he was very shaken,\" he said. The neighbour, who asked not to be named, said a plane spotter, who had been following the flight on an plane tracking app from Clapham Common, had seen the body fall. The plane spotter had arrived almost at the same time as the police and told them the body had fallen from a Kenyan Airways flight. \"If it had been two seconds later, he would have landed on the common where there were hundreds of people - my kids were in the garden 15 minutes before [he fell]\", the neighbour added. \"I spoke to Heathrow.

You could be forgiven for thinking nothing of any significance had happened here recently. Other than journalists arriving, there is little activity, with many people presumably out at work. But every 30 seconds or so the quiet is punctured by the din of jet engines travelling overhead, indicating the road's position directly underneath a major highway for aircraft, heading for Heathrow from across the globe. The Met Police said a post-mortem examination would be carried out in due course and the death was not being treated as suspicious. Kenya Airways said the aircraft was inspected and no damage was reported. A bag, water and some food were found in the landing gear compartment on the aircraft when it landed. Security concerns at Nairobi airport By BBC Reality Check The discovery of the stowaway who started his journey from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi has raised questions about the effectiveness of security checks in place there. The airport is already under a state of heightened security largely responding to the threat posed by the militant group al-Shabab, based in neighbouring Somalia. A similar incident took place in 1997 when the body of a young man was found hanging in the nose-wheel bay of a British Airways flight from Nairobi after it landed at Gatwick Airport. The Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) says a team has been assembled to investigate how the stowaway got on board the plane. The KAA carries out security drills at the airport - most recently in November 2018. A spokesman for Kenya Airways said: \"The 6,840km (4,250-mile) flight takes eight hours and 50 minutes. It is unfortunate that a person has lost his life by stowing aboard one of our aircraft and we express our condolences. \"Kenya Airways is working closely with the relevant authorities in Nairobi and London as they fully investigate this case.\" It is not the first death of this kind on the Heathrow flight path. In June 2015, one man was found dead on the roof of notonthehighstreet.com's headquarters in Richmond, west London, while another was found in a critical condition after they both clung on to a British Airways flight from Johannesburg.

The reports range from being wrongly charged for mysterious bumps and scratches, petrol and even missing seats. The car hire industry says these complaints represent \"a very small proportion of the 55 to 60 million rental transactions that take place annually\" across the EU. However as the UK ECC is not very well known, it believes that the number of complaints it receives represents only a small minority of cases. Credit card charge John Griffiths from Poole in Dorset hired a car last year whilst on holiday in Ireland. A couple of weeks after he returned home he received a letter from the car hire firm informing him that the sum of 450 euro had been charged to his credit card for damage to the rear bumper of his hire car. The damage had been identified in the pre-rental inspection so John Griffiths immediately contacted the company to dispute the charge. \"I was absolutely astounded and in fact very angry. I think it's incredible that they have the right to take money from my credit card without my authorisation.\" As is common in many of these cases, John had an early flight so when he dropped off the car the rental office was shut and there was no member of staff to inspect the car. His money was eventually refunded following the intervention of the UK ECC but many holiday-makers are not so lucky. Tip of the iceberg Jed Mayatt, manager of the UK European Consumer Centre said: \"We knew that complaints about car hire were rising, but when we analysed our database I was really shocked at the scale of the problem.\" Based on historical trends, the UKECC expects the number of disputes to rise to 400 by the end of the year. Complaints to the UKECC are believed to be the tip of the iceberg with many disputes going unreported. The majority of its cases relate to car hire problems in Spain, Italy, France and Ireland. Customers reported a range of hidden charges, including the cost of refuelling when the car had been returned with a full tank of petrol, extra insurance premiums and some holiday-makers paid for cars online yet on collection discovered their booking does not exist. Jed Mayatt from UKECC commented: \"Of course, not all car hires end in tears, but consumers really do need to wise up and take some basic precautions when they are entering into car rental contracts in the EU. \"Consumers are often at their most vulnerable during tough economic times and, quite naturally, they often have their guard down and are more trusting when they are on holiday\". \"Our general advice to consumers hiring cars abroad is, where possible, to return the car to someone in the office, get them to check the car and sign it off as in good condition. If you have to leave the car, take some photos - showing that it was returned in good condition.\" In a statement Leaseurope - which represents car rental companies across the EU - told 5 live Investigates that the number of complaints represented a \"very small proportion of the 55 to 60 million rental transactions that take place annually\". Leaseurope says its members are \"working with the European Commission and consumer centres across Europe to further enhance the industry's handling of complaints\". \"We are currently piloting a European car rental conciliation service to handle this type of issue.\" You can hear the full report on 5 live Investigates on Sunday, 10 October at 2100 BST on BBC Radio 5 live.

Many have paid tribute to his wit and charm, with former first minister Alun Michael describing him as \"the absolute master of the one-liner\". Here are some of his best quotes. In 1998, he appeared on BBC's Newsnight and when asked by Jeremy Paxman if he wanted to be first minister, Mr Morgan replied: \"Do one-legged ducks swim in a circle?\" It prompted a bemused Paxman to ask: \"Is that Welsh for yes?\" On finally getting the job of first minister in February 2000, he said: \"I'm going to uncork the Welsh champagne bottle and let it fizz.\" During an assembly debate on police reform, he commented: \"The only thing which isn't up for grabs is no change and I think it's fair to say it's all to play for, except for no change.\" In 2003, Mr Morgan took Conservative AM Jonathan Morgan to task after he criticised the quality of assembly debates, saying: \"It's like a child shooting both its parents and then complaining about the food in the orphanage.\" The Queen may not have been amused the following year, when he arrived late for her visit to Builth Wells in Powys. He defended himself saying: \"I wasn't late, the Queen was early.\" Mr Morgan also had choice words about opponents and different ruling regimes. On the Conservatives, he quipped: \"The Tories' relationship with Wales is based on trust and understanding. We don't trust them and they don't understand us.\" And on the difference between his administration and that of his predecessor Alun Michael, he said: \"We had developed a reputation for political shenanigans and being incapable of running our own affairs, and that's how it appeared to people. \"Drama is fine but if drama implies that the Welsh couldn't run a whelk stall, then that's a problem.\" Mr Morgan once said an MP in New Labour stood for \"Material for Promotion, Mandelson Poodle and Millbank Pagee,\" while his version of Welsh for spin doctor was \"a practitioner of gyratory medicine\". Paying tribute to Tony Blair after the prime minister announced his departure, Mr Morgan said: \"It's very strange for me to be standing here today talking about a person who shafted me on one occasion but on the other hand, compared to what has happened with Iraq, I think that's pretty small beer to be honest with you. \"Life is far too short to be bearing grudges of that sort.\" Following a heart scare in 2007, Mr Morgan said he would like to spend his last day in the company of dolphins, whose staple diet of oily fish he adopted. \"Because their interest is mackerel and my interest is mackerel...

The decline has been particularly dramatic in the past two years. Media reports have raised questions about the safety of home births. Some experts say these are scare stories though. On a maternity ward in a big Amsterdam hospital, the OLVG, health journalist Hester van Yperen is proudly holding her son. He was born by Caesarian section three days earlier. The operation was planned because the baby was in the breech position. 'Too risky' Hester, 37, has reported on the safety of home births for the Dutch TV channel, RTL. From her hospital bed, she told me why she'd never wanted to give birth at home. She said: \"Dutch women grow up thinking home birth is good for you, and that it's part of mother nature. \"But I didn't consider it at all. I think it's too risky. If something is wrong, it's better to be in hospital.\" The Dutch government has described as \"worrying\" the fact that the rate of death among newborn babies is higher than in other European countries. The health minister said recently that obstetric care needed to improve, and there was sometimes \"insufficient communication\" between professionals. Some doctors say women are choosing hospital birth because they want a full range of pain relief and quicker deliveries. In the peaceful commuter town of Soest, it is easy to find women who hold dear the Dutch culture of a high rate of home birth. Eke Ut Mannetje has delivered all three of her children at home. Eke said: \"You have all the bacteria and ill people in hospital. Emotionally, you want to hide in surroundings that you know and have comfort when giving birth. For me, being at home was perfect. \"The birth of my first daughter, Sient, who's now seven, went really quickly. We lived on a fourth floor home in Amsterdam at the time. \"The midwife had to run to get to me in time. We lived close to the hospital - but she said if there were complications, I'd have to stay horizontal and the firemen would have to get me out of the window. I was glad that wasn't the case!\" 'One big disaster' Christine Coenen delivered her daughters Fean, 10, and six-year-old Do in hospital - although she would have preferred home birth. It was what her own mother had done with 10 children. But Do was three weeks late in arriving. Christine was suddenly rushed to hospital with contractions. The placenta was late in being delivered, and she lost a lot of blood. Christine said: \"There is no guarantee you won't have complications at home - but I know from experience that there's also no guarantee you won't have complications in hospital either. \"What happened to me was one big disaster. It's not nice being driven to hospital while having contractions and being in pain.\" One unique feature of the Dutch system is a network of maternity nurses called Kraamhulp. They assist midwives during the birth, help new mothers begin breastfeeding and provide vital back-up during the crucial first week with maternity care and even housework. One of them, Sylvia Dorrestein, told me: \"It's emotional and intensive but also a really nice job. I've been doing this for 15 years. \"You have to learn how to raise a child in the home - not in hospital.\" But critics of the system say it has been too hesitant in considering risk. The charge is being led by Professor Gerry Visser, an obstetrician at Utrecht Medical Centre. He said: \"There's been this mentality of 'don't be too aggressive - they're healthy women - it can't be too serious'. Generally that's correct - but not always. \"The rate of intervention here is too low. We fell asleep. And now the higher mortality data has given us something of a crisis.\" Unfairly blamed Last year in the Netherlands, there were around 1,700 stillbirths and deaths among newborn babies. Everyone agrees that figure is too high, and that Dutch midwives and doctors should work more closely together. But are home births being unfairly blamed? Professor Simone Buitendijk leads midwives' training and researches the Dutch maternity system and international mortality rates. She is dismayed at the recent drop in home births. She said: \"Thirty of those 1,700 deaths were after the mother started to give birth at home - and not all of those 30 are avoidable. \"Home births are safe. Even if we totally abolished them, we wouldn't make a small dent in the mortality statistics. \"It's very short-sighted. I think it would be really sad if choice disappears - and there's a real risk of this happening in the Netherlands. \"It has nothing to do with a painting over the bed, or a nice soft light in the corner.

With the economy looking marginally less gloomy, the chancellor has made plain he is not going to unleash huge amounts of public spending any time soon. What he hinted at was if, the economy continues to look less peaky by the autumn, he, at that point, will feel that it is possible to look at increasing public spending in what he described as the years ahead, in the next spending review. That will be the government's tax and spending masterplan, in 2019. And the arguments about the shape and scale of the Tory commitments to public services, whether spending or reforms point to those decisions, over the next 12 months, not to the kind of immediate top-ups to this service or that which MPs have been pushing for. And the outcomes of those decisions will set the economic and political backdrop for the run up to the next general election, scheduled for 2022. As we reported this morning, some ministers around the cabinet table already believe that could include tax rises for the health service. Others in government are making it plain that will have to mean, in their view, a more generous approach to other areas like defence and council spending.

By contrast, the average share on the London stock exchange - up to the end of last week - had risen by just 2%. Mr Woodford, who judges success over decades rather than years, is doing everything he can to dampen down the euphoria. \"It's far too early to conclude that the fund's strategy has worked,\" he says. On the personal qualities needed in a good fund manager, he is equally understated. \"I would suggest that a healthy balance between arrogance and humility is helpful,\" he says. Colleagues are less equivocal. \"He's arguably the best fund manager of his generation,\" says Mark Dampier, research director at Hargreaves Lansdown. His view is based on Mr Woodford's long-term record - 25 years of market-beating returns. To many, he looks like the man who just can't stop making money. 'High single digits' Neil Woodford is not the best fund manager in the country over the last year. In fact, he currently comes in at number 235 out of more than 1500 in a league table produced by Financial Express (FE). But his performance is the best in the Equity Income sector - a part of the industry that aims to provide investors with a regular income. However, to get a true measure of the man, Woodford fans say you need to take into account his record at his previous employer, Invesco Perpetual. Anyone investing a pension fund of \u00a310,000 with him 27 years ago - and then following him to his new fund - would now have \u00a3309,000. (Figures to end of May 2015). Had they invested the money across the stock market as a whole, they would only have \u00a3117,000. The danger of doing so well is that investors have high expectations - expectations which Woodford is trying to rein in. He says his aim is to deliver \"high single-digit\" returns every year, averaged out over three to five years. \"We hope to deliver more than this, but this is the target against which we expect to be judged,\" he says. Top five holdings in Woodford's Equity Income Fund AstraZeneca 7.18% of fund GlaxoSmithKline 7.05% Imperial Tobacco 6.96% British American Tobacco 5.74% British Telecommunications 3.85% Patience Like Warren Buffett, Neil Woodford believes in long-term investment. Typically, he holds shares for more than 10 years. And he will only buy them when they look cheap. He finds shares that are undervalued by the rest of the market; hence he is a big investor in the tobacco industry, for which he makes no apology. \"I'm not paid to exercise my moral judgements in my portfolio. The tobacco sector still looks structurally undervalued and is, therefore, an appealing investment.\" Equally, he is a keen investor in the pharmaceutical and health industries. One company he has bought is 4D Pharma, based in Manchester, which is researching asthma and arthritis treatments. Its shares have quadrupled in value over the last year. Drug development company Oxford Pharmascience is another. Its shares have quadrupled in the last six months. But despite such spectacular short-term successes, if there is one word to describe Mr Woodford's approach, it is patience. Hence his new fund - launched in April - is called Woodford Patient Capital. It aims to provide long-term funding for start-up companies. And it is perfectly possible that he will never sell out. 'A better crop' With a wealth of start-up high tech companies in Oxford, it is no surprise that Woodford opened his corporate headquarters there. But there is another reason too. Neil Woodford has never liked the City of London. His 25 years at Invesco Perpetual, based in Henley on Thames, taught him to avoid the frantic atmosphere of trading desks. \"I have never had a yearning to work in the City, and in many ways I believe it is to my advantage that I don't.\" He believes that not being in London keeps him immune from the noise - \"the fashions and fads\" - that can build up in the City. Given his ambitions to nurture small companies, it is no surprise to learn that Woodford also has an interest in farming. Indeed he has a degree in agricultural economics. If he farms like he invests, says Mr Dampier, he would be planting for the long term. \"He'd be thinking of enriching the soil, and getting a better crop next year and the year after.\" Fast rides In one respect only, Mr Woodford has met the conventions of a sometimes flashy profession - a penchant for fast cars. Maybe that's vital for the streak of arrogance he says is necessary. \"You take the Porsches and the top cars, he's been through a few of them,\" says one colleague. Yet according to another, he is very down to earth too. Indeed, with an interest in ecology and the environment, he leads a peaceful existence in one of the prettiest valleys of the Chilterns. It is there that he loves to ride horses - \"very much a passion of mine,\" he says. And are there any similarities between keeping in the saddle and running an investment fund? \"They are both very difficult to master,\" he replies. \"And I am still learning on both counts.\" Watch the Hardtalk interview with Neil Woodford here.", "output": "This weekend, hundreds of thousands of small investors - many of them pensioners - will be saluting Britain's very own Warren Buffett.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Alice CuddyBBC News More than three million people around the world have tested positive for the virus since it first emerged in China late last year. Close to 230,000 have died. There are only a handful of countries that haven't been touched by the pandemic. On Thursday, we told you about the lives of seven people in the UK who died on 12 April, the day the country officially surpassed 10,000 hospital deaths. These are the stories of four other deaths on three continents that also happened that day. Maria Pollidori was admitted to hospital in central Italy in late February for a stomach cancer operation. Everything seemed to have gone smoothly, and her family looked forward to her return. But on 9 April they received a call from the hospital saying the 84 year old had tested positive for coronavirus. Italy has been one of the countries worst-hit by coronavirus. The central region of Marche, where Maria and her family live, has recorded thousands of cases. But Maria's family had no idea that she had been showing any symptoms. Three days after they received the call from the hospital, she passed away. Her son Pierluigi said the hardest thing was not being able to be close to her \"at the time she needed us most\". Maria's death was not only felt by her family. As a nurse and midwife of 25 years she was well known in and around the small seaside town of Porto Potenza. But because of the pandemic, no-one was able to pay their respects to her at a funeral. It is a story that echoes throughout the country. Thousands of miles away in the US state of Texas, Phillip Tsai-Brooks and his husband Anthony were both in hospital with Covid-19 on 12 April. It was love at first sight when the pair were introduced through mutual friends. They married in 2014 on a cruise ship in San Francisco Bay, and brought Phillip's widowed mother on their honeymoon to Puerto Rico - as they often did on their much-loved international travels. In a statement to the BBC, Phillip's brothers said Phillip and Anthony were able to break barriers, and were accepted as a couple in the city of San Antonio, where they were known for the joy they brought to people's lives. Phillip, one of five brothers, had always dreamed of being a hair stylist and one day opening his own salon. His ambitions were realised when he opened the Extreme Opulence Hair Studio. More recently, he had been teaching others in the profession. Only child Anthony, known as Tony, spent several years in the US Air Force before working for his local council, helping with budget planning for the city of Live Oak. A colleague said he was \"smarter about city budgets than most people\", and described him as \"one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet\". The charismatic military veteran would regularly bring sweets into work for the local mayor, dropping them in a jar on her desk, he said. Relatives and friends of the men described them as the perfect couple. They dreamed of one day adopting their own children. But their lives and dreams were tragically interrupted by the outbreak of coronavirus. In a Facebook post in late March, 42-year-old Phillip said he was feeling unwell and had been told to quarantine as a precaution. Six days later, he said he was in hospital with confirmed coronavirus. \"Be here for a couple of days\u2026 then quarantine,\" he wrote. Anthony, 52, was taken to a different hospital, suffering similar symptoms. In what Phillip's brothers described as the final chapter of their love story, Tony was moved from another healthcare system into the same hospital as Phillip. As their conditions deteriorated, they lay in rooms next to each other. Phillip passed away on 12 April after suffering a heart attack as a complication of Covid-19. Just two days later, Anthony died. \"Such a tragic loss but their love will last forever,\" Phillip's brothers said. Elsewhere in North America, Victor Batista Falla had recently returned to Cuba, the country of his birth, for the first time in 60 years. The 87 year old was born into one of the wealthiest families in the country, with his father's side founding a bank and his mother descending from rich sugar planters. He fled the country in 1960, after Fidel Castro and his revolutionary forces ousted President Fulgencio Batista. Victor then became a prominent figure of Cuban exile literature, founding the journals Exilio and Escandalar in New York. After moving to Madrid, he opened the publishing house Colibr\u00ed, through which he published numerous essays about Cuba. France-based Cuban writer William Navarrete met Victor in the Spanish capital in 1996 at a cafe popular with Cuban exiles. After their first meeting, the pair saw each other whenever William was in Madrid. William described Victor as a man who hated confrontation and gossip, and who was protective of his privacy. \"He was a bon vivant, but very measured,\" William said of his friend. \"He never ostentatiously displayed relationships and never boasted about the things he did.\" Victor's high-profile relationships extended far beyond Cuba. He was the uncle of the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and a statement from the duke and duchess said his death was a \"great loss\" for the family. William said Victor never spoke of his connection to the royals and did not like to talk about his family's vast wealth. \"Once I asked him if he was nostalgic for the lavish life he had had in Cuba until the age of 27,\" William recalled. \"He replied that he was nostalgic for the things he wanted to do and that he had not done.\" After 60 years away from the country, Victor quietly returned to Cuba in February. It's not clear what led him to return. William did not know anything of the trip until he read a newspaper article telling him that his friend had died there of Covid-19. In the early hours of 3 December, 1984, a valve broke in a storage tank inside a chemical factory in the central Indian city of Bhopal. Soon after, a deadly cloud of gas escaped from the factory into the surrounding neighbourhoods. It became one of the deadliest industrial disasters in modern history. Thousands of people died, and tens of thousands more needed treatment. Among them was Imran Khan, who was just a young boy when the disaster happened. Two years ago, he developed mouth cancer, believed to be a result of the leak, and had to give up work. After surviving his initial cancer, it returned again, and he was forced to undergo more chemotherapy. His condition deteriorated in recent weeks and he died on 12 April. Later tests confirmed that he had contracted coronavirus. A group representing survivors of the gas tragedy have accused the local government of turning their backs on people like Imran. They say five gas leak survivors died of coronavirus within days of each other. A hospital set up for gas victims was converted into a facility for coronavirus patients. The Bhopal Group for Information and Action says gas victims were then ignored, despite being particularly vulnerable to the virus because of their health conditions. Imran's older brother Rashid Khan is now looking after his wife and son. \"The wellbeing of his entire family is on my shoulders,\" he told BBC Hindi.

But Volkswagen has not yet made any payments to buyers in the UK or elsewhere in Europe, even though millions of cars sold in the region were also fitted with similar software. Nor does it have any plans to do so. However, efforts are now being made to force the company to change its mind, orchestrated by the European Commission. The Department for Transport has been involved in the discussions. Defeat devices The scandal first became public in the US in September 2015. It emerged that roughly 600,000 diesel vehicles had been fitted with \"defeat devices\" - software which could recognise when a car was being tested, and turn on its emission controls systems. They could then be turned off again when the car was being used on the road. That would improve its performance, but also dramatically increase the levels of harmful nitrogen oxides it produced. The software had been developed by VW's engineers because they realised that their cars were not capable of both passing strict US emissions tests, and offering high levels of performance. But the scandal was not confined to the US. It soon became apparent that cars sold all around the world had also been fitted with defeat devices - including about eight million in Europe. They included cars sold under the Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche brands, as well as Volkswagens. Consumer anger News of what Volkswagen had been doing prompted angry reactions from buyers, many of whom demanded compensation. In the US, they got what they wanted. Under the terms of a $10bn settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, VW agreed to buy back or repair all of the affected vehicles, and provide their owners with a cash sum of at least $5,000. Buyers in Canada received a similar settlement, but only after taking out a class action lawsuit against the company. In Europe, things have been rather different. Although Volkswagen is in the process of recalling the affected vehicles and modifying them, it has refused to provide any recompense for buyers. Legal niceties There is a good reason why Volkswagen has made payments in the US. It simply had no choice. What it was doing was clearly illegal. The company has admitted that it deliberately set out to circumvent the emissions testing process, and designed its defeat device accordingly. It also lied to regulators about what it was doing. The US authorities take a very dim view of this kind of thing. As a result Volkswagen is facing a total bill in the US of $21bn. That includes large criminal and civil fines, as well as the cost of buybacks and compensation. If VW had decided to fight the charges rather than settling, it could have been even bigger. It has also pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and obstruction of justice. Europe complicated In the UK and other European countries, the situation is more complicated. Although it is in the process of recalling millions of vehicles fitted with software capable of cheating emissions tests, Volkswagen denies actually doing anything illegal. It says, for example, it \"does not accept that a defeat device prohibited under UK law was fitted to any of the affected UK vehicles\". It also insists: \"This issue has not caused any loss of engine performance or any increase in running costs. Nor has it changed fuel economy figures, CO2 emission figures or the vehicles' tax status. \"In addition the value of the vehicles has not been negatively affected by this issue.\" So no compensation, it argues, is needed. Similar arguments are used in other European countries. Put simply, Volkswagen doesn't believe that in Europe the \"defeat devices\" were actually defeat devices - in the strictest legal sense. It also maintains that the software wasn't actually needed to pass emissions tests in Europe, which were less stringent than those in the US. Combined action Nevertheless, efforts are under way in Brussels to force Volkswagen to pay up. Last week the European Commission hosted a meeting of 22 consumer protection authorities from across the continent. They agreed to prepare collective action against the company. It is understood this could involve individual authorities imposing co-ordinated fines on Volkswagen for alleged breaches of consumer law, as well as taking a joint \"administrative decision\", which could be used to support litigation against the company in national courts. According to people within the Commission, the main aim is to put pressure on the carmaker, in the hope that it will voluntarily provide compensation. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said afterwards that the government took \"the unacceptable actions of VW extremely seriously\" and was \"pushing them to compensate the UK consumer\". Even if these efforts fail, VW could yet be forced to make substantial payouts. It is facing a range of class action lawsuits, representing hundreds of thousands of disgruntled buyers - and if it loses, the bill could be very steep indeed.", "output": "It has been a year and a half since the diesel emissions scandal at the German carmaker Volkswagen first came to light.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The \"m\u00e9tis\" children born to Belgian settlers and local women were forcibly taken to Belgium and fostered by Catholic orders and other institutions. About 20,000 children are believed to have been affected. Most fathers refused to acknowledge the paternity of their children. The children were born in the 1940s and 1950s and taken to Belgium from 1959 until the independence of each of the three colonies. Some of the children never received Belgian nationality and remained stateless. Speaking in the Belgian parliament, Mr Michel said the country had breached the children's basic human rights, seeing them as a threat to the colonial system. It had, he said, stripped them of their identity, stigmatised them and split up siblings. \"I vow that this solemn moment will represent a further step towards awareness and recognition of this part of our national history,\" he said in his statement. Many of the mixed-race children had gone on to help Belgium become a \"more open and tolerant society\", the prime minister added. He also expressed Belgian compassion for the \"African mothers whose children were snatched from them\". Two years ago, the Catholic Church apologised for its role in the scandal. Last year, Belgian MPs called on the government to help the affected children find their biological parents and also gain Belgian nationality. Meanwhile, their mothers have also been searching for their children. The groups miXed2020 and M\u00e9tis de Belgique say many of the kidnapped children \"suffered deeply\" as a result of their experience. Many still had no access to birth records and remained unable to find their mothers or their Belgian fathers, who, the groups said, were often well-known figures. Georges Kamanayo, one of the children who were taken to Belgium, said Mr Michel's apology was the \"ultimate recognition of an injustice\". \"We have felt like third-rate Belgians for a long time,\" he told daily newspaper De Standaard. \"In the colony we were set apart from the white children. It was pure segregation. We tried to immerse ourselves in Belgium, so we wouldn't stand out.\" He added: \"In Belgium we always react a little slower, other countries have preceded us.\" Belgian colonial rule of Congo was particularly brutal when it was known as Congo Free State between 1885 and 1908. An estimated 10 million Africans lost their lives when King Leopold II ran the country, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, as his own fiefdom. Last month, the UN's Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent told Belgium to apologise for atrocities committed during its colonial era. Racial discrimination was \"endemic\" in Belgian institutions, the UN experts said in a report. \"The root causes of present day human rights violations lie in the lack of recognition of the true scope of violence and injustice of colonisation,\" their report added.

The final draft includes the description of Gibraltar as a \"colony of the British Crown\" in a footnote.

She said: \"I find it really difficult because I don't know quite how Paul felt and he died from excess secretions in his upper airways, which is like drowning, and he was unable to communicate to us. \"The last 58 hours of his life were horrendous and that has left me with a terrible memory.\" But she added that the family was grateful the ombudsman took up their complaint. Correct treatment Mr Ridd added: \"We wanted the ombudsman's report in order to make changes for vulnerable people going into hospital that can't communicate for themselves, and their families and carers need to communicate for them. \"It is so important that is recognised within the health authorities and picked up on, so patients can have the correct treatment and this doesn't happen again.\" Both recalled their brother as a \"special individual\". Mrs Nicholls said: \"He was very sociable. Unfortunately he had severe learning difficulties which meant he had the mentality of an 18-month-old child but he enjoyed the simple things in life. \"He gave our family so much pleasure.\" Mr Ridd added: \"He had a character that blossomed and gave sunshine. \"Everybody that he met warmed to Paul, he brought happiness to us and people on the street.\" Managers at the hospital said procedures had been improved.

As far as the carmaker is concerned, however, the Invitation is merely one of the 51 models it is planning to launch over the next six years. On average, that is a car launch every six weeks - though not all of them will be sold globally, of course, and many of them will be mere tweaks to existing models. Nevertheless, many of the new cars will be produced in several factories at the same time, so Nissan says it is actually preparing to start production of a new or a refreshed model in one of its factories every two weeks between now and 2018. \"Last year, we sold 4.2 million cars, this year we're gonna sell probably going to sell over 4.7 million cars and the next year even more,\" grins Andy Palmer, executive vice president at Nissan, in charge of global products. \"This is a brand very much on the move.\" Asian brand Nissan's model onslaught is part of an ambitious strategy aimed at lifting global sales from just over four million cars currently to almost eight million in 2016. \"New cars are always part of growth,\" says Mr Palmer. \"In Europe, and globally, our intention is to take an 8% market share. \"Within that strategy, Europe is a very important component. It's very much our intention to become the number one Asian brand in Europe.\" Dramatic growth Nissan is already growing at a dramatic rate, with global sales rising to 4.67 million vehicles in 2011, up 14.4% when compared with 2010. The carmaker enjoyed particular strength in Europe, where sales rose 25% when compared with 2010. Last month, Nissan's market share in Europe stood at 4.1%. And within Europe, Russia rose to become the carmaker's main market, with sales rising 74% to more than 138,000 cars. Look-alikes Creating a closer family resemblance between different Nissan models is a central idea behind Nissan's strategy. The idea is that small and large models should look similar, the way a father and a son might, yet allowing for different sizes and abilities. In the past, Nissan's loosely connected model line-up has been criticised because it has failed to build strong brand loyalty the way rivals such as Ford or Volkswagen have, with their tightly connected ranges of cars that enable customers to grow up with the brands by moving from smaller to larger models that resemble each other. This is now being fixed, with the Hi-Cross concept an example of things to come. \"It is an SUV concept that will sit above the Qashqai,\" says Mr Palmer, insisting that the car represents a \"flow of architecture that will resonate across the whole brand\". Nissan's new design language is central to its growth plan, according to Mr Palmer. \"You very much have to know and be true your own personality and be confident in your brand's DNA,\" he says. \"It's that personality that drives brands, it's that personality that drives growth of the brand worldwide.\" 'Adapt quickly' Nissan also believes its ability to speed up the vehicle development cycle has made it a more competitive company. Currently, it takes the carmaker just three years from when an idea is hatched to when a car rolls off the production line, which means it can adapt quicker to changing consumer tastes than many of its rivals. \"You can do virtually everything in a digital environment,\" says Trevor Mann, Nissan Europe's senior vice president for manufacturing. \"And our organisation is of a size and a quality to be able to adapt very quickly.\" For a rather small car, Nissan's Invitation has attracted a great deal of attention at the Geneva motor show this week.

In these days of gloomy introspection about the decline of the UK's military might, it was to say the least, a surprise. But the second was no less amazing - that the personnel of G4S, a private British security company, is four times larger than the British Army. Chief executive Nick Buckles has outlined a potential loss of at least \u00a330m on its \u00a3284m contract for the Olympics but it soon became apparent that this was a drop in the ocean. The company's revenue in 2011 was about \u00a37.5bn - and is rising. G4S has a primary listing on London Stock Exchange, a former home secretary as \"group consultant\", and operations in over 125 countries - not bad for a security firm founded in 2004 and based in Crawley. This is a company whose previously accident-prone record - as Group 4 Securicor - in running prisons and providing military security, had been criticised in parliament and provoked global protests about its employment practices. And now the cash-strapped and resource-starved British Army has had to provide thousands of troops for the Olympics to fill the gap left by the failures of a private army. It all set me thinking about history. Where had I heard such stories before? The private army of the Honourable East India Company, that's where. The mother of all global multinationals, the story of the East India Company uncannily echoes that of modern giants, who trade in natural resources, make their profits and gain new spheres of influence through economic intervention. Founded in 1600 to exploit the trade with India, the company's shareholders were wealthy merchants and aristocrats and the keys to its success were both commercial and military. The shareholders of the East India Company were making huge profits from their commercial operations in India, operations that were secured and guarded by private armies working for the company and paid for by Indian taxpayers. And when things went horribly wrong it was the Indian and British taxpayers who suffered and the British government and British armed forces that had to step in to sort out the disaster. In the 17th Century India was not a single entity - it was divided between many different states. It was beset by internal divisions and Mughal power in the north was collapsing, which made it easier for the company to divide and rule. As always in history, where there is a vacuum the go-getters and money makers move in to fill it. There was a gold rush as the company began trading in Bengal under a permit from Shah Jehan, establishing textile factories in villages on the Hooghly River. They processed material from the village-based hand loom industry, and drew in hundreds of thousands of highly skilled weavers, dyers and washers, to manufacture a product now aimed at specific markets around Asia and in Britain. A crucial step came in 1717 when the increasingly powerless Mughal emperor in Delhi, acknowledging the facts on the ground, gave the company a grant of 38 villages near Calcutta, in what turned out to be a Faustian pact. Now other European powers, particularly the French, began to smell the sweet aroma of profit so the company had to swell its private army to protect its interests. At first the numbers were small - 2,200 Europeans and a similar number of native troops won the decisive battle at Plassey in Bengal in 1757 against the last independent Nawab of Bengal, who also had a tiny force from the French East India Company. A similar size force gained victory at Wandiwash in the south where, between the 1740s and the 1760s, the British and the French fought out another part of their global confrontation. Then in 1765 in Delhi, the Mughal Shah Alam formally awarded the British the \"diwan\" of Bengal - that is, the right to raise revenues. With that, the entrepreneurs were able to partly finance themselves with Indian taxpayers' money. Now the people of Bengal were paying their taxes to fund a private army to police them. What had begun as a speculative piece of Elizabethan merchant-venturing had entered a new phase. And the recruitment of security forces accelerated, especially of local personnel, fighting in company uniforms, and trained in British military discipline. A private army making profit for the company's shareholders with very little control from either the British or the Indian governments. Does this sound familiar? In the south between the 1760s and 1799 the company fought four wars with the Muslim rulers of Mysore who were French allies, ending in the siege of the island fortress of Seringapatam in 1799 in which Sultan Tipu was killed. The numbers of the armed forces at the disposal of the company had now soared to meet the new \"security\" opportunities. At Seringapatam their forces were 50,000 strong, the size of a big European army of the time. Investment grew, just as it would today, and in the next few years company profits rose astronomically. Their accounts registered with the British parliament show revenues rose from over \u00a38m in 1794 to \u00a313.5m in 1803. The value of this today is very difficult to calculate, whether you go for value in wages, prices, or real income, but that 1803 profit could be calculated as high as \u00a348bn in today's money - a reasonable guess might be \u00a320bn. G4S, Halliburton and Blackwater would be green with envy. This changing situation is revealed in the vast archive of the company now preserved in the British Library on a staggering 11 miles of subterranean shelving. In the aftermath of the victory over Tipu the governor-general Richard Wellesley, brother of the future victor of Waterloo, wrote: \"I shall retain full sovereignty of Seringapatam, for the company as being a tower of strength from which we may at any time shake Hindostan to its centre, if any combination should ever be formed against our interests. \"I shall not at present enlarge upon the advantages which are likely to be derived to the British interests from this settlement, they are too obvious to require any detailed explanation.\" The conquest had happened piecemeal and opportunistically. It was effected by mercenaries, picking off regional threats one by one, establishing themselves on the ground as the local power, employing local security personnel with powers of coercion, employment and imprisonment. By the 1830s the company archives reveal a shift from trade in textiles to the ownership of land, and at this point the colonial project acquired a new ideological tone, exemplified in Lord Macaulay's 1835 edict on Indian education, announcing the replacement of Persian by English as the new language of government and commerce. You could say this was the moment that English started to become the international means of communication and power. These interventionist attitudes form the background to the 1857 mutiny - the greatest rising against any colonial power in the Age of Empire, far surpassing in scale the other great revolts in Asia, Africa and the New World. By now the company depended on huge numbers of local troops, and there were many strands to native discontent. The spark of the revolt was a protest in the native army ranks against British insensitivity to Hindu religion, especially in the alleged use of rifle cartridges greased with cow fat. But it rapidly spread as a rebellion against foreign rule in which even Muslim jihadists made common cause with Hindus. As rebellion spread like wildfire up and down the Grand Trunk Road from Bengal to the Punjab, the very presence of Britain in India hung in the balance. The war that followed was conducted with horrific violence and savage reprisals by both sides. Both Hindu and Muslim rebels expressed their loyalty to the ageing Mughal Emperor in Delhi - Bahadur Shah - who after the defeat was exiled to Burma. His sons were killed in cold blood by the British who were shockingly merciless in their revenge. So the company's extraordinary rise to global power ended in catastrophe both for the shareholders and for the country in which they were operating. The rising of 1857 was a disaster for India, wrecking Mughal Delhi and its refined cultural life, and bringing devastation on its population, many of whose adult males were summarily massacred. But the rising was also a terrible shock to the British establishment, as it opened up to public gaze the workings of company rule. In the aftermath, in 1858 the British parliament stepped in to take direct control of its Indian possessions, nationalised the private army of the company and put an end to its 258-year existence in India. The company left behind a memory of corporate abuse, colonialism, exploitation and monopoly power, but as always there are many sides to any story in history. When the company was finally dissolved in 1874, the Times's judgement was that \"the company had accomplished a work such as in the whole history of the human race no other company ever attempted, and as such is ever likely to attempt in the years to come\". Given the events of the last few weeks, indeed of the last few years, it seems unlikely that G4S, Halliburton or Blackwater will be remembered in quite the same way.", "output": "The recent discussions around the G4S Olympic security scandal highlighted two jaw-dropping facts, writes historian Michael Wood.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Vineet KhareBBC Reality Check Its cities are already creaking under the strain of poor infrastructure and inadequate public services. The government has undertaken a major investment programme to modernise selected cities across the country. In the run-up to the Indian election, which gets under way on 11 April, BBC Reality Check is examining claims and pledges made by the main political parties. Pledge: In 2015, the Indian government made a commitment to invest in 100 'smart cities' over five years. Verdict: The project timeline has been delayed as not all the cities were not chosen at the start of the programme, and only a small portion of the funds allocated have been used so far. What is a smart city? The government makes it clear there's no single definition of a smart city. But it's pledged to allocate funds to improve the quality of life in 100 selected cities, using the latest technological developments. Under the government's Smart Cities Mission, 100 cities were chosen from across the country, with the last batch only selected in 2018. These delays have led to the project missing its original deadline, which has now been extended to 2023. Under the programme, each smart city is to be provided annual federal support, with some contributions from state and local city bodies. Read more from Reality Check Has the project delivered? By February 2019, the government had approved 5,151 projects worth about 2,000bn rupees (about $29bn) under the Smart Cities Mission. It says 715 of the projects have now been completed, and another 2,304 are under way. However, the official data shows a significant difference between allocated funding and actual project spending. A total of about 166bn rupees ($2.39bn) had been allocated to the Smart Cities Mission between 2015 and 2019. But in January this year, the government acknowledged that just 35.6bn rupees ($0.51bn) had been utilised - about 21% of the total. There's also been concern voiced about how the money is being used. Out of the projects approved so far, about 80% will be spent on developing areas within cities - rather than the whole city. One NGO, the Housing and Land Rights Network, has labelled the Smart Cities Mission a \"smart enclave scheme\". Some analysts argue the mission focuses on new projects, rather than on enhancing the capacity of existing local bodies in urban areas. So, offering bicycle-sharing facilities or building parks may not be enough unless thought is given on how to integrate them into overall city planning, they say. \"The lack of coordination between implementing agencies is a major reason why the intended benefits are still not visible to the public,\" said a parliamentary committee report. The government says it has offered training courses to boost the capacity of existing local bodies - but it's not clear how successful these have been. The government says the pace of the project has picked up significantly in the last year. \"There has been a 479% increase in projects completed since October 2017,\" it told India's parliament in December. Hardeep Singh Puri, the minister of state for housing and urban affairs, told the BBC that 15 integrated command and control centres are already operational under the project. \"If we have 50 of these completed by December 2019 out of the 100 required, my view is that this is one of the fastest implemented projects of this kind anywhere in the world.\" Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter", "output": "India's urban population is growing rapidly and is expected to reach 600 million in the next decade.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the government was committed to the safety of offenders and to reducing the number of people dying in custody.

Mr Grayling said: \"Although there are already comprehensive investigations into individual deaths we recognise there is benefit at this time in collating lessons that may be system-wide.\" He said the review would make recommendations for cutting the risk of future deaths. The review will be led by the Labour peer Lord Harris of Haringey, who is chairman of the Independent Advisory Council on Deaths in Custody. No under-18s Justice Minister Lord Faulks told the House of Lords that the review would start \"as soon as resources were in place\". He said the government wanted it to report back by spring 2015. \"It does not mean that lessons are not continuously learned from all other sources that provide information,\" he said. \"The review will focus on key themes including vulnerability information sharing and the safety of young people.\" The former chief inspector of prisons, Lord Ramsbotham, said he regretted that the review covered only those aged 18-24 and not those under 18 as well. He said the government's plans to build secure colleges for under-18s and its policy of putting all over-18s in adult prisons could \"exacerbate existing flaws and create significant risk to young lives\". 'Relentless' Campaigners had pressed the government to set up an inquiry, arguing that doing so could address systemic failings in a way that individual inquests could not. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright initially rejected the calls but later agreed to reconsider. The charity Inquest, which was among those calling for an independent review, said that of the three under-18s who had died in prison since 2011, two were being monitored for suicide and self-harm at the time of their deaths. In the same period, 41 people aged 18-24 died in prison from self-inflicted causes. Inquest said 14 of these people, accounting for more than a third of the total, were being monitored for suicide and self-harm when they died. Common features among children and young people who have died in prison from self-inflicted causes are diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), special educational needs, and personality and other disorders. Before the decision to establish a review was announced, Deborah Coles, co-director of Inquest, said: \"The state has frequently been put on notice about the scandal of deaths of children and young people in custody and yet has failed to act. \"The relentless nature of these deaths is shocking enough but the recurrence of depressingly familiar failings year after year should give most cause for alarm. \"Investigations and inquests are held in isolation, limited in remit and cannot address the wider systemic failures in state care both within and outside prisons.\" 'Fortified schools' Speaking to BBC News before the review was announced on Thursday, Lisa Courtney - whose son Ben was 18 when he hanged himself at Portland Young Offenders Institution - said more light should be thrown on failures by such institutions. Her son suffered from learning difficulties and ADHD, but she said his medical notes were never sent to Portland. \"Prisons are about punishment but they are not only about punishment,\" she said. \"They are about correction. \"Ben was neglected, Ben was just left in a cell to die, left in a cell to hang himself. \"Something is going wrong in there.\" Campaigners argue that the number of children and young people dying in custody means that the state is failing in its obligation to protect life under Article 2 of the Human Rights Act. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Justice has announced plans to spend \u00a385m building a secure college in Leicestershire that will hold up to 320 young people in custody.

Richard Jameson, who runs a transport company based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, agreed that drivers are facing an increasingly dangerous situation. \"The guidance given by the government is all well and good, until you approach the port of Calais. When you do, it's an absolute nightmare for any driver. \"You're sat in your cab and surrounded with tens of, if not 100, migrants swarming the motorway between the lorries. There are unbelievable scenes. \"The police are fighting a losing battle. And as a driver, you're quite limited as to what you can do.\" He said migrants used to try to stow away at night, when lorry drivers were asleep, but were now \"more brazen\" and making daytime attempts. He said hard-sided lorries, of the type his company used, were generally more secure because the only access is through the back doors. But even when drivers secure their doors, migrants have gone underneath the vehicles and hidden on top of wheel axles, he said. 'Unbelievably stressful' For his drivers, the problem is compounded by being unable to get out of their cabs to make extra checks at Calais because of the sheer number of people on the motorway wanting to get on board. \"This is going on every single day, and I don't know what the answer is,\" he said. \"It's unbelievably stressful for drivers. I have drivers who don't want to go any more - they can't get out of their cabs without facing migrants coming towards them. And if they try to alert other drivers that someone is trying to get in their trailer, they can have rocks and bricks thrown at them. \"It would be nice for the British police to go out there to open their eyes as to what is going on.\" Peter Cullum, the Road Haulage Association's head of international affairs, has recently called for more \"boots on the ground\" at ports, saying: \"Truck security, though important, is only part of the solution. Increasing clandestine numbers require more crowd control.\" Peter Davis, who runs a fruit and vegetable import and export business in Louth, Lincolnshire, said one of his drivers had been told by French police to allow migrants on the lorries - because they could not prevent them getting on board. Asked how drivers could prevent migrant stowaways, he said: \"There's nothing they can do, absolutely nothing. \"There are probably between 15 and 30 immigrants following a lorry, they're in groups, and the only way you could stop someone breaking in the back of the lorry is to confront them - and you can't do that, because there's no support from the police. You can't do anything.\" Mr Davis also said French police had advised drivers to leave the backs of lorries open so migrants could be seen more easily - but said that was not possible for his business as the fresh produce needs to be kept at a certain temperature and there is the risk of contamination. He added: \"It's getting worse. It's a slow but sure descent into total anarchy. French police are turning a blind eye to it.\"", "output": "Lorry drivers heading to the UK have been confronted by hundreds of migrants trying to stow away on their vehicles over recent days.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter \"The promise\" he was referring to was the one made in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, in which China agreed that it would run, in effect, a \"one country, two systems\" policy when it regained sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. It would allow the region to \"enjoy a high degree of autonomy\" for the next 50 years with its current social and economic systems, free press and lifestyle. Now, Lord Patten is an intelligent man well versed in politics and would have expected some level of state intervention that blurred the lines of that promise. His democratic developments, for instance, were quickly reversed by Beijing. But he was sincere and confident when he spoke of an \"unshakable destiny\". Five years of living in Hong Kong, a place he grew to love deeply, had taught him, he said, that its people's commitment to an open society was in their \"DNA\". He was right. The locals do not like it when China's ruling Communist Party imposes its political will on what it calls Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (HKSAR). When it proposed changes to the city's electoral system in 2014 the Hongkongers gathered en masse in public, carrying umbrellas as a symbol of peaceful protest (doubling up, on occasion, as protection from tear gas and pepper spray). Five years later in 2019 the umbrellas were out again as hundreds of thousands of residents took to the streets, many of whom were not even born when Patten made his speech in 1997. They came to protest against a proposed bill by the Hong Kong government that would enable the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China. That was a red line for those in the community deeply suspicious of Beijing's motives and interference. They feared the new law would erode judicial independence and endanger activists and journalists. What followed was bloody and brutal with both sides upping the ante as summer protests gave way to autumn sieges. Police deployed a cocktail of teargas, water cannons, rubber bullets, and live ammunition, while some protesters threw petrol bombs, vandalised buildings and wielded batons. Positions hardened, tensions rose. You will probably remember much of this from the television pictures and newspaper reports at the time, but you are less likely to have seen a first-hand account from the frontline. That is what the dissident Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei gives us in his latest documentary, Cockroach - the derogatory name police gave to the protesters (who had their own insulting names for the police). As with all his work it is deeply political and, implicitly, heavily critical of the Chinese government, an administration he and his family have suffered under for decades. Its side is not presented in the 93-minute doc that places you at the sharp end of the action. It is a protesters' dispatch, giving a voice to those who fear suppression and intimidation. We see them taking on the police (some of whom, we learn, are conflicted) with a mixture of courage and audacity. Sometimes they perpetrate violence, often they are on the receiving end. Cameras are constantly rolling, lives are put on the line. It starts with a locked off shot of man standing on top of a 20-metre wall of scaffolding covering the Pacific Place mall in the Admiralty district. He has his back to us. All we can see of him is his yellow plastic raincoat. To his right is a handwritten banner that reads: \"No Extradition to China\". We hear the traffic below. The film cuts to a young man on the other side of the street. He is looking up at the isolated protester whose earlier post on social media had prompted him to come along. He says he hopes \"he will be fine.\" The introduction of an ominous, metallic soundtrack (by Punkgod) suggests he will not be fine. What happens next is not easy to watch and might be too much for some adults. It is definitely not suitable for children. Ai Weiwei is a very direct filmmaker, he is not one to sugar the pill. It is a brutal beginning to a powerful documentary in which distrust and desperation turns a moderate society into a collective of civil rights activists. There are interviews with pro-democracy politicians, campaigners (some of whom are now in jail) and lawyers, as well as first-person accounts from a section within the protest movement who believe a more aggressive form of direct action is needed to make the authorities agree to their \"five demands\" (withdrawal of the extradition bill, universal suffrage, amnesty for arrested protesters, retract classification of protesters as \"rioters\", and an independent inquiry into police brutality). It is with this more radical group of largely younger activists that we remain as they talk of starting at the back of the protests (\"like watching a movie\") to being at the business end, nose-to-nose with heavily armed police (\"like being in a movie\"). The allusion to action films and video games crops up more than once, memorably so when on a rare occasion we hear from a policeman who explains his actions as if it were an exercise at drama school, \"It's an act, a script, you play the bad guy.\" Sadly, it is all too real. The documentary goes from bloody confrontation to bloodier confrontation, drawing you further and further into the psyche of the protesters who are fuelled by a heady mix of adrenalin, fear and purpose: a leaderless band of young people willing to die for their culture and community, for the rights and way of life that was promised to their parents: a promise Chris Patten pointedly reiterated as he left 23 years ago. Cockroach is their story, told with intensity and integrity by Ai Weiwei, a fine artist who has become an exceptional filmmaker. It ends with a written update about the new National Security Law imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing in 30 June 2020, which effectively quashed the protests and caused the mass resignation of opposition politicians. It marked the loss of Hong Kong's judicial independence, the text says, and the end of \"one country, two systems\".

He is described as having \"ultra-conservative\" views and used his maiden speech in the House of Commons to support his father's interests, arguing against abolition. While that argument failed, his finances did not - when slavery was abolished in the 1830s, the Gladstones received more than \u00a390,000, about \u00a39.5m in today's terms, as compensation for the slaves they were forced to free.

Department of Health Secretary Brendan Murphy made the prediction after being asked about the coronavirus' escalation in other nations. Dr Murphy spearheaded Australia's early action to close its borders last March. \"I think that we'll go most of this year with still substantial border restrictions,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday. \"Even if we have a lot of the population vaccinated, we don't know whether that will prevent transmission of the virus,\" he said, adding that he believed quarantine requirements for travellers would continue \"for some time\". Citizens, permanent residents and those with exemptions are allowed to enter Australia if they complete a 14-day hotel quarantine at their own expense. Qantas - Australia's national carrier - reopened bookings earlier this month, after saying it expected international travel to \"begin to restart from July 2021.\" However, it added this depended on the Australian government's deciding to reopen borders. Australia's tight restrictions The country opened a travel bubble with neighbouring New Zealand late last year, but currently it only operates one-way with inbound flights to Australia. Australia has also discussed the option of travel bubbles with other low-risk places such as Taiwan, Japan and Singapore. A vaccination scheme is due to begin in Australia in late February. Local authorities have resisted calls to speed up the process, giving more time for regulatory approvals. Australia has so far reported 909 deaths and about 22,000 cases, far fewer than many nations. It reported zero locally transmitted infections on Monday. Experts have attributed much of Australia's success to its swift border lockdown - which affected travellers from China as early as February - and a hotel quarantine system for people entering the country. Local outbreaks have been caused by hotel quarantine breaches, including a second wave in Melbourne. The city's residents endured a stringent four-month lockdown last year to successfully suppress the virus. Other outbreaks - including one in Sydney which has infected about 200 people - prompted internal border closures between states, and other restrictions around Christmas time. The state of Victoria said on Monday it would again allow entry to Sydney residents outside of designated \"hotspots\", following a decline in cases. While the measures have been praised, many have also criticised them for separating families across state borders and damaging businesses. Dr Murphy said overall Australia's virus response had been \"pretty good\" but he believed the nation could have introduced face masks earlier and improved its protections in aged care homes.

Mr Puigdemont, who is wanted in Spain for sedition and rebellion, was detained by German police acting on a European arrest warrant. He appeared before a German judge on Monday and was remanded in custody. Prosecutor Georg-Friedrich Guentge said Mr Puigdemont \"appeared calm and composed\". Mr Puigdemont was detained while crossing from Denmark on his way to Belgium, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since Catalonia's parliament unilaterally declared independence from Spain in October. A European warrant for his arrest was reissued on Friday. Who is protesting? In central Barcelona, protesters chanted \"Freedom for the political prisoners\" and \"This Europe is shameful!\" as they headed to the offices of the European Commission and the German consulate. Spanish news agency Efe estimated crowds of 55,000 in the centre of the city. Smaller demonstrations were held in Girona, where Mr Puigdemont once served as mayor, Tarragona and Lleida. Some protesters also formed road blocks in various locations. Tensions in Catalonia are very high and its separatist leaders abandoned plans to name a new president after the arrest on Friday of the latest candidate, Jordi Turull, sparked protests in Barcelona. Spain's Supreme Court has ruled 25 that Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. They all deny the allegations. How was Carles Puigdemont caught? German police said that Mr Puigdemont was detained by a highway patrol in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, which borders Denmark. He had been on a trip to Finland to meet lawmakers and attend a conference last week when the arrest warrant against him was reissued, taking him by surprise. He slipped out of Finland before the authorities could arrest him but only got as far as Germany before being intercepted. His spokesman, Joan Maria Pique, said he had been heading to Belgium \"to put himself, as always, at the disposal of Belgian justice\". International warrants for Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders were withdrawn in December by a Spanish judge, who said they had shown a willingness to return to the country. What happens next? Mr Puigdemont spent Sunday night in a prison in the north German town of Neum\u00fcnster. His court appearance there on Monday was a formality to confirm his identity. The court remanded him in custody pending extradition proceedings. Mr Puigdemont faces charges of sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of public funds in Spain as a result of his role in last year's Catalan banned independence referendum. The charges in Spain could result in up to 30 years in prison. Germany has 60 days to decide whether to return him. In order to do so, its judges need to assess whether the Spanish charges are punishable under German law. Criminal lawyer Martin Heger told Germany's Spiegel website (in German) that the lesser charge of misappropriation of public funds was also a crime under German law, and therefore it was clear that the exiled ex-leader would have to be extradited. However, if he is extradited on that charge, he can only be tried on that offence. It is unclear whether the alleged crimes of rebellion and sedition are punishable in Germany. The extradition procedure can last about two months. Mt Puigdemont also has the right to oppose the warrant and apply for asylum in Germany. Spain's latest move is considered the most serious challenge to date to the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight. Various other Catalan politicians have been subjected to new warrants, including Catalonia's former education minister, Clara Ponsati. She is in Scotland, where she has a position at the University of St Andrews, and is preparing to hand herself in. The number of European arrest warrants issued has increased since 2005, according to EU figures. In 2015, about 16,000 warrants were issued and about 5,000 executed.

It comes after LBC Radio obtained what it said was an internal Labour document detailing 45 cases, involving messages posted by members on social media. Speaking to BBC One's Sunday Politics Wales programme, Lord Hain said he was \"very disturbed\" by the investigation, \"because I think it highlights what has been a curse in the Labour party over this past period\". \"We've always been the party that champions individual liberty and human rights, and I find it deeply deeply upsetting and painful that anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic attacks have got to the point where the police are investigating it in the Labour party,\" said the former MP for Neath. \"That's the sort of thing you expect from fascists and racists and anti-Semites, you don't expect it from members of the Labour party.\" He said: \"If the party leader had been tough enough in stamping it out... this particular investigation I don't suppose would ever have occurred.\" \"There is a particular problem of a particular small group on the hard left in the Labour party, who seem to think that anybody standing up for their particular view in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, if they take a view that is seeming to defend the Jewish interest in that conflict, then they are targets,\" Lord Hain said. \"I do not believe this has actually assisted the Palestinian cause. In fact, the reverse. \"Undoubtedly this has cast a really dark stain over the party. \"I think if you go into a general election with such an important section of the community, the Jewish community, which has historically been majority Labour... actually against the party, I think that makes it very very difficult electorally.\" He denied he was \"having a pop\" at Mr Corbyn but he added: \"I think it will be difficult for the Labour party to get out of all of this in a way that commands cross community support again on this particular issue.\" 'Tackling anti-Semitism top priority' In September, Labour's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, after a long-running row about Mr Corbyn's handling of the issue. It vowed to incorporate all the 11 examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance into its code of conduct. But Jewish groups criticised an accompanying statement which the party said was aimed at protecting free speech. A Labour spokesman said: \"Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party are fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations. \"We have updated our rules and procedures to make it easier to take action against anti-Semitism and Jeremy asked General Secretary Jennie Formby to make tackling anti-Semitism her top priority.\" Watch Sunday Politics Wales, BBC One Wales, 1100 GMT, 4 November", "output": "A police investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism within Labour would not have happened if leader Jeremy Corbyn had been tough enough in \"stamping it out\", Lord Hain has said.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The move is a bid to avoid scenes of crowds swarming to popular areas seen last weekend as lockdown restrictions were eased. Loch Lomondside and Stirlingshire are off limits to day-trippers. But despite the warnings, some day trippers were observed at beauty spots on Saturday. A line of parked cars could be seen near the Devil's Pulpit near Killearn, while at Arrochar Traffic Scotland issued a warning as parked vehicles were leading to hazardous narrow lanes for other road users on the A83. Last weekend, large numbers of people gathered at parks and beaches as lockdown rules were slightly eased, allowing Scots to sunbathe and meet friends or family from one other household outdoors for the first time in months. Police dispersed more than 2,000 gatherings and car traffic trebled at some beauty spots. Following the lockdown breaches, Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland's coronavirus guidelines could be enforced by new laws if \"even a minority\" continued to flout them. This weekend, Police Scotland and Stirling Council closed a road beside Loch Lomond to deter day-trippers. The B-road between Drymen and Rowardennan is shut to vehicles, apart from local residents, for 21 days after people flocked to places like Balmaha last weekend. The Bracklinn Road near Bracklinn Falls in Callander has also been closed. Local councillor Danny Gibson said visitors flouted the Scottish government's recreational travel guidance. He said: \"We have felt it necessary to close the road because of issues last week over illegal parking traffic congestion, dangerous driving and littering so we have had to take this step to protect our local residents. \"The guidance is five miles within your local area for leisure and recreation and 99% of the population don't live within five miles of Balmaha so the clear message is to stay local.\" Police also issued a warning to anyone considering breaking the five-mile rule. Insp Andy Bushell from Forth Valley division said: \"Over the past week there has been a significant increase in footfall within our national parks and beauty spots, causing an increase in congestion, potential for accidents, and dangerous and inconsiderate parking on country roads. \"We have also witnessed a lot of groups not following the Scottish government regulations, engaging in anti social behaviour and some with no regard for the impact the behaviour was having on local residents. \"The National Park is currently closed and not in a position to welcome visitors - this means car parks are also closed. The volume of people coming into this area cannot be sustained safely.\" Gordon Watson, chief executive of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, said that the time was not right to return there.

One Japanese official once said to me: \"Japanese people never eat rabbits, but we don't tell British people that they shouldn't\". I pointed out that rabbits are not exactly an endangered species. Still, there is some merit to the government's argument. A number of coastal communities in Japan have indeed hunted whales for centuries, and continue to do so. Taiji in Wakayama prefecture is well known, many would say infamous, for its annual dolphin hunts. There are other places, in Chiba Prefecture and in Ishinomaki in northern Japan, that also do coastal whaling. So, yes, coastal whaling is part of Japanese culture, like Norway and Iceland and the Inuit of northern Canada. But only Japan continues to sail a fleet of ships half way across the globe to hunt whales in the Antarctic and maintains a large factory ship that can process hundreds of whales at sea. Nothing about these Antarctic whaling expeditions is historic. Japan's first whaling voyage to the Antarctic took place in the mid-1930s but the really huge hunts didn't get going until after World War Two. Japan lay in ruins, its population starving. With the encouragement of General Douglas MacArthur, Japan converted two huge US Navy tankers into factory ships and set sail for the Southern Ocean. From the late 1940s to the mid-1960s whale meat was the single biggest source of meat in Japan. At its peak in 1964 Japan killed more than 24,000 whales in one year, most of them enormous fin whales and sperm whales. Today Japan can afford to import meat from Australia and America. There is no deep-sea commercial whaling in Japan. The fleet that is now hunting in Antarctic waters is paid for by Japanese taxpayers to carry out what the Japanese government describes as \"scientific research\". Japan's other justification is that it needs to kill hundreds of whales each year to study them. But the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has systematically dismantled that argument. In 2014 it ruled that there was no scientific case for Japan's programme of \"lethal research\" in the Southern Ocean, and ordered Tokyo to stop. For a year Japan stopped. But last year it sent its fleet to sea again insisting, to widespread disbelief, that its new, smaller, Antarctic whaling programme satisfies the ICJ's requirements. Junko Sakuma used to work for Greenpeace in Japan. For the last 10 years she has been researching Japan's whaling industry. \"There is no benefit to Japan from whaling...but nobody knows how to quit,\" she tells me at Tokyo's famously chaotic Tsukiji fish market, the biggest in the world renowned for its pre-dawn tuna auctions. Of the thousands of fish wholesalers in Tsukiji only two still deal in whale meat. At one stand we find a few large hunks of minke whale meat, deep red and oozing blood. At the next there are two long slabs of lighter-coloured fin whale meat, an endangered species, its trading banned by CITES. Business is bad, complains the stall owner. Last year Japan caught no whales in the Antarctic, so there is less minke whale meat available, he says. If there is a whale meat shortage, the price should be soaring. But according to Junko it is not. \"The fact is, most Japanese people do not eat whale meat,\" she says. \"Consumption has been falling for years,\" and adds that \"even as the amount of whale meat decreases, the price doesn't go up\". According to Junko's research, the average consumption of whale meat by Japanese people in 2015 was just 30g (one ounce) per person. If eating whale is such an integral part of Japanese culture, why are so few eating it? I turn to my old friend Etsuo Kato. Over the 20 years we have known each other he has, on occasion, tried to persuade me to eat whale meat with him. Kato-San grew up in Kita-Kyushu in western Japan, close to the big whaling port at Shimonoseki. We are sitting in a cosy restaurant in Tokyo's notorious red light district, Kabukicho. Above us hangs a very large, and rather ancient, mummified whale penis. On the wall are picture of whales. The first plate to arrive is whale sashimi - it is raw. The owner points to the different delicacies; steak, heart, tongue and even raw whale skin. My stomach turns, but I steel myself. Gingerly, I put a bit of raw whale steak into my mouth. It has a strong gamey flavour, chewy and fibrous. Next, I try the tongue. It is salty and fishy. Kato-San points to the heart. I politely decline. \"When I was a child I ate this every day,\" he says. \"Meat meant whale meat. I didn't know what beef was, or pork. Steak was whale steak, bacon meant whale bacon.\" But if Japan stopped whale hunting you would be sad? He looks at me smiling and gently shaking his head. \"I don't need whale hunting\" he says. \"Once you have eaten beef there is no need to eat whale meat.\" The other customers in the restaurant are all middle-aged salary men. Eating a bit of whale meat is nostalgic, remembering school meals 50 years ago. So I come back again to my original question: why does Japan still do it? Recently I was at a private briefing with a high-ranking member of the Japanese government. Japan had just announced it was going to resuming whaling. I outlined to him why I thought it made no sense, and asked him to respond. His answer was astonishingly frank. \"I agree with you,\" he said. \"Antarctic whaling is not part of Japanese culture. It is terrible for our international image and there is no commercial demand for the meat. I think in another 10 years there will be no deep sea whaling in Japan.\" \"So why not stop now?\" asked another journalist. \"There are some important political reasons why it is difficult to stop now.\" he said. He would say no more. But Junko Sakuma thinks the answer lies in the fact that Japan's whaling is government-run, a large bureaucracy with research budgets, annual plans, promotions and pensions. \"If the number of staff in a bureaucrat's office decreases while they are in charge, they feel tremendous shame,\" she says. \"Which means most of the bureaucrats will fight to keep the whaling section in their ministry at all costs. And that is true with the politicians as well. If the issue is closely related to their constituency, they will promise to bring back commercial whaling. It is a way of keeping their seats.\" It may seem incredibly banal. But Japan's determination to continue whaling may come down to a handful of MPs from whaling constituencies and a few hundred bureaucrats who don't want to see their budgets cut.", "output": "Hunting whales is irrelevant to feeding Japan's population, draws global condemnation and is certainly not economic.

India is often in the news for crimes against women and, according to government statistics, a rape is reported every 15 minutes. \"These cases go on for years in the courts before the guilty are punished, whereas when a cow is slaughtered, Hindu extremist groups immediately go and kill or beat up whoever they suspect of slaughter.\" The project, he says, is \"his way of protesting\" against the growing influence of the vigilante cow protection groups that have become emboldened since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, came to power in the summer of 2014. \"I've been concerned over the Dadri lynching [when a Muslim man was killed by a Hindu mob over rumours that he consumed and stored beef] and other similar religious attacks on Muslims by cow vigilantes,\" Ghosh said. In recent months, the humble cow has become India's most polarising animal. The BJP insists that the animal is holy and should be protected. Cow slaughter is banned in several states, stringent punishment has been introduced for offenders and parliament is considering a bill to bring in the death penalty for the crime. But beef is a staple for Muslims, Christians and millions of low-caste Dalits (formerly untouchables) who have been at the receiving end of the violence perpetrated by the cow vigilante groups. Nearly a dozen people have been killed in the past two years in the name of the cow. Targets are often picked based on unsubstantiated rumours and Muslims have been attacked for even transporting cows for milk. Ghosh, who is from the eastern city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), says he became aware of \"this dangerous mix of religion and politics\" only after he moved to Delhi a few years ago and that \"this project is a silent form of protest that I think can make an impact\". So earlier this month, during a visit to New York, he bought the cow mask from a party shop and, on his return, began shooting for the series, taking pictures of women in front of tourist hotspots and government buildings, on the streets and in the privacy of their homes, on a boat and in a train, because \"women are vulnerable everywhere\". \"I photographed women from every part of society. I started the project from Delhi since the capital city is the hub of everything - politics, religion, even most debates start here. \"I took the first photo in front of the iconic India Gate, one of the most visited tourist places in India. Then I photographed a model in front of the presidential palace, another on a boat in the Hooghly river in Kolkata with the Howrah bridge as the backdrop.\" His models have so far been friends and acquaintances because, he says, \"it's such a sensitive topic, it would have been difficult to approach strangers\". Two weeks ago when he launched the project on Instagram, the response was \"all positive. It went viral within the first week, my well wishers and even people I didn't know appreciated it.\" But after the Indian press covered it and put out their stories on Facebook and Twitter, the backlash began. \"Some wrote comments threatening me. On Twitter people started trolling me, some said I, along with my models, should be taken to Delhi's Jama Masjid [mosque] and slaughtered, and that our meat should be fed to a woman journalist and a woman writer the nationalists despise. They said they wanted to see my mother weep over my body.\" Some people also contacted the Delhi police, \"accusing me of trying to instigate riots and asking them to arrest me\". Ghosh is not surprised by the vitriol and admits that his work is an \"indirect comment\" on the BJP. \"I'm making a political statement because it's a political topic, but if we go deeper into the things, then we see that Hindu supremacy was always there, it has just come out in the open with this government in the past two years.\" The threats, however, have failed to scare him. \"I'm not afraid because I'm working for the greater good,\" he says.

They said more victims may die before they see the final report in January 2017, or have the opportunity to benefit from a redress scheme. The HIA inquiry was first announced in 2010 and was formally set up by the Office of the First and Deputy First Ministers (OFMDFM) on 31 May 2012. Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt chairs the Stormont committee that scrutinises the work of office. Delay concern Speaking in the assembly on Tuesday, Mr Nesbitt asked OFMDFM Junior Minister Jennifer McCann to explain to victims why victims' request for an interim report was unreasonable. Ms McCann replied that the chairman \"wasn't in favour of doing an interim report because he felt it would delay the [final] report coming forward, and I have to say that we have to take on board what Judge Hart says\". It is not the first time MLAs have made changes to the HIA inquiry's timescale. When it was originally announced in 2010, ministers initially said the public inquiry would examine abuse claims over a 50-year period from 1945 to 1995. However, in October 2012, its remit was extended to investigate allegations dating back to the foundation of the state in 1922.", "output": "The Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) inquiry is to run for a year longer than originally planned.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The Warwickshire-based carmaker will put the money towards the more than \u00a3500m it plans to spend on new models over the next five years.

They told her how grateful they were to get the Operation Christmas Child box. The charity believes it could be the first time social media has helped unite a sender and receiver. Growing up in Ruthin, Denbighshire, Mrs Glyn said the horrors of the Bosnian War were lost on her. All she knew when she packed the Operation Christmas Child shoebox with toys, a toothbrush, toothpaste and a picture of herself was that she would be helping a child in need. \"Being six I wasn't really aware of what was going on in Bosnia. I think I knew there was a war but didn't really understand,\" she said. \"I was sort of aware the box was going to help other children in difficult situations.\" She said she thought no more of it - until she received a message on Facebook earlier this month. \"I just got this message from a lady I didn't know with this picture of me as a child saying 'hello, is this you?',\" she said. \"I said 'yes'. I thought it might be someone I'd met on a holiday as a child and gave my name and picture to.\" It turned out the woman who had got in touch - Anesa Avdic Dzinalic - was married to Mirzet Dzinalic, the little boy who received the shoebox in Montenegro. Together with his sister, Safida Dzinalic-Dedic, who was 12 at the time, they were so grateful for the unexpected gift that they kept the photograph of the little girl who had sent it. Crucially, she had written her name on the back of it. It was taken with them in their family album when they later moved to Sweden. \"When Anesa - and then Safida - got in touch, I was quite emotional about it,\" said Mrs Glyn, who is now married with two young daughters. \"The first thing I thought was how amazing it was that they'd kept the picture and also that they had traced me on Facebook as they only knew me by my maiden name. \"I got talking to them and found out more about what I'd packed in the box as I couldn't remember. A Mickey Mouse puzzle, a toothbrush and my picture with my name written on the back... \"Safida said they didn't have much stuff back then and they really appreciated the things in the box. The fact they traced me shows that.\" Now a primary school teacher at Ysgol y Gymraeg Dewi Sant in Rhyl, Mrs Glyn plans to tell her pupils about her shoebox experience when she returns after maternity leave before Christmas. \"Our school still takes part in Operation Christmas Child so I will tell the children how you never know when these things pop up again and how you are really helping people,\" she added. She also hopes to travel to Sweden to meet the family in future. Operation Christmas Child - the Samaritan's Purse campaign which helps people send shoeboxes of toys and supplies to children in need around the world - said Mrs Glyn's story was quite unique. \"Many people include short letters and photographs of themselves, a good number of those packing and receiving the shoeboxes become close pen-friends, and we often have 'full circle' stories where children who received a shoebox become packers themselves,\" a spokesman said. \"But I've never heard of someone finding the packer through social media in that way.\"", "output": "A woman who sent a box of gifts to a family from Montenegro during the Bosnian War has been tracked down and thanked by them 22 years later.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust has apologised for the mistake, calling it a \"tragic\" case of human error.

On his appointment, he was also given 500,000 shares in the company, currently worth more than \u00a37m.

The Health Committee said it backed the aim, but not the detail, of the bill. The legislation was introduced as a members' bill by Scottish Labour MSP Anne McTaggart. Its supporters argue that the bill would increase the number of organs available for transplants, and therefore reduce waiting times and save lives. But the committee said the majority of its members believed there was not enough clear evidence that changing to the specific opt-out system proposed by the bill would increase the number of donations. However, it also said there \"may be merit\" in developing a \"workable\" opt-out system. It called on the Scottish government to carry out a detailed consultation on methods of increasing organ donations, including opt-out, in the next parliament, and to consider legislating itself. The committee also said some of its members did support the general principles of the bill and and felt that it needed to be introduced now. Committee convener Duncan McNeil said the committee recognised the \"devastating impact on all aspects of family life of those who are waiting for donated organs\". He added: \"As a committee we have to consider all the evidence placed in front of us and it was clear that there are differing views about the best way to increase donation rates. \"While the committee supported the aim behind the legislation, a majority couldn't support the detail.\" The bill proposes a move to a \"soft opt-out\" system which would allow parts of a dead adult's body to be used in transplants in the absence of express permission.

The app lets users follow high-profile gamers, watch live gaming streams and leave comments without interacting with the rest of Facebook. It also lets gamers broadcast their own smartphone screen.

Competition in the space is heating up, with Microsoft's Mixer and YouTube funding players and franchises in recent months. Gaming only Until now, Facebook's gaming brand been accessible as a tab inside the main Facebook app, and as an independent website. The company said the stand-alone app was \"a focused, gaming-only experience for people who want deeper access\". The app, which has been tested in Asia and Latin America for about a year and a half, launched on the Google Play app store on Monday. A version for Apple's iOS is still to follow. In common with rival apps, users can follow streamers and comment on live gameplay, and also interact with Facebook groups about individual games. But Facebook's app also lets people play games from the company's \"instant games\" library from a tab inside the app, without installing the software separately. Another feature is the ability to \"go live\" from the app and broadcast the smartphone's display on Facebook. The feature lets mobile gameplay be streamed directly without any extra equipment. YouTube has a similar feature available to channels with more than 1,000 subscribers. Bringing all those functions together \"helps it differentiate from other live streaming-only apps,\" said Piers Harding-Rolls, Research Director for games at Ampere Analysis. \"Facebook's approach is to democratise the streaming process, meaning any user can go live with a stream very easily.\" The approach may provide it with some advantages in markets where mobile gaming is much bigger - such as China and south-east Asia - he said. Facebook says it had five million installations of the app during the 18-month test run in limited markets, and that more than 700 million people already interacted with its gaming products. \"The Facebook Gaming app is a prime example of gaming's resurgence at Facebook over the last few years, and we're just getting started,\" said Vivek Sharma, vice president of Facebook Gaming. But Mr Harding-Rolls warned that a dedicated app strategy \"has its pros and cons\". \"It allows Facebook to position its offering against other live-streaming sites focused on games and helps drive visibility of games content on Facebook, but it requires users to download a dedicated app, which is likely to hamper adoption,\" he said. \"But it is also a user-acquisition funnel for consumers that might not be interested in the Facebook app, including young consumers,\" he said. Game-streaming viewership is estimated to have increased during the coronavirus lockdown period by at least 10%. But competition in the space had already increased before the virus emerged.

Within 10 years, new space telescopes might be able to determine whether K2-18b's atmosphere contains gases that could be produced by living organisms. Details were published in the scientific journal Nature Astronomy. The lead scientist, Prof Giovanna Tinetti of University College London (UCL), described the discovery as \"mind blowing\". \"This is the first time that we have detected water on a planet in the habitable zone around a star where the temperature is potentially compatible with the presence of life,\" she said. The habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures are considered sufficiently benign for water to exist in liquid form on the surface of a planet. The new planet is just over twice the size of Earth - in a planet category known as a \"super Earth\" - and has a temperature cool enough to have liquid water, between zero and 40C. K2-18b is 111 light-years - about 650 million million miles - from Earth, too far to send a probe. So the only option is to wait for the next generation of space telescopes to be launched in the 2020s and to look for gases in the planet's atmosphere that could only be produced by living organisms. What is an exoplanet? The team behind the discovery looked through the planets discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope between 2016 and 2017. The researchers determined some of the chemicals in their atmosphere by studying the changes to the starlight as the planets orbited their suns. The light filtered through the planets' atmospheres was subtly altered by the composition of the atmosphere. Only K2-18b revealed the molecular signature of water, which is a vital ingredient for life on Earth. Dr Angelos Tsiaras, a member of the UCL team, said that finding water in the atmosphere of a \"potentially habitable exoplanet was incredibly exciting\". Other astronomers, however, dispute the claim that the planet is potentially habitable. One analysis indicates that planets that are 1.5 times the mass of the Earth are unlikely to have a rocky surface. There is also concern that K2-18b's size and gravity would make it difficult for the world to support life. Other critics suggest that the planet should not be classified as a super-Earth, but as a mini Neptune instead. This is a class of planet that is typically more massive than a super-Earth (it includes worlds that are up to 10 times the mass of our own planet). Prof Tinetti, however, maintains her view that the new world is potentially habitable. She said it had a mean density that's comparable to that of Mars (which is composed of silicates) and Jupiter's moon Europa, and much higher than Neptune's. \"K2-18b cannot be classified as a mini-Neptune, it is more likely to be a planet with an interior of rock and ices. These types of planets, [are] sometimes called 'ocean planets',\" she told BBC News. \"Now, whether this planet really has an ocean at the surface or rock, we cannot tell with current observations, but having water in the atmosphere is a good start.\" But it is a view that Dr Laura Kreidberg, of the Centre for Astrophysics at Harvard University does not agree with. \"The interior of the planet is much more like Neptune. Pressure and temperature increase with depth, so that before a rocky surface is reached, it is too hot and too high-pressure for complex molecules like DNA or any of the other building blocks of life to form,\" she told BBC News. Prof David Charbonneau, also from Harvard University, said the fact that K2-18b's atmosphere was detected was proof in itself that it could not support life. \"If the planet had a thin secondary atmosphere similar to Earth it would be so thin that Hubble couldn't detect it.\" Long haul Another issue is that astronomers can't agree what conditions are needed for habitability. We only have the Earth to go on but life may also be possible on other types of worlds It is likely to require a survey of the chemical composition of, perhaps, hundreds of worlds and an understanding of how they are created and evolve, according to Prof Tinetti. \"The Earth really stands out in our own Solar System. It has oxygen, water and ozone. But if we find all that around a planet around a distant star we have to be cautious about saying that it supports life,\" she said. \"This is why we need to understand not just a handful of planets in the galaxy but hundreds of them.

The measure covers the piercing of the tongue and genitalia - an AMs committee said that the weight of evidence on the medical implications meant that the proposed ban should be extended. It is one of several amendments made to the proposed law during its second passage through the Senedd. Others include: Other measures in the law include creating a mandatory licensing scheme for acupuncture, body piercing, electrolysis and tattooing. The bill, now to become the Public Health Act, also prohibits tobacco and nicotine products from being handed over to under 18s by home delivery or collection services and creates a national register of retailers of tobacco and nicotine products. The older version of the law had failed to pass in the last assembly term because of a lack of opposition support over a ban on the use of e-cigarette devices in some public places. The ban had attracted criticism from the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, although some Plaid AMs were expected to help the bill pass the assembly. That changed after comments by former Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews, dubbing a previous deal with Plaid Cymru a \"cheap date\", upset the group and led them to reject the bill in dramatic scenes. The bill was reintroduced to the Senedd with the e-cigarette element dropped after the assembly election, and this time the law had a much smoother ride, with no objections from opposition AMs. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Conservatives and UKIP all said they would support the revised proposals prior to the vote. Public health minister Rebecca Evans said if passed the bill \"will create the conditions which enable people to live healthy lives and will protect them from preventable harm\". In a Senedd debate the Welsh Conservatives' Darran Millar told AMs that the bill was in \"much better shape\" than when it included the e-cigarettes ban.

People with diabetes are normally told to keep their blood pressure below 130/80, slightly lower than the target for the rest of the population. For someone without diabetes, blood pressure should be no higher than 140/85 mmHg. Ideally, we should all have a blood pressure below 120/80.

These are sediments that were laid down in the seconds to hours after a huge asteroid had slammed into the planet. You'll know the event we're talking about - the one researchers now think was responsible for the demise of the dinosaurs and the rise of mammals. The high-resolution account of this catastrophe was recovered by a UK/US-led team, who spent several weeks in 2016 drilling into what remains of the crater produced by the impact. Today, this 200km-wide structure is positioned under Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, with its best preserved central portions sitting just offshore of the port of Chicxulub. The team pulled up a great long core of rock but it's a particular 130m-long section that essentially documents the first day of what geologists call the Cenozoic Era, or as some others like to refer to it: the Age of Mammals. Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth The section is a nightmarish jumble of shattered material, but its contents are arranged in such a way that scientists say they can discern a clear narrative. The bottom 20m or so, is dominated by glassy debris. This is the rock that was melted by the heat and pressure of the impact. It lapped across the base of the crater in the subsequent seconds and minutes. This then transitions to a lot of fragmented melt rock - the result of explosions as water rushed over the hot material. The water came from the shallow sea covering the area at the time. It would have been pushed temporarily out of the way by the impact but when it came back in and made contact with the broiling rock, it would have set off violent reactions. Something similar occurs at volcanoes where magma interacts with seawater. This phase covers the first minutes to an hour. But the water keeps coming, filling up the crater, and the top 80-90m of the core section is built from all the debris that was in this water and ultimately rained out. Larger fragments initially followed by finer and finer material. The timescale for this is the first hours after the impact. And then, right at the top of the 130m core section is evidence of a tsunami. The sediments all dip in one direction and their organisation suggests they were deposited in a high-energy event. Scientists say the impact would have generated a giant wave pulse that would have crashed on to shorelines hundreds of kilometres from the crater. But this outward train would also have had a return pulse and it's the debris carried in this tsunami that caps the top of the rock sequence. \"This is all still Day One,\" says Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin. \"Tsunamis move at the speed of a jet plane. Twenty-four hours is a generous amount of time for the waves to move out and come back in again,\" he told BBC News. Prof Gulick's team is confident in the tsunami interpretation because mixed in with the deposits are soil markers, and charcoal - evidence of the great fires that would have been triggered on nearby landmasses by the heat of the impact - all brought back to the crater by the returning wave pulse. Strikingly, what the team doesn't see anywhere in the 130m core is the presence of sulphur. That's surprising because the asteroid would have hit a seafloor made up by perhaps a third to a half with sulphur-containing minerals, such as gypsum. For some reason, the sulphur must have been preferentially ejected or vaporised. But this only goes to support the popular theory now for how the dinosaurs met their demise. So much sulphur mixed with water and injected into the sky would have dramatically cooled the climate, making life a struggle for all sorts of plant and animal life. \"There was a global climate model run with just a hundred gigatonnes (billion tonnes) of sulphur injected into the atmosphere and that came up with 25C cooling for at least 15 years, which puts most of the planet below freezing,\" said Prof Gulick. \"And the conservative estimate for the amount of sulphur released is 325 gigatonnes. That's orders of magnitude more than you would get from any volcano like a Krakatau which can also cool the climate for a short period.\" The mammals pulled through this calamity, the dinosaurs did not.

But now the Oak Room from Mrs Cranston's Glasgow tearoom has been gently woken by a team of experts. And the restoration of the room will form the jewel in the crown of the V&A's Scottish Design Galleries when the museum opens its doors in two weeks. Glasgow Museums curator Alison Brown said: \"The oak room is a sleeping giant in our collection. It is the largest tearoom interior designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for Miss Cranston's Ingram Street tearoom. \"He was working on this at the height of his career, designing it in 1907, completed in 1908.\" The journey of the conservation to the point of displaying this interior has been a long and very painstaking project, which has further revealed the intricacies of Mackintosh's design process. It has involved very specialist crafts people and experts, almost all based in Scotland. The process began in Midlothian. Charles Taylor runs the wood workshop where the 43ft (13m) high Oak Room was initially restored and rebuilt. He said: \"Our workshop is in a former church in the centre of Dalkeith. It is a substantial building and it was just big enough to house the entire assembly of the Oak Room. \"The first step was to take some 850 pieces and to set out the room and it formed a massive 3-D jigsaw puzzle.\" The Oak Room The Oak Room was the largest Charles Rennie Mackintosh interior for Miss Cranston's Ingram Street Tearooms in Glasgow. The 44ft-long (13.5m), double-height room, designed by Mackintosh in 1907 and completed in 1908, is acknowledged as one of his key works, informing his design ideas for the Glasgow School of Art Library, which was completed a year later in 1909. The Oak Room was last used as a tearoom in the early 1950s. When the tearooms were removed from their original Ingram Street premises in the 1970s, each room was numbered, each wall given a reference, and each piece of panelling coded. Plans and elevations of the rooms were drawn to show how everything fitted together. Between 2004 and 2005, with the help of this information, Glasgow Museums quantified and documented all surviving Oak Room panelling. This earlier developmental stage, funded by the Scottish Government, helped inform the work to recreate the interior, lost to public view for generations. Saved from demolition to make way for a hotel in 1971, the original rooms had already been hidden under layers of paint in the 1950s. Charles Taylor explained: \"There was clearly a big spring clean and they decided to brighten up the room, which was covered in a bright grain finish. \"That in itself was an asset, because it provided all the marks to position the pieces back to precisely where they were.\" Also discovered beneath the layers of paint, was the distinctive pink glass Mackintosh had used. Moira Malcolm, director of Rainbow Glass Studio, had the challenge of recreating it. She said: \"\"He chose this pink-purple streaky glass and the lampshades were actually the most simplistic design he possibly could make. They are really just four segments of glass boxed together. \"So, really, it was just showing, finding beautiful materials, made well in a simple design to maximum effect.\" 'Poignant and important' To many, the Oak Room is Mackintosh's lost masterpiece. The direction he develops here, is further developed in the Glasgow School of Art Library. Its loss in the fire of 2014 makes this restoration more poignant and more important. It's been a long process involving many different partners.

But the Welsh government insists there have been real improvements in recent years. It said 34,000 more patients were seeing a dentist at the end of last year compared to two years previously. The figures show that 52% of adults in Wales were treated by a dentist in the 24 months before 31 December last year. But Plaid Cymru said the fact that almost half of adults had not received any treatment highlighted a problem with the number of available NHS dentists.

'All necessary precautions' He said: \"It was recommended almost a year ago that the corroded pipes needed replaced, but nothing was done about it for a further eight months.\" He added: \"Why wasn't the situation made clear to parents and staff who had already expressed their concerns? And why were warnings over safety ignored for so long? \"Bottled water was only provided to the schools from November 2018, so were any staff or pupils put at risk in the meantime?\" Mr McGregor said the council needed to be \"completely transparent about what steps were taken and when, and make clear that all necessary precautions were put in place to ensure safety of teachers and pupils.\" A spokesman for North Lanarkshire Council denied there was any delay in their response and that the system had been flushed twice a day to help prevent a build-up of copper solution in the taps. He told the BBC: \"When we received this report, all options were considered to address the issue, including the replacement of copper piping. \"Given this is a significant job as the campus has in excess of 300m of copper piping, further investigation was required to establish the scale of the problem, including finding the source. \"Corrective action was taken immediately by regularly flushing the system, which is in line with the recommendations by the Drinking Water Quality Regulator.\" He added: \"We have been replacing all the copper pipework with plastic pipes in all three buildings of the campus. \"This work is 95% complete and has been carried out over the weekends and holidays and is due to be finished this month.\" The council said that samples had since been taken from all areas where pipes were replaced and that the copper build-up had now been addressed.", "output": "A council has denied being slow to act after high levels of copper were found in drinking water at two schools.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Arkadiusz Kacmarek stabbed father-of-one Slawomir Kulesza, 47, repeatedly in the head and heart with a kitchen knife. The 22-year-old denied the murder and claimed he was so drunk he had no memory of the violence at the house in Ellesemere Port, Cheshire. Kacmarek was found guilty and handed a minimum sentence of 19 years. He was also convicted of possession of a knife in a public place after the nine-day trial at Chester Crown Court. Police said they may \"never know\" what led to the stabbing, which happened after Kacmarek had drunk to excess. The killer first met Mr Kulesza when he moved into a two-storey mid terrace house in the town's Blakemere Court in February. On the evening of 1 May, the pair were seen buying a bottle of vodka together at a local shop. A neighbour later reported hearing loud noises coming from the property and at about 01:05 BST Kacmarek was captured on CCTV walking along Westminster Road carrying a kitchen knife, which was later found discarded in an alley way. He was then spotted by police walking on Westminster Bridge and stopped when they saw blood on his clothes. The officers took him home and discovered Mr Kulesza critically injured in the kitchen, and Kacmarek was arrested. A post-mortem later revealed Mr Kulesza died of stab wounds. DNA analysis proved blood on Kacmarek's clothes and on the kitchen knife belonged to Mr Kulesza and traces of Kacmarek's DNA were also found on the knife. After the sentencing Keith Drummond, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Kacmarek's apparent memory loss was no excuse. \"It is not a defence to say 'I was drunk and if I had been sober I would not have done what I did',\" he said. \"The Crown Prosecution Service accepted that he was drunk but said that the multiple stab wounds he inflicted on Mr Kulesza proved that he intended to kill his victim or cause him really serious harm.\" Det Insp Kate Tomlinson, of Cheshire Constabulary, said Kacmarek had subjected Mr Kulesza to \"a horrific degree of violence\", leading to severe injuries to his brain and heart. \"It was a vicious and sustained assault and Kacmarek then left Slawomir dead or dying on their kitchen floor as he went out to dispose of the knife,\" she said. \"Our thoughts are with the victim's family.\" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

However, ethanol is sometimes reportedly replaced with toxic methanol in the contaminated drink. Police in the southern city of Bandar Abbas last week arrested a couple for allegedly producing home-made alcohol.

Analysts spoken to by the BBC's Persian service believe the economic impact of the US pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal may be playing a part.

It is like they are punishing us by destroying our reefs.\" I didn't take it seriously. I thought it might be anti-Chinese bile from a politician keen to blame everything on his disliked neighbour - a neighbour that claims most of the South China Sea as its own. But then, as our little aircraft descended towards the tiny Philippine-controlled island of Pagasa, I looked out of my window and saw it. At least a dozen boats were anchored on a nearby reef. Long plumes of sand and gravel were trailing out behind them. \"Look,\" I said to my cameraman, Jiro. \"That's what the mayor was talking about, that's the reef mining!\" Even so, I was unprepared for what we found when we got out on the water. A Filipino boatman guided his tiny fishing boat right into the midst of the Chinese poachers. They had chained their boats to the reef and were revving their engines hard. Clouds of black diesel smoke poured into the air. \"What are they doing?\" I asked the boatman. \"They are using their propellers to break the reef,\" he said. Again I was sceptical. The only way to see for sure was to get in the water. It was murky and filled with dust and sand. I could just make out a steel propeller spinning in the distance on the end of long shaft, but it was impossible to tell exactly how the destruction was being carried out. The result was clear, though. Complete devastation. This place had once been a rich coral ecosystem. Now the sea floor was covered in a thick layer of debris, millions of smashed fragments of coral, white and dead like bits of bone. I swam on and on. In every direction the destruction stretched for hundreds of metres, piles and piles of shattered white coral branches. It seemed so illogical. Why would fishermen, even poachers, destroy a whole coral system like this? Then, down below me, I spotted two of the poachers, wearing masks and trailing long breathing hoses behind them. They were manhandling something heavy. As they struggled up the sandy underwater slope, through a stream of bubbles, I caught sight of what they were carrying - a massive giant clam, at least 1m (3ft) across. They dropped it on to a pile near their boat. Next to it lay three others they had pulled out earlier. Clams of this size are probably 100 years old, and - as I discovered later on an internet auction site - can sell for between $1,000 (\u00a3665) and $2,000 a pair. We motored out to a group of much larger fishing boats anchored just off the reef. These are \"mother ships\" to the small poacher boats on the reef. On board the big boats I could see hundreds of clam shells stacked high. On the stern of each boat, two large Chinese characters spelled out the name, Tanmen. I'd heard of Tanmen before. It's a fishing port on the large Chinese island of Hainan. In May 2014 another boat from Tanmen had been caught by Philippine police on another reef close to the Philippines called Half Moon Shoal. On board, the police had found 500 Hawksbill sea turtles, most of them dead. Hawksbill turtles are critically endangered and protected under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). A Philippine court sentenced the nine Chinese poachers to a year in prison. Beijing was furious. The foreign ministry demanded the convicted poachers be immediately released and accused the Philippines of \"severely violating China's sovereignty\u2026 by illegally detaining Chinese fishing vessels and fishermen in waters off China's Nansha Islands\". None of this proves China is protecting the poachers. But nor does Beijing appear to be doing anything to stop them. The poachers we saw showed absolutely no sign of fear when they saw our cameras filming them. Back on Pagasa, a Philippine marine corps officer told me the destruction of the reef has been going on for at least two years, day and night. \"You men are armed,\" I said to him. \"Why don't you go over there in your speedboat and chase them off or arrest them?\" \"It's too dangerous,\" he said. \"We don't want to start a shooting war with the Chinese Navy.\" I still found it hard to understand why these Chinese fishermen, who have a long tradition of fishing on these reefs, are now destroying them. Greed may be one answer. In newly wealthy China there is far more money to be made from looting and trading in endangered species than in catching fish. There is another sad fact about what is going on out here. However shocking the reef plundering I witnessed, it is as nothing compared to the environmental destruction wrought by China's massive island building programme nearby. The latest island China has just completed at Mischief Reef is more than 9km (six miles) long. That is 9km of living reef that is now buried under millions of tonnes of sand and gravel.

The Welsh Government said those patients should consult their doctor. Fiona Loud, Kidney Care UK's chief executive, said: \"People who continue to be clinically vulnerable deserve all the protection they can get from the government and people who have been lucky enough to have a transplant, they need to continue to shield. \"They need to completely self-isolate to look after that precious kidney and the chance they've been given.\" Coronavirus has hit transplant patients hard. At Wales' only unit in Cardiff, no transplants at all took place between 12 March and 29 June. Although some operations are now proceeding, older patients are still not currently on the active list. Sian Griffin, a consultant nephrologist - someone who specialises in kidneys - at University Hospital of Wales, said it was hoped operation numbers would soon return to normal, having reopened the transplant unit six weeks ago \"in a staged fashion.\" Changes had been made to minimise the risk of contracting coronavirus, she said. \"We are hoping to get everyone back on to the list soon but there's no obligation. \"If someone would prefer to keep going with their treatment, they can wait until we know what's happening with the virus in the next year or two before deciding to proceed.\" Three weeks ago, Carwyn Jones from Pont Sian, Ceredigion, got the call to travel to University Hospital Wales as there was a potential donor for the double transplant he needs. But someone on the ward tested positive for Covid-19 and the unit was closed, while the organs Mr Jones was due to receive were given to another patient. \"It has been tough.

Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told a press conference that: But he said Paddock's motivations and whether there were any possible accomplices remained a mystery. The FBI's Aaron Rouse said so far no link to terrorism had been found but they would continue to \"look at all avenues\" without \"closing any doors\" because it was \"an ongoing investigation\". \"We don't understand it yet,\" Sheriff Lombardo told reporters, but questioned whether he could have accomplished his plan by himself. \"You've got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point,\" he said. Ms Danley, who spoke to the FBI on Wednesday, expressed shock at the \"horrible unspeakable acts of violence\" Paddock had committed. Paddock \"never said anything to me or took any action\" which she understood as a warning of what was to come, she said in a statement read by her lawyer. Ms Danley added: \"I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together.\" US authorities named Ms Danley a \"person of interest\" in their investigation and said they had made contact with her shortly after the shooting. Ms Danley voluntarily flew back to Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night to speak to the FBI, just over two weeks after Paddock had surprised her with a \"cheap ticket\" to enable her to visit her family. While there, he wired her $100,000 (\u00a375,400), explaining it was to buy a house. \"I was grateful, but honestly I was worried it was a way for him to break up with me,\" she said. \"It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.\" Her sister earlier told Australian outlet 7News that Ms Danley \"was sent away... so that she will not be there to interfere with what he's planning\". Paddock checked into a suite in the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents. US President Donald Trump, who visited the city on Wednesday, said \"America is truly a nation in mourning\" in the wake of the mass killings. Hundreds of people were injured in the attack. President Trump praised the emergency services who battled to save as many as they could, despite the danger to themselves. \"When the worst of humanity strikes - and strike it did - the best of humanity responds,\" he said as he applauded injured officers. \"In the depths of horror, we will always find hope in the men and women who risk their lives for ours,\" he added. Mr Trump said he was in the \"company of heroes\" after visiting the first responders. \"Words cannot describe the bravery that the whole world witnessed on Sunday night,\" he said. \"Americans defied death and hatred with love and with courage.\" Will the attack prompt more demand for gun control? The shooting has prompted calls for reform to US gun laws. But Mr Trump - who has been backed by the National Rifle Association, and spoke often of protecting gun rights during his campaign - has tried to steer clear of leaning too far either way. After visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, he said \"perhaps that [time] will come\" for a debate.

He was one of the survivors. I believe that he was in the sea for many hours. He never could swim, so it is a wonder he survived. My father ingested a large quantity of oil when in the sea. As a result, he developed duodenal ulceration and was operated on shortly after his return to Britain. He had very painful trouble with his digestive system for the rest of his life. I have a painting of the sinking of the Arandora Star. It was painted by a German survivor at 'Donalsen POW Camp' (Donaldson's Hospital, Edinburgh) in 1941. The painting was given to my father, then a camp guard. It may be the only eyewitness record of the tragedy. Linda Baldi, Salerno My grandparents from La Spezia owned a cafe in Kilmacolm. During the war my grandfather was sent to the Isle of Man and my grandmother to Glasgow. Despite being born in Scotland dad wasn't allowed to continue his studies and was sent to do manual labour on a local farm. He and his sister had to run the cafe between them as best they could. They had no problems with the locals at all, after all they had grown up with them, gone to school with them and are still friends with some of them today. Dad never complained about being mistreated during the war years, his only regret was that he never managed to complete his studies. He set up business in Glasgow, Dino's and Ferrari's in Buchanan Street and Sauchiehall Street. On the other hand, growing up in the 60s and 70s, I suffered a few snide remarks about the Tallies. Krys Inglis, Irvine My grandfather and eldest uncle who were born in Italy were interned on the Isle of Man. My two younger uncles, both born in Scotland, went to war and were both posted to Italy, one with the Highland Light Infantry and the other with the Gordon Highlanders. They bumped into each other in a street in Palermo late in the war. My grandparents house in the Gorbals had windows broken and my grandmother, mother and an aunt were verbally abused. When I was born in 1947 and we lived in the Gorbals I was always known as \"the Tally's wean\" - something to be proud of according to my Scottish father, and he was right. Brian Steel, Cupar My grandparents, Lorenzo and Anna Esposito, came over from Amalfi in Italy in the early 1920s and settled in Dundee and had four children, including my mother. My grandfather firstly owned and later worked as an employee in fish and chip shops in the Hilltown area of the city. He was never a supporter of the Fascist party. Indeed, he refused to contribute to the collection organised by the local black shirts to help finance the war in Ethiopia. On hearing the news that Italy declared war on the radio, my grandfather announced to the family that the police would be coming for him. They arrived shortly afterwards and he was taken to the Isle of Man. Marie Hermiston, Edinburgh My story is probably a bit fragmented but from what I remember of the stories told, the head of my gran's family was Dominic Margiotta. He was married to Maria D'Placido and they had a large family of nine. Three of their sons served during the war for Britain and all perished. As a migrant from Naples, Dominic Margiotta was selected to be deported on the Arandora Star. He was one of the fortunate survivors. There were others deported along with him, some of whom weren't fortunate enough to survive, one of these was a gentleman named Pelosi. Other families from the Grassmarket in and around this time were Visco, Fusco, D'Angelo, Peruzzi, Tomassi and Crolla, Angeluci, Pappa to name a few. But there were no known repercussions from Mussolini joining the war. The Grassmarket was full of Irish, Polish and Italian immigrants. The name Margiotta is fairly common in Edinburgh now as a great many of his family went on to own a chain of local shops. The Crolla family branched out into chip shops and restaurants. Antony Visocchi, New Jersey My father was a British subject and was not interned but that did not stop a mob from smashing the plate glass windows of his cafe in Leven. All of my uncles were sent to camps in the Isle of Man, Canada and Australia. One died in the Arandora Star. They were taken away in the dead of night by the police, thrown in prison and were permitted no visitors. Their wives and children were made to move to camps inland away from the coast. Although they had to close down their businesses and were deprived of income, they still had to pay the rent, mortgages and upkeep of the buildings.

Tynwald - believed to be world's longest continuous parliament - dates back 1,000 years and was established by the Vikings. It is made up of two chambers: the directly elected House of Keys (lower house) and the indirectly chosen Legislative Council (upper house). The Legislative Council has eleven members including the Bishop of Sodor and Mann and the Attorney General. The two chambers process legislation which requires Royal Assent but sit together as Tynwald to debate policy and financial issues. The Isle of Man was one of the first countries to give women the vote in 1881 and also led the way as the first country in western Europe to allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote in national elections. MHKs work in the same way as MPs do at Westminster and can propose new laws and raise issues that matter to their constituents in the Manx parliament. They can also hold government ministers to account over current issues, scrutinise and vote on legislation and take part in debates when they gather in the chamber. Most candidates stand as independents, but there are registered political parties on the Isle of Man. Thirteen woman are seeking election this year compared to just seven in 2011 - only two were elected. Two candidates from each of the island's 12 constituencies will be elected as Members of the House of Keys (MHKs) for a term of five years. The Isle of Man is almost entirely self-governing, and the 24 successful representatives will control virtually every aspect of public life from law and order to health provision. MHKs in numbers In 2011, the Liberal Vannin party gained three seats with 21 MHKs electing to stand independently. There is also a Manx Labour Party, who through David Cretney, retained one seat in 2011. With no structured opposition, every issue is debated on its own merits and by consensus. There is no whip system in place - the council of ministers and government departments operate under a system of collective responsibility. At the last general election, Tim Crookall won the only seat in Peel with just 646 votes whilst Juan Watterson received the highest number of votes (3,080) - to gain one of Rushen's three seats. This year's election will see an end to a system in which some Manx residents get three votes and others get just one. Following an overhaul of the Isle of Man's electoral boundaries, each of 12 island areas will be represented by two political members with those elected sworn in on 27 September. A speaker will be elected on the same day. The government said the reform was needed to achieve \"equality in political representation\". A shake-up is guaranteed following announcements by six of those elected in 2011 that they will retire from politics in September. They include Chief Minister Allan Bell (Ramsey), Treasury minister Eddie Teare (Ayre), Environment, Food and Agriculture minister Richard Ronan (Castletown) and Policy and Reform minister John Shimmin (Douglas West). The founder of the Liberal Vannin party Peter Karran (Onchan) and his fellow Onchan representative Zac Hall will also stand down.

Mac computers, which do not use the App Store, are also now affected. Fortnite's updates often make sweeping changes to the game and Thursday's introduces a partnership with Marvel comics superheroes, among other things. Game development Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney blamed Apple's plan to pull access to developer tools on 28 August, the day after the new season begins. \"Apple has said they will revoke all of Epic's Apple SDK [software development kit] access for game development on Friday,\" he said. \"If they do that, we won't be able to update Fortnite on Mac.\" Current versions of the Mac operating system try to stop users opening any apps not checked by Apple, using a process called \"notarising\". Apple had attempted to revoke Epic's access to its developer tools for the entire company but was prevented by a court ruling because Epic also makes Unreal Engine, a game development tool used by lots of creators. And removing its compatibility could have hurt companies not involved in the dispute. \"Epic Games and Apple are at liberty to litigate against each other,\" the judge ruled. \"But their dispute should not create havoc to bystanders She did, however, allow Apple to pull those kind of permissions for Epic's own games, such as Fortnite, saying the company had \"strategically chosen to breach its agreements with Apple\". 'Deliberately violated' The row began when Epic issued an update for Fortnite that allowed players to buy the in-game currency, V Bucks, directly from Epic instead of using the Apple payment system. Apple takes a 30% cut from those payments - amounting to millions of dollars from Fortnite. And it is the only payment system allowed on apps available through the official app store. But Apple rejects the accusations it runs any kind of monopoly. It says Epic deliberately violated the guidelines \"that are applied equally to every developer and designed to keep the store safe for our users\".

This decision follows a successful trial in selected restaurants earlier this year. The move to paper straws will be completed next year. Environment Secretary Michael Gove called it a \"significant contribution\" to helping the environment, adding that it was \"a fine example to other large businesses\". The ban does not yet extend to the rest of the chain's global empire, but trials will begin in selected restaurants in the US, France and Norway. In some other countries, straws are being offered on request only. In April, the government proposed a ban on plastic straws and cotton buds in England. But many businesses, including Waitrose, Costa Coffee, and Wagamama, have already started to take action. All JD Wetherspoon pubs stopped using plastic straws at the beginning of the year. Pizza Express said it would replace all plastic straws with biodegradable ones by summer 2018. And more than 60 independent British festivals - including Boardmasters and Bestival - have banned plastic straws as part of a pledge to rid their sites of single-use plastic by 2021. Most straws are made from plastics such as polypropylene and polystyrene, which unless recycled take hundreds of years to decompose. Many end up in landfill and the oceans, and the BBC's Blue Planet II highlighted the damage plastic can cause to marine wildlife. But not everyone thinks total bans are the answer.

He has been a prominent figure in a public immigration crackdown in Italy since his government, a coalition between the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, came to power in June. The minister has frequently come into conflict with rescue ship operators and last month was involved in a public stand-off about the disembarkation of 150 migrants on a coast guard ship on the island of Sicily. Mr Salvini is under investigation for his role in the dispute. In a separate development, a rescue vessel operating in the central Mediterranean Sea has had its registration revoked by Panama leaving its future operations in jeopardy. When the Aquarius next docks, it will have to remove its Panama maritime flag and cannot set sail without a new registration, raising the possibility it may end up stuck in port. It is the last private rescue ship picking up migrants trying to cross from Libya to Europe and is currently sailing to the French port of Marseille with migrants on board. The charities running the Aquarius accuse the Italian government of pressuring Panama into deflagging it. The two groups which lease it, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and SOS Mediterran\u00e9e, say they were notified of the decision by the Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) on Saturday. The authority is said to have described the ship as a \"political problem\" for the country's government, and said Italian authorities had urged them to take \"immediate action\" against them, according to SOS Mediterran\u00e9e.

Clooney, a Kentucky native, said he was \"ashamed\" by the decision to charge Brett Hankison, not with Ms Taylor's death, but with \"wanton endangerment\". Actors Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright have also voiced their frustrations. Taylor's death on 13 March, along with those of George Floyd and others, has become a rallying cry for Black Lives Matter protesters around the world. There have been widespread calls for the three officers involved in her death, who are all white, to be charged with murder or manslaughter. On Wednesday it was announced that Mr Hankison would be charged on three counts of wanton endangerment for firing into a neighbour's apartment during the raid. No charges are to be brought against Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, the other two officers involved. In a statement, Clooney said he had been \"born and raised\" in Kentucky and was brought up to know \"what is right and what is wrong\". He said he had \"cut tobacco on the farms of Kentucky\", owned a home in the state and knew its \"community\" and \"commonwealth\". \"The justice system I was raised to believe in holds people responsible for their actions,\" the former ER star continued. \"Her name was Breonna Taylor and she was shot to death in her bed by three white police officers, who will not be charged with any crime for her death.\" Fellow Oscar winner Davis tweeted her anger at the decision and Westworld star Wright called for a change in the law, while director Ava DuVernay voiced her support for Taylor's family. \"God bless Breonna's family and all who knew and loved her,\" tweeted the director of A Wrinkle in Time and When They See Us. \"Her tragic death compounded by the violence of silence and inaction by the city she called home is more than any of them should have to endure.\" Actress Mira Sorvino, meanwhile, took issue with her own Twitter followers after expressing her feelings about the case. \"I see I lost over 100 followers since my tweet about Breonna Taylor and how the justice system utterly failed her,\" she wrote. \"If that's why then I'm glad to see you go.\" What happened to Breonna Taylor? Breonna Taylor was an emergency medical technician who lived in Louisville, Kentucky. She and her boyfriend were at home in bed when police officers entered her apartment shortly after midnight on 13 March. The officers were acting under a so-called no-knock warrant, which authorised them to enter the home without warning. Ms Taylor's boyfriend, who has a gun licence, fired shots during the incident, saying later that he thought there were intruders in the home. Ms Taylor died after being shot six times by police. No drugs were found in the property. A legal case filed by Ms Taylor's family said the officers were not looking for her or her partner, but for an unrelated suspect who did not live in the complex and was already in custody.

But there's something missing. In the 1960s, Nasa had a very clear target: the Moon. Somehow, Orion has been tagged the \"Mars ship\". But there is no tangible race to the Red Planet as there was to the Moon in the 60s and no hard-and-fast deadline like that set by JFK. Nasa's chief scientist Ellen Stofan says the launch sets America \"on that journey to Mars\". But she adds that: \"Getting to Mars is tough... we're trying to break the problem into each of the technologies we need to develop.\" The next step in the problem is testing Orion's new rocket - the Space Launch System (SLS) - in 2018. But then Nasa will need to design and test a transfer ship to carry the astronauts on the 16-month round trip. Then there is the thorny problem of protecting humans from cosmic radiation they will be exposed to on the way, as well as getting astronauts down and then back up from the surface. Without a real political imperative to get there soon, those technologies are going to take years if not decades to develop. Programme resurrected Orion started off as the \"Moon ship\" under George W Bush's Constellation plan to get Americans back to the lunar surface by 2020. After entering office, President Obama initially ordered the scrapping of the entire Constellation programme. It was the height of the worldwide financial crisis and finding the money to continue with an over-budget, under-schedule programme that was closely associated with his Republican predecessor was probably not a top priority for the new president. \"This is like a death in the family,\" said Nasa chief Charles Bolden in 2010, after the cancellation of the multi-billion-dollar programme was announced. But scrapping Constellation meant scrapping jobs, and the president soon ran into fierce political opposition from members of Congress representing districts that were home to Nasa centres. In April 2010, under pressure from Congress, Obama resurrected the space vehicle - with some design changes - and announced a package of measures to help workers at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida find jobs after the retirement of the space shuttle. Thus, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) was re-born as the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) - swiftly switched back to \"Orion\" after the fuss had subsided. As for the other elements of Constellation: the Ares I rocket, its heavy-lift counterpart Ares V, and the Moon lander Altair - they were to get no reprieve. Going to Mars Obama reiterated that Constellation's path was \"unsustainable\" and promised to begin work by 2015 on a new heavy lift rocket - later named the SLS - to launch Orion into space. But what was Orion going to do now that landing on the Moon was off the table? Obama decided to go one better than President Bush, and announce that America was going to Mars. Now, the Moon was an achievable goal in the near term, given sufficient funding. A cynic might say that setting Mars as the goal cleverly kicked the problem into the long grass - since the technologies needed to mount a successful round trip to the Red Planet were nowhere near mature. At the same time, going to Mars has long been the dream of many in the space community. And it appears that the sight of a president announcing a manned programme to Mars was enough to assuage some of the criticism. Even under the Constellation plan, going back to the Moon would have served as a proving ground where astronauts were to have learnt to \"live off the land\" in preparation for an eventual trip to the Red Planet. Capture asteroid But nearly five years on, as President Obama approaches the end of his presidency, the question of what to do with Orion - at least while those all-important Mars technologies are being developed - has come around again. Among the proposals being talked about is for Orion to visit an asteroid that has been previously captured and redirected by a robotic mission - either a small rock that is surrounded by a bag in space, or lifted off the surface of a larger body. But those weren't the focus of talk around Friday's launch. The latter proposal has already proven controversial in the media, and - in any case - the \"asteroid bagging ship\" probably doesn't have quite as much of a ring to it. Thus, Orion was designated the \"Mars ship\". But let's not kid ourselves; we're going to be waiting a long time before we see the stars and stripes being planted in the red Martian soil.

Police condemned the CPS decision as \"wrong\", and the Labour Party has suspended the 86-year-old peer. Lord Janner \"is entirely innocent of any wrongdoing\", his family has said. A retired High Court judge will now review the CPS's handling of the case. 'Extremely disappointing' More than a dozen individuals made allegations to police relating to Greville Janner, the CPS said. The \"core allegation\" was that as MP for Leicester West at the time, Lord Janner befriended the manager of a children's care home to allow him access to children so he could \"perpetrate serious sexual offences on children\", the CPS said. Leicestershire Police interviewed more than 2,000 people throughout the course of their investigation, and a \"comprehensive file of evidence\" was submitted to the CPS. In a statement, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said there was enough evidence to charge him with: She said the CPS were \"wrong\" not to prosecute the Cardiff-born peer following investigations in 1991 and 2007. \"The police made the decision not to pursue Greville Janner in 2002, which again we have looked at and in our view it was wrong,\" she told the BBC's World at One. \"There are real lessons to be learnt... if we had the evidence we now have earlier, I think the position would have been very different when Greville Janner's medical condition was not as it is today,\" Ms Saunders said. Lord Janner was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2009, the CPS said. Assistant Chief Constable Roger Bannister of Leicestershire Police said the force had invited the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to look into \"what happened in the early 2000s\" and inquiries are ongoing. \"Why was the decision different? Could it have been? Should it have been? If that's the case then I would be the first to say that's regrettable,\" ACC Bannister said. Last year a former detective sergeant with Leicestershire Police, Mick Creedon - now chief constable of Derbyshire Police - told a national newspaper that in 1989 he was ordered not to arrest Lord Janner and not to search his home. Responding to the CPS's decision, the force said it was \"worried\" about its impact. ACC Bannister said he believed it was \"the wrong one\" and it would do little to support and encourage victims of sexual abuse to come forward. He said: \"I am extremely worried about the impact the decision not to prosecute him will have on those people [who came forward]. \"More widely I am worried about the message this decision sends out to others, both past and present, who have suffered and are suffering sexual abuse. \"We are exploring what possible legal avenues there may be to challenge this decision, and victims themselves have a right to review under a CPS procedure.\" One man, whose claims that he was assaulted by the peer were investigated by Leicestershire Police, said the decision was a disgrace and \"if he was an everyday person with a normal life and job, justice would [have] been served\". Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has said Labour \"acted swiftly and decisively\" to suspend Lord Janner from the party following the CPS announcement. He said the allegations were \"very serious\" but he understood the CPS's decision. But Sir Clive Loader, Leicestershire Police and Crime Commissioner, said the decision was \"not just wrong\" but \"wholly perverse\" and \"contrary to any notion of natural justice\". Explaining its decision, the CPS said there is no treatment for Lord Janner's condition and there is no current or future risk of offending. His condition is \"rapidly becoming more severe\" and requires continuous care both day and night, the statement said. \"His evidence could not be relied upon in court and he could not have any meaningful engagement with the court process, and the court would find it impossible to proceed.\" Ms Saunders said the decision will be \"extremely disappointing to complainants\" and she has written to all of them. Last year the CPS announced it was considering evidence against Lord Janner as part of an inquiry into allegations of historical child abuse. The investigation was linked to Frank Beck, who was found guilty of sexually and physically abusing more than 100 children in the 1970s and 1980s. Beck, who ran children's homes in Leicestershire, was given five life prison sentences and died in jail. Clive Coleman, BBC Legal Correspondent The Code for Crown Prosecutors says that, when assessing if a prosecution is in the public interest, consideration should be given \"as to whether the suspect is, or was at the time of the offence, suffering from any significant mental or physical ill health as in some circumstances this may mean that it is less likely that a prosecution is required\". If they cannot understand the difference between guilty and not guilty, cannot give instructions to their lawyers and so cannot test the evidence against them, prosecutors will not generally charge them. That is small comfort to the alleged victims of Greville Janner, but it is the system operating to ensure that the mentally frail do not face unfair trials that they cannot comprehend. An NSPCC spokesman said \"something went badly wrong\" in the way the allegations were handled and \"we need to be reassured this will never happen again\". In a statement Lord Janner's family described him as a \"man of great integrity and high repute with a long and unblemished record of public service\". \"As the Crown Prosecution Service indicated today, this decision does not mean or imply that any of the allegations that have been made are established or that Lord Janner is guilty of any offence,\" the family said. In 1991, Lord Janner made statements in Parliament asserting his innocence after a man claimed he had abused him.

The company behind it says a two-year trial, published in Basic and Clinical Andrology, shows the gel works and is safe - at least in primates. It hopes to have enough evidence to begin tests in men within a few years. If those get funding and go well - two big \"ifs\" - it will seek regulatory approval to make the gel more widely available to men. It would be the first new type of male contraceptive to hit the market in many decades. Male birth control At the moment, men have two main options of contraceptive - wear a condom to catch the sperm, or have a sterilising operation (vasectomy) to cut or seal the two tubes that carry sperm to the penis from where they are made in the testicles. Vasalgel has the same end effect as vasectomy, but researchers hope it should be easier to reverse if a man later decides he wants to have children. In theory, another injection should dissolve the gel plug. That worked in early tests in rabbits, but the researchers have yet to prove the same in monkeys and man. Under anaesthetic The idea behind Vasalgel is not new. Another experimental male birth control gel - RISUG (reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance) - that works in a similar way to Vasalgel is being tested in men in India. Unlike RISUG, Vasalgel is not designed to impair the swimming sperm. It merely blocks their path while still letting other fluid through, according to the manufacturer. Both gels are given as an injection, under anaesthetic, and are meant to offer long-acting contraception. The monkey trial The University of California researchers tested the gel on 16 adult male monkeys, 10 of whom were already fathers. The monkeys were monitored for a week after getting the injection and were then released back into their an enclosure to rejoin some fertile females. Mating did occur, but none of the female monkeys became pregnant over the course of the study, which included two full breeding periods for some of the animals. Few of the male monkeys had side-effects, although one did need an operation because the injection did not go to plan and damaged one of his tubes. Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, said: \"The study shows that, in adult male monkeys at least, the gel is an effective form of contraception. \"But in order for it to have a chance of replacing the traditional surgical method of vasectomy, the authors need to show that the procedure is reversible.\" He said there had been very little commercial interest from pharmaceutical companies in this kind of a approach. The non-profit company researching Vasalgel, the Parsemus Foundation, has used grants and fundraising to get this far. Prof Pacey said: \"The idea of a social venture company to develop the idea is intriguing. \"I would imagine there is a worldwide market for a new male contraceptive, but trials in humans and more long-term safety data are required before we will know if it is a success.\" This type of contraceptive wouldn't protect against sexually transmitted infections such as HIV. But in terms of willingness, experts believe men would be up for trying new contraceptives, such as a gel. Dr Anatole Menon-Johanssonm from the sexual health charity Brook, said: \"Some men do want to be part of the solution and do their part. \"If you can have more options available then maybe more men would go for it.\" He said the idea of a \"reversible vasectomy\" was desirable, whereas asking some men to take hormones to control their fertility might be \"a big ask\".

General secretary Chris Keates suggested the government was encouraging the practice to save money. The government wants its flagship free schools in England to use unqualified teachers to give them more flexibility. But these schools, set up by parent and community groups, will not be allowed to proceed unless they have sound plans for quality teaching, ministers have said. The union is debating a resolution on the subject at its annual conference in Glasgow. The resolution calls on the NASUWT's executive to ensure schools are allowed to use staff without qualified status only to cover short-term absences or allow teachers to plan and prepare for classes, or when all attempts to obtain a qualified teacher have failed. The NASUWT said one teaching assistant taught a class for three years despite not being qualified. It also cited the example of another teaching assistant delivering lessons full-time. Teaching assistants are widely used in schools to help teachers in the classroom. Those with the higher level teaching assistant's qualification are allowed to take lessons but they are not permitted to teach new material, which should always be done by a qualified teacher. 'Flouting the law' Ms Keates said the government's move to scrap the national negotiating body for school support staff had given schools a licence to misuse and abuse support staff. She added: \"Support staff are valuable members of the education team and do an excellent job, but they are not trained and paid to be teachers.\" \"Schools are flouting the law and statutory guidance, and compromising standards.\" She also warned parents to expect it to happen more frequently in England as Education Secretary Michael Gove's policy to increase the number of academies and free schools progressed. The comments come as research published at the National Union of Teachers conference in Harrogate suggests two-thirds of adults in Britain believe free schools will undermine the quality of children's education. Four-fifths of the 2,000 adults surveyed by the company ComRes for the NUT said they would not want their child going to a free school that did not employ professional teachers. And 86% said they thought any school receiving state funds should employ qualified teachers. 'Drive up standards' NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: \"This survey clearly shows that the majority of people want children to be taught by a qualified teacher. \"They see no advantage to doing anything other than this and are perfectly aware that if unqualified teachers become the norm in free schools it will simply be to cut costs.\" On free schools, Mr Gove has said he wants \"the dynamism that characterises the best independent schools to drive up standards in the state sector\". \"In this spirit we will not be setting overly prescriptive requirements in relation to qualifications - instead we will expect business cases to demonstrate how governing bodies intend to guarantee the highest quality of teaching and leadership in their schools,\" he said in response to a question in the House of Commons last November. \"Ensuring each free school's unique educational vision is translated into the classroom will require brilliant people with a diverse range of experience,\" he said.", "output": "Schools are increasingly using unqualified support staff to teach lessons on a regular basis, a teachers' union says.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News They showed that testing levels of 10 fats in the blood could predict - with 90% accuracy - the risk of the disease coming on in the next three years.

And when the research team looked in the other blood samples, those 10 markers of Alzheimer's could predict who was likely to enter mental decline in the following years. Howard Federoff, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center, told the BBC: \"I think there is a huge need for a test. \"But we must look at larger numbers of people before this could be used in clinical practice.\" The full power of the test has not been investigated either. So far they know a diagnosis of dementia can be predicted three years ahead of time, but the researchers are now investigating whether the test works even earlier. It is not clear exactly what is causing the change in fats in the blood, but it could be a residue of the early changes in the brain. Dementia across the globe A successful test for Alzheimer's could transform medical research and treatment drugs could be tested at a much earlier stage in the disease. Prof Federoff said slowing the pace of the disease could have a huge impact: \"Even a short delay of symptoms will have a tremendous economic benefit just in terms of the cost of care.\" Dr Simon Ridley, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said the findings were \"encouraging\" and that a blood test would be a \"real step forward\". He added: \"To test the effectiveness of potential new drugs, it's important to be able to recruit people to clinical trials in the early stages of the disease, when such treatments are most likely to be effective. \"If confirmed, these results could also aid efforts to develop better tools for diagnosing Alzheimer's - allowing people with the disease to access crucial support and existing treatments sooner.\" The Alzheimer's Society's Dr Doug Brown said the test needed to be investigated further, but could pose ethical challenges. \"If this does develop in the future people must be given a choice about whether they would want to know, and fully understand the implications.\"", "output": "A blood test can accurately predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease, according to US researchers.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The figure is about one in 14 of those who took the exam earlier this year. Pupils from England, Wales and Northern Ireland were offered the chance to redo part or all of their GCSE English after complaining they had been downgraded. Meanwhile an alliance of heads' and teachers' unions is submitting a legal challenge to the High Court next week. Exam boards said they were offering the English resits free of charge to schools as a response to strength of feeling on the issue. The AQA board, which has the largest market share for English GCSE, said in an earlier statement that it had \"followed the correct procedures and awarded the right grades\" but understood students' disappointment. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: \"We know that thousands of students who sat the exam in June and got a D grade achieved the same level of work as their fellow students who took the exams in January and received a C. \"It is only because of when they took the exam that they are being penalised and told to resit the exam. This is completely unfair. Rather than telling these students to try again, their work should be marked to the same standard as if they took the exam in January.\" Legal action An alliance of heads and teachers' unions is continuing to press for June's papers to be regraded in line with the January C-grade boundaries. In its pre-action letter, the alliance said pupils who took GCSE English in June had been treated with \"conspicuous unfairness\". A spokesman for the alliance said that following a meeting of legal representatives on Wednesday, it had been decided a claim for a judicial review would be put forward next week. \"We have now thoroughly examined the case that we have and we are convinced of the merits of our case, and the expectation that we will have a success to get the outcome we want - which is a regrade for students,\" he said. \"We will be putting our claim together and submitting it over the next week.\" Exams watchdog Ofqual conducted an inquiry into the fiasco, which concluded that January's GCSE English assessments were \"graded generously\" but the June boundaries were properly set and candidates' work properly graded. The regulator insisted it would be inappropriate for either of the sets of exams to be regraded and students would be given an extra chance to resit the GCSE in November. \"We have responded to the pre-action letter and are rigorously defending our decisions,\" Ofqual said in an earlier statement.

The Health and Social Care Board says staffing difficulties have meant \"longer than acceptable\" waiting times. The plan is to reduce the current number of specialist breast cancer services. Instead, so-called centres of excellence are hoped to be provided. For instance, there is a question mark over the future of assessment services in the Southern Health Trust. While its two mobile screening units will remain, the BBC understands that on-going staffing levels could mean that women who require further assessment may have to attend a different health trust. It is understood three potential locations are being considered - Altnagelvin, Dundonald and Antrim Area Hospitals. Plans to transform the local health and social care system includes less duplication of services. 'Staffing difficulties' While that could mean hospital buildings not closing, services inside could be dramatically transformed. For instance a hospital might lose or gain a service. That could mean specialist staff and patients being expected to travel elsewhere, maybe even a little further, to get the expertise required. In a statement, the Health and Social Care Board (HSC Board) and Public Health Agency (PHA) said there have been challenges in recent years to meet waiting list targets due to \"difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist staff in a number of trusts\". \"While a number of measures have helped to improve the waiting times for those referred for breast assessment, the need for a more sustainable model of care which can provide an assessment, within target timescales, for all people with a suspicion of breast cancer is widely recognised,\" it added.

The AA said it considered the use of plastic screens, like in taxis, but said it was \"imperative\" that instructors could reach the steering wheel in an emergency, which was not possible with a screen. Sarah Rees, managing director of AA Driving School, said the decision was a \"welcome relief for the thousands of people in England\" wanting to learn to drive, and the beginning of the end of \"an incredibly challenging time\" for instructors.

The driving school, which employs 17 instructors providing lessons in Wirral and the surrounding areas including North Wales and Liverpool, was effectively forced to close during lockdown - bar teaching a few key worker students who needed to take a test for their jobs.

But it is now \"eagerly awaiting\" official guidance from the DVLA for resuming lessons. \"We're looking forward to restarting,\" said Mr Quail. \"We're going to make sure that all our students are kept safe and hopefully get people driving again.\" He added that resuming lessons would also help those looking for work amid the coronavirus crisis. \"A lot of our students come to us because it's necessary for a job so I hope it will help kickstart this for them,\" he said.

The Dow Jones ended the year down 5.6%, the wider S&P 500 fell 6.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.9%. US-China trade woes and slower global growth are among issues blamed for the poor showing. Analysts have also cited US political uncertainty and interest rate rises as contributing factors. As the year ended, the US was still in the grip of a government shutdown caused by President Donald Trump's determination to secure funding for a wall on the Mexican border to tackle illegal immigration. Mr Trump has also regularly rattled investors during the year by escalating his tit-for-tat trade tariff battle with China. Earlier this month, both sides agreed to suspend new tariffs to allow for talks. The president has also been at odds with the central bank, the Federal Reserve, over whether interest rates should be increased. At the same time, Europe has been rocked by political setbacks including Italy's budget row with Brussels, the waning authority of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the \"gilets jaunes\" protesters in France and, of course, Brexit. Although sizeable in historic terms, the US stock market falls were smaller in scale than those seen elsewhere, arguably in part because of the economic stimulus provided by the Trump administration's $1.5tn Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in December 2017.

Because some things, like business rates and health, are devolved some announcements were for England-only. So what applies to Wales? Money in your pocket Figures from HMRC show that on 30 November 125,000 jobs in Wales were furloughed - protected under the UK government's Coronavirus Job Protection Scheme. By the end of December that had risen to 158,700 and provisional estimates from HMRC report that had increased to 178,000 by the end of January. That accounts for 14% of Welsh jobs. The furlough scheme is UK-wide, and the chancellor announced it will be extended until the end of September. The UK government will continue paying 80% of employees' wages for hours they cannot work but employers will be be asked to contribute 10% in July and 20% in August and September. Last year, the Welsh government criticised the chancellor for not extending the furlough scheme when Wales went into its firebreak lockdown. The chancellor also extended the \u00a320 weekly increase to Universal Credit - introduced in response to the coronavirus pandemic in April 2020 - for another six months. Figures for January show there were around 280,000 people receiving Universal Credit in Wales then. Labour and some Conservative MPs, including Preseli Pembrokeshire MP Stephen Crabb, have been calling for the weekly increase to be extended for at least 12 months or more. Universal Credit decisions apply to claimants in Wales because it is a UK-wide benefit. Mr Sunak also outlined details of a new UK-wide payment for self-employed workers. He announced that a fourth Self-Employed Income Support Scheme will be available to claim from next month worth 80% of three months' average trading profits - up to \u00a37,500 in total. When the scheme was launched it was based on tax returns for 2018-2019, but due to new data being available the Treasury says more newly self-employed people will now be eligible. What's happening to taxes? The chancellor extended the stamp duty holiday for property sales in England to June. But the equivalent tax - land transaction tax - is devolved in Wales so this will be a matter for the Welsh Government to decide. He announced no changes to rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT but froze income tax thresholds from 2022 to 2026. The personal income tax allowance is to be frozen at \u00a312,570 and the higher rate income tax threshold is to stay at \u00a350,270. Some taxes are devolved in Wales, but the chancellor is raising corporation tax - which applies in Wales - from its current level of 19% to 25% in April 2023. However, the rate will stay at 19% for about 1.5 million smaller companies in the UK with profits of less than \u00a350,000. The reduced level of VAT for hospitality firms across the UK will remain at 5% until the end of September. An interim 12.5% rate will then apply for the following six months. Your local area There were a couple of announcements that might affect your local area. The Treasury announced a \u00a3150m UK-wide pot to help community groups take over their local struggling pubs, arts venues or sports clubs. It's being dubbed the \"Community Ownership Fund\", and will allow community groups to bid for up to \u00a3250,000 of matched-funding to help them buy local assets to run as community-owned businesses. Mr Sunak also announced \u00a34.8m to pilot a hydrogen production centre in Holyhead in Anglesey, which would produce and distribute hydrogen made using renewable energy to use in HGVs. The Treasury said this hydrogen would be used to \"decarbonise high carbon-emitting transport\" as part of plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Budget also brought forward \u00a358.7m of funding over the next five years for investment in three \"City and Growth Deals\", in Swansea Bay, north Wales and mid Wales. City and Growth Deals use funding from the Welsh Government, UK government and other organisations including businesses and universities to support regeneration projects and economic growth in areas such as agriculture, infrastructure, transport and technology. The chancellor also announced \u00a330m in funding towards a rail testing complex in south Wales, located at the Nant Helen surface mine and Onllwyn coal washery at the head of the Dulais and Tawe valleys. The Welsh Government had estimated the project would cost about \u00a3150m, and the Treasury says it will \"match fund\" up to \u00a330m, with the remainder coming from the Welsh Government and private sector investment. Tackling the virus The UK's Covid vaccination rollout will receive an extra \u00a31.65bn in the Budget and the chancellor announced \u00a322m of the programme's funding will be used in a trial to see if mixing different vaccine doses works. Wales will continue to get a proportional share of vaccines and the Welsh Government plans to offer all adults in Wales a first dose of the vaccine by 31 July 2021. Extra funding for Wales? Because some areas are devolved, any announcements around things like support for apprenticeships, culture, the NHS and business grants will be England-only. Rishi Sunak said that the majority of the measures he announced will apply to people \"in all four nations\" of the United Kingdom and that the Budget will result in an extra \u00a3740m for the Welsh Government. The money Welsh ministers will get to respond to Covid will be less from April, but there will be more to spend on the pandemic in the coming year than previously announced. On Tuesday the Welsh Government announced its final budget for the year and said it would spend an extra \u00a31.1bn in the next financial year.

The PMI is a key indicator of activity in the sector and a reading below 50 shows contraction. This is the third month in a row that the HSBC reading has been below that level. The data comes amid fears of a slowdown in China's overall economy. Data released earlier this month showed that China's economic growth slowed in the April to June period, the second straight quarter of weaker expansion. The world's second biggest economy grew by 7.5% compared to the previous year, down from 7.7% in the January to March period. Further slowdown? China's manufacturing and export sectors have been key drivers of its economic growth over the past decades. However, demand for China's exports has slowed recently, especially from key markets such as the US and Europe as they grapple with slowing economic growth. At the same time, policymakers have found it tough to boost domestic consumption enough to offset the decline in foreign sales. That has led to concerns that a slowing demand from key markets coupled with a subdued domestic consumption may hurt growth in China's manufacturing sector and impact China's overall economic growth. Hongbin Qu, chief economist China at HSBC that weaker new orders played a key role in a slowdown in manufacturing activity in July. Zhiwei Zhang, an economist with Nomura, added: \"The fall in the index is in line with our view of growth momentum fading further in the coming quarters\".

It is expected that the new facilities will bring in hundreds of workers each day. The First Derivatives hub will be based beside the cathedral. Meanwhile, the council has plans to build a theatre, a civic centre and a new park. Such investments are also attracting housing back into the city centre. Facing the new First Derivatives' offices on Hill Street is the city's former post office. At present there are plans to convert this building into 18 apartments. The council investments will be worth well in excess of \u00a320m. The overall final value of the private sector construction has not yet been revealed. Planning legacy Such developments are being viewed as a means of shaping a new future for a town centre badly damaged by poor town planning in the 1960s and 70s. This saw the demolition of hundreds of homes to make way for a dual carriageway. High rise flats followed, although they are now mostly demolished. Following the closure of Newry Port in the 1970s, the city's canal fell into a state of serious disrepair. Low bridges were erected blocking any form of transit on the historic waterway and a one-way system was introduced in the island area between the Clanrye River and Canal. The development of the Buttercrane and Quays Shopping Centres on the Armagh side of the city saw more and more of Newry's retail activity take place away from Hill Street on the County Down side - despite regular cross-border shopping booms. Eamonn Connolly of Newry Business Improvement District is one of a number of people working to reshape the city. Considerable debate He was once County Down's Gaelic football goalkeeper. He also built a modular hotel in a Warrenpoint Industrial Estate and shipped it to the Shetland Islands. It is this capacity for imaginative solutions that Mr Connolly believes is at the heart of the city's regeneration proposals. \"High streets have suffered with out-of-town and online shopping,\" he said. \"We all realise that the High Street needs to do something to improve itself and revitalise itself. So this is a community offering, a work offering, a retail offering and a wider regeneration offering.\" The project is likely to lead to considerable debate over car parking. Not just because more people will be working in the city centre but because the civic centre will be built on the existing Cathedral car park. But Mr Connolly believes solutions can be found. \"Car parking is an issue but is one we are constantly providing solutions to and the Council has said that with this redevelopment of the car park they will be providing solutions to replace the lost spaces,\" he said. Among the most eye-catching parts of the regeneration plan is the development of a new theatre and conference centre. This will be located on a section of wasteland that sits behind the existing Arts Centre and Town Hall. Last year the Council spent in the region of half a million pounds upgrading these facilities. As such, the enhanced plans came as something of a surprise to the local arts community. Donal O'Hanlon of Newpoint Players said the investment is welcome, but more detail is required. \"The Town Hall is an iconic building and is the one most associated with Newry,\" he said. \"It makes an excellent concert hall but it wasn't built as a theatre. It is on a first-floor level. So any visiting production, of which there are few, have to lift all of their sets manually up a flight of stairs. \"They want to roll a truck up at the back and just roll it into the theatre.\" Full design team He said that while the local theatrical community is delighted, it has no idea about what is proposed. \"We remain optimistic that something will be provided that will be acceptable to amateurs and professionals alike,\" Mr O'Hanlon said. The council has said that it will appoint a full design team for the project early in 2019. Before that they say that they will engage with the arts community.

Eight of the victims came from the north east of Scotland, seven from Liverpool, Norfolk and Worcestershire, and one from Latvia. The AAIB report said a magnetic particle had been found on the chip detector in the gearbox of the Eurocopter Super Puma a week before the crash. However, it was not recognised as an indication of the degradation of a part of the gearbox known as the second stage planet gear. The AAIB said: \"The use of verbal and email communication between the operator and manufacturer on 25 March led to a misunderstanding or miscommunication of the issue.\" It was this second stage planet gear that failed just days later as a result of a fatigue crack. The main rotor separated from the fuselage and the aircraft crashed into the sea as the helicopter was flying to Aberdeen from the Miller Platform.

But the role of the drone is now changing. Millions of pounds are being sunk into civilian projects - everything from border security to police surveillance and even transporting goods. This year the US Congress passed legislation giving US airspace regulator the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) until September 2015 to open up its airspace to drones, and Britain is expected to follow suit. The UK's airspace regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), has told BBC Newsnight that large unmanned drones could be flying in British skies by the end of the decade. The CAA has already handed out 120 permits to fly small, lightweight drones. By 2020 this may be extended to larger unmanned aircraft. \"In aviation terms you can probably equate where we are with unmanned technology now to manned flight in 1918 or the early 1920s,\" Gerry Corbett at the CAA said. \"We've found them useful in war fighting and we can see the way ahead for commercial use.\" Large defence companies and small start-up firms are investing heavily in what many think could soon be a market worth tens of billions of pounds. To date the development of unmanned aircraft has been driven by the huge increase in military spending in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Now the sensors and cameras used in drones are cheap enough for a whole raft of civilian applications to be possible. 'Quiet revolution' Already the first tentative steps are being taken. Five police forces have tested small, lightweight drones as an alternative to traditional air support units, although only one force - Staffordshire - still uses the device. Earlier this year Kent Police signed a deal with partners in the UK, France and the Netherlands to develop an unmanned aircraft to monitor shipping in the English Channel. On the commercial side, small wing-shaped drones are already being used to photograph and analyse agricultural land. The data can be used to pinpoint where extra fertilizer and pesticide is needed. When in the air, the 2m (6.5 ft) long wings can fly by themselves from point to point using the same GPS technology found in most smartphones. \"It's potentially a quiet revolution that's going to come in,\" Sue Wolfe from the aerospace company Callen-Lenz, one of the two small British firms behind the project, said. \"It's a very exportable technology. You can see this scaling up for some of the big plains in Canada, for example.\" But the real money in the civilian market is likely to come not from small, lightweight drones, but from much larger unmanned aircraft. Unmanned cargo planes The US Department of Homeland Security is already using unarmed versions of the military's Predator craft to search for illegal immigrants along the Mexican border. Multinational freight firms like Federal Express are looking at using unmanned aircraft to deliver mail and cargo long distance. But before the emerging civilian drone industry can really get going, some serious safety and privacy hurdles have to be overcome. The US airspace regulator the FAA said it expects 10,000 unmanned commercial aircraft to be flying in American skies by 2017, a plan that has been met with some fierce criticism. Campaigns are now underway to make a number of US cities \"drone free\" and politicians are debating a privacy bill which would require drone operators on the US mainland to inform the government of any data collected. \"The public is just not aware how quickly this is happening. We're talking in the US of opening up the skies by 2015 and in the UK by 2020,\" said privacy campaigner Chris Coles who runs the Drone Wars blog. \"There is a real failure to have a proper discussion and debate about this in the UK. Very few parliamentarians for instance are talking about this.\" Avoidance systems But behind the scenes a large amount of public money is already being spent here in Britain. A consortium of defence companies led by BAE Systems has been given almost \u00a331m in regional funding to try and prove civilian drones can safely share the skies with other airspace users. Another \u00a317m has been spent turning an old military base at Aberporth in west Wales into Europe's first centre for flying and testing civilian drone aircraft. The key piece of technology currently missing is a \"detect-and-avoid\" system for civilian drones that will automatically steer the pilotless craft away from commercial airliners and crash land in a safe area if necessary. The CAA has made it clear that it will not approve the use of drones larger than 20kg in UK airspace until it is convinced the drone can automatically sense and avoid other aircraft \"If there is an accident at this stage it would set the industry back a long way,\" Mr Corbett at the CAA said. \"We're not there yet but there are a lot of people working on it very closely,\" he added. \"Whoever cracks the 'detect-and-avoid' nut first will, I think, have a winner on their hands.\"", "output": "Unmanned aircraft, known as drones, are the eyes and ears of the US military, providing troops with an \"eye in the sky\" in situations where manned flight is considered too dangerous or difficult.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "We put some of them to our expert guests on BBC Africa's Kenya Election Watch podcast. It's a 15-minute show with three segments: Main interview, fact-checking, and audience questions. Listen to the final episode: Kenya Election Watch special: Everything you need to know about the elections. Here are some of the questions we have already answered: How important is ethnicity in the election? Kenya's political leaders have always relied on the backing of members of their ethnic group and it will be no different this time around. It is therefore not surprising that some political analysts have been looking at the voter registration in the candidates' ethnic strongholds as an indicator of who may have an upper hand. Kenya's five major ethnic groups make up about 70% of the population. In order to win the presidential race a candidate needs to forge ethnic alliances to get a majority of that vote. Ethnicity also plays a role in the MP, senate and local votes. However, President Uhuru Kenyatta told the Financial Times that he expects this election to be fought on economic issues, particularly the rising cost of food. The opposition has accused the government for failing to anticipate food shortages resulting from the ongoing drought. It has also accused the government of creating an artificial food shortage to allow affiliated businessmen to use the emergency period to import maize, a staple food, duty-free into the country. The government has denied the allegations and has since moved to subsidise maize flour. Mr Kenyatta could have a point about voters being motivated by issues other than ethnic affiliation. A poll in April found that 28% of voters were undecided. Which candidate will get Kenyan troops out of Somalia? President Kenyatta has said that Kenyan troops will remain in Somalia as part of its peacekeeping mission until peace and stability are restored. Kenya has 3,600 troops serving under the UN mission in Somalia (Amisom), having been deployed in 2011 in pursuit of Islamist militants al-Shabab after a series of cross-border attacks. But opposition coalition Nasa has said it would withdraw Kenyan troops from Somalia, saying they were needed back home. Since the 2011 intervention, al-Shabab militants have perpetrated several attacks in Kenya, including the high-profile attacks in Westgate mall in the capital, Nairobi in 2013 and the killing of 148 students at Garissa University. In January last year, some 150 troops were reportedly killed after al-Shabab militants overran a Kenyan military base. Others were captured and have appeared on the militants' propaganda videos. The Kenyan government has not officially acknowledged the number of soldiers killed or kidnapped in the attack. Will the electoral commission deliver a credible election? A new team of election officials took office in January after the previous team was accused of mismanaging the 2013 election. The judgement on the credibility of the election will have to be passed after 8 August. The electoral commission says it is working on some of the challenges that characterised the 2013 elections, such as a lack of staff training on using the voting technology and delays in getting election materials. The commission has acquired a system known at the Kenya Integrated Election Management System (KIEMS) which is currently being used to verify voters' registration and will be used on election day to verify the eligibility of voters, tally results and transmit them to a national tallying centre. Electoral commission chairman Wafula Chebukati told a press briefing in May that the staff were interacting with the KIEMS machine months ahead of the election, unlike the previous election when staff were not given time to familiarise themselves with the new technology. In February, 65% of those polled said they had confidence in the electoral body. How are the campaigns using social media? Social media is playing a bigger role in this election than in the past. Kenya has a very active and loosely connected Twitter community who identity as #KOT (Kenyans on Twitter). Their influence can be seen during the campaign period where they push the agenda of their political favourites. Political parties have also hired social media influencers who have big followings to push their messages. Others have a dedicated team of \"social media ninjas\" whose role is to create a positive narrative and obfuscate any discussion that is deemed as damaging the campaign they are backing. The parties and candidates are also creating short video explainers for their campaign talking points, memes and hashtags to push their agendas and attack their opponents. Some politicians are also using Twitter bots to exaggerate the numbers of their followers. The mainstream media is also using Facebook, You Tube and Twitter to broadcast political rallies and special programming. The leading presidential candidates have been especially busy. President Kenyatta has been sharing messages of unity and development: While opposition leader Raila Odinga has been saying that he has the backing of 10 million voters. Mr Odinga's campaign is essentially saying they are favourites to win the election because there are 19 million eligible voters. The minister for internal security has been critical of the opposition's rhetoric, saying it was creating anxiety in the country, but Mr Kenyatta's party has also been pushing the message that it will win the election by garnering 70% of the vote. Thousands of candidates are competing for various seats but not all are getting much coverage on mainstream media, a situation that has led some of them, especially independent candidates, to use social media platforms like Facebook Live to engage with voters directly. How are the politicians funding their election campaigns? Kenya does not have an election campaign funding law. An attempt by the electoral commission to introduce one last year was defeated by MPs. The commission had proposed caps for different seats: The absence of the law means candidates are currently free to spend as much as they want. According to the privately owned Daily Nation, \"most of the money is spent on logistics and advertisements but many candidates and parties also bribe voters\". It reports that in the 2013 election, then opposition coalition Cord spent in excess of $50m (\u00a340m) while the governing Jubilee Party spent more than $100m to run its presidential campaign. Politicians raise money from businessmen and some hold fundraisers. Opposition parties however accuse the ruling party of using state resources in its campaigns. Will there be post-election violence? Ken Opalo, from Georgetown University in the US, says that while there is likely to be some trouble, it will not be on the scale seen 10 years ago, which left more than 1,000 people dead and about 600,000 displaced from their homes. \"I am not too worried about the national elections. The real action will likely be at the county level,\" he said. \"There will most certainly be violence. But again, that will be more a reflection of what is at stake, rather than some descent into complete chaos and state failure.\" This is a view shared by Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the UK's University of Birmingham and a commentator on Kenyan politics. He says \"disorderly party primaries are a reason to be concerned, but that they may not lead to greater conflict come election day\". What chaotic primaries tell us about election What is the true picture of Kenya's economy? Kenya has maintained steady economic growth rate in the past five years, averaging 5% per year. However, rising prices of basic goods like milk, bread and maize flour have pushed inflation up to 12%, and many Kenyan families say they are now struggling to get by. Kenyans have been using the hashtag #CostOfLivingKe to share the costs of basic items and how they are adjusting their lifestyles. \"Every election year, the economy also experiences a shrinkage and that's no different this year as investors wait out on the election period,\" Kwame Owino, CEO of the Institute of Economic Affairs told the BBC. \"Some companies are currently cutting down employment, but not in big numbers, and the informal sector remains the biggest employer,\" he added. Positives: Kenya got $1bn in new investments in 2014 following some reforms like reducing the costs of doing business and bureaucracy, investment in infrastructure and lowering visa costs which has encouraged tourism. Negatives: The economy has however been strained by corruption, heightened political tension and state-controlled bank interest rates - a measure meant to reduce borrowing costs that has failed to deliver. The UN's development agency (UNDP) says Kenya has the highest unemployment rate in the region, with four out of 10 Kenyans out of work. Mr Owino says that dispassionate voters may be guided by who they think will best serve their economic interests. How bad is corruption? In its 2016 report Transparency International ranked Kenya at position 145 out of 176 countries. It blamed Kenya's low ranking on the incompetence and ineffectiveness of anti-corruption agencies, saying that the failure to punish individuals implicated in graft had been a major stumbling block. Anti-corruption campaigner John Githongo has called President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration \"the most corrupt in Kenya's history\". Mr Kenyatta has, however, said his anti-corruption efforts were being undermined by the courts, who were slowing prosecutions and the anti-corruption agency, who he said were \"sluggish\". Mr Githongo cites several reported scandals involving alleged inflation of costs of projects and payments to phantom companies. In 2015, Mr Kenyatta suspended and eventually removed five ministers and other high-ranking officials on corruption allegations. Another minister resigned after public pressure. Opposition members have also been named in several scandals but some have accused the government of scapegoating. Constitutional bodies set up to fight corruption have been accused of being partisan and lacking independence. Kenyan political analyst Barrack Muluka blames ordinary Kenyans for the corruption problem, saying that they are blinded by their ethnicity: \"A government can steal as much as it wants and Kenyans will be happy as long as it's 'our thieves'.\" He points at the April party primaries where candidates of questionable integrity and those accused of being involved in corruption won their races. Mr Githongo, calls it \"normalisation of the absurdity\". He says that theft has become normal: \"Those we used to call thieves are now hustlers,\" he says.", "output": "Ahead of Kenya's elections in 8 August, we asked you what questions you wanted us to report on.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Mark Long, 45, was found with serious injuries at flat in South Baileygate, Pontefract, at about 02:40 BST.

It said the move to \"reconfigure\" the plant was in response to a global decline in demand for fuels. The company added that the smaller operation would allow it to retain 450 highly skilled roles at the site. Under the plans, a crude distillation unit and fluidised catalytic cracker unit, which have been mothballed since the start of the Covid pandemic, will remain closed. 'Critical infrastructure' In a statement, Petroineos said keeping the two production units in a mothballed state would \"reduce future incurred costs associated with operating these two older plants\". It added that the proposals would align its \"refining capacity to meet local demand in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland\". Petroineos Refining chief executive Franck Demay said: \"As a national critical infrastructure it is vital we retain a productive capacity of fuels in Scotland. \"For almost a century the Grangemouth refinery has reliably produced high quality fuels for the domestic market and for export. \"We firmly believe that only by taking action now will we preserve one of Scotland's last large manufacturing sites and a significant contributor to the Scottish economy.\" We're commuting less, told not to travel outside council areas, and few of us are flying anywhere, so instead of cracking crude oil at 300 degrees Celsius, it's no wonder that Grangemouth refinery is feeling the chill of the pandemic crisis. Two of its older plants, first operating in 1949 and 1952, have been mothballed through the crisis, and are now being shut permanently. Whereas it was processing 200,000 barrels of crude oil each day, that has been halved. This cut in staff by nearly 30% comes with a cut in capacity to 150,000 barrels. That signals that this is not a short-term reaction to the pandemic crisis, but an acceleration of a trend that was coming anyway, adapting to lower demand for oil. With road transport shifting to batteries, trains being electrified, more efficient aircraft, and big hopes for hydrogen fuel cells, that all has an impact on places like Grangemouth refinery. And with global over-capacity in refining, it is tough to compete with newer, more efficient plants. So instead of being a big exporter from Scotland, the intention is to produce enough for only Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. The impact on Scotland's trade figures will be significant. These jobs losses, then, come as a sign that public policy is working. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are burning less oil. The industrial complex that has long been pivotal to the Scottish economy is sending a signal of the old oil economy winding down. To be truly successful, public policy would also ensure a transition to jobs in green energy. But in manufacturing terms, there's not much sign of that happening. 'Vaccine within grasp' Sandy Smart, Unite's industrial officer, said the union was \"deeply concerned\" by the news. \"We are acutely aware of the very challenging market conditions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic that has resulted in a lower demand of fuels but there is now a vaccine within grasp which could significantly effect demand in the coming months,\" he said. \"We firmly believe the proposal is premature and that Petroineos should instead be discussing with us how to effectively use the extension in the UK government's furlough scheme to give us more time to explore every option. \"The workforce also needs assurances from the company over the medium and long-term security of the plant.\" 'Devastating news' Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said it was important that Grangemouth had \"a sustainable future\". He said: \"This announcement will be devastating news for those affected and their families at what is already an anxious time. \"The Scottish government will do everything it can to support those whose jobs are at risk of redundancy at Grangemouth and we will provide support through our Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) initiative.\" Petroineos is a 50:50 joint venture between Ineos and Chinese state oil company PetroChina.

As the announcement was made that he was to be Mr Mugabe's deputy, he looked up, smiled and accepted a few hugs as party supporters roared and cheered with joy. Mr Mnangagwa is considered the ultimate insider: He served time in jail before independence in 1980 and since then in government - traversing security, justice, housing cabinet posts as well as a stint as speaker of parliament. Many are fearful of his reputation for cruelty and ruthlessness, as well as his darting eyes. When I once asked him why he arouses such a response, he replied, with his eyes shut: \"I don't know, but you have come and spent time with me, is there anything to fear?\" Unlike other party officials, he often drives himself around town without his security. Insiders within Zimbabwe's state security service say he is \"a hands-on person\" - the link-man between Zanu-PF and the country's influential military and spy agencies. In the early 1980s, he was Zimbabwe's spymaster at the time of the Gukurahundi atrocities, when the North Korean-trained Fifth army brigade killed thousands of civilians as it dealt with an alleged insurgency in the south of the country. He has denied any role in the massacres, blaming the army. 'Soft side' Zanu-PF MP Joramu Gumbo, an ally of Mr Mnangagwa, admits the new party vice-president \"rarely smiles\" but says he is \"misunderstood by many\". \"If you get to understand him, you will soon discover he is a down-to-earth person. \"He is very humorous, very intelligent.\" Earlier this year as justice minister, Mr Mnangagwa refused to sign the death warrants for 97 murder convicts, saying the \"sentence is too harsh and must be done away with\". \"That explains his softer side, partly shaped by his background during the war and experience,\" says Mr Gumbo. Others see the roots of his fearsome reputation in the liberation war. In 1963, soon after the formation of the Zanu party, he led the first group of party cadres to China for military training. A decision had been reached to wage a military offensive to tilt the political scales against Ian Smith, then leader of Rhodesia. On his return, Mr Mnangagwa led a group of fighters known as \"the crocodile gang\", which blew up some trains and also killed a white farmer. He was caught in 1965 and sentenced to death. He escaped that penalty because of he was under 21, but his close associates say he was brutally tortured using techniques such as water boarding and being hung by his legs. The beatings he received at the time have affected the hearing in his left ear. \"He has scars of that period. He was young and brave,\" says a close friend of Mr Mnangagwa, who asked not to be named. \"Perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young.\" Lawyer After his release from jail in the early 1970s, he completed his law studies in Zambia, and then joined Mr Mugabe, who he had met in jail, in Mozambique and Tanzania. \"That's where the bond between the two developed. He looked up to Mugabe as his father, not brother,\" says Mr Gumbo. \"He has been respectful and loyal since\u2026 the time they met in prison at Harare Central, where Mugabe taught him law he was doing by correspondence.\" He was elected as Mr Mugabe's special assistant in 1977, becoming head of both the civil and military divisions of Zanu. Their relationship remained close until 10 years ago when he faced the wrath of Mr Mugabe for holding an unofficial meeting with Zanu-PF provincial chairpersons to seek support to become the party vice-president - a position that was then chosen by the provinces. The president sent him into political oblivion, stripping him of senior government and party positions. But like a true crocodile, he lurked in the water - only raising his head above water when necessary - and striking when the opportunity arose. This came in 2008 when he is rumoured to have masterminded Zanu-PF's political campaign, co-ordinating the party links with both army and intelligence. After opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the first round of the presidential election, the military and state security organisations are accused of unleashing a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forced thousands from their homes. Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected. Mr Mnangagwa has not commented on allegations he was involved in planning the violence. An insider in the party's security department confirmed Mr Mnangagwa is the political link between the army, intelligence and Zanu-PF. \"He cuts party finance deals, organises the campaign that links both security and party. He has Mugabe's ear on everything.\" 'Party purged' This year he paired up with first lady Grace Mugabe to rid his political rival Joice Mujuru of any power in the party. But political analyst Takura Zhangazha says as Mr Mugabe's deputy, he will have \"limited room to manoeuvre\" and must remember who is boss. If he does become president, commentator Pedzisai Ruhanya believes little will change. \"In appointing Mnangagwa, Mugabe is appointing someone who mirrors his leadership style. Mnangagwa is a hardliner, and hardliners aren't known for liberal democratic practices.\" Pro-democracy campaigner Lovemore Madhuku agrees: \"He is a hardliner. The way he ascended to power speaks to that. Many people have been purged. That's his style; no change can come from anyone within Zanu-PF.\" Yet a former intelligence officer, who operated in the internal wing of CIO under Mr Mnangagwa, thinks he is a pragmatist and will be a reformer. \"Mnangagwa understands the nuts and bolts of business, capital. He isn't a hardliner as many people say. \"Should he become president, he is going to work more with the business community; he wants money and that which is good for the country. He isn't hostile to progress.\"", "output": "Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, known in Zimbabwe as \"ngwena\" or \"crocodile\" because of his political cunning, is now President Robert Mugabe's heir apparent.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "\"Non-stop aggression from the US government has put us under significant pressure,\" Guo Ping, who chairs the company, said. \"Right now, survival is the goal.\" The company urged the US to reconsider the rules, which make it difficult for Huawei to buy essential parts for products such as phones.

But Mr Hendry said: \"It is quite legitimate to import the wood from overseas and Ironbridge would be a useful contribution towards a low carbon economy. \"If there's a dead forest in North America that no longer has any benefit and wood from that forest is going to be used in the mix then that's entirely legitimate. \"We want to make sure we move in a low carbon direction and we're encouraging power stations to convert to using biomass. \" E.On plans to import two million tonnes of wood a year to burn at Ironbridge Power Station and the UK produces 10 million tonnes a year.

The move was widely panned by the public, as well as amongst his own cabinet, and within a few weeks Mr Abbott was facing a leadership challenge that, although initially unsuccessful, eventually concluded with his ousting in September. Now, the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who one suspects doesn't see eye to eye on much with his predecessor, has wasted little time in abolishing the policy of awarding knights and dames. In a statement, Mr Turnbull's office said the awards were not appropriate in a modern honours system. Prince Philip will get to keep his title, amongst the seventy-odd others he already holds. But as things stand, his Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, Royal Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Grand Master and First Principal Knight Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, Extra Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Thistle, Knight Grand Cross with Chain of the Order of the Queen of Sheba, Knight of the Order of the Elephant etcetera etcetera (excuse me while I put the kettle on) will be among the last Australian knights. Mr Turnbull's move will likely go down well with the Australian public. But it also raises interesting questions about this country's future as a constitutional monarchy. Government priority? Unlike Mr Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull is a committed republican. A former chair of the Australian Republican Movement, he led the unsuccessful 1999 referendum campaign to abandon the monarchy and establish a republic. Following the referendum defeat, he accused the then prime minister and fervent monarchist John Howard of \"breaking the nation's heart\". Many have wondered whether now in power, he might once again pursue another public vote on the establishment of a republic. Just two years ago, Mr Turnbull was advocating a nationwide online plebiscite to address the issue ahead of a possible second referendum. But since ousting Tony Abbott in September's leadership coup, the Prime Minister has stepped back from that position. While saying he remains a firm republican he has made clear that he does not see the issue as a priority for his government. He certainly wouldn't want to have a referendum and lose again. And polls show at the moment that is likely what would happen. One survey last year showed support for a republic at a 20-year low with just 39% of people favouring abandoning the monarchy. There seems absolutely zero chance of a referendum before the next election due in just under a year's time. But who knows? If Malcolm Turnbull wins in 2016, he may want to return in his second term to an issue he has long felt passionately about. Also public opinion might change, if Prince Charles were to come to power. The Queen will celebrate her 90th birthday next year. All these matters might make for interesting, if a little awkward, after-dinner conversation when Prince Charles makes a royal visit to Australia later this month. Certainly if it were Prince Philip visiting, instead of his son, you might imagine him asking: \"So Mr Turnbull, I hear you are a Republican and don't approve of my knighthood?\"", "output": "\"Knightmare\", as it became known, was arguably the beginning of the end for Australia's former prime minister and staunch monarchist Tony Abbott.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Stanley James, 89, June Hamer, 71, Stanley Bradford, 76, Edith Evans, 85, Evelyn Jones, 87, and William Hickman, 71 all died between 2003 and 2005.

One of Wales' biggest inquiries, it was launched after the death of an 84-year-old patient at a nursing home in Newbridge, Caerphilly. Opening the inquest, Assistant Coroner for Gwent Geraint Williams said police started investigating in 2005 following the death of an 84-year-old \"mentally infirm\" woman at another care home in Newbridge. Mr Williams said it led to officers uncovering a \"pattern of concerns linked to other deaths in other care homes\". In relation to the Brithdir inquiry, Mr Williams said: \"Operation Jasmine uncovered evidence suggesting poor care of residents, including allegations of poor pressure sore and peg [percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy] feed management, malnourishment, and general neglect of the residents' long-term needs, together with deficient standards of care and nursing practice.\" The inquest heard resident Mr James, who had dementia and was not mobile, developed several pressure sores in the 18 months before he died in August 2003. Mr Bradford, who had schizophrenia, was admitted to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil on several occasions for complaints of \"dehydration, chest and urine infections\". Before he died in August 2005 he was \"observed to be seriously malnourished\", by doctors. Dementia patient Mrs Evans was admitted to the same hospital in September 2005, where nurses found the site around her feeding tube \"infected\", while broken skin was found on her buttocks and she appeared \"unkempt and dirty, and her mouth and lips were dry and her tongue was thick\". Dr Prana Das, who owned and ran the nursing home along with several other facilities in Wales, faced a string of charges relating to failings in care.

European Council President Donald Tusk is expected to inform Canada late on Monday whether the Ceta signing can go ahead on Thursday. Belgium needs Walloon support to sign Ceta, which the rest of the EU backs. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) is the EU's most ambitious free trade deal to date. It would remove nearly all tariffs in trade between the EU market of 508 million people and the world's 10th biggest economy. A signing ceremony has long been planned for Thursday in Brussels, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flying in for it. But Wallonia's objections have put those plans on hold. Canadian Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland was bitterly disappointed on Friday when talks broke down and she flew home. Wallonia, a staunchly socialist region of 3.6m people, wants stronger safeguards on labour, environmental and consumer standards. Its fears echo those of anti-globalisation activists, who say Ceta and deals like it give too much power to multinationals - power even to intimidate governments. There have also been big demonstrations in several EU countries against Ceta and the TTIP trade talks between the EU and the US. The European Commission negotiated the massive Ceta text agreed with Canada in 2014, and on Sunday it presented a new clarification to Wallonia on the proposed procedure for settling disputes with investors. The rules for trade arbitration are one of the thorniest issues in the deal. Belgium's RTBF news reported (in French) that the latest EU document did not satisfy the Walloon politicians. What is Ceta? Canada and the EU would eliminate 98% of tariffs under Ceta, which was negotiated over five years between 2009 and 2014. Supporters say this would increase trade between them by 20%, and would especially help small businesses. Critics say the deal threatens product standards and protects big business, allowing corporations to sue governments.

He said: \"On Air, On Sale is good news for any music fan and exciting for our artists who can now go into the studio knowing they don't have to wait weeks, or sometimes months, to see the music they have created go on sale. \"I'm pretty confident that in a few months it's going to be a level playing field. \"I can only make the decision on behalf of our artists and our company, but I'm absolutely convinced that in the next few months everyone will have the same policy.\" 'Artist view' The change is a big shift from established music industry practice. Previously, tracks would be played on radio for weeks before they were available to buy - a practice known as \"setting up\" a song. Essex singer Jessie J thinks it's a good idea.

The Arts Council of Northern Ireland said it was \"delighted\" with the \"lifeline support\". On Friday, some of Northern Ireland's leading musicians said the industry needed urgent financial support to survive. Arts leaders had warned that the sector faced ruinous losses due to widespread closures during the coronavirus pandemic. Theatres, galleries and music venues across Northern Ireland have been closed since mid-March. Many staff have been furloughed using the government's job retention scheme. However, many other artists, musicians, actors and freelancers who are self-employed have not been eligible for income support schemes established during the pandemic. Venues are likely to face restrictions on capacity due to the need to maintain social distancing when they do reopen. There are also fears that music concerts and festivals may not take place until 2021. The Arts Council has previously said that 108 venues and organisations it funds would lose about \u00a34m in income by the end of June. The UK government said the arts funding \"represents the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture\" and will help struggling institutions \"stay afloat while their doors are closed\". The support fund for cultural organisations in England is made up of \u00a3270m of loans and \u00a3880m of grants. The UK government said the loans would be \"issued on generous terms\". Independent cinemas and heritage sites are also eligible for the emergency grants and loans. Northern Ireland will receive \u00a333m as part of funding to devolved administrations coming from the UK scheme. However, it is not yet clear how the money will be spent, where it will be targeted and whether additional support will be available to individuals in the arts whose incomes have been affected by the loss of work. The BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz said the devil would be in the detail of the funding scheme. \"The government has not specified how the money will be divided between competing art forms or regions, nor how the application process will work,\" he said. \"There will be winners and losers.\" The Arts Council welcomed Northern Ireland's share of the funding. \"We are delighted that the arts and cultural sectors in Northern Ireland are to get lifeline support,\" it said. \"It signals just how important the arts are to our economy, to our society and to our mental health and wellbeing. \"We look forward to hearing the detail of this funding with anticipation.\" The chair of Westminster's Culture, Media and Sport Committee Julian Knight said the funding was a welcome \"first step\" but more was needed to secure the future of many cultural venues. \"We know that one metre social distancing doesn't work economically for most theatres and venues in the UK,\" he said. \"We ultimately need to have a means by which these organisations can open safely and gain the confidence of the public.\"", "output": "Northern Ireland is to receive \u00a333m as part of a UK government support package for arts venues.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Six people were arrested and one fixed penalty notice was issued, Police Scotland said.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \"It is simply wrong and misleading to suggest that we have stopped funding to keep rough sleepers off the street. \"We gave councils an initial payment of \u00a33.2m at the start of the pandemic so they could take immediate action and help rough sleepers off the street. \"We have since given councils a further \u00a33.2bn to deal with the immediate pressures they are facing, including supporting rough sleepers.\" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said: \u201cOf course, Everyone In was never meant to last forever. \"When it comes to an end we will need funding to ensure vulnerable people are not suddenly left without accommodation.\" Greater Manchester Combined Authority said it would relaunch its own scheme as a successor to Everyone In, called A Bed Every Night, which aims to spend \u00a34.75m and provide 445 beds across all 10 boroughs.

In addition, in the last six months BBC Watchdog Live has had nearly twice as many complaints about how NatWest handles fraud cases compared to rivals. NatWest said it was \"working harder than ever\" to keep customers safe. Arun Chauhan, a lawyer and member of the Fraud Advisory Panel, told the programme; \"There's a growing body of evidence that they're falling behind other banks and how they're dealing with fraud, now that's on two things. \"That's on the front end side, that's their ability to pick up these transactions that are fraudulent and stop them in the first place, but the second is how they're dealing with customers, are they being fair to customers.\" 'The way the bank dealt with it is appalling' Retired police officer Kevin Patrick was one of the many viewers to get in touch with the BBC after he was defrauded of more than \u00a311,000 in June 2018. After problems with his email account Kevin contacted his provider, and was given a unique reference number. Shortly afterwards Kevin received a call from someone posing as an engineer working for the company, who quoted the same unique reference number he'd been given. With no reason to suspect the person he was talking to wasn't who they claimed to be, Kevin agreed to give them access to his computer. The fraudsters managed to access both his HSBC and NatWest accounts. An attempt to move money from his HSBC account was stopped by the bank and flagged as fraudulent. After being unable to move any money out of his HSBC account, the fraudsters managed to transfer \u00a311,000 from his NatWest account. At the time, the bank refused to refund Kevin because he allowed fraudsters to take over his computer. After BBC Watchdog Live investigated, the bank recognised they did not get it right and have \"wholeheartedly apologised for the distress caused.\" \"The way the bank dealt with it is appalling, they've blamed me as a customer. Basically they're saying that because I turned the computer on it's my fault.\" \"As a former police officer, I find that really offensive because that's like blaming you as a victim,\" said Kevin. Fraud was also attempted on Kevin's HSBC account. However, the bank stopped this from happening. Fraud lawyer Mr Chauhan said the rules were clear and how Kevin was conned was sophisticated. \"NatWest somehow have not picked this up as an unusual transaction, \u00a311,000 out of the blue, is an odd transaction. HSBC clearly have something that works and NatWest on this occasion have something that doesn't.\" NatWest said it had recently increased the warnings it issued to customers making transactions on the app and online; updated its app; increased alerts to customers and continued to invest heavily in its security features. \"Since February, we've carried out additional checks on more than 11,000 payments and stopped \u00a38.7m of potential scam payments after alerting our customers. \"When customers do become victim to fraud or scams, we treat each case individually and constantly update our processes and procedures to ensure they are fair and above or in-line with the industry and guidance from the ombudsman and regulators. \"Consequentially complaints to FOS have decreased by 48%,\" it said. The bank said it now wanted to work with the BBC to review the cases of the customers who've contacted the show because they've been dissatisfied with the outcome of their fraud complaint. \"We are a founding member of the Contingent Reimbursement Model code launched yesterday and are committed to working with regulators, law enforcers and the industry to try to reduce fraud and increase security for our customers,\" it added. A new voluntary code designed to stop victims of fraud losing money came into effect this week.

The governor had tried to postpone the primary to June, but was blocked on Monday by the state Supreme Court. On the ballot were Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, who are both vying to be the Democratic presidential nominee. The eventual winner will challenge President Donald Trump, a Republican, in November. Local offices were also on the ballot, and a seat on the state's Supreme Court. Wisconsin is the first state in three weeks to hold a primary with in-person voting since stay-at-home orders swept the nation amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Badger state imposed its own lockdown on 25 March. All other states have postponed their primary season elections or moved entirely to postal votes while the country remains in the throes of its health emergency. Wisconsin has recorded more than 2,500 coronavirus cases and 92 deaths. Pandemic's stress test for democracy The Democratic presidential campaign has been in deep freeze for three weeks. It seems unlikely that Wisconsin will do anything to thaw the race. Neither Bernie Sanders nor Joe Biden actively campaigned in the state, and the results - when they're announced in a week - will be vastly overshadowed by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The legal battle behind the decision to proceed with the election, however, could have very real implications for how US democracy functions during the outbreak. Some Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have suggested lower-turnout elections benefit their candidates. Many Wisconsinites may have been reluctant to cast in-person ballots. Wisconsin's dispute could foreshadow a contentious general election season where it will be impossible to keep political concerns and gamesmanship out of the decisions about the voting process. On the eve of the election, Wisconsin's Supreme Court blocked Governor Tony Evers's last-minute executive order to suspend in-person voting. \"No Wisconsinite should ever have to choose between exercising their constitutional right to vote and being safe, secure, and healthy,\" the governor said. But the Republican-controlled legislature immediately took Mr Evers - a Democrat - to the state Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a 4-2 majority. That same day, the US Supreme Court intervened, barring an extension of postal voting. Pollsters expected a lower turnout on Tuesday to benefit the conservative judicial candidate - who was endorsed by the president - for the state's highest court. At a White House briefing on Tuesday, President Trump said the Wisconsin Supreme Court had made the right decision to allow the state's primary election to go ahead. \"Mail-in voting is horrible,\" he said. \"It's corrupt.\" When a reporter asked the president how he reconciled that view with his own request last month for an absentee ballot to vote by post in Florida's Republican primary, he replied: \"Because I'm allowed to.\" Wisconsin Republican county chairman Jim Miller downplayed the virus threat to voters. \"If you can go out and get fast food, you can go vote curbside,\" he told the New York Times. \"It's the same process.\" Widespread no-shows by election workers prompted the consolidation of polling stations, leaving some sites understaffed and overcrowded. In the city of Milwaukee - Wisconsin's most populous city - its usual 180 polling places were reduced to five. National Guard troops helped out. Sally Rohrer, a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, volunteered at a local polling station, a location that combined four sites into one. Many voters who turned out on Tuesday donned masks and socially distanced as they lined up. But Ms Rohrer told the BBC she and other volunteers were not supplied with masks. She said that while many voters had covered their face not everyone had. \"This is a huge risk, not only to our health but to our democracy,\" Ms Rohrer said. Many of her fellow students said they did not receive requested absentee ballots, echoing reports from across the state of voters missing their postal ballots. State data cited by the New York Times indicated that more than 9,000 postal votes were missing. \"They were just completely disenfranchised,\" Ms Rohrer says. \"Whatever the results from today's election are, I won't feel they were free and fair.\" Additional reporting by Shrai Popat", "output": "The US state of Wisconsin pressed ahead with an election on Tuesday, despite a state-wide stay-at-home order amid the escalating coronavirus outbreak.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Of the 355 individuals who have applied to speak to the inquiry so far, 57 are from Australia.

The \"Yes-they've-budged\" camp point to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron now saying they will consider any new proposals from the UK on replacing the contentious Irish border backstop (if they are realistic and immediately operable). This is a marked change from the EU's official position when Boris Johnson became UK Prime Minister: that the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement (containing the backstop) was signed, sealed and carved in stone. The \"No-the-EU-hasn't-really-budged\" camp say EU leaders don't believe Boris Johnson has any realistic alternatives to the backstop up his sleeve, so they are trying to take the initiative in the blame game that would inevitably follow a no-deal Brexit by wanting to appear open. The aim being that Angela Merkel, for example, could turn to German businesses that would lose out in a no-deal scenario and say: \"Look, I tried my best. It's Boris Johnson who failed you.\" EU figures who've been involved in Brexit negotiations are also keen to point out that being open to alternatives to the Irish backstop is not a change of position for Brussels. It's written into the existing Withdrawal Agreement. And as for Angela Merkel's positive words to Boris Johnson about finding new solutions, the German media was quick to underline how often she has repeated over the last few years that she would work \"until the last minute to make a deal with the UK,\" as long as EU single market rules were respected. Her attitude - in public at least - is unchanged. Behind the scenes though, EU leaders have been readjusting their view of Boris Johnson somewhat. During this summer's Conservative party leadership contest to replace Theresa May as prime minister, I heard Boris Johnson described in private conversations in EU circles as \"a buffoon\" and \"a reckless populist willing to drive his country over the cliff-edge of a no-deal Brexit to satisfy his ambition to become prime minister\". I now notice a subtle tone change. In his one-to-one chats in Paris, Berlin and at the G7 with European Council President Donald Tusk, the prime minister has managed to persuade Brussels that: a) He is serious in his threat to pursue a no-deal Brexit if no agreement with the EU can be found; and b) He would actively prefer to get a deal through parliament if possible. But this change in perception does not alter facts on the ground. EU leaders still think a no-deal Brexit is the most likely option right now. Time is running out - unless the prime minister were to do a last-minute U-turn and request a new Brexit extension after all. EU politicians also speak of the numbers not adding up in parliament for Boris Johnson. A reason they give for not being willing to jump forward with a backstop compromise. \"There is little-to-no pressure from the rest of us in the EU on Dublin right now to find and accept a backstop compromise,\" one high-level EU diplomat told me. \"If we did introduce a time limit - or even if we got rid of the backstop altogether from the Withdrawal Agreement, as Boris Johnson says he wants us to do - what would be the point? The prime minister doesn't have the majority in parliament to guarantee the Brexit deal would then go through and we, the EU, would have sacrificed our principles, our reputation, exposed our single market on the island of Ireland and thrown member state Dublin under a bus voluntarily. We'd be worse off than if we just accept a no-deal Brexit is going to happen.\" Boris Johnson's majority of one in parliament means EU leaders understand his focus is now domestic: shoring up his premiership by winning a general election, rather than agreeing a compromise deal with the EU. Few in the EU are holding their breath that MPs will succeed in stopping a no-deal Brexit in the coming weeks - though if they did, Brussels would be delighted. I notice rather that a number of European politicians are placing any hopes they have on Boris Johnson to avoid no deal. They speak of the prime minister's ambition to remain in the job and to go down in the history books in a positive way. One European official remarked: \"Johnson can see a no-deal Brexit is bad for his country but we're afraid he's boxed himself in with all his threats and promises at home.\" EU leaders will now watch and wait for what early autumn brings in UK politics.

He is now remembered as a diplomat and peacemaker during a turbulent time in the country's history. The apology comes after a long campaign to formally clear his name. On Thursday, at a ceremony on the Poundmaker Cree Nation, about 200km (125 miles) northwest of Saskatoon, Mr Trudeau said Canada recognises \"that during his lifetime, Chief Poundmaker was not treated justly nor showed the respect he deserved as a leader of his people\". The prime minister called Poundmaker - or Pitikwahanapiwiyin in Cree - \"a peacemaker who never stopped fighting for peace, a leader who, time and time again, sought to prevent further loss of life in the growing conflict in the prairies\". Former Poundmaker Cree Nation chief Blaine Favel called the apology a step towards reconciliation and said it \"makes the history of Canada that much more rich\". Poundmaker was a leader during a period of growing insecurity and rapid change among the Metis, First Nations peoples, and settlers living in Canada's prairies. First Nations peoples were becoming increasingly disillusioned at the government's failure to live up to recent treaty commitments, including promises of rations. Meanwhile, a Metis-led rebellion in the region over land concerns had led to outbreaks of violence. At the time, in March 1885, Chief Poundmaker travelled with a delegation from his reserve to nearby Fort Battleford and its neighbouring village to ask for overdue government rations. Due to the unrest, the inhabitants had holed up in the barracks and government officials refused to leave the safety of the fort to meet with Poundmaker. Frustrated, his men are alleged to have ransacked the village despite the chief's protests. \"Chief Poundmaker and his people came to be viewed as a threat,\" Mr Trudeau said. In retaliation, over 300 Canadian militiamen - led by Lt Col William Otter - set off to attack Poundmaker's camp. The Battle of Cut Knife Hill lasted some seven hours. Facing stiff resistance, Lt Col Otter eventually called for a retreat. Poundmaker is credited with preventing the warriors from pursuing retreating militiamen, saving countless lives and preventing further bloodshed. After the battle, and following a failed attempt to negotiate a peace agreement in an effort to prevent further reprisals, he was arrested and put on trial for treason. He was convicted, and sentenced to three years in jail. He maintained his innocence. Poundmaker was released after serving a year in jail due to deteriorating health and died four months after. His prosecution was part of an effort by the Canadian government to suppress further armed conflicts and exert more control over the indigenous peoples in the region, and secure its push to settle the west.", "output": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has exonerated a Cree leader who was convicted in 1885 on a charge of \"treason-felony\".", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Bern Had they said yes, it would have been the first step towards full membership of the European Union, and by now Switzerland would probably be one of the more longstanding members of the EU. But in a result which surprised many, and which is still the closest ever vote in Switzerland's post-war history, 49.7% of those voting said yes to membership, but 50.3% said no. Switzerland's economy minister at the time, the late Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, called it \"Black Sunday\", warning of damage to the Swiss jobs market, and a young generation of Swiss who would be \"deprived\". And 20 years on many Swiss, like political scientist Georg Lutz at the University of Lausanne, still remember the disappointment of that day very clearly. \"It was a big surprise, it was one of the first times I was allowed to vote and I voted in favour,\" he remembers. \"And suddenly there was a no, which hardly anybody expected, because we were in the times when it was the end of the Cold War, there was this liberal movement towards Europe. And suddenly it was almost the reverse dynamic.\" Success in isolation But two decades later the disappointment has eased, and the dire warnings of Mr Delamuraz have not come true. Quite the contrary in fact. Switzerland's economy is doing very well - its unemployment rate, at less than 3%, is the envy of its European neighbours. Christoph Blocher of the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) was the key figure in the No campaign 20 years ago. He appealed to a traditional image of Switzerland, his rallies were determinedly nationalistic, he even often appeared carrying large cow bells. Also, as one of Switzerland's leading businessmen, he spent 2m francs (\u00a31.3m; $2.2m) of his personal fortune on the campaign. Looking at Switzerland today, he is as convinced as ever that his go-it-alone policy is the only right one. \"Twenty years ago I heard the same thing all the time: there's no alternative to European Union membership, there's no alternative to those colonial agreements (with Brussels),\" he told parliament earlier this year. \"But look at the alternatives the Swiss people have voted for, and compare them with the intellectual bankruptcy outside our borders. The alternative is to stay true to Switzerland, to represent our strengths, our financial sector, our jobs, our well-being and our freedom. The alternative is to say no [to agreements with Europe].\" Accepting EU policies Analysts of Switzerland's relationship with Europe, however, say it is not quite as simple as that. The Swiss No vote coincided with a downturn in Switzerland's economy - both the public deficit and unemployment were rising. Swiss political and business leaders viewed the prospect of being shut out of the European market with horror, and just weeks after the No vote Swiss diplomats were in Brussels, nervously presenting a request to negotiate bilaterally. They knew that in order to preserve their access to Europe's lucrative trade markets, they would have to sign up to the very policies the Swiss voters had rejected. And since 1992 Switzerland has concluded more than 100 agreements with the EU, among them the key elements of EU policy. \"Although Switzerland turned down membership, in the years afterwards all the major issues like free movement of people have been agreed with the EU,\" says Georg Lutz. \"So the situation isn't so different these days, especially with regard to migration.\" Magnet for EU workers Switzerland's agreement to free movement of people is a particular irony: in 1992 opinion polls showed that one of the key factors in the No vote was a fear of immigration, and of Switzerland being forced to let in too many foreign workers. At that point foreigners in Switzerland made up 20% of the population. Today the figure is 25%, and the increase is due almost entirely to the arrival of EU citizens. Switzerland has in fact seen much higher numbers of EU workers coming in than many of its neighbours who are full members of the EU. So is Switzerland better off outside the EU? \"No one will ever know,\" says Mr Lutz. \"Yes the economy is healthy, unemployment is low, but nobody will ever know if Switzerland might have been even more successful if the country had joined the European Union.\" Unsurprisingly, given the crisis in the eurozone, opinion polls today show the Swiss have little enthusiasm for Brussels: barely 11% say they would consider membership. And now a new era of agonised decision-making may be approaching, because Brussels has told the Swiss government the EU is no longer interested in pursuing bilateral agreements. Instead Brussels wants Switzerland to automatically adopt EU law - a suggestion which is already causing Swiss hackles to rise. Bilateral stalemate Meanwhile various unsigned bilateral agreements, including a crucial one on energy, are gathering dust in Brussels. A deal with Europe is fundamental to the Swiss economy, so the current stalemate is not an option. But when one Swiss politician recently proposed going back to square one, and voting again on joining the European Economic Area, he was ridiculed, with colleagues suggesting he \"drink a glass of Swiss wine to clear his head\". Any suggestion that Switzerland should officially join Europe is still, it seems, political dynamite, and very few in the political establishment dare touch it. A pity, says Georg Lutz, since, he believes, both sides might have benefited over the last 20 years from a closer relationship. The EU in particular, he suggests, might have learned something from Switzerland's prudence - in particular its legal limits on public debt. \"(If Switzerland had been a member) I guess we would have pushed for fiscal conservatism throughout the entire time, because that's the tradition in our country as well. \"But whether Switzerland would have succeeded with that, I have some doubts.\"", "output": "Twenty years ago this week Swiss voters said no, by the tiniest of margins, to membership of what was then the European Economic Area.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Katy Baguley and her husband Chris were new to open water swimming.

Twenty-two people died in the attack on 22 May 2017. Mr Holyland said Abedi's \"loitering\", the way he was dressed and his multiple visits would have been indicators. He told the inquiry security staff had been taught how to identify such behaviours in their SIA training. Abedi initially visited the arena's foyer for 20 minutes and then returned later, hiding in an \"out-of-the-way\" place for an hour in a CCTV blind spot, the court heard. The 22-year-old, dressed all in black and carrying a large rucksack, had been reported to security by a member of the public at 22:15. Security guard Kyle Lawler earlier told the inquiry he had a \"bad feeling\" about Abedi but did not approach him for fear of being branded a racist. Mr Holyland said: \"The training focuses on behaviour not features such as ethnicity. \"There were behaviours [from Abedi] that identify as suspicious\", he said, adding: \"Loitering, being incorrectly dressed for the time of year, and multiple sightings of the same person.\" Abedi detonated his bomb at 22:31 as fans left the Ariana Grande concert. The court was told he was seen praying before the explosion but Mr Holyland said he was not aware of praying being classed as a suspicious activity. Earlier, Michelle Russell from the SIA said the authority did not distinguish between bag checks and bag searches but she believed a bag check would require a staff member to hold a licence. Security staff have previously told the inquiry the instruction on the night of the bombing was a 100% bag check. \"If the activity is wholly or partly responsible for determining suitability of admission it would be potentially be caught by the legislation,\" she said. Ms Russell also said the authority licensed individuals but businesses could become approved contractors on a voluntary basis. CCTV blind spots The inquiry also heard evidence about the CCTV system that was in operation in the City Room where the bomb was detonated. Mike Cowley, from Manchester Arena operator SMG, previously said in a statement that in his view \"the CCTV system was a good system\". \"The images were good, the functionality met the needs of the operation and it was a reliable system,\" he told the inquiry.

She told Chester Crown Court she had not told her police handlers during a row that she had lied about the murder. Her parents both deny murdering Shafilea, who the prosecution claims was killed because she had become too Westernised and her conduct was bringing shame on the family. The court has been told Ms Ahmed told police her parents had murdered her sister after she was arrested for organising a robbery at her family home in 2010. Tom Bayliss QC, defending her father, said: \"Its not been an easy journey for you has it? You've had pangs of conscience about the lies you have told.\" He added: \"You have tried to retract your statement haven't you?\" She replied: \"I never tried to retract my statement. I've always said if I don't want to be a witness, it is because I can't cope, not because I want to take my statement away.\" 'Made up' story Mr Bayliss told the court that Ms Ahmed had an argument with her \"police handlers\" in March and claimed she told them the story was \"made up\".

One comment ruins your day. But that's why I've come off it.\" The star, who has 19 million followers, says he'll keep the account open, but it will only share automatic updates from his Instagram page from now on. A quick scan of Twitter finds a number of negative - although not necessarily abusive - comments directed towards the 26-year-old. \"Irritating ginger busker\" is a particularly common insult; while the song Galway Girl has provoked a torrent of anger. \"Revolting, fudged cultural appropriation,\" wrote David N about the jaunty jig, in which Sheeran describes falling for a girl who \"played the fiddle in an Irish band\". Another user described it as \"awful 'diddly-eye leprachaun'\" music, full of \"stereotypical nonsense\". Richard Roche had some helpful advice regarding the lyrics, which he described as: \"Full of geographical inaccuracies (there's no pub on Grafton St).\" Most recently, Sheeran had to defend himself against accusations of using a backing track during his headline set at Glastonbury. The star uses a loop pedal during his performances, which allows him to record his vocal and guitar lines, creating a layered, looped accompaniment live, on the spot. \"Is it a backing track or invisible musicians?!? Who's playing when Ed Sheeran stops?!?\" wrote one mystified fan. \"Couldn't he get real musicians? I like him but all a bit karaoke,\" wrote another. In his last personally-authored tweet, the star sounded exasperated by the accusations. \"Never thought I'd have to explain it, but everything I do in my live show is live, it's a loop station, not a backing track. Please google,\" he wrote. Other users took aim at Sheeran's televised Glastonbury show after he suffered guitar problems during the song Bloodstream. \"Ed Sheeran come to my house and I will show you how to tune a guitar you useless mess,\" wrote one. Speaking to The Sun, Sheeran said he had \"been trying to work out why people dislike me so much\" but the simple answer is that he's the victim of his own success. His third album \u00f7 (Divide) is the year's biggest-seller, dominating the charts and radio around the world. In the UK, every song on the record made the top 20 of the singles chart, while the lead single, Shape Of You, spent 14 weeks at number one. That sort of ubiquity draws out the more mean-spirited and aggressive users of Twitter - which has gained a reputation for harbouring trolls. Stars including Miley Cyrus, Sue Perkins, Stephen Fry, Halsey and Avengers director Joss Whedon have all quit the site after suffering abuse. Others, including Selena Gomez and Tom Daley, have received death threats. (We saw no evidence of similar tweets to Sheeran, although it is possible such messages would have been deleted for violating Twitter's terms and conditions). Last year, Bloomberg reported that Disney chose not to pursue an acquisition of the social media network in part because it thought the bullying behaviour of some users might damage the film company's image. Twitter has since taken action to combat abuse - giving users better tools to mute or block trolls. Based upon a trawl of Sheeran's account, mean tweets are vastly outweighed by positive ones. Every time he posts a photo or a comment, the majority of responses are variations of, \"I love you\", \"te amo\" and \"come to Portugal!\" And if Sheeran ventures back onto the site, he'll find heartwarming messages like this one from Castie Collins, who wrote: \"I'm learning guitar because of you.\" \"Thank u @edsheeran for making great music so studying isn't always SO terrible,\" said Emily Estopare. Hannah Robinson added: \"I'm sick and feel like crap but I turned on some Ed Sheeran songs and felt better.\" And Karen Porter had kind words for Sheeran's Glastonbury slot: \"Could tell you were having the best time ever up on that stage,\" she said. \"Amazing to see true talent and a genuine soul. Much love.\" Even the star's least-liked song received some (faint) praise from Sadie Lyon, who wrote: \"My Uber driver knows the rap bit in Galway Girl.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

PM Boris Johnson has said airport tests would identify only 7% of cases and so could give a \"false sense of security\". And Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said testing was not a \"silver bullet\". \"That's why we have the quarantine,\" Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. \"The idea that one test in an airport could resolve the quarantine issues... we couldn't safely do that,\" he said. A government spokesman said assessment of how testing might help was ongoing. \"Any potential change to the testing for arrivals would need to be robust in minimising the chance that positive cases are missed,\" he said. The BBC has been told a cabinet decision on whether to introduce airport testing has been repeatedly postponed and now may never happen. In a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, Labour argues the UK's quarantine arrangements are \"losing public confidence and undermining our ability to keep people safe and save jobs\". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he was calling for a \"two test system\". \"It isn't just about a test in an airport,\" he said, adding that follow-up tests would improve the accuracy of the results. \"If the government had it [a two test system] up and running it would take away need for 14 day quarantine policy,\" he said. People entering the UK face 14 days of self-isolation unless they are travelling from countries that are exempt - a status determined by the separate authorities in each of the four nations. In recent weeks, Britons holidaying in France, Spain and the Netherlands have been caught out by the removal of exemptions at short notice. Last week, Scotland and Wales told arrivals from Portugal and parts of Greece to quarantine, while England and Northern Ireland held off. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps admitted it had created a \"confusing\" situation for travellers. In theory, airport testing is a great idea and would reduce the length of time quarantine could take. But there are a number of problems. The incubation period for coronavirus - the point at which someone becomes infected to the point at which they show symptoms - can be up to 14 days. In the early part of the incubation period the test may not pick up the virus. So you cannot just test at the airport and think someone is clear. They would still have to quarantine and then the idea discussed is that they would be tested after maybe seven or 10 days. That has a minimal effect on quarantine and would put the testing regime under even more strain. A more immediate solution - and one that has been put to the government - is to be a little more intelligent with the quarantine rules. It is a rather blunt tool - some countries are on the quarantine list with infection rates only a little higher than the UK. And national infection rates miss the differences between regions. One suggestion is you only insist on quarantine when a traveller has been in a high infection rate area. But of course that becomes even harder to enforce. In his letter to the home secretary, Mr Thomas-Symonds calls for a review to report back within a fortnight. \"It should include outlining options for a robust testing regime in airports, and related follow-up tests, that could help to safely minimise the need for 14-day quarantine,\" he writes. \"Given the huge challenges being faced by the travel sector and the scale of job losses, it makes sense to look at this area as part of a wider package of improvements to the testing regime.\" He also said there were \"serious concerns\" about the poor monitoring of incoming travellers, claiming \"less than a third of passenger-locator forms are checked\". Airlines have criticised the use of quarantine measures at a time when lockdowns around the world have contributed to a collapse in passenger demand. On Friday, Virgin Atlantic announced plans to axe another 1,150 jobs after completing a \u00a31.2bn rescue deal, months after making 3,150 redundancies as a result of the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic. Airport bosses have also criticised ministers. On-site testing facilities had already been set up at London's Heathrow Airport, chief executive John Holland-Kaye said last week. \"It is frustrating that the government just has not made a decision to get on with this, when governments in other countries in Europe are getting on and making it happen,\" he added. France and Germany are using testing at airports for passengers arriving from countries with a higher infection rate. And, on Friday, former Brexit Secretary David Davis said testing at UK airports - with passengers given results within two hours - could cut quarantine to \"less than five days\". \"If anybody is positive, they should be quarantined right there,\" he said, arguing the government could pay to house them in under-used airport hotels. However, the prime minister responded by pointing to Public Health England modelling suggesting only 7% of cases would be picked up. While he understood \"the difficulties\" the airline industry was facing, Mr Johnson said \"93% of the time you could have a real false sense of security, a false sense of confidence when you arrive and take a test\". \"The quarantine system that we have has got to be an important part of our repertoire, of our toolbox, in fighting Covid,\" he added.", "output": "Airport coronavirus testing options should be explored as a way of cutting the number of travellers who must spend two weeks in quarantine, says Labour.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "At a question and answer session in Portree, Infrastructure Secretary Alex Neil said a feasibility study was already under way.

She added that just the name of the village was enough to prompt humiliating taunts from whomever she met. \"The situation was so bad that even our relatives mock us relentlessly,\" she said. In 2017, Mr Modi directed authorities to change the village's name. Today, the renamed village of Ajit Nagar stands proudly in the northern Indian state of Haryana. The village council chief, Lakwinder Ram, said they had been trying for years to get the attention of the government and change the name. \"When that didn't work, we thought that perhaps a young person writing directly to Mr Modi might move him,\" he said. \"There was not a soul in the village who didn't want the name to change.\" Locals say that Ganda got its name when a flood ravaged the area decades ago. An officer who visited in the aftermath of the disaster saw all the debris that had been swept in and remarked that it was extremely dirty or \"ganda\". Since then, they say, the name just stuck. Mr Ram added that the name of the village also drove away potential grooms since they did not want a bride from a village that had such a humiliating name. \"We are extremely relieved now,\" he said. But Ganda is hardly a unique case. Representatives from more than 50 villages have pestered the Indian government for a name change in the recent past. The reasons are varied - some names are seen as racist, others were just bizarre and a few more downright embarrassing for its inhabitants. \"The requests of some 40 villages have been accepted and implemented,\" Krishan Kumar, a senior federal government official, said. Among these, is a village called Kinnar which means transgender in Hindi. That became Gaibi Nagar in 2016. And in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, a village in Alwar district used to be called Chor Basai. But since the word chor means thief in Hindi, the village's new name is now just Basai. But the process to get the name of a village changed is not that easy. To begin with, the state government must be convinced enough to take up the issue with the Indian government, which has the final authority. But before they can grant the request, the government also has to get clearances from other official units including the railways and postal department as well as the Survey of India. This is to ensure that the new proposed name does not exist anywhere else in the country. For residents of Lula Ahir village in Haryana state - a derogatory term for a disabled person in Hindi- the process has been fraught with bureaucracy. They first wrote to the state government in 2016, unhappy with the village name. \"We wanted to change the name to Dev Nagar,\" village council chief Virender Singh said. They waited for a response for six months - only to receive a rejection letter since a village named Dev Nagar already exists somewhere else in the country. Back at the drawing board, the village council decided to try once again with another name - Krishan Nagar. \"We wrote to the administration again and kept following it up with them,\" Mr Singh said. \"But it just went from one department to another.\" In July, they thought their luck had changed when the state's chief minister announced that the village had a new name. Instead, they found out that the decision hadn't been formally implemented by the central government yet.

The shocking 2015 allegations led to calls for an inquiry into policing. The story in Quebec is unfolding as law enforcement across the country is under growing scrutiny of the relationship between police and First Nations people in Canada. The high-profile case began last year, when a number of women went public with their allegations to investigative news program \"Enquete\", describing intimidation, abuse of power, and sexual and physical abuse by provincial police stationed in Val d'Or, a town of 31,000 people some 530km (330 miles) northwest of Montreal. Soon after, the Quebec government ordered a wide-ranging inquiry into the allegations, with the investigation handled by Montreal police. Six Quebec provincial police officers from Val d'Or were suspended with pay during the investigation. The police eventually handed over 37 files to Crown prosecutors. On Friday, the Crown gave a rare explanation of its decision not to press charges at a news conference in Val d'Or, saying they hoped the transparency would help bolster faith in the process. Prosecutors said they had no reason not to believe the women's allegations but did not think they could prove them in court. \"We have to be clear that the fact that charges have not been laid doesn't mean that the events did not take place. The burden on the Crown is very high. We have to show that the suspect is guilty beyond reasonable doubt,\" said Sylvain Petitclerc. The Crown said in a number of cases there was insufficient evidence to identify a suspect. In other cases, they failed to find enough overall evidence. In three cases, the allegations were made by a third party and later denied by the potential complainant. In one instance the suspect had died. The Crown did file charges against two retired police officers from Schefferville, another rural Quebec community, on alleged crimes dating back to the 1980s and 1990s. But Edith Cloutier, with the Val-d'Or Native Friendship Centre, called Val d'Or \"ground zero\" for the accusations, and said the lack of charges has renewed calls for an independent inquiry into systemic racism and the relationship between police and aboriginal people in Quebec. The province has repeatedly rejected that request from federal and provincial indigenous groups. \"Those women forgot their fear, broke their silence, finally spoke out,\" Ms Cloutier said. \"The system has failed to protect them.\" Assembly of First Nations Regional Chief for Quebec-Labrador Ghislain Picard said simply: \"It's clear there is a very wide gap between justice and its application to indigenous people.\" In April, Quebec setup a confidential hotline indigenous people could call to file complaints of police abuse.

The decision has been revealed in a series of exchanges with customer Andrew Denny, who said: \"Tried to buy a loaf of bread yesterday. To my astonishment the local Gregg's said they didn't sell it any more.\" The company responded: \"Sorry Andrew. If products aren't selling well, we take them off to allow for other products to be sold.\" After Denny said this made Greggs more like a \"snack bar\" than a baker, it added that \"we do still sell bread in some of our shops :-)\". The company says it's now focusing on \"food-on-the-go products, including sandwiches\", which are \"freshly prepared in store every day and made using our own bread\". \"While loaves of bread can still be purchased in a number of our shops where we see high levels of customer demand,\" a spokeswoman adds, \"we also understand that customer shopping habits and needs are changing and have adapted accordingly.\" Ready-made sandwiches are certainly huge business, with sales increasing by 4.2% in the last year to \u00a37.85bn, according to the British Sandwich Association. The average price of a ready-made sandwich is \u00a32.14, it says. This is cheap compared with most fast foods, especially when part of a lunchtime deal, including a drink and a snack, for not much more money. The concentration on takeaway sandwiches and other ready-to-eat food appears to be working for Greggs, which earlier this year gave its shareholders a \u00a320m dividend after sales exceeded expectations. But food journalist Andrew Webb worries that bread, part of the human diet for around 9,000 years, is in danger of becoming \"little more than a carbohydrate glove\" to prevent sandwich fillings from spilling. \"We treat bread these days a little like we treat tea or milk,\" he says. \"We just want the cheapest available. It's the product that gets thrown out the most.\" Overall sales of loaves in the UK fell from the 1950s to 1980s, according to the Federation of Bakers. They stabilised during the 1980s and, since the early 1990s, have risen and fallen again. Still, 83% of consumers still buy packaged, sliced loaves, according to the market research company Mintel. Lunch breaks have become shorter, meaning more people eat in the workplace, in a style Webb calls \"al desko\". Supermarkets have entered the lunchtime market, forcing Greggs and its competitors to focus, particularly in city-centre areas heavy on office workers, on sandwiches and other convenience foods, he adds. Greggs also sells pasties, sausage rolls, salads and pizza slices, among other things. Yet sandwiches dominate front-of-shop displays. \"We continue to eat a lot of bread, but often we hardly notice it,\" says Webb. \"The decision by Greggs is another step towards this.\" Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.", "output": "Greggs, Britain's biggest chain of bakeries, has stopped selling loaves in many of its stores.

The new Welsh Revenue Authority (WRA) will collect the devolved taxes. It should work with professional bodies to clarify how they will work, the assembly's Finance Committee has said. The Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes Bill was published in September. In a report, the Finance Committee made 18 recommendations in relation to the bill. The committee said it wanted clarification on how the law would affect cross-border properties, with concerns there is no definitive map of them. 'This bill should proceed' Committee members were also worried the provisions for establishing the amount of tax due and to whom were confusing and unclear to taxpayers. Chairman of the committee, Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas, said the issue needed clearing up as a \"matter of urgency\". \"While the committee has agreed this bill should proceed, we also want to see much clearer guidance from the Welsh Government as to what the land transaction tax is and how it will work,\" he added. \"We want to see assurances the Welsh Revenue Authority, which will be responsible for collecting taxes raised, will be ready to collect taxes and offer advice from day one.\" The committee's report will be considered in a meeting of the full assembly before a vote on whether the bill can proceed to the next stage of the law-making process.

Rail punctuality across the UK sank to a 13-year low in 2018. Punctuality information will let passengers get a more accurate picture of exactly how good their service is. UK rail passengers have become increasingly frustrated by delays in recent years as creaking networks, staff shortages, and industrial action have taken their toll. In the year to the middle of October 2018, trains clocked up 32 years of delays. According to the Office of Rail and Road, total delay hours have increased 22% since 2008-9, compared with a 10% increase in the number of trains running. With rail fare increases digging ever deeper into consumers' wallets, passengers do not believe they are getting the service they are paying for. In September 2018 regulator the Office of Rail and Road said \"no-one took charge\" during timetable chaos that caused severe disruption on Britain's railways in May of that year. It blamed a lack of \"responsibility and accountability\" and said passengers were \"badly treated\". Cancellations and delays continue to plague thousands of commuters. For example, on Friday morning all of the trains coming into and going out of Waterloo, a major London transport hub, were cancelled after over-running engineering work. On time? Industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said the punctuality information will help train operators pinpoint the causes of delays and improve their services. It won't lead to more compensation for passengers because companies will continue to be held to the standards set down in their franchise agreements, which don't take account of the new measures. However, passenger group Transport Focus welcomed the move towards greater transparency. Anthony Smith, its chief executive, said: \"Train timetables need to be a work of fact, not fiction. \"It is good to see train operators reporting true on-time performance to the minute at every station.\" Train firms will publish a spread of information about their services, such as how many were early, within a minute of the timetable or within three, five, 10 or 15 minutes. The proportion of trains cancelled will also be shown. RDG chief executive Paul Plummer said: \"Every second matters to us and our customers which is why rail companies have together developed and are now using these to-the-minute measures for train punctuality at every station as part of our plan to improve the railway today. \"Record investment to upgrade the railway, including the roll out of thousands of new carriages, will continue to help improve journeys over the coming years and in the shorter term, we're using a more transparent measure of punctuality to help us cut delays and reduce disruption.\"", "output": "A more exacting standard for punctuality will be brought in on UK railways next month in an attempt to improve performance.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The vehicles collided on Monkswood Way, Stevenage, at about 21:45 BST on Thursday leaving two seriously injured and 15 more hurt. One of the event's organisers described the \"horrific\" crash as a \"nightmare\". Hertfordshire Assistant Chief Constable Nathan Briant said the two drivers had been identified and interviewed. He said officers were \"continuing to work with partners to fully understand the events\" and the drivers had been \"interviewed as part of the ongoing investigation\". \"Whilst the events do occur regularly the meeting yesterday evening appeared far larger in nature than previous events, and it is now understood that an organiser had publicised the meeting on social media as a charity event,\" he said. \"Last night we identified more than 130 witnesses and an investigative team has been formed to ensure each of these is contacted to obtain their statements. \"We are also aware of a large number of people leaving the area prior to our arrival, among these are likely also to be further witnesses to the collision.\" Police have asked witnesses to send footage of the crash to detectives. Video footage shows one car passing another before the two collide and one strikes people standing at the roadside while the other hits spectators in the central reservation. One witness said on Twitter: \"I've just witnessed that horrendous crash in Stevenage, no more than 50ft away from me. I'm still trying to process it all.\" Cruise-Herts planned the event on Thursday where people were due to gather to look at modified cars. Organiser Rix Sidhu said he had been organising similar meets for 17 years and the latest was held to raise money for charity. He estimated one of the cars that crashed was travelling at 60 or 70mph and then went into the crowd \"at speed\". Mr Sidhu said: \"We held the meet in a car park with a speed bump at the entrance. But unfortunately some people went a bit rogue. \"We try and stop that, we urge people...not to go out on the roads, not to risk injury or anything. \"But unfortunately, in this age of social media and Snapchat, people want to get footage and post things to their friends, which seems to drive some people to the main road.\" In a statement on Facebook he said they would not be organising any more such events. He also said the police were aware that the group met every Thursday evening, having attended in the past, and said the two drivers involved in the crash were \"not regulars\". At the scene By Adam Jinkerson, BBC News Last night there were hundreds of people here, but this morning the only sign anything happened is an abundance of skidmarks in the adjacent car park - and police markings on the road at the scene of the accident. There are yellow spray-painted markings that seem to indicate where the two cars involved were travelling, the point at which they met - and where they came to rest. Some of those markings are on the pavement. I can also see that first aid was given here. There are are a few bits of medical paraphernalia left among the rubbish, which is now the only other evidence of how many people were gathered here last night. Throughout the morning young people have been turning up to collect their vehicles but they have been too upset to talk about what happened. Fellow organiser Dean Summerbee, 34, said people attending had been warned not to race or do wheel spins and burnouts. He said: \"It was horrific seeing it last night. It still plays over in my head in slow motion. I literally had to pull my mate out of the way. \"My thoughts go out to everyone who has been hurt. It's not something I'd like to relive again. \"I feel sorry for anyone who witnessed it. It was a nightmare last night.\" The section of A-road passes a retail park near Stevenage Football Club. Tom Adams, who lives in Welwyn Garden City and arrived shortly after the crash, said he knew the organisers \"dotted all the Is and crossed all the Ts\" and it was \"not just a gathering of hooligans\" but the event had been let down by a \"bunch of boy racers\". He added: \"There is a select group of people that have no consideration for other people and unfortunately that has come back to bite us.\" Ciaran O'Connor, 33, was travelling home when he witnessed the crash which he described as \"horrific\". Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service crews cut free one person trapped in a vehicle and provided \"trauma care\" to a number of injured people. Stevenage Borough Council leader Sharon Taylor said such events were unauthorised and hard to regulate. She said: \"We will do whatever we can to make sure we don't get dreadful incidents like this.

While 324 synod members voted for women bishops, Church voting rules mean 122 votes against were enough to block it. However, the Archbishop of York said the principle had been accepted. Dr Williams addressed the synod on Wednesday morning, the day after the ruling body had rejected legislation that would have paved the way for women bishops within two years. He said: \"The temptation to run around saying, 'What do we do? Who do we blame?' today is going to be strong. I hope that we will try and hold back from simple recrimination in all this. \"The work to do internally is considerable - but, it's tempting to say, that is as nothing compared with the work we have to do externally. We have, to put it very bluntly, a lot of explaining to do.\" He went on: \"Whatever the motivations for voting yesterday, whatever the theological principle on which people acted and spoke, the fact remains that a great deal of this discussion is not intelligible to our wider society - worse than that, it seems that we are wilfully blind to some of the trends and priorities in that wider society.\" A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister thought there should be women bishops and was disappointed at the result of the vote, but that it was \"a matter for the Church to decide\". Unity The key concerns of opponents within the Church are over provisions for traditionalist parishes opposed to women bishops to request supervision by a stand-in male bishop. Critics of the legislation said it did not provide enough safeguards for the objectors. Lay member Alison Ruoff said she had voted against the ordination of women bishops in order to keep the Church together. \"There are hundreds of churches in the Church of England which are standing with us and we were doing what was right for them - it's not just me,\" she said. \"This is to make sure that we can walk together as one Church of England - a broad Church, yes, but we want to be there without splits, without divisions.\" The Rev Prebendary Rod Thomas, chairman of the conservative evangelical grouping Reform, said: \"We have avoided what could have been a disastrous mistake for our unity and witness.\" But the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, insisted: \"There will be women bishops in my lifetime. \"The principle has already been accepted by the general synod. It has already been accepted by all the dioceses,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday. \"So what we need to do is find the legislation - 99.9% of the legislation is there - it's this little business of provision for those who are opposed.\" Church rules state that the measure cannot be brought back before the synod \"in the same form\" during the current term, ending in 2015. But Dr Sentamu said he hoped the Church's \"Group of Six\" senior officials - the two archbishops and senior clergy and lay representatives - would meet and find a way to revisit the issue before then. \"I believe what was rejected yesterday were not women bishops; what was rejected was the legislation - some people felt it was not good enough,\" he added. The proposed legislation paving the way for women bishops needed to gain two-thirds majority support in each of the synod's three houses - bishops, clergy and laity - but fell short by six votes in the House of Laity. The result was greeted with emotion, with some supporters of women bishops in tears. The Bishop of Durham, Justin Welby, who is the next Archbishop of Canterbury and a supporter of women bishops, tweeted overnight: \"Very grim day, most of all for women priests and supporters, need to surround all with prayer & love and co-operate with our healing God.\" 'Betrayed' The House of Bishops is meeting on Wednesday morning to \"consider the consequences of the vote\", the Church's media office said. The Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, said those Church members who were in favour of women bishops, but who had voted against the move because of concerns over the provisions for traditionalist parishes, were central to finding a solution. \"There's a very big challenge, I think, to those who voted against but actually pledged themselves to see in what way they could move forward so that women can be bishops in the Church of England,\" he said. The House of Laity is the largest element of the general synod and is made up of lay members of the Church elected by its 44 dioceses. The votes were 44 for and three against with two abstentions in the House of Bishops, 148 for and 45 against in the House of Clergy, and 132 for and 74 against in the House of Laity. Christina Rees, a synod member who has spent 20 years campaigning for women bishops, said: \"It feels as if the House of Laity betrayed the entire Church of England last night. \"The people, the sort of extremes in our Church - the very conservative evangelicals and very traditionalist Anglo-Catholics - have no idea how this will be read by most people.\" She said she thought that, to most people, \"this just looks like blatant discrimination\".

It outperforms its counterparts on a whole host of measures from patient satisfaction to waiting times. But in early December it missed the four-hour A&E waiting time target - dipping below the 95% standard by the narrowest of margins. Since then weekly performance has got even worse. This is not a quirk. It's been dragged down along with the rest of the hospital sector. Once you strip out the small units and walk-in centres, where the pressure is less intense, nearly all England's major units are now missing the target. This is why the NHS in England has just posted it worst performance in a decade. Performance levels in Wales and Northern Ireland are even lower (Scotland seems to be performing at a similar level to England, although as the data there lags behind the other parts of the UK, it is hard to say for sure). This is despite ministers in all four corners of the UK handing the health service extra money to deal with winter pressures. So why are things deteriorating? The quick answer - and the one that was pointed out repeatedly in the past few weeks - is that attendances are going up across the UK. As England has the best and most up-to-date figures, let's have a look at these. During the first week of December there were just over 436,000 visits - up by nearly 30,000. Get involved on: But what is interesting as you delve down into the data is that it's not just A&E units that are finding it difficult - there are pressure points across the whole system. Nearly a fifth of patients who go to A&E need to be admitted into the hospital for more complex care than can be given in an emergency department. Sometimes they face long waits (classed as over four hours) before a bed can be found for them. These are known as \"trolley waits\". The current levels being seen are the worst since records began in 2010. But hospitals are also finding it difficult to discharge patients. The figures for October and November, the last full month for which they are available, were at their highest since that data set began in 2010. A significant factor in this is the squeeze on councils' social care budgets. Many of the patients who end up in hospital are frail and elderly, and when they are ready to be released need support in the community to get back on their feet. If it's not there, they have to stay in hospital, which occupies a bed often needed for other patients. Another pressure point is at the other end of the system - before the visit to hospital is made. Both the Royal College of GPs and British Medical Association have been vocal about the workload their members are facing. A recent BMA survey found three quarters of doctors said their caseload was \"unsustainable\" - and that seems to have started impacting on patients, as latest data from the official NHS England patient survey shows they are finding it more difficult to get an appointment. If GPs are unable to keep pace with demand, the obvious place patients turn to is A&E. To be fair to ministers across the UK, they have recognised this. Wales, Scotland and England have all published plans in the last 18 months to relieve the pressure on the urgent and emergency care systems. But these are all long-term solutions. In the short-term, all eyes are on what happens this winter. So what next? \"Predictions are very hard to make,\" says Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals. \"What we don't know is what will happen with Norovirus or flu. Services are so stretched at the moment, that all it will take is a spike in those to make it very difficult for us.\" It seems to be the case that despite all the planning, all the money, and all the hard work of NHS staff, this winter will hinge on factors outside everyone's control.", "output": "You need look no further than Salford Royal Hospital to realise the point the NHS has got to.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The singer has boosted her wealth by around \u00a315 million in the last year, according to Heat magazine.

The differences found in the research, published in journal Brain, show more work is needed to understand how autism affects girls, the scientists say. Experts said girls with the condition could be more stigmatised than boys - and it could be harder for them to be diagnosed at all. Autism affects 1% of the population and is more prevalent in boys, so most research has focused on them. In this study, scientists from the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine how autism affects the brain of males and females. Male and female brains differ anyway - tissue volume is greater in males. 'Look-alikes' The study looked at the difference between the brains of typical males and those with autism - and then females with and without autism. They found the brains of females with autism \"look\" more like - but still not the same as - typical male brains, when compared with the brains of females without autism. But the same kind of difference was not seen in males with autism - so their brains did not show \"extreme\" male characteristics. Dr Meng-Chuan Lai, who worked on the study said: \"What we have known about autism to date is mainly male-biased. \"This research shows that it is possible that the effect of autism manifests differently according to one's gender. \"Therefore we should not blindly assume that everything found for males or from male-predominant mixed samples will apply to females.\" He said future research may need to look at males and females equally to discover both similarities and differences. Dr Lai added: \"Lastly, there really needs to be more research and clinical attention toward females 'on the spectrum'.\" 'Masking' Carol Povey, Director of The National Autistic Society's Centre for Autism, said: \"Historically, research on autism has been largely informed by the experiences of men and boys with the condition. \"This important study will therefore help our understanding of how the condition differs between genders.\" She added: \"Girls can be more adaptive than boys and can develop strategies that often mask what we traditionally think of as the signs of autism. \"This \"masking\" can lead to a great deal of stress, and many girls go on to develop secondary problems such as anxiety, eating disorders or depression. \"It's important that we build on this study and more research is conducted into the way autism manifests in girls and women, so that we can ensure that gender does not remain a barrier to diagnosis and getting the right support.\"", "output": "Autism affects male and female brains differently, a study has suggested.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Wellesbourne police station on Kineton Road has been axed as part of Warwickshire Police's attempts to save more than \u00a320m.

Time zones are irregular and affected by political, geographical and social changes. BBC News website readers have been sharing their experiences of time and how it affects them when they interact and work with people across different time zones. Libby and Edward Fisher, UK and Australia: Keep in touch with family Libby Fisher, in the UK, regularly contacts her brother in Australia: Having seen my brother only twice in the last three years, I've become adept at keeping in touch across two different time zones. Currently, he is in Australia where the 11 hour time difference means it can be difficult to chat as he is winding down at the end of the day and I am just about ready to get the day started. Weekends are generally perfect though, particularly if it is Sunday morning in the UK and Sunday evening in Australia as it gives enough time for a good catch-up. By comparison, keeping in contact with my brother when he was in China was slightly easier with an eight hour time difference. During the week, it is more difficult to keep in touch with someone in either Australia or China, as one person is trying to get out to work and the other is coming in from a long day, so keeping in touch via Facebook, email and text is much more convenient, although a bit impersonal. The best way to keep in touch is to visit. I went to visit my brother in China and have a trip planned to Australia in the summer. Visiting friends and family across the world is really the best way to keep in touch. Edward Fisher speaks to his family in the UK from Australia: Living in Australia but having family back in the UK is quite strange, because yes we are separated but at the same time we still maintain close links. It became obvious early on that I was going to have limited contact with my family because of the different times zones. My family and I solved this by emailing, and generally allowing a few days to respond. If it's more urgent, or just wanting to catch up, we do call each other, but either we call first thing in the morning or last thing at night. We also try to pre-arrange our phone calls by email and plan a conversation schedule. It's no surprise that whoever is calling in the morning generally wants to spend the whole day talking, while the other frequently yawns on the other side! If things are more urgent or if we just want to say a quick hi, then we send text messages. Because of today's technology and good internet access being in a different time zone doesn't mean that my family are far away. John Perry, Saudi Arabia: Keeps in touch with work I am currently working in Riyadh where the working week is Saturday through Wednesday, with Thursday and Friday as the weekend. I have been travelling to this area for thirty years and have never got used to the first day of the week being Saturday. It sounds very wrong to say \"see you on Thursday\", meaning \"see you at the weekend.\" Trying to communicate with someone back home can be a little difficult as there are only three working days that we have in common with the UK - Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Coupled with this is the fact that we are currently +3 hours ahead of GMT. So 0900 on a Monday morning in the UK is midday Monday here. The only times when we can communicate effectively are 0900 to 1300 Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, in other words, 12 hours per week. This caused considerable problems for me recently when I needed access to legal advice. I was asked a question by my solicitors on Wednesday. I didn't see this email until Saturday when I replied directly. My solicitor didn't see my reply until midday my time Monday morning - thus an urgent matter was delayed by four days. Transferring money via international banks can also have the same delay, meaning money can disappear for four days while it navigates two sets of weekends. As we are working in a \"global\" market - people need to understand that we work in different time zones and have different working weeks. Of course, when working for an American based company, things get far worse - I have been told to attend video conferences at 0300. It is one thing for a manager to expect their staff to be at work when they are, but when one's manager is in the US and you are in Saudi Arabia, things are a little different! Tim Roach, Ontario, Canada: One place many times When I worked in the High Arctic in the 1970s we were located geographically in the Mountain Time Zone but all of our communications were with Resolute Bay and Winnipeg so officially we were using Central Time. However, our meteorological observations and twice daily balloon releases were co-ordinated on a world wide basis and set to Greenwich Mean Time. In order to match mealtimes to the periods between balloon flights we set our living schedule to Atlantic Time. All of this was only possible because we had 24 hours of daylight in summer. Megan, UK: Playing online games across time zones Role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons have entertained hordes of folks for years. We play in groups and create an alternate reality devising and playing characters in a fantasy world. We describe what characters are doing and saying by rolling a strange-shaped dice. We gather in each others homes and meet up at conventions to play, but with the growth of the internet other options have opened up. Many games are now played by e-mail or in forums on discussion boards, but whilst these can be fun, nothing quite beats actually talking and interacting with other players in real-time which we can now do via the internet. I'm currently running a game for two lovely people in America who are prepared to get up early in the morning so that we can play together.

Gradual recovery Ms Forbes wants to be frank with people that there are difficult times ahead, saying that \"things are going to be really difficult\". She said: \"Business owners are facing acute hardship right now, we know the unemployment rate is likely to increase - we'll do everything we can to support business but it is going to be enormously challenging.\" And she said that even as the immediate crisis waned, \"things are not going to get much better\". She said: \"I think even with additional certainty for certain sectors being able to open, we're also starting to see more redundancies and more major businesses having to let people go. \"I think the impact is going to be with us for quite a long time. it's not just about getting through this acute few months, but actually figuring out how we support the economy for a much longer period of time. \"People talk about graphs, they talk about a V-shaped graph which means economic output plummeted during the crisis but will bounce back as we come out and get businesses trading again. \"But there's evidence now that it will be a more gradual recovery, which means economic output might not recover to the pre-crisis level until the start of 2023.\" Restoring confidence The Scottish government is moving out of lockdown \"carefully and cautiously\". But has the \"stay at home\" message been so effective that people will be wary about returning to workplaces and businesses? Ms Forbes said the economy has to be restarted \"at a pace the country is comfortable with\" with the best scientific evidence in mind. She said that while tourism businesses in rural areas will be keen to reopen, local residents may still be \"nervous about an influx of visitors\". She said: \"How do we give people confidence and hope that's based on truth, and honesty and evidence? \"There's no value in me glibly saying 'lets get the economy back up and running, firing on all cylinders as quickly as possible' if we don't take people with us. \"Because the customers won't go back to those shops, the markets wont return, people will not feel comfortable going back to work if that confidence is not based on fact.\" 'Disproportionate' impact There are concerns that the longer Scotland remains in lockdown, the worse the financial impact will be. As the easing of measures accelerates south of the border, is there a danger of Scotland being left behind? Asked if the fiscal impact could be more marked in Scotland, Ms Forbes said: \"It certainly could be worse for slightly longer than in England because you're right in saying that shops just now are able to reopen, the housing market is slightly ahead and some construction in England continued during the pandemic. \"So yes, there is a risk of the economic impact being very disproportionate. The risk with that, for me, in balancing a budget is that it's not just about the money in people's pockets as employees - it's great that the furlough scheme has been extended to cover the different reopening dates, but it will also have a profound impact on our budget as well. \"I think a lot of the impact will be a lot more easily quantified at the end, because equally you could argue that if customers in England are not confident that things reopened at the right time they haven't actually returned. \"So we know that some industries are already trading [in England] that aren't in Scotland, but ultimately if there is a more significant return of customers or of the market in Scotland, and businesses get back up and trading quicker when they're allowed to do so, actually it might even itself out.\" Social distancing People have become used to keeping apart - something Ms Forbes says will not be changing any time soon. \"Ultimately, until we have a vaccine the only way we have to deal with coronavirus is social distancing,\" she said. \"We're all going to have to adapt in the way we work, the way we spend time with one another, and the way we have fun - we're going to have to do that through social distancing.\" A key piece of this strategy is the distance itself - the 2m (6ft) rule. There have been calls from businesses and some politicians to relax this rule, with the World Health Organisation suggesting a 1m (3ft) distance which is currently in use in countries such as France. Ms Forbes said that while the matter remains under review, \"at the moment the evidence we are basing our decisions on is that 2m is significantly preferable to 1m\". She added: \"We need to make sure we are following the best evidence in order to save lives and reduce transmission, and that is what will give customers the confidence to return to the shops and the pubs.\" The role of government The response to the pandemic has seen unprecedented levels of state involvement in the lives of people in the UK, with the government now paying the wages of a quarter of the workforce. Ms Forbes said the response to the crisis had probably changed how she sees the role of government. She said: \"My view going forward is that there has to be some sort of national endeavour. Businesses and government should be working together far more closely than we have. \"There's been a bit of a culture where it's government does things to business and business grumbles and gets on with it - that has to change. \"There is no public sector without a thriving private sector. That private sector though has to look after its employees, and make sure they're not on fragile contracts. \"My thinking going forward is that I don't think we should be increasing the tax burden at a time like this at all, but I do think some of the expectations that government has of business need to be clearer in coming out of this pandemic. \"I keep hearing this point about doing thing differently, about how we want to take advantage of this moment to reposition the economy to make it a fairer society, but actually that's going to require quite significant levels of government intervention and a sense of national endeavour where everyone is playing their part.\" Radical changes Ms Forbes has only been finance secretary for a short time, but taking the reins at a pivotal moment means she can envisage radical changes to the economy in the coming years. She said: \"I hope in 10 years time there's people in my role just now discussing that the reason why Scotland is such a prosperous, thriving growing economy is because of decisions that were taken in the aftermath of a pandemic in 2020 to reposition our economy and to support the industries that will really grow and take us into the future.\" In particular, Ms Forbes wants to see a digital revolution making the most of new technology and artificial intelligence that could help solve the way \"economic output is unfairly distributed across Scotland\". She said: \"We are not making the most of how we use technology. We are a small country of 5 million people with a global market out there that means you can access that from the smallest island in Scotland in the same way as you can in the middle of London. I think we need to do far more on that.\" How do we get there? The finance secretary highlighted three key ways the government wants to help move to this radical future. The most \"obvious\" is investment, giving financial support to businesses to invest in new equipment. The second is education, with universities and colleges under \"extreme pressure\" and facing \"significant\" changes to their student base. Ms Forbes said: \"If we're going to be investing in universities to replace their lost grant funding we have choices about what we prioritise, and we're going to have to produce the skills and talent that can work in these businesses and support these industries.\" The third element of the finance secretary's plan is to help industries \"refocus\". \"The oil and gas industry is a pretty good example where we know we need to change, we need to transition,\" she said. \"If we're going to be significantly investing in those industries then we need to be clear about what the output is that we want, and it can't just be business as normal.\" Listen to more from Kate Forbes on the BBC's Podlitical podcast", "output": "With the coronavirus infection rate falling and lockdown measures starting to ease, attention is turning to the economic impact of the pandemic and the threat to jobs and businesses.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "At best we need to more than double the amount of trees we plant to achieve our carbon reduction targets, experts have said. Here are some of the things our readers wanted to know about tree planting. Can I plant trees anywhere? Stuart James, 27, from Bath, said he wanted to be \"a part of the change we all need to make\". \"I haven't got a lot of land but can you just plant trees wherever you like?\" he asked. You can plant trees in your own garden as long as roots and branches would not damage nearby properties, according to the Woodland Trust. In England, you would not need planning permission to plant less than two hectares (20,000 sq metres) in a low risk area, it said. Otherwise you would need an Environmental Impact Assessment from the Forestry Commission. Trees can only be planted around your local area with the landowners' permission, The Tree Council warned. You should not plant trees on archaeological sites, places with rare or protected species, grassland that has never been ploughed, wetlands and heathland, the Woodland Trust said. Which are the best trees to plant? Trevor Ley, 43, from Woolwich in south east London, asked: \"What small tree or plant could households grow in their gardens to best absorb carbon? \"I feel it is very important to support tree planting as, living in London, you see many green spaces disappear to become high-rise developments,\" he said. Mr Ley said his children Alexander, six, and Isaac, three, enjoyed putting the gardening tips they learned at school into practice at home. Long-living native species such as oak and maple are effective at storing carbon dioxide, according to the Woodland Trust. But these could grow to be very large so trees such as Hazel, Blackthorn, Crab Apple and Goat Willow were suitable for smaller spaces, the trust said. Medium-sized tree options include Elder, Field Maple, Hawthorn, Holly and Yew. The Tree Council suggested people \"copy nature by planting trees already successful on or near the site\". What can I do locally? Dana Druka, 24, from Scotland, now lives in Birmingham. She said she found it difficult to find a local tree planting scheme flexible enough to fit around university and work. \"I think planting trees can offer huge benefits,\" she said. \"From improving personal fitness and mental health, creating wonderful shared spaces for communities and ultimately being proactive in fighting climate change.\" Joshua Watkins, 18, from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, said news articles and charities told people about the problems but not the solutions. \"If everyone did at least a little something then surely that's better than one organisation trying to do something big on their own?\" he said. The Tree Council has a national network of local tree volunteers and local councils should be able to point anyone in the right direction. Many forests have schemes allowing people to dedicate a tree to a loved one. Should developers plant one tree per new house? Natalie Parker, 27, from Banbury in Oxfordshire, said: \"I live on a established estate and have lots of trees to look at from my garden and love listening to the birds they attract. \"I think the government should introduce a rule that all new-build properties should plant a tree in the garden. \"Trees will attract wildlife to these new estates and also offer shade and privacy to residents.\" Hazel Sniadowski got in touch to tell us that when she moved to Milton Keynes in 1984 she received a \u00a310 tree voucher. \"If this scheme was rolled out it would help towards the carbon neutral aim,\" she said. Even if every household with a garden in the UK planted two trees they would amount to 45 million. This would still only be about 3% of the total number of trees the Woodland Trust has estimated the UK needs to plant by 2050 in order to reach net zero emissions - 1.5 billion. Where can I go for more information? Chris Johns, 65, from Hurst Green in Surrey, asked which organisations offered advice about planting trees. \"Apart from the CO2 benefits of woodlands they are so pleasant on the eye and on the soul - having more woodlands must be win-win,\" he said.

It was just amazing to think that this other world existed, this past - who were these people and what kind of language did they speak?\" In time Danielle became a professional archaeologist and an expert on Channel 4's Time Team. Later, the same thing happened in Macclesfield, 30 miles to the south, when Rebecca Holt walked into the city's West Park Museum and saw the mummy case of a 15-year-old temple girl. \"I was probably about five and remember seeing the mummy case for the first time and it was just sheer fascination. 'Mum, what's this, what's this?' And my fascination never went away,\" she says. She kept going back and at 14 was a museum volunteer, spending hours there after school. A mentor, honorary curator Alan Hayward, taught her how to read hieroglyphs and handle objects. Now 24, she's just finished a master's degree in archaeology at Oxford University. The passions awakened by the mummies in these two young women are inherited in a very direct way from two women who lived in their localities a century earlier, and whose collections the museums were built to house - Annie Barlow in Bolton and Marianne Brocklehurst in Macclesfield. In fact, there is an even stronger link than this between Danielle Wootton and Annie Barlow. Barlow was the daughter of a wealthy mill-owner, and Danielle's own grandmother and aunt worked in the Barlow and Jones family mills. It was the money earned from the mill - which spun Egyptian cotton into Lancashire cloth - that enabled Barlow to go and explore Egyptian tombs. Marianne Brocklehurst, meanwhile, came from a silk manufacturer's family. As well as funding her own travels she paid out of her own pocket for the construction of the West Park Museum, where Rebecca found her inspiration. Her legacy includes not just the objects she brought back from Egypt but her detailed diaries and sketches of her trips down the Nile, which are some of the only records of tomb sites before they were disturbed. But there is a third northern mill heiress who made a major contribution to the UK's mummy mania - Amelia Oldroyd, whose finds are catalogued in leather-bound record books in the archive of the Bagshaw Museum in Batley. She was one of the first to explore a burial chamber at Abydos - now recreated in the museum - after it was opened in 1900 for the first time in 4,000 years. At a time when male collectors were throwing textiles aside in their hunt for large mummy cases and gold objects, Amelia brought back a rare intact cartonnage - a mummy wrapping made of papyrus with a painted representation of the dead person's face. Find out more Listen to Samira Ahmed's documentary, The Victorian Queens of Ancient Egypt, on Radio 3, on Sunday 3 February at 18:45 Or catch up afterwards online According to a third young female archaeologist, Cairo-born Heba Abd El Gawad, the female explorers had a distinctive approach, focusing not just on the grand tombs but on the intimate small portable objects. (One reason, possibly, why they tended to be dismissed as amateurs by contemporary male archaeologists.) \"Unlike displays that we see today, where there is so much focus on gold, royal figurines, everything that is very glittery, I think you can tell from their collecting patterns that they were also interested in the daily life of ordinary people,\" Heba says. She points also to their collections of cartonnage face wrappings. \"There is this intimacy in the mummy face. You can see the eyes, it's looking back at you. You can see the human being in there.\" In the present day, Danielle and Rebecca also focus on small portable antiquities and what they reveal about lived life - the make-up containers, the jewellery, the small statues. Rebecca's favourite object in the display in Macclesfield is a six-inch statuette of a queen, Queen Ti, who is wearing large ornate wig and carrying a lotus flail. \"It's one of the first artefacts whose hieroglyphs I tried to translate, so that's quite special to me,\" she says. \"The carving itself is really magnificent. I love Queen Ti - how powerful she was and how much influence she had.\" For Heba, 26, who grew up looking at the pyramids and thinking about the human labour forced to create them, while reading books on the ancient Egyptian world bought for her by her father the Victorian women themselves hold a complex fascination. They were Egyptology pioneers, who used public subscription to fundraise to bring cultural enrichment back to ordinary people. But they were also colonial looters. The diaries and lectures of these Victorian women capture the adrenalin rush of discovery. Amelia Edwards, another Victorian pioneer, founded the Egypt Exploration Fund which made possible the excavations of the famous male Egyptologist, Flinders Petrie. On one occasion she wrote about receiving a note at their camp from an artist travelling with them: \"Please come immediately - I have found the entrance to a tomb. Please bring some sandwiches.\" On rushing to join him Amelia wrote: \"All that Sunday afternoon we toiled upon our hands and knees as if for bare life, under the burning sun. More than once, when we paused for a moment's breathing space, we said to each other: 'If those at home could see us, what would they say!'\" But the Victorian women were enthusiastic participants in a kind of Wild West of collecting in the Nile valley, battling against the deeper pockets of the British Museum, the Louvre and the Penn Museum of Philadelphia, bargaining with local dealers and officials. Bribery and theft were routine. Marianne Brocklehurst's diary jokes about smuggling antiquities out. The reason that mummy case in Macclesfield is empty is because she discarded the body, possibly overboard from her boat, into the Nile, worried the smell might give away her theft. Heba says, \"Maybe for me it can be doubly sensitive being Egyptian and how we perceive the body today. Even during Pharaonic time there were texts that totally condemned tomb robbers and anyone who fiddles with mummies or does unwrapping just to take the jewellery and amulets. That was a huge offence in ancient Egypt.\" Heba believes Egyptology museums should be honest about the provenance of their collections. The new display for Brocklehurst's mummy case in Macclesfield's Silk Museum - where it has been moved from the West Park museum - makes no mention of the discarding of the body, or the fact that it was smuggled out. Mummified hands sit in a glass case with no labelling. 'I don't want to make it sound like I'm pro-returning everything. That's not what I'm after,\" says Heba. \"But what I'm after is trying to [make people think] what makes it acceptable?\" It would never have been acceptable, she points out, to exhibit British human remains this way. Rebecca feels she can still see Marianne Brocklehurst as a heroine, while acknowledging that her diary shows the unpleasant, even racist colonial attitudes of the time. Her favourite passages recount how Brocklehurst sacked the Egyptian chef on her Nile houseboat who was beating the kitchen maid, then promoted the maid to his job. \"Her priority is to protect this woman. And it's just, 'You know, we don't need this man. She [the maid] can do great.' She was just fiercely protective of the women in her life.\" The dilemma now is whether local councils hit by years of central government funding cuts, can see a value in investing in updated displays and expertise for these Egyptology collections. In a growing number of the 150 museums across the country which hold such collections there is a battle to even keep them on display. Northampton Council's controversial sale in 2014 of the ancient Egyptian Sekhemka statue (gifted to them in 1870) to raise funds, caused international outrage in the museum world, especially in Egypt. Arts Council England withdrew the city museum's accreditation. \"I guess I'm just really, really thankful that West Park Museum was here,\" says Rebecca Holt. The museum is currently rarely open. Budget cuts have hit Dewsbury museum where Amelia Oldroyd's collection was held for many years. It closed in 2016 and Bagshaw Museum in Batley, where the artefacts now are has no specialist curator and operates restricted opening hours. Bolton Museum shows what can be done with vision and money. Its sensitively refurbished Egypt Gallery tells the story of Annie Barlow. Signage in the beautifully reconstructed tomb of Thutmose III, where the unidentified male mummy is now on display, makes clear that keeping human remains is a dilemma. There is equal focus on the life of ancient Egyptians, not just their death. Danielle Wootton looks at the crowds of children and families packing \"Bolton's Egypt\" gallery in Bolton Museum. \"I'm really, really happy to see it because that's how I felt years ago.

This has contributed to an atmosphere of uncertainty. South Korean authorities have issued guidelines, advising people to \"avoid visiting crowded places as much as possible\" and to wear face masks in public. It has also advised against \"close contact with people who have fever and heavy breathing\". Some buildings have set up temperature screening booths at their receptions. It appears that to some extent, South Koreans have been heeding the advice. People wearing masks on the streets of South Korea's cities have become a common sight. Baseball games, cinemas, churches, shopping malls and theme parks have reported lower visitor volumes, according to news agencies. Some South Koreans are choosing to get groceries delivered to them at home instead of venturing out. E-Mart and Lotte Mart, two of the country's biggest supermarket chains, saw weekly sales in store drop by 12% while online sales went up by 50%, reported AFP news agency. Supermarket staff have also been wiping down supermarket trolley handles before and after use. Nearly 2,500 schools have been temporarily shut, while health workers have been spraying down subway stations and the insides of train carriages. After facing intense criticism that it was not doing enough, the government has stepped up efforts to put out more timely information and allay public panic. It has launched a website dedicated to Mers updates, Acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan was photographed shaking hands with shop owners, and President Park Geun-hye postponed a trip to the US vowing to put a \"quick end\" to the outbreak. Police have charged eight people for allegedly spreading rumours falsely naming hospitals treating Mers patients and disclosing patient information without consent, reported Yonhap news agency. Village lockdown More than 3,800 people remain under quarantine - either monitored in hospitals or at home. Those at home are being tracked by their mobile phones. But one entire village has been put on lockdown. More than 100 residents of Jangduk in North Jeolla province have been barred from leaving and from receiving visitors since last Friday, when one case of Mers was confirmed. The elderly woman had earlier sought treatment at a hospital where Mers patients were being treated. While she is now in another nearby hospital, the whole village has been isolated, with all entry roads guarded by sentries. Health workers have been taking residents' temperatures twice a day, and the government and other villages have been providing food and supplies. \"We are not in the middle of war, and didn't get any advance notice,\" a resident told Reuters news agency over the phone. Mask fun Amid the public unease, some South Koreans have tried to make light of the situation - including this Seoul wedding party whose picture has gone viral online. Wedding organiser Sewing for The Soil told the BBC's Kevin Kim in Seoul that they provided masks at the ceremony last Saturday in case guests needed them. \"After taking the main wedding photos, we thought it would be fun if we took a group photo with everybody with the masks on, and the bride and groom agreed... it was all fun and light-hearted,\" said a spokesman. Actors and singers have also started posting pictures of themselves wearing masks on their social media accounts, prompting a wave of \"mask selfies\", reported The Korea Herald. Some have used it as an opportunity to encourage better health practices. \"Wash your hands, wear a mask (to) avoid Mers,\" wrote pop singer Zico. Culture curtailment But Korean pop music or K-Pop, one of South Korea's most famous cultural exports, has itself not been immune to the slowdown, with several singers postponing their national tours. A rap music festival which was due to be held in Seoul last weekend has also been cancelled. Arts and cultural centres in the cities of Busan, Jeju and Yongin have cancelled performances, reported The Korea Herald, and film distributors have postponed releases as cinema ticket sales have plummeted by 25%. An international book fair due to open next week has also been put back to mid-October, while agricultural events, such as the Mountain Berry and Watermelon Festival in Gochang county, have been cancelled. Tourism drop-off Known for its shopping and beautiful landscapes, South Korea is a magnet for visitors in the region. But since the outbreak began more than 54,000 tourists have cancelled their bookings, according to tourism authorities. Many of those cancelling flights are from Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan and Singapore, according to travel analysis firm ForwardKeys. Hong Kong issued a travel alert earlier this week advising against non-essential travel to South Korea, while other governments such as Taiwan have called on travellers to take precautions. The trend has had an industry-wide effect with hotels, travel agencies and duty free retailers reporting lower sales figures.

Some Conservative MPs have also questioned the decision to charge Ribble Valley MP Nigel Evans. Mr Evans was acquitted - but the DPP has defended the decision to prosecute. The former Conservative deputy speaker of the House of Commons, was acquitted of nine sex abuse charges, including rape, at Preston Crown Court on Thursday. The attorney general's office stressed Mr Grieve and the (DPP) hold meetings roughly every fortnight, and typically discuss major cases after the verdicts. 'Negative message' A spokesman for the attorney general's office said: \"The running of individual cases is a matter for the independent CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and the DPP. \"However, as part of his role superintending the CPS, and as would be normal in high-profile cases such as these, the attorney general will discuss these cases with the DPP at their next regular meeting.\" They are expected to meet after Easter. BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said long standing protocol meant the attorney general did not talk to the DPP about cases once charges involving politicians have been brought until their conclusion. Mr Roache was cleared of rape and indecent assault in February and Mr Le Vell was acquitted of a number of child sex abuse charges in September last year. Prof Liz Kelly, director of the child and woman abuse studies unit in London, told the Guardian she feared the debate around Mr Evans's trial was sending an \"extremely negative message to survivors of sexual violence\". \"At this time of ongoing high-profile trials, political interference undermining work to improve prosecutions of sexual offences should desist,\" she said. Critics of the CPS, including some Tory MPs, have said it must avoid bringing together a series of weak cases in an attempt to form a strong one. Ms Saunders defended the decision to take the case against Nigel Evans to court. She said the CPS was not on a mission to pursue famous people, but prosecuted every case in the same way. She said she would look at the case to see if lessons could be learned - as was normal with all acquittals - but she rejected any widespread change to CPS procedures in such cases. \"I think we made the right decision in taking it before the court,\" Ms Saunders said. \"We looked at all the evidence and decided there was a realistic prospect of conviction.

Among the changes will be the development of cardiology services in Glangwili Hospital, and a paediatric high dependency unit will provide a \"comprehensive higher level sick children's service\". The board covers Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, and an orthopaedic \"centre of excellence\" is planned in the south of the area. \"Our vision is quite simple - to provide integrated health care with 80% of NHS services provided locally, through primary, community and social care teams working together,\" said a spokesperson. \"This will mean access to diagnostic tests, such as X-rays, blood tests and scans, and also a range of outpatient and specialist services that were previously only available in hospital.\" There are also proposals for new centres in Aberaeron, Carmarthen, Cross Hands, Crymych and Whitland. The board says mental health services will also be extended and expanded with a psychiatric initial assessment and intensive care unit in Carmarthen. It defended its plans to change the way the emergency department is run at Prince Philip hospital as it said that about 80% of attendances were categorised as minor injuries. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Conservatives in the Welsh assembly, said the changes would \"sadly see a 20% reduction in beds, the A&E unit closing at Prince Philip and three hospitals closing\". He blamed the changes on the Welsh government for a \"\u00a3534m cut in funding\" to the NHS. \"They have also failed to attract key medical staff. Both these situations can be reversed, but the Welsh government is not willing to do that.\" 'Long overdue' William Roberts, of the aBer action group, set up in response to Hywel Dda Health Board's plans for Aberystwyth's Bronglais Hospital, said services previously under threat would now remain at the hospital. \"We are pleased that services at Bronglais Hospital which were under threat some months ago, now appear to be secure, thanks to the people of mid Wales who went to Cardiff to protest - over 850 of them - and the hospital consultants who were prepared to write to the minister,\" said Mr Roberts. \"We are, however, sorry that this would appear to be at the cost of services at Llanelli.

Above, the bright blue sky is devoid of the aeroplanes ordinarily flitting back and forth with such regularity they are used to tell the time. The absence of holidaymakers due to the Covid-19 pandemic is keenly felt on this Caribbean island for which, like many of its counterparts, tourism has long been its breadbasket. Often dubbed the \"most tourism-dependent region in the world\", the Caribbean attracted more than 31 million visitors last year. For some islands, the sector accounts to a colossal two-thirds of gross domestic product. 'Zero tourists, zero income' Antigua closed its borders to commercial flights in late March in an effort to contain the coronavirus. \"Zero tourists means zero income,\" local excursion operator Glen Hector tells the BBC. It is especially galling after ploughing his life savings into a new boat for his Creole Antigua Tours company in October. \"My business is 100% dependent on tourists. We're staying positive that things will pick up but I'm not seeing that happening until at least the end of the year,\" he explains. \"If things don't get better I'm really expecting to pack up. I know other small companies who feel the same.\" On 4 June the first commercial flight in 10 weeks will land in Antigua when American Airlines touches down from Miami. British Airways is set to follow suit in July. Tourism bosses hope the island's oft-touted \"365 beaches\" will help facilitate social distancing and woo cautious holidaymakers back. Still, Aidan McCauley, owner of the Sugar Ridge resort, is expecting a \"very soft season\". He hopes to reopen by November. \"We get 50% of our guests from the US and we believe that market will recover quicker, assuming Covid is contained. But is that likely? A second wave in the autumn would mean nobody will be able to come at all,\" he says. His plans include converting some of the hotel's 60 suites to self-catering to alleviate travellers' fears of virus transmission. In St Lucia, the Anse Chastanet resort's 540-strong workforce is down to just 35. The last guest left on 24 March. \"It's completely and utterly depressing to be here,\" says financial controller Stuart McKee. With tourism the country's main source of both jobs and income, the drop-off is \"scary stuff\". Furloughed staff are receiving income support through the country's national insurance scheme but residents are acutely aware that the impact on government finances will be long-lasting. \"The government is being hammered because no-one has paid any taxes for the last couple of months. They were expecting a windfall in March from VAT as February is traditionally the strongest month,\" Mr McKee explains. \"St Lucia is too well off for IMF assistance so where the funds will come from I don't know. The virus itself has been pretty well contained but the economic fallout is terrifying,\" he adds. In Dominica, tourism keeps up to 5,000 of the island's 72,000 inhabitants employed, says director of tourism Colin Piper. The sector had already taken a hit from 2017's devastating Hurricane Maria but visitors were fast returning to explore the country's famous hot springs, rainforests and waterfalls. Dominica's healthy agricultural industry means it is less reliant on vacation dollars than many of its neighbours. Nonetheless, tourism contributes up to a third of GDP, Mr Piper says, with officials working hard to ensure the \"sustainability of livelihoods\". Low case numbers Many Caribbean nations are hedging their bets that people who have spent weeks cooped up on lockdowns across the world will be longing for a beach vacation. What the islands have in their favour is relatively low numbers of virus cases. Earlier this month, University of West Indies researchers declared Covid-19 to be contained within the English-speaking Caribbean. Now the region has the delicate balancing act of luring tourists back while ensuring both their safety and that of their citizens in tiny nations with limited health resources. Hospitality-related businesses employ more than 15,000 of Turks and Caicos' 40,000 inhabitants, says Todd Foss, president of the British territory's Hotel and Tourism Association. Bookings from prospective holidaymakers are still being received daily, but lack of confidence in local health facilities is still a deterrent for many, Mr Foss says. \"The key to welcoming the first plane appears to be for the ministry of health to increase the capacity of our hospitals, particularly the intensive care units. Until this occurs, we are unlikely to see any revenues for the industry,\" he adds. In Antigua, the government plans to require all visitors to undergo rapid Covid-19 testing upon entry. They hope provisions such as virus tests for all industry workers and socially distanced resort dining will make people feel comfortable enough to travel. Tourism Minister Charles Fernandez concedes \"things will be slow\" but says there are \"promising signs\" vacationers are keen to return to the Caribbean.

Public toilets were introduced in the second half of the 19th Century but the vast majority were for men only. Historic England said the first ladies loo opened in Oxford Circus in 1884 but women's public toilets were \"relatively uncommon\" until after World War One. Veronica Fiorato from Historic England said: \"Many people often think of listed buildings only as churches, castles and grand stately homes but buildings like toilets are also an important part of our nation's rich history. \"The lavatories in Berwick and Seaburn reflect the emerging changing social status of women at the beginning of the 20th Century. \"The appearance of toilets like these represented the gradual opening up of a world of new leisure and work opportunities previously unavailable to women.\" Historic England said there were various reasons why women were not given public toilets. In the Victorian era ladies were deemed too modest to \"answer the call of nature\" away from home, while another theory suggests it was a \"cynical ploy\" to control women's movements and ambitions becoming known as the \"urinary leash\". On its first day, the Bank Hill toilet attracted 62 customers. It remained as a toilet until the 1950s, after which it was used for council storage and later an ice cream parlour called Loovre. The Seaburn toilets closed in the 1960s but reopened in 2018.

Growing up in the 1980s, every bulletin on the national broadcaster, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, would start with news of the president. \"Mtukufu Rais Daniel arap Moi, leo hii...\" the newsreader said in Swahili, meaning: \"Today, His Excellency the President Daniel arap Moi...\". We would then be told about what the president had been up to. We knew when President Moi went to church. We knew when President Moi went to a goat auction. And we knew when President Moi hired and fired his ministers during roadside rallies, often on the notorious lunchtime bulletin. Free school milk I will remember the former president for nyayo milk. Nyayo, meaning footprint, was his philosophy of peace, love and unity. Many of his projects used the prefix \"nyayo\". Nyayo milk was a feeding programme he initiated for all state-funded primary schools. We used to get milk twice a week; sometimes one packet, sometimes two. We were told this was about the president making sure that hunger did not stop us from going to school. \"The president loves you,\" our teachers would tell us. And I remember teachers using milk as bait to keep us in school all day. On some days the milk vans would arrive by noon, but would not be handed out until evening assembly. We lived for the free milk. Trekking to see the president I will remember how lessons would be interrupted if President Moi came to visit the area. Every school would cancel classes and send students to line up along the highway and sing for the president as he drove by. Kenya's longest-serving president 1924born in farming community 1967becomes vice-president 1978becomes president 1982coup attempt foiled 2002steps down as president 2020dies in Nairobi In 1997, when I was in high school in western Kenya, I remember walking 8km (five miles) to the nearest main road where the president was slated to stop on his way to Migori. The school choir had rehearsed several patriotic songs, and only the most influential and senior students were allowed to sing. Word was that the president, a man famously generous with handouts, always gave money to school choirs that sang for him. Senior students were not going to let Form One and Form Two pupils to enjoy that manna. Mr Moi was slated to pass by our spot at 14:00 and address the people. We were there by noon. However, he did not arrive until nearly 19:00, probably because he made too many stops as he was on the campaign trail. 'We saw him with our own eyes' And because of his tardiness, he did not even stop to address us. The president's convoy slowed down just enough for us to catch a glimpse of him through the sunroof of his vehicle. We did see him smile and wave his famous rungu - the club and symbol of power that he always carried with him. More on the death of Daniel arap Moi: And that was how days of rehearsals, two hours of walking and another five hours of waiting for the president on an empty stomach was rewarded. A 10-second glimpse of the great man. As jaded and upset as we were, many of us felt honoured to have seen the president with our very own eyes. 'He jailed my father' But, perhaps most personally, I will remember how President Moi's regime robbed me of paternal love. My father, Cpl Michael Collins Owino, was in the air force at the time of the aborted coup in 1982, the year I was born. When the army foiled the coup and a crackdown began in the military, my father was among the servicemen arrested. He was tried and handed an 18-year sentence. But in 1988, he was pardoned after six years in prison and that is when I remember seeing my father for the first time. To this day, I do not know whether my father was involved in the attempt to unseat Mr Moi. But the president's crackdown affected both real and imaginary enemies, with lots of collateral damage. My father died in 2001 never having discussed what had happened to him. In his life, he remained very distant, and often hostile. My mum did not speak of it either. After his death, I went digging to try and understand what had happened. The only reference I ever found was in a newspaper article from August 1982, in a series on the courts martial that followed the coup attempt. But all the newspaper had was an image of \"Cpl Michael Collins Owino of the Kenya Airforce\". Under his image, they summarised his defence in four words: \"I was following orders\".

There should be a settlement with dignity for the peace loving people of Sri Lanka and not the facist LTTE. LTTE cannot build north and east because of their autocratic and facist ideology. There should be an economic development based on self reliance and we can follow the Indian and Chinese trading systems.This is the final chance to Sri Lankns to select whether to stand up as a nation and defeat LTTE terrorists.Shanthan Welayuthan, Wembley, United Kingdom Both leaders are curupted and neither of them have clear vision to get the whole nation out of the trouble.both fellows are making their own strategies to be crowned as president.the ethnic issue is a political football for opportunistic politicians.it is very unlikely that either Ranil or Mahinda would address burning problems of the people, rather they would be playing around with peaple's votes near election time and enjoy themself when the elections are faraway.Sugath Senevirathne, Hounslow, UK Right now, only one visionary leader in Sri Lanka is Mr. Prabaharan. Tamils don't want to waste their time, sharing the country and resources with Sinhalese as they [Sinhalese] are only good at destroying the country, not building it. Let Tamils go their own way and Sinhalese fight themselves.Prem Sivasamy, London, UK The economy is in the first place.Rest of the problums will automaticaly go away with the economic growth.Jagath, Colombo, Sri Lanka Will the UNP actually field Ranil for the Presidency against Mahinda? I won't believe this until Nomination Papers are handed over. Ranil has absolutely no chance in a Presidential Race against Mahinda Rajapakse. Mahinda will win by a massive margin.Aruna Wickramatunga, Colombo, Sri Lanka The country needs a strong leader with a vision. SL still got hope we shouldn't give up! (1)Let's hope for a leader who can settle the war. I do not call this an Ethnic problem since we Sri Lanknans be it Tamil, Sinhalese or Muslims lived and will be living cohesively. It just a misunderstanding that has grown. I guess direct talks with parties in concern (may be two leaders) could settle the differences.(both parties will have to forget & forgive and start fresh. After all we are fiting with another set of Srilankans and not bunch of invaders. 2) Let's hope for a Leader who will have a vision to build the economy Both canditates got potential, yet who comes out with clear statements on these two should be given preference.Namal Abhayawickrama, Indonesia I think Hon. Ranil will be more experienced Than Prime Minister Rajapakse. People gave a mandate for Hon. Ranil for five years which was unfairly taken back by the Sandanya Regime. Therefore he deserve and should be given a chance a president. Also the fact that Prime Minister will have a pact with JVP the chances of negotiated settlement with LTTE will become remote.Navrooze Rawoof, Colombo, Sri Lanka Speaking as a Tamil born and bred in the UK, and as a son of a Tamil Doctor forced to move to England due to the transparent preferential treatment of the Sinhalese at the time, I would say that the ethnic struggle has been the biggest cause of contention in SL for the last 50 years. The ethnic struggles that have made the largest progress in recent history have always had the least corrupt, most forthright leaders at their hub, people like Gandhi, JFK and Mandela to name but a few. I'd see Ranil Wickramasinghe as the best of a bad bunch as I feel it is time for a change, the current presidents favourite (Rajapakse) will undoubtedly be as untransparent and single-minded as Chandrika herself and will therefore not present much hope for the future of a country that has such greatness in its potential.Sean Jehan, London, UK If one of them becom the president and the other one stay as PM,would be great. I mean for the future of the country. We need a uncorrupted National government.Rizmy Mueen, Opfikon, Switzerland Ranil's stand on the ethnic issue is crystal clear.His economic reforms are also solid. On the other hand the Prime Minister has been unable to put forward a coherent set of proposals to solve the ethnic problem.He also lacks contemporary economic reforms.Suranjith Fernando, Edinburgh, UK The stand on the ethnic problem, the economy, the law and order situation including violations by party MPs and their children.Dhammika W, Colombo, Sri Lanka Both of them are not strong leaders and they will not resolve countrys ethnic problem. It is impossible to build a strong economy without resolving this issue. It will be like one step forward and two step backward.Shan Mylvagaman, London, UK It is very ridiculous that, there is one main issue to be addressed on this ellection!every thing has became a very major issue in sri lanka now but the biggest issue is , most of us not seen those . every body talking about only the ethnic crisis... which only one of thousands...! the issues are not valid with SL politicians , that will not do what they say....simply say ... sri lanka needs just a leader who can lead us .. and i dont see anyboy in SL now or another 20 years time .. but till we get \" THE PRINCE OF DIYASEN\" atleast we should have a someboy to keep the mother land unsell... for that definitely RANIL is not the man.Indika Shirantha, Shanghai, China", "output": "The election commissioner is expected to announce the date of this year's presidential elections.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Ever since its first case was confirmed on 30 January, India has taken a number of measures to try and combat the coronavirus. It has eased testing eligibility and invoked a draconian 122-year-old colonial-era epidemic diseases law to restrict public gatherings, among other things. Now it is set to extend a strict three-week lockdown - scheduled to end on 15 April - until the end of the month. More than a billion people continue to stay at home and land, rail and air transport remain suspended. There have been some 180,000 tests for the infection so far. Some 4.3% of the samples have tested positive. The contagion has killed 273 people. It has reportedly spread to nearly half of the country's 700-odd districts. Several hotspots have been identified. Global health experts are keenly looking at how India battles the virus. Its dense population, vast geography and weak public health system can easily overwhelm the best efforts to contain the spread of infection. \"It is something which is worrying a lot of people, \" a leading virologist told me, insisting on anonymity. \"It is early days yet in the trajectory of the virus here. In three to four weeks, the picture will be clearer.\" Economist Shamika Ravi, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who is closely tracking the infection, believes India is not doing badly. She says the number of active cases is doubling every seven days, a slower rate than before. The death rate is still low but rising. \"Our [infection] growth rate is highly contained despite the fact that we are actively chasing the fire,\" she told me. \"Almost all of our testing has been driven by protocol, starting with people with travel history, contact tracing of people in touch with them and so on. The probability of getting more positive cases [from this cohort] would have been much higher.\" Many are also pointing to the lack of reports about any surge in hospital admissions with influenza like illness and Covid-19 patients, which would hint at a rapid community transmission. But this may well be because of lack of information or weak reporting. A private hospital in the central city of Indore, as I reported, is already seeing a surge of cases and treating more than 140 Covid-19 patients, with nearly a third in critical care. At the weekend the hospital was reporting around 40 fresh cases a day. \"We thought the transmission was going down, but our case load went up suddenly over two days,\" Dr Ravi Dosi, a chest specialist, at the hospital, told me. Others like T Jacob John, a retired professor of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, believe India must prepare for the worst. \"I don't think we have yet understood the enormity of the problem that is likely to befall us in the next two months,\" he told me. \"For much too long the virus dictated our responses rather than the other way round\". Dr John says India's response has been largely \"evidence-based and reactive when it should have been projection-based and pro-active\". India's health ministry has strenuously denied there has been community transmission even as doctors from all over the country say they have been seeing patients with Covid-19 like symptoms from early March. \"The entire focus seems to on finding evidence of community transmission, It's a tactical error,\" says Dr John. \"We all know community transmission is there.\" Dr Ravi believes that going forward, \"every week is critical now\". Easing the lockdown to prevent an economic meltdown and flattening the curve of the virus will now require more surveillance testing to find out who's infected and who's not. India would then need millions of testing kits and trained manpower to handle the process. Testing is also a highly involved process, which includes ensuring a cold chain for and smooth transport of tens of thousands of samples to the labs. India's resources are finite and capacity is limited. One way to get around this, says Dr Ravi, is \"pool testing\". This involves collecting a number of samples in a tube and testing them with a single real time coronavirus test based on swabbing of the nose and throat, as recommended by the WHO. If the test is negative, all the people tested are negative. If it's positive, every person has to be tested individually for the virus. \"Pool testing\" reduces the time needed to test large swathes of the population. \"If there's no trace of the infection in some districts, then we can open them up for economic activity,\" says Dr Ravi. Virologists believe that India should also do mass anti-body testing - a finger prick blood test to look for the presence of protective antibodies. The blood test is easier and quicker to scale up than, say administering polio drops for immunisation, which India has successfully done. \"We need antibody testing as a public health tool rather than a diagnostic tool,\" says one virologist. \"We need to identify people who have recovered from the infection and send them back to work because they are no longer at risk.\" Along with this, India needs to look at plasma therapy, virologists I spoke to said. This involves using blood with consent from patients who have successfully fought the infection. This antibody-rich blood plasma can be infused into sick patients. Many doctors say it is a \"hopeful milestone' in treating the disease. Most virologists I spoke to are unanimous that India should be testing \"much, much more\". Ideally, one of them told me, any person with \"any upper respiratory tract infection\" should be eligible for a test. India doesn't have a culture of testing for infectious diseases because most citizens cannot afford them. Risk mitigation is not ingrained in the culture. \"We tend to treat instead of testing. We rely on medical signs and symptoms [of a disease] rather than the cause or set of causes of a disease or condition,\" a virologist observed. \"We do tests only when we are very sick.\" It is all right, says Dr John, that the government is \"fighting the war on the virus with the might of its administrative muscle\". But that might be not enough. Many complain that beyond motivational appeals by the prime minister and routine briefings by bureaucrats, information around the transmission of the virus and scale of testing has been often opaque and evasive. Wearing masks was made mandatory only last week. With its excellent public health system and response, only the southern state of Kerala appears to have flattened the curve so far. \"This is going to be a long haul. We can't be treating India as one episode of flattening the curve and be done with it. The virus doesn't lose virulence,\" says a virologist. \"And all the states are not going to see a rise and fall in the curve at the same time.\" The weeks ahead will possibly tell us whether India will face an exponential rise in infections or begin to flatten the curve. \"This is a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle. There are not going to be any easy answers,\" says Dr John.", "output": "At the weekend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the next three to four weeks would be \"critical\" to prevent the spread of coronavirus in India.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Caroline LowbridgeBBC News Craig Keogh, 26, was described as being aggressive by two pub workers, who told jurors he had offered to sell them the drug. Mr Keogh knew Jane Hings, who lived in the Leicestershire village of Fleckney, because he had walked her dog. He denies her murder, burglary and two counts of raping her. Mary Prior, prosecuting, said Mr Keogh went to Ms Hings' bungalow in the early hours of 24 September and she was found dead by two carers later that morning. In a list of facts agreed by both the prosecution and defence, she described how Ms Hings' body was found in the bedroom of her bungalow. \"They saw that Jane's head appeared to be between the pillows and that she was naked under the quilt,\" said Mrs Prior. \"She was plainly not breathing.\" The carers called an ambulance and attempted to resuscitate her. When a paramedic arrived he noted Ms Hings was cold to the touch and rigor mortis had already set in. The jury was told that Mr Keogh had been on a night out in Oadby on the evening of 23 September. Two members of staff from the Oadby Owl pub told jurors that Mr Keogh seemed to be under the influence of drugs and he had offered to sell cocaine to them. Kitchen manager Christopher Murphy said he warned Mr Keogh that it was their right to inform police if anyone on the premises had drugs. \"I hoped he might leave the premises and not cause any more aggravation to anyone,\" said Mr Murphy. But instead Mr Keogh responded in \"an aggressive manner towards the pair of us\", he said. \"I believe he said 'I'll swing man's jaw', which I took to mean as punching,\" said Mr Murphy. He told the court they warned him again that they would call police, but Mr Keogh responded by saying: \"I'm from Fleckney - I've seen a man get shanked.\" Mr Murphy said he understood \"shank\" to mean \"stab\". \"I believe his words were 'I have a piece' which I took as a weapon,\" Mr Murphy added. Aaron Watson, general manager at the pub, described Mr Keogh as being \"lairy\" and said he was \"going up to people, arms out, getting up to people's faces\". In further facts agreed by the prosecution and defence, the jury was told that Mr Keogh's DNA was found on swabs taken from Ms Hings' body and on a tongue piercing bar recovered from her body during a forensic examination. Mr Keogh bought a new tongue bar after Miss Hings' death, having told a friend he had swallowed his old one. Mrs Prior told the court Mr Keogh asked the friend to sell some jewellery on his behalf, which he did for \u00a3105. This jewellery was later identified as belonging to Ms Hings by her friends. Jurors were told Mr Keogh paid for a carvery meal at a pub for him and his friend later that day and a round of drinks for other friends, explaining that he had found \u00a3200 in a bag in Leicester city centre. The prosecution claim he took this money from Ms Hings' handbag, which he allegedly stole after killing her. \"Throughout the day the defendant was described [by his friend] as being happy and laughing,\" said Ms Prior.

And it's not just Facebook parents are turning to. Matchmaking apps and websites have sprung up offering to help parents connect with other families to form \"safe\" learning pods, or match them with teachers who can give online lessons, dubbed \"zutors\" (zoom tutors) by one matchmaking service. Regular tutoring services have also seen an explosion of interest. One company in Missouri saw a 40% rise in bookings for its online academic subjects across all age groups in April, and is now seeking to add 10,000 more tutors and instructors. But extra teaching does not come cheap, with private tutors costing anywhere between $20 (\u00a315) and $65 (\u00a349) an hour, and monthly fees at around $3,000 (\u00a32,300). Posts to the Pandemic Pods group range from seeking advice on whether an \"outdoor-based\" pod of five children, made up of three families, can safely spend some time indoors, to a mother wanting advice on how to manage a \"micro-school\" timetable for six six-year-olds. One California mother has erected a huge geodesic tent in her back garden and renamed it \"Dome School\" for a small group of kindergarten-age children. Julie Lam, CEO of San Francisco-based real estate investment firm Goodegg, realised she needed to make changes for the new school year after her \"really terrible\" experience trying to work and home-school her three children aged five, seven and eight during the spring term. \"I'm not an educator. I was trying to support each of my three children in their school work each day, trying to work out what they should be doing, trying to work out if they were doing it right, while fielding calls and taking meetings. It's was so stressful,\" she says. Unhappy with the input she got from her children's public school, she and her husband decided to move their children to a private school. Although her children will start their new school remotely, Mrs Lam says the support she has received has been \"very refreshing\". The children can expect a full timetable of study, and she can have a daily check-in with their teachers. Through a matchmaking site, she has also found a college graduate who can come to her house three days a week and help supervise her children's distance learning. Ms Lam recognises she is in a fortunate position to be able to make these choices. \"I didn't grow up with wealth so I don't take it for granted. I think everyone is just trying to do the best they can in these difficult times.\" Widening gaps of inequality Her comments touch on one of the big concerns around the growing popularity of learning pods and private tutors - that it will further widen inequalities in the education system, which have long fallen along race and income lines. New research suggests the impact of the lockdown is already being seen in students' academic gains. A working paper from the NWEA, a non-profit organisation, predicts the average student will be starting the new school year having lost as much as a third of the expected progress in reading and half the expected progress in maths. Some students are nearly a full year behind where they might expect to be in a normal school year. Learning loss is likely to be greater among low-income black and Hispanic students, according to analysis by consulting group McKinsey and Company. It highlights data which shows only 60% of low-income students logging into online instruction compared with 90% of high-income students. Engagement rates were also lagging behind in schools serving predominantly black and Hispanic students, with 60-70% logging on regularly. Most schools across the US had intended to welcome back students on their premises when the new academic year starts in the coming weeks. But with US Covid-19 cases topping 4.7 million and rising by up to 77,000 a day, they have had to rapidly rethink their plans. More than half of 106 school districts have now confirmed they will begin remotely, compared with just one two weeks ago. Bree Dusseault of The Center on Reinventing Public Education (CRPE) says some schools have been able to transition smoothly to online teaching, while others are still trying to organise laptops and internet hotspots for their students. She says many school districts have not been properly supported at state level, and have been burdened with having to \"provide everything for schools as well as ensure health\". State intervention would allow for greater consistency when it comes to \"device provision, communication hotspots, school meals, mental health and protections for physical health\", she says. A big unknown, she says, is how the country's most vulnerable learners are faring. \"Districts are reassuring us that they will provide services, but there has been almost no information about what support is being given to children who are homeless, disabled and in juvenile detention.\" Ms Dusseault understands why parents would seek out-of-school support \"especially if their district isn't stepping up\", but she says \"the key is ensuring that all families can find and pay for those solutions if they have to\". \"Robust conversations\" around equality issues are also heavily discussed in the Facebook groups, says Ms Chang, and some families are actively trying to organise pods that are more equitable. One public elementary school in San Francisco, Rooftop, decided to \"head inequity off at the pass\" as head Nancy Bui puts it, by organising a school-wide virtual \"pod\" programme. This programme \"supports family-to-family connections by assigning kids in the same class to smaller cohorts\" but ensures the pods reflect the diversity of the school. 'They didn't even know they were learning' Kellyse Brown's family is one for whom a solution has been found. The lively nine-year-old has spent the summer taking part in a summer school set up and run by a parent-led group in Oakland, California. Oakland Reach was set up four years ago to help disadvantaged families fight for high quality education for their children. Most of the city's public schools are majority black and Latino, and less than 30% of students were reaching the required reading level. A group of parents decided this had to change. Co-founder Lakisha Young said it became apparent as soon as the lockdown happened in March that the students of Oakland were likely to be adversely affected and indeed this proved the case, with just 30% of students found to be participating in online learning. The organisation raised more than $350,000 to pay for 14 teachers and two directors to run a free virtual summer school for 180 children aged between five and 13, for the whole of the six-week summer break. Kellyse's day starts with a virtual get-together with her classmates and teacher. She will do some maths and English along with an hour of mindfulness and an afternoon of enrichment activities ranging from science experiments to karate and cooking. Her mother, Keta Brown, who is a family liaison officer with Oakland Reach, says it has been a wonderful experience for her daughter. \"It hasn't felt like work. Their literacy lessons for instance revolved around civil rights and Black Lives Matter - issues that are relevant to them. They didn't even know they were learning,\" says Keta, who is also delighted that her daughter now knows how to cook pasta. \"I feel so fortunate that Kellyse was able to have this opportunity because so much learning is lost in the summer term, and it's very possible children this year will have backtracked to March.\" Oakland Reach is now thinking about how to help families further as the new school year gets under way remotely - and is well supported by both the school district and financial donors in doing so. Ms Young says that for families who are happy with their school's provision they still want to offer \"robust one-to-one tutoring\" to supplement children's learning. For other families, they intend to continue providing academic instruction and enrichment - and \"setting up parents as the real leaders of their child's education\", by providing support to access both the curriculum and the necessary technology. On the subject of pods, she says: \"We would love to partner with them. This crisis has created an opportunity for real innovation and we are open to working with everyone to help make our education system work better for all.\"", "output": "When the number of coronavirus cases began to rise in the San Francisco area in early July, mother of one Lian Chikako Chang started a Facebook group to support local families and teachers who were suddenly facing the prospect of schools not opening in person as planned in mid-August.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Mark LowenBBC News, Lombardy, Italy He parks beside the police cars blocking a road to Codogno, the epicentre of Italy's coronavirus outbreak. And across the ad hoc barrier, fencing off an invisible threat, he passes a simple object to his sister stuck on the other side: a facemask. Pharmacies in the town of 16,000 people are running low. Queues of anxious customers are forming, as Codogno hits headlines around the world. The mayor, Francesco Passerini, tells me by phone that the situation is completely calm and supplies of food and medicine are stable. \"Our town has overcome everything, including the Second World War,\" he says - an attempt at reassurance. But in the 11 closed-off towns, in which more than 50,000 people are quarantined, fear is setting in. Andrea Alloni, a resident in Codogno, says while some are convincing themselves that the outbreak will blow over, others are so worried that they're using sleeping pills. Emergency medical phone-lines are saturated. The elderly are feeling particularly vulnerable. And while a handful of shops are open inside the town, the streets are quiet. Most are staying at home - or if they venture outside, they do so in face masks. Italy is struggling to understand how it went from six coronavirus cases to more than 200 since last Friday, becoming Europe's worst-affected country and the third worst hit in the world after China and South Korea. So far, seven people have died. \"Patient zero\" - the individual first infected - has still not been identified. It was initially believed to be a 38-year-old man who visited a hospital in Codogno where a woman later died from the virus and whose colleague had been in China in January. But when his colleague tested negative, the search for the original infector continued. Finding the source of the outbreak would help authorities understand the spread and potentially stem it. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has defended his government's response, insisting that the high number here is because Italy is testing more people than other European countries. There is a hope that the outbreak has stabilised, with new cases slowing. But the authorities here are worried. With the unprecedented containment measures widening, the economic impact could be severe. Public spaces have been cordoned off, schools, universities and museums are closed, key events like the Venice Carnival and Milan fashion week have been curbed, even filming of the new Mission Impossible in Venice has been suspended. Lombardy and Veneto - the two most affected regions - make up 30% of the Italian economy. Italy's growth is already estimated at just 0.1% for 2019 - the lowest in the eurozone. The talk now is that the impact of the virus could tip it into recession. Neighbouring Croatia and Greece have cancelled all school visits to Italy. Kuwait has stopped flights here. Italy itself was the first European country to halt flights to and from China when the outbreak began: a risk for an economy that depends on some five million Chinese tourists a year. In an era of social media, rumours and scaremongering fly fast. It's too early to talk of panic here. But some supermarkets are seeing empty shelves, as families stock up. Bars and restaurants are closing this week - the old town of Piacenza was eerily quiet for a weekday evening. The far-right opposition is harnessing the situation to push its call for closed borders. \"We're confident our public health system can face this if it's a few hundred cases,\" says Andrea Alloni by phone from Codogno. \"But if the number spikes, it won't be able to cope.

By law, shops should not sell vaping products to anyone under the age of 18. The UK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA) blamed \"unscrupulous retailers\" and called for better enforcement. For many people quitting smoking, vaping is a good alternative to cigarettes, but there are fears it is becoming glamorised and increasingly attractive to children. On YouTube, there are clips from young vapers performing spectacular tricks for millions of viewers. And critics say some of the flavours might appeal directly to children - a claim the industry disputes. Pupils at Ysgol Gymraeg Ystalafera, a Welsh-medium secondary school near Neath, said children - sometimes as young as 11 - were vaping for a number of reasons. \"I believe that when they see the older pupils in the school experimenting with all these different types of vape, they think it's how to fit in,\" one pupil said. The different flavours were another reason for their popularity with children, according to some. \"They definitely appeal to a younger market, so much like alcopops were for younger children,\" a pupil explained. Another added: \"You see videos going viral of people vaping and making shapes out of the smoke and stuff like that and I think it just attracts a younger audience that thinks it's cool.\" Pupils also thought it was easy to buy vaping products, despite the age restriction. To test that, X-Ray sent sixteen-year-olds Rory and Anthony to Newport fitted with secret cameras to see how many shops would illegally sell them vaping products. Some shops did ask for ID, but half of the 20 they visited sold vaping products labelled \"highly addictive\" and \"over-18s only\" without checking their age. One even sold illegal vape liquid with no proper labelling for just 50p. Prof Martin McKee, a public health expert from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said he was concerned about the \"real risk of a nicotine-addicted generation\". \"What this demonstrates very clearly is that the rules are simply not being applied,\" he added.

His mother, grandmother and sister deny manslaughter. Read more stories in Leeds and West Yorkshire The court heard evidence from Jacqueline Lowdon, an NHS dietitian of 26 years with experience of treating severe eating disorders. As Mr Burling had not had any health assessments in recent years, she had to work with figures from the post-mortem examination along with anecdotal evidence from his family, the court heard. Mr Burling's mother Dawn Cranston, 45, grandmother Denise Cranston, 70, and his sister Abigail Burling, 25, all deny killing him. They also deny an alternative count of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable adult. No symptoms connected to eating conditions such as anorexia or bulimia were recorded in Jordan's case and gastro-intestinal diseases including coeliac and Crohn's were also ruled out. She estimated he had experienced \"at least six months of malnutrition\" and was satisfied there was \"nothing medically\" that could have caused his condition. When asked by Nicholas Lumley QC, prosecuting, what treatment Mr Burling would have required, she told the jury he would have had to take on nutritional fluids very slowly to avoid the potentially fatal effects of \"re-feeding syndrome\" where a starved patient is given too much nutrition too quickly. Dr Lowdon said an adult male patient of Mr Burling's BMI would have required an initial 185 calories a day, with a healthy adult male requiring up to 3,000. When asked if she had ever studied a patient with such a degree of malnutrition, she replied: \"No I haven't.. I've never seen anyone with such a low BMI as this.\" Mr Lumley told Dr Lowdon a relative of Mr Burling had commented Jordan looked like a \"World War Two concentration camp\" victim and asked her if this was fair. She replied: \"Yes it is, that's where re-feeding came from. \"Prisoners from camps were fed and started to die, that's where we found out about re-feeding syndrome.\" On Wednesday, the court heard the cause of his death was \"acute bronchopneumonia\", which is likely to have been caused by his malnutrition, his immobility and his infected sores.

He also pledged to increase the minimum wage to help with the cost of living. Meanwhile a senior party figure has said people earning \u00a360,000 were \"not rich\" and the tax rise focus should be \"the privileged few rifght at the top\". Mr Miliband said he wanted to \"send a very clear signal\" that it was wrong that millions of working people in the UK could not afford to bring up their families properly. The Labour leader said: Mr Miliband said the housing benefit cut - affecting social tenants in England, Scotland and Wales deemed to have spare bedrooms - would be scrapped. Earlier on Saturday, shadow communities and local government secretary Hilary Benn told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme the housing benefit change was a \"cruel and unfair policy\" which \"undermined families and communities\" and did not work because there were no smaller properties for people to move in to. Critics have called the cut a \"bedroom tax\" however the government said it was tackling a \"spare room subsidy\" which was unavailable in the private room sector, and that the \u00a323bn-a-year housing benefit bill must be cut. Mr Miliband told a crowd in Brighton: \"Abolishing the bedroom tax. Strengthening the national minimum wage. Childcare there for parents who need it. That's what I mean by tackling the cost of living crisis at this conference. That's what I mean by a government that fights for you.\" The Labour leader added that the national minimum wage was \"one of the proudest achievements of the last Labour government\" but it was falling behind price rises under the coalition government. He pledged to strengthen it. If the national minimum wage had risen in line with the cost of living it would be 45p an hour higher than the current level, which is due to rise next month from \u00a36.19 to \u00a36.31, he explained. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: \"Conservatives back the minimum wage. \"But if Ed Miliband was really on the side of hardworking people then he would have supported our welfare changes to ensure work always pays and should have voted in favour of halving the amount of income tax someone working full-time on the minimum wage pays.\" Mr Miliband criticised Mr Cameron's record as one of \"tax cuts for millionaires, tax cuts for hedge funds, tobacco lobbyists in Downing Street\". It was the \"forgotten wealth creators - the people who put in the hours, who do the work, who do two jobs, who do the shifts\" that should be supported, he said. 'Cruel and unfair policy' The speech came after Rachel Reeves, deputy to shadow chancellor Ed Balls, told the Daily Telegraph what incomes she thought should be considered for tax changes. \"The focus should be on those privileged few right at the top, and that's not people earning \u00a350,000 or \u00a360,000 a year,\" she said. \"If you're a single-earner family in the South East on (that income), you don't feel particularly rich, and you'd be aggrieved that people earning between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a31 million are getting a tax cut.\" A Liberal Democrat document leaked earlier this week suggested the party was considering increasing taxes for people earning more than \u00a350,000. Senior Lib Dem Vince Cable said the proposal was not government policy and he did not know where it had come from. The average annual wage of full-time workers in the UK was \u00a326,500 in the year to April 2012, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics in its annual survey of hours and earnings last November. Labour has also promised to make childcare a key part of its manifesto. Of their plan for schools to extend their opening times, Mr Miliband said it \"doesn't make sense in this century\" that some schools still close in mid-afternoon when parents are usually at work. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said \"most jobs don't fit neatly with school hours\". She added: \"We know parents with early starts, or commutes to work, need childcare they can rely on. \"Childcare is now as vital to our economic infrastructure as transport, housing or IT.\" At present some schools offer breakfast clubs and after-school clubs to help working parents, but Labour says many of these have closed due to government cuts. Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman told the Independent she was \"determined\" mothers and fathers should be entitled to transfer part of their flexible parental leave to grandparents, enabling them to return to work.

The raids, with at least 800 heavily armed officers, led to 15 arrests. One man has been charged with planning an attack. Prosecutors said it involved \"gruesomely\" killing someone. Omarjan Azari, 22, is accused of conspiring with Mohammad Ali Baryalei - believed to be the most senior Australian member of IS - and several others between May and September, according to court documents. 'Imperative danger' Australian media reports said they had discussed abducting members of the public and beheading them on camera, draped in a black IS flag. In recent weeks, IS has released video footage showing the beheadings of two American journalists and a British aid worker seized in Syria. Analysis: BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney The news of an alleged plot to publicly behead a random Australian will shock many people here, including the vast majority of this country's long-established moderate Muslim community. Many Muslims are unhappy with what's going on in Iraq and Syria but would never resort to violence. These raids risk antagonising the broader Islamic community. But Australia, like many countries including Britain, is worried about the threat from Islamic State, not just abroad but at home. More than a decade on from Australia's support for the US-led war in Iraq, the country finds itself embroiled in a conflict that is far from over. Tony Abbott this week announced he is sending 600 troops to the Middle East to assist in the fight against Islamic State. Security forces clearly face a battle at home too. Who are Australia's radicalised Muslims? Asked about the reports at a news conference, Mr Abbott said: \"That's the intelligence we received.'' \"Direct exhortations were coming from an Australian who is apparently quite senior in [IS] to networks of support back in Australia to conduct demonstration killings here in this country.\" Prosecutor Michael Allnutt said Mr Azari had planned to commit \"extremely serious\" offences that involved \"an usual level of fanaticism\" and were \"clearly designed to shock, horrify and terrify\" the public. The plot involved the \"random selection of persons to rather gruesomely execute\", and those involved had an \"irrational determination\" to carry it out even though they knew they were under surveillance, he added. The charge against Mr Azari stemmed from a telephone call intercepted earlier this week, which prompted police to carry out the raids. \"It's been an immediate reaction to a clear, imperative danger,\" Mr Allnutt said. Mr Azari's barrister told the court that police had very little evidence to support the charge, but he did not apply for bail. Another of those arrested, a 24-year-old man, was charged with unauthorised possession of a prohibited weapon and possessing ammunition without a licence. About 200 people from Sydney's Muslim community held a protest against the raids on Thursday night. Speakers reportedly made claims of police brutality and political hysteria. 'Young recruits' The anti-terrorism operation - the largest in Australian history - began early on Thursday, with officers executing 25 search warrants across 12 suburbs of Sydney. Other raids took place in Brisbane. Acting Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said they were not directly linked to the Sydney operation but related to a raid last week on an Islamic centre that led to two men being charged with terrorism offences. Australia and foreign fighters: Phil Mercer: Australia's home-grown terror threat Mr Colvin said the age of Mr Azari and others under investigation were of concern, adding: \"We are seeing that younger and younger men are deciding to take up arms or wanting to participate or in some way contribute to the cause.\" Last week, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Mr Baryalei, a former Sydney bouncer and part-time actor, had recruited a \"who's who\" of Australian IS fighters. The Australian police subsequently confirmed that a warrant had been issued for him for \"alleged terrorism-related activities\".

On Thursday, the plans were submitted to the Coastal Communities Fund for a purpose-built boat which could be plying the route again within two years. The idea is the brainchild of retired Liverpool University professor Kenton Morgan. He said: \"It's known there are 400,000 annual visitors to Cefn Sidan beach just along the coast, and tens of thousands of visitors to Llansteffan Castle, Ferryside Castle and Laugharne, with its Dylan Thomas links. \"If the plan is approved, the ferry itself will become a tourist attraction.\" As the name suggests, the settlement of Ferryside developed around the landing stage of a ferry across the Tywi estuary which may have pre-dated the Norman Conquest.

However, with the second-highest tidal range in the UK, crossing the estuary is not without its difficulties. A conventional boat would require a 820ft (250 metre)-long jetty, owing to the slope of the beach. To overcome this the group behind the scheme has chosen an amphibious craft, using technology developed by a New Zealand company. The ferry would be fitted with retractable wheels like an aircraft, which would avoid the need for a jetty. If successful, the boat would be built in Solva in Pembrokeshire.

Why then immediately highlight problems? The presidents of the European Parliament and the European Commission chose to respond to Mr Cameron's letter and speech today with words of warning - describing his EU reform ideas as \"problematic\" and highlighting possible legal issues. Why? I would argue this is because the European Union realises the British prime minister needs a fight and a bloody nose to drown out criticisms back home that this EU reform process is a sham; that Mr Cameron's demands are wishy-washy and worthless. They realise he needs a sense of drama. Of a bitter battle fought and won. And they are preparing to give it to him. But there are also some very real difficulties with the changes to the EU that David Cameron demands from a European perspective. And they will emerge in the \"hows\" rather than the list of \"whats\". Exactly how the Prime Minister's demands can be implemented will be the focus of negotiations that will now get underway in earnest with his 27 EU partners. For example, the first objective \"to protect the single market for Britain and for others outside the eurozone\" has a lot of backing in other European capitals but will the UK insist on a veto on eurozone legislation? That will be a lot more difficult to achieve than a vote. Excluding Britain from the idea of ever-closer union has caused a fair amount of eye-rolling but few objections in EU circles. The same goes for giving national parliaments more of a say in forming EU legislation. That option already exists, (though is little-used) and could easily be tweaked. But curbing EU migration is problematic. Though here, again, a number of the British ideas are welcomed by the majority of other European countries - such as restricting the freedom to work across the EU of citizens from new member states (until their economies have caught up with the EU average). There is also broad agreement on cracking down on welfare tourism and limiting child benefits and out-of work benefits for migrants. The real problem is centred around in-work benefits. David Cameron insists that the UK be allowed to limit them for non-British EU workers for four years. Central and Eastern European countries with a fluid workforce, such as Poland, are loud opponents of the proposal (though privately they say they would be happy if their best and brightest would think twice before abandoning their homeland). But it is powerhouse Germany that will be the hardest obstacle to overcome here. Discriminating against EU workers goes against one of the bloc's founding principles - the freedom to live and work anywhere in the European Union. Britain's four key objectives for renegotiation: Read more on this story What Britain wants from Europe EU vote: When, what and why? Guide to the 'leave' campaigns Guide to the 'In' campaign 'Brexit?' Everything now at stake for Cameron Once again, though, every German diplomat or politician I have spoken to about this says Germany will do its utmost to accommodate the UK in all its reform demands. Big EU players, such as France and Germany regard this EU renegotiation process as a bit of an annoyance they want to get over with quickly. Many privately say they think this is more of an internal Conservative Party issue for Mr Cameron, but the feeling is they will play ball with the aim of moving on as soon as possible as an EU of 28 countries to deal with what they view as the really important matters facing them: not Brexit, but rather migration. Credibility and cohesion There are three main reasons why the EU wants the UK to stay. Firstly there is a rather painful awareness that, without Britain, the bloc would be economically, politically, militarily and diplomatically weaker. Then there is the fear of contagion. Brussels frets when Mr Cameron says the EU must show it is flexible enough to suit the needs of all its member states. There is a worry that the UK might inspire other countries' governments, opposition parties or popular movements to insist they get their own EU deal to better suit their individual needs. And finally there is a concern that Brexit could be the straw that breaks the camel's back of the EU as a whole.

The chemical spillage has been cleaned up and there is no further risk to the river, the company said. NI Water said it would continue to work with the Environment Agency. The Annsborough River is a tributary of the Carrigs River. which runs from Castlewellan through the village of Maghera and into Dundrum Bay. The incident was reported to the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) pollution hotline on Saturday. Staff from the agency and officers from the Department of Agriculture's fisheries team immediately went to the scene and conducted a detailed investigation. \"The source was traced to premises where it was discovered that a chemical had escaped into the river causing significant pollution,\" a spokesman for the department said. \"Statutory water samples were collected and evidence gathered with a view to an enforcement action. To date the number of dead fish is in excess of 1,600. \"All relevant authorities have been notified, including local council environmental health as Dundrum Bay is a significant shellfish production area.\" Adrian Truesdale, who owns a caravan park beside the river, said he thinks the number of fish killed could rise. \"With part of the river being tidal, I would imagine that a lot from Saturday afternoon and Sunday have already been washed on down into the bay,\" he said. \"My worry is because it goes down into Dundrum Bay, other fish that would come in and go up the Moneycarragh river would also be affected by this.\"", "output": "Accidental discharge from a treatment works caused the deaths of more than 1,600 fish in a river near Newcastle, County Down, NI Water has said.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Robert Edwards, 55, was arrested in Bury St Edmunds on 20 May 2011 over allegations of assault. He was taken to West Suffolk Hospital after falling unconscious in his cell and died on 25 May. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found insufficient checks were made on Mr Edwards. The IPCC investigation began in December 2011, but the findings were only made available after an inquest held in Bury St Edmunds closed on Friday. 'Vulnerable state' Recording a narrative verdict, Suffolk's coroner Dr Peter Dean said Mr Edwards was a \"known methadone and alcohol user\". \"He should not have been deemed fit for detention,\" Dr Dean said. \"Subsequently, finds of deterioration were missed, leading to aspiration and hypoxia, leading to cardiac arrest and widespread ischemia of the brain.\" The IPCC investigation found there was a lack of clarity as to who had responsibility for Mr Edwards's care following a shift handover between custody sergeants. But it was unable to establish whether officers were supplied with specific information that Mr Edwards, when heavily intoxicated, had a tendency to vomit in his sleep. Commissioner Sarah Green said: \"Our investigation found that Suffolk Constabulary failed to take appropriate care of Mr Edwards, who was in a vulnerable state due to his intoxication, and did not properly carry out rousing checks on him as needed. \"When Mr Edwards' condition deteriorated, this was not identified and responded to sufficiently promptly.\" 'Extremely seriously' A Suffolk Police spokesman said the force's \"thoughts and sympathies\" were with the family. \"We hope that the conclusion of the inquest can bring them some closure in relation to his death,\" the spokesman said. The IPCC investigation also found that a detention officer, Barry Brackenborough, had a case to answer for gross misconduct for failing to wake Mr Edwards on more than one occasion. The officer resigned from Suffolk Police ahead of disciplinary proceedings. A misconduct panel, held in his absence, found the case proven and indicated that had Mr Brackenborough not resigned, he would have been dismissed. Suffolk Police said it took the incident \"extremely seriously\" and had been \"determined to learn lessons from it\". The spokesman added: \"Officers and staff who work in our custody suites are given extensive training in rousing procedures, in line with national guidelines. \"This was no different at the time of Mr Edwards's death. However, in this particular case the training was not put into practise and procedures not followed correctly.\" PC Alison Huntley was found to have a case to answer for misconduct for failing to rouse Mr Edwards adequately on one occasion.

There have been about 25 reported self-immolations in Tibetan parts of China over the last year. But the reports cannot be independently verified.
