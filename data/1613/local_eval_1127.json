If it is a store bought yogurt, then the shelf life should be about 2 weeks in the refrigerator.Make sure to store the sauce in an air-tight container. Most tubberware should work. Those soup containers from Chinese takeout orders work perfectly.EDIT: After a bit of a debate in cooking chat, I decided to change my answer a little. The reason I said 2 week is because personally I had eaten 2 week old Mast O Khiar. However it could be recipe dependant so it could be different for a different recipe. However it is very easy to tell whether yogurt OR cucumber is bad.Mast O Khiar should have a very fresh/clean aroma. When yogurt turn bad, it releases a rancid smell. If it smells bad, dont eat it.If you see fuzzy mold it's a good idea to throw it out.  <sep>  Q: What is the shelf life of a yogurt product?
