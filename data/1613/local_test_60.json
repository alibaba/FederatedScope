Once owned by King Charles I of England  it disappeared from view until 1900  when it resurfaced and was acquired by a British collector. At that time it was attributed to a  Leonardo  disciple  rather than to the master himself.\nThe painting was sold again in 1958 and then acquired in 2005  badly damaged and partly painted-over  by a consortium of art dealers who paid less than $10 000 (8 445 euros). The art dealers restored the painting and documented its authenticity as a work by  Leonardo .\nChristie's says most scholars agree that the painting is by  Leonardo   though some critics have questioned the attribution and some say the extensive restoration muddies the work's authorship.\nChristie's capitalized on the public's interest in  Leonardo   considered one of the greatest artists of all time  with a media campaign that labeled the painting \"The Last Da Vinci.\" The work was exhibited in Hong Kong  San Francisco  London and New York before the sale.\nIn New York  where no museum owns a  Leonardo   art lovers lined up outside Christie's Rockefeller Center headquarters on Tuesday to view \"Salvator Mundi.\"", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

The famed New York gossip columnist  Liz Smith  has died at 94.  Her  decades long column in the New York Daily News gave people a look into the lives of the rich and famous and powerful.\nFor decades  if you wanted to know where a famous person was last night and with whom  you'd see what  Liz Smith  was writing.  Smith  was a famed gossip columnist who chronicled the lives of the rich and powerful in New York's tabloids.  She  died Sunday at the age of 94. NPR's Andrew Limbong has this appreciation.\nANDREW LIMBONG  BYLINE:  Liz Smith  liked to compare gossip to Greek tragedy.  She  was especially fond of this quote from an academic calling gossip an emotional release valve that allows us to express a whole range of human findings - envy  anger  compassion - and to find solace in other people's woes. But  she  herself wasn't that high-minded about it.\n LIZ SMITH : It wasn't just about people doing terrible things all the time. A lot of it was just wannabe news.\nLIMBONG: This is  Smith  on NPR in 2009.  She  talked about bringing readers to places where all the rich and famous people hung out.\n SMITH : You wanted to go. You wanted to know how - what would it be? How much did you tip the hat check girl in a place like that? You know  looking through the keyhole at how your betters lived  I guess.\nLIMBONG:  Liz Smith  was born in Fort Worth  Texas  in 1923.  Her  babysitter used to take  her  to movies where  she 'd be captivated by movie stars.  She  moved to New York and began ghost writing gossip. In the '70s   she  eventually got  her  own column in the New York Daily News simply titled  Liz Smith .  She  never wanted  her  columns to be mean  and they were far removed from the sort of bloggy online snark of the gossip that came after  her . But  she  had insider information on the likes of Rock Hudson  Elizabeth Taylor  Elaine Stritch.\nDOREE SHAFRIR: And you could tell that  she  was writing them sort of from a place of almost  like  love of the people  she  was writing about. Like   she  really enjoyed the world that  she  was writing about and the characters in it.\nLIMBONG: That's Doree Shafrir.  She  covers tech for BuzzFeed now  but  she  used to work at Gawker and profiled  Smith  for the New York Observer in 2008.\nSHAFRIR: Like a lot of people in media  but probably especially for gossip columnists of  her  era  the line between friends and sources and subjects necessarily got very blurred.\nLIMBONG:  Smith  was criticized for not being objective  but  she  didn't pretend to be.  She  told NPR in 2009 about  her  biggest scoop.  She  got it from  her  friend Ivana Trump.\n SMITH : One day Ivana called me and asked me to come to the Plaza Hotel. And when I got there   she  threw  herself  in my arms and told me that Donald didn't want  her  anymore  and that  she  had just gone through all of this plastic surgery to enhance  her  looks. And I tried to give  her  some motherly advice.\nLIMBONG: The Trumps' divorce was a big deal  and  Smith  knew what the fallout would look like.\n SMITH : I said  get yourself a PR person who's respectable and defend yourself against him.\nLIMBONG: Donald Trump  who was a celebrity real estate developer at the time  wasn't  thrilled Smith  was writing about  his  divorce.\n SMITH :  He  said  he  was going to buy the New York Daily News in order to fire me.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Comic strip artist Mort Walker  a World War II veteran who satirized the Army and tickled millions of newspaper readers with the antics of the lazy private \"Beetle Bailey \" died Saturday.  He  was 94.\n Walker  died at  his  home in Stamford  Connecticut  said Greg Walker  his eldest son and a collaborator. His father's advanced age was the cause of death  he said.\n Walker  began publishing cartoons at age 11 and was involved with more than a half-dozen comic strips in  his  career  including \"Hi and Lois \" ''Boner's Ark\" and \"Sam & Silo.\" But  he  found  his  greatest success drawing slacker Beetle   his  hot-tempered sergeant and the rest of the gang at fictional Camp Swampy for nearly 70 years.\nThe character that was to become  Beetle Bailey  made  his  debut as Spider in  Walker 's cartoons published by the Saturday Evening Post in the late 1940s.  Walker  changed Spider's name and launched  \"Beetle Bailey\"  as a college humor strip in 1950.\nAt first the strip failed to attract readers and King Features Syndicate considered dropping it after just six months   Walker  said in a 2000 interview with The Associated Press. The syndicate suggested  Beetle  join the Army after the start of the Korean War   Walker  said.\n\"I was kind of against it because after World War II  Bill Mauldin and Sad Sack were fading away \" he said. But his misgivings were overcome and  Beetle  \"enlisted\" in 1951.\n Walker  attributed the success of the strip to Beetle's indolence and reluctance to follow authority.\n\"Most people are sort of against authority \"  he  said. \"Here's  Beetle  always challenging authority. I think people relate to it.\"\n \"Beetle Bailey\"  led to spin-off comic strip \"Hi and Lois \" which  he  created with Dik Browne  in 1954. The premise was that  Beetle  went home on furlough to visit  his  sister Lois and brother-in-law Hi.\nFellow cartoonists remembered  Walker  on Saturday as a pleasant man who adored his fans.

He  will be sorely missed by  his  friends in the NCS and by a world of comic strip fans \" Morrison said.\nFellow cartoonist Mark Evanier said on his website that  Walker  was \"delightful to be around and always willing to draw  Beetle  or Sarge for any of his fans. He sure had a lot of them.\"\n\"Beetle Bailey \" which appeared in as many as 1 800 newspapers  sometimes sparked controversy. The Tokyo editions of the military newspaper Stars & Stripes dropped it in 1954 for fear that it would encourage disrespect of its officers. But ensuing media coverage spurred more than 100 newspapers to add the strip.\nShortly after President Bill Clinton took office   Walker  drew a strip suggesting that the draft be retroactive in order to send Clinton to Vietnam.  Walker  said  he  received hundreds of angry letters from Clinton supporters.\nFor years   Walker  drew Camp Swampy's highest-ranking officer  Gen. Amos Halftrack  ogling his secretary  Miss Buxley. Feminist groups claimed the strip made light of sexual harassment  and  Walker  said the syndicate wanted  him  to write out the lecherous general.\nThat wasn't feasible because the general was such a fixture in the strip   Greg Walker  said Saturday.

Now an independent consultant  Blankenship was previously a vice president at Tesla Motors from 2010 to 2013  and a vice president of real estate at Apple  working closely alongside  Steve Jobs  to launch the first 165 Apple Stores worldwide before that.\nBlankenship recently sat down with Business Insider deputy executive editor Matt Turner to discuss  the visionary leadership of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk   and how  they  set  their  companies up for success from the beginning.\nAt Apple  we looked around at what was going on in the world at the time  and the technologies that were available that weren't in phones of the time. If you went back 10 years ago and you looked at a Motorola flip phone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the hottest phones \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or the Palm  Nokia  et cetera  they worked  but there was so much more potential.  Steve  just saw so much more opportunity for what this device could be.\n Steve  just saw so much more opportunity for what this device could be.\nThey had a phone  which then enabled the real disruptive part of that technology  which was the app store. Think about it  for two  three  four years  Apple never advertised the phone; it was \"there's an app for that.\" If you step back  what would Uber be today without a smartphone? What would Facebook be? What  Steve  saw were opportunities with existing things that other people just didn't see.\nWith Elon  it's very  very interesting talking to  him  because everything really does have a bigger picture to it. You think about Tesla. Well  when I first met with  him  six or seven years ago   he  had this vision  and the vision was to move the planet away from fossil fuels and into renewable resources. Tesla is a part of that  but it's not the whole picture. It's moving people to electric vehicles  but what else could you do? Well  if you're building an electric car you have to have a lot of batteries  so you go to a battery factory. Well  if you've got these batteries what else could you do with them? You could do a battery wall  a battery pack that hangs on the wall \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you charge it up and run your house and car off of it. And then what's missing is solar  so a year ago they merged with Solar City.\nNow you can take this energy from this great big fusion reactor in the sky  put it in batteries and run your car and your house. It's a bigger picture than what other people are doing. You might ask  well  why don't other car dealers do this? Or why don't other manufacturers do this? It's because they just don't see things the way a  Steve Jobs  and an Elon Musk do \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and they have the conviction to make it happen.\nTurner: How alike are those two people   Steve Jobs  and Elon Musk?  They 're almost iconic now. What similarities do  they  share  and what was it like to work with  them ?\nBlankenship:  They  share a lot of the same qualities.  They  have a conviction and a belief that the direction  they 're going is right. Regardless of what anybody else says  the direction is right.\nTurner: How much of those companies are tied up in the individual? Clearly  Apple exists after  Steve Jobs   but how much of the culture that's there was really  the Steve Jobs culture ? How does  it  survive on after  he 's no longer there? What would you make of Apple today?\nBlankenship: When you put together the group of people I just described  those people have a can-do mind-set  that nothing's impossible: \"We're doing something bigger than making an electronic device; there's a bigger purpose here.\" Look at what the results have been of Apple. Yes   Steve  passed away in 2011  but look at the way the company has continued to evolve as a service company: How many millions of iPhone X's do you think they're going to take on order for over the next couple of weeks? It's going to be massive. The company today isn't going through the product innovations on an every three-year basis that it was in the 10 years between 2000 and 2010  but I think it's finding ways that the device has become more personal and more embedded in what you do and how you do it  which aligns you to the platform in an incredible way. Tim [Cook] has done a really good job of doing that.\nTurner: What you've described at both Apple and Tesla with  Steve Jobs and Elon Musk  is a mission at the heart of the company and its strategy. Are there any other companies or people you see out there that when you look at them you say  that's the same thing?\nBlankenship: I think there are different types of missions. Yes  Elon and  Steve  had their missions. If you look at Amazon  Amazon's mission  without a doubt  is the customer: What can we do for the customer? What can we do to make the experience better for the customer? How do we have the best customer experience on the planet?

For founders looking to get on Oddup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s radar   CEO James Giancotti  reveals some factors  the company  looks at when considering whether to rate new startups.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not. You have to put in a lot of time and hard work. You must also answer the question: Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be your investor? Like any relationship  you want investors you love working with who can also make connections for you and help your business grow to the next level. Be selective and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid to say no. We did. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not egotistical. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about finding the right fit \u00e2\u0080\u009d explained  Giancotti .\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wondering how to spot good investors  Oddup has you covered with their investor ratings.  Giancotti  said they look at an investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire portfolio for their rating  not just the shining stars. By going that route  their ratings reflect the whole picture.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI like the analogy that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only as good as the children you have \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Giancotti  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have one amazing child and one terrible child  even though you love them all  there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one that really stands out.

You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to evaluate the companies that investors are getting money from.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAs startups grow  one mistake founders make is focusing on themselves at the expense of the company. When companies have a few employees  the founder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement is crucial. When the team grows to 50 people  smart founders look to hire someone else who can grow the company long after they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve left the picture. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a founder going through a round of funding  stay focused on your company  not yourself.  Giancotti  also advocates planning early for how your startup will raise funds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re raising money to survive \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  said  \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already out of time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhen you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to gain momentum for your startup and get it off the ground  you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably have people tell you that your idea is terrible.

This job takes a lot out of you. Even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re physically healthy  the mental part can wear you down just as much.

He  makes the point in an essay for Aeon   a forum for elaborate intellectual arguments  drawing on a series of  his  own academic investigations.\nIn  his  view  both kinds of fanaticism reflect both the failure of the liberal democratic order to inspire anyone to defend it  and the insidious attractiveness of ideologies which challenge that order. What makes these ideologies appealing is not their content but the strong collective identity they offer. They create peer groups that promise their own members such admiration that it can seem like sufficient reason to lay down one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.

CLOSE White House Spokesman  Sean Spicer  doubled down on  his  claim that President Trump's inauguration was the most watched in history.  He  also said  his  intention is to \"always tell the truth \" but said there may be disagreement over the facts. (Jan. 23) AP\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway claimed that \u00e2\u0080\u009calternative facts\u00e2\u0080\u009d were employed by  Press Secretary Sean Spicer  when he tried to make the case that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration  period  both in person and around the globe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Actually   Spicer  got several facts wrong.\n Spicer  then read a prepared statement later that day  further criticizing the media for \u00e2\u0080\u009cdishonesty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Spicer   Jan. 21: \"Secondly  photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way  in one particular tweet  to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We know that from the platform where the president was sworn in  to 4th Street  it holds about 250 000 people. From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220 000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument  another 250 000 people. All of this space was full when the president took the oath of office. We know that 420 000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday  which actually compares to 317 000 that used it for President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last inaugural. This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u00e2\u0080\u0094 period \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both in person and around the globe.\"\nAt a Jan. 23 press conference   Spicer  made an alternative argument  saying the number of people watching the inauguration on TV  online and in person had to be the largest ever.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a right to say if you add up the network streaming numbers  Facebook  YouTube  all of the various live streaming that we have information on so far  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any question it was the largest watched inauguration  ever \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Spicer  said.\nOn that point   Spicer  may be correct. While Nielsen TV ratings were higher in past years  some data suggests online viewership was up compared with 2009. But there is no comprehensive measurement available that would prove or disprove this claim.\nOn NBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Meet the Press  host Chuck Todd asked White House counselor Kellyanne Conway  \u00e2\u0080\u009c[W]hy the president asked the White House press secretary to come out in front of the podium for the first time and utter a falsehood?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conway responded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so overly dramatic about it  Chuck. What \u00e2\u0080\u0094 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a falsehood. And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving Sean Spicer  our press secretary  gave alternative facts to that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cNewsHour\u00e2\u0080\u009d also posted a timelapse video of the crowd throughout Inauguration Day  which shows it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite stretch back to the Washington Monument  as Trump and  Spicer  said. And as our fact-checking colleagues at The Washington Postpointed out  other journalists had more photographic evidence on Twitter.\nMetro ridership. At the press conference   Spicer  also gave inaccurate numbers for those taking the Washington  D.C.  Metro system for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inauguration compared with Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nBut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what Metro said  and  Spicer  acknowledged that during  his  Jan. 23 press conference.\n Spicer \u00e2\u0080\u0099s 317 000 figure was the number Metro gave for riders as of 11 a.m. on Inauguration Day 2013. The comparable number  for 11 a.m.  for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inauguration was 193 000.\nCrowd-size experts.  Spicer  was right about one thing: It appears  as  he  said  that no one has scientifically calculated estimates of the crowd size for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inauguration. Congress has prohibited the National Park Service from making official estimates after it produced an official estimate that 460 000 turned out for the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cMillion Man March\u00e2\u0080\u009d in 1995  prompting organizers to threaten a lawsuit.\n Spicer  argued that floor coverings over the grass on the National Mall \u00e2\u0080\u009chighlight[ed] where people were not standing  while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how  [Spicer]  kept a straight face when he said that \u00e2\u0080\u009d Doig said.\nTV and online viewership. But at the Jan. 23 press conference   Spicer  emphasized the combined audience \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in person  watching on TV and watching online \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was the highest in history. Asked if he was now saying that it was the largest in-person crowd for an inauguration   Spicer  said  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not. I am saying that it was the total largest audience witnessed in person and around the globe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.
