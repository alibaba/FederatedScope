It had an amazing story line, gorgeous graphics, challenging gameplay, and the best voice acting I have ever heard in any video game with all of this. That said, I couldn't enjoy it because there were several things that distracted me from focusing purely on the storyline. The first thing was, as other reviewers stated, many items are not available without unlocking them.", "output": "Good Review", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1545.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an English language product review, determine if it is a Good Review or a Bad Review.

It's full of stereotypes, which means that all kinds of people will relate to it. Don't waste your time. Read something better! The author needs to find some new friends - not so many as most readers have now!

Some people think it means you can go get your nails done. That's what I wanted but this says different things. It's worth reading or keeping to refer to. If you buy someone else to read the book with you, make sure they really enjoy reading. Maybe then both of these will be more fun. For my own purposes it needs some work.
