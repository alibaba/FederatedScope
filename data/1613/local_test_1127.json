While I don't know the whole theory behind it, each time it happened, there was something just below the hole, let's call it \"the lump\". What I think happens is that the lump is too heavy. When the batter below it tries to rise, it doesn't have the strength to push up the lump. This could be combined with differences in heat transfer throughout the batter vs. on the batter-lump transition in preventing rising (I am certain they exist, but I don't know whether they have an effect at all). The result is a hole where the batter didn't rise, surrounded by nicely risen batter. As to where the lump comes from: you say \"chocolate and pear cake\". If you have pear pieces in the batter, right under the surface, they can do this. I have certainly seen it happen when the recipe includes fruit pieces in the batter. If there are no pear pieces, my second guess is badly dissolved flour. The directions for this type of cake normally include folding the whites very gently, and generally erring on the side of too little whisking. This could contribute to uneven batter texture, resulting in lumps. In the second case, the cake may have some less-than-pleasant pieces, but will still be mostly good.

The guideline for conversion (and this is just a guideline, not a rule or guarantee) is to subtract 25-30\u00c2\u00b0 F / 10-15\u00c2\u00b0 C from the temperature, and 25-30% from the cooking time.So, for example, if a recipe calls for baking at 350\u00c2\u00b0 F for 60 minutes, your first attempt in a convection oven should be 325\u00c2\u00b0 F for 45 minutes.Again, please keep in mind that a convection microwave is still fundamentally a microwave oven.

Grains are mostly starch, but they contain enough fat for rancidity to be a noticeable problem. There's a huge amount of variability in how long that takes, though. If it's airtight and kept in a cool, dark place, it'll last much longer than the best before date. But if it's been exposed to air, light, or heat, it can go pretty fast, perhaps even before the best before date.So, smell it. If you detect any unpleasant smells, you probably don't want to eat it.

The national dutch sausage, Frikandel, is minced, skinless, and not usually eaten at breakfast. There is a perception amongst the dutch that Americans eat nothing but meat and fat in huge portions. I did a semester abroad in the Netherlands. For the first few days, the host family fed me eggs and sausages for breakfast. I usually have some toast or cereal for breakfast. So, after a couple days I asked them if this is what they had for breakfast every day. My host mother said, \"No, this is what we were told Americans have for breakfast everyday!\"After a chat, they said they were buying British breakfast sausages and eggs for me. Their typical breakfast was a slice of bread, some cheese, and a very strongly flavored liverwurst. My tastes were not as developed back then. After two days of that I asked if there was any other breakfast choices. My host mother bought me suikerbrood. It is a loaf of bread with sugar baked in it. It was delicious! I told them that I enjoyed this new breakfast very much. This caused a lot of chortling for my two host siblings.
