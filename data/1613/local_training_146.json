We hit it off great, shared a bunch of interests, just got along really well. He used to bring his girlfriend Erin around a lot and her and I started becoming friendly too and he had no problem with that.\n\nA few weeks into knowing her, Erin told me that she had cheated on Thomas with another guy, Jason, earlier that summer, multiple times. Thomas knew about it and chose to stay with her. He says he forgave her. Yet he would very regularly badmouth Jason to me and other people despite assigning her no blame for what happened even though she clearly deserved it more than Jason did from Thomas's point of view. Erin badmouth him too, even though she was hooking up with him! I even allowed them to color my views of Jason initially until I got to know him (same circles) and he was a great guy to be honest. The whole story just didn't seem right but I ignored it.\n\n(side note: I even invited Jason to a party I was hosting a little while ago and they absolutely lost it with me even though they told me they weren't going to attend anyway.)\n\nRecently I get close to one of Erin's friends, call her Allison, whom she introduced me to and developed feelings for her. I would talk to Erin semi-regularly about this and ask for her advice on Allison. One day, Thomas sent me a rude message asking me why I was talking to Erin so much and that she didn't want to hear me talking about Allison. I was a bit perturbed because Erin had never given me that impression, she was always happy to give me advice about Allison, whom she knew I really liked. Thomas had never ever had a problem about my friendship with Erin: we were close because of similar mental health issues.\n\nI called Erin that day itself and asked her if I was being annoying about Allison. She said absolutely not, why did I ask? I replied that Thomas just told me she didn't want to hear about it and I would rather she conveyed it to me herself. I was confused, he never had an issue with my being close to Erin and I voiced that to her. She told me it was nothing to worry about. I said ok and changed the topic.\n\nFast-forward a couple of months and neither of them has talked to me for a while. I stopped texting them too, suddenly I get a long wall of text from Thomas telling me that I broke his trust and lied to both him and Erin in an attempt to cause relationship trouble. Well, that explained why Erin wasn't talking to me as well.\n\nI'm not too fussed about losing these friendships because they've barely been in my life for the last couple of months. I personally feel like these are toxic people, especially looking back now at the way they demonized Jason to me and others. I still want to check if I could've done anything different: was it wrong of me to talk to Erin about what Thomas said to me?\n\nTL;DR: Friends with both members of a dysfunctional relationship that has involved cheating and I feel like I'm being blamed for something I didn't do?", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

My sister has had parties in the past that have been mellow, and a couple that have made me extremely uncomfortable with how many people are there(my sister is aware of how uncomfortable these parties make me).\nRecently, my sister told me she would be having people over on a weekend night while my parents were gone. This was fine but I ask for nobody to go upstairs or in the garage so they dont let out our animals. The night of I go about shutting and locking all the doors that need to be a locked and set up a gate up for the stairs. \nWhen I entered the kitchen I asked someone if the room smelled like gas to them. Someone had leaned against the oven and left the pilot on for who knows how long. I turn it off.\nI look at the stairs and it seemed like somebody tracked dark wet mud all the way up to the top. I follow the trail and try to get into my parents room. My parents door was locked so I pick the lock open. I wasn sure what to expect when I walked into the room but it ended up being a guy in the bathroom. I knock on the door and tell him he shouldn't be up there.\n When i checked the garage someone moved everything and unlocked all the doors, again. I walk out to find four people sitting in my garage that doesnt have any lights sitting on the ground with the side doors open. They had let all of my moms indoor cats out.\nIrritated now by the last few incidents. I find my sister who was in charge of the music. The music was very loud still so I yell multiple times for her to turn it down or off so I could make her look for my moms cats. I get her and a few people to go outside and help me find them. I was really upset during this time so and I told her it was really bad that someone had let them out and how upset I was. After a bit, fortunately we got them together and I put them all in my room for the rest of the night.\nI walked out again and the room was filled with smoke and smelled like fire. The room was full of people yet nobody seemed to notice. Someone had leaned against the oven and turned it on causing a box someone set on it to catch on fire. I grab the flaming box and push through the group of people to set it in the sink.\nThe next day I get home from work to find my sister was loudly explaining to my parents on how upset she was that I yelled at her because the cats got out painting me as the villain of the night. Frustrated, I walked into the room and asked why she was saying such mean things. It turns out her best reason for saying all this was due strictly from the fact that I yelled at her about the cats. At this point with everything I had dealt with the night prior I exploded. I told my parents everything that had happened the night prior. She had nothing to defend her point, but now she wont talk to me and has disinvited me to our trip to various music festivals we had planned together this year.

I'm psyched because I've wondered this exact thing about a situation I recently created a few months ago, but have nobody inbiased to really talk about it.\n\nSo I'm going to give a lot of context, even things that aren't directly related to the termination of this friendship but help paint a picture of what the dynamic was.\n\nOk so I had reconnected with a really close high school friend via text messages/snapchat. Eventually we found out we actually live close to each other so we decide to meet up and hang out. \n\nWe go out and have some fun, and end up sleeping with each other. We decide to be FWB for awhile and it's great. One day, however, we hang out (after not seeing each other for about a month, leaving me quite horny) and she says she doesn't want to. I get kind of upset, so I just leave brewing. I think it's VERY important to establish that at no point, neither here nor later in the story, do I even approach her without her consent. I don't touch her, I don't back her into a corner, I literally draw an imaginary line in the ground between us and very intentionally do not let any part of may body cross it.\n\nMy leaving did not sit well with her, she was incredibly hurt (she told me later she cried... so that made me feel pretty shitty) and she doesn't see me for about another month. She still texts me though, and she decides to go visit her family. She ends up asking me to pick her up from the airport, which I do, and we actually have a pretty great time. At the end of the night I make a move and we have a kind of argument/discussion. Basically she's not sure if she wants to keep doing this or not because I was such an asshole. The discussion ends with her telling me we'll talk about it on the phone later.\n\nBut we actually don't. She basically dissappears from my life for 6 months now, and I get it. In that particular situation I was without a shadow of a doubt the asshole. I do get texts from her every once in awhile, but not really any conversations. I continue to tell her how sorry I am and how awful I feel, and none of it is a lie I had NEVER felt such intense guilt. It would actually keep me up at night because I never wanted to hurt somebody I care about like that.\n\nBut randomly, after about 6 months she hits me up again, and asks me \"Do you want to be redeemed\". Wtf what a weird text. But obviously I do, at this point I'll be ok with her just accepting my apology and not talking to me again, so I want in on this. \n\nTo summarize, some guy (we will call him Ryan) she does not like fell in love with her and dude is SCARY. He actually seems like he might hurt her, and he found a guy that she likes (We'll call him Will) and wants to get in contact with him to... idk what exactly, but he's not interested in a friendly chat. She wants to give Ryan my number and have me pretend to be Will to keep the \"real\" Will safe. Obviously this puts me in a pretty bad position, but this friendship meant a lot to me so I agree. I should be safe right?\n\nExcept my dumb ass forgot my FB is linked to my phone number and Ryan immediately knows i'm not Will. So he calls me and says \"You're not will, give me Will's number now\". I don't even even HAVE Will's number, but I keep the act up anyways. Idk why but I thought it was funny for him to ask me for Will's number and to respond with \"But I am Will the fuck you mean dawg?\" Lol. \n\nHe starts threatening me, telling me how he's going to leave me a bloody mess, beat my face in, etc. He's also super racist so that's fun (I'm Mexican). This goes on for a couple weeks, but then I find out he's going to contact my friends and I get mad. I basically tell him if he Continues what he's doing I'm going to call the police. This seems to stop him.\n\nAt this point she starts talking to me again. I mention all this because I know that I did some bad shit, but it's my belief that I made up for it. My life was in actual danger, and she even propositioned this to me as a means to rectify everything, so I don't think it should play into the verdict, but maybe I just can't see things from the right perspective.\n\nThe new friendship doesn't involve sex. I've given up on that. First of all she moved away 2 states over, and it just doesn't seem like the kind of thing I should push for anyways. I make it clear that I would like it, though, and we're very flirty, but I never actually push forward with it. And before you say even that was unsolicited, it's not like there's NOTHING happening. She randomly sends me nudes and really suggestive texts. Sk do with that what you will.\n\nAnyways, for the most part we just talk about our lives. And we talk a LOT. She calls me literally every day for nearly 5 months. It doesn't matter if I'm at work or with friends, she calls. At first I'm really happy (I even visit her once), but it starts to grind on me that she calls me every day and only seems to complain about her life. It's not the only thing we talk about (and we talk for literally hours most of the time), but it always comes up.\n\nShe also starts getting angry when I don't pick up. Once I was out with friends all day and she got mad at me because my phone died. \"Well huh you had battery to take snapchats all day!\"\n\nWell yeah... that's why my phone is dead. Not only does she demand my time on the phone, but she started going to school and wanted me to proofread all her papers, which I do. It's clear she's been out of school for awhile because her essays are terrible; lots of spelling and grammar errors mixed with poor structure. Needless to say, a lot of my time is being eaten up by her. Then she starts disappearing again. She won't call or answer me, and at first it freaks me out because I think something happened, but no. She just wants to be alone, and I get it. It just really starts bothering me that she kind of talks to me when she gets something out of it and conveniently decides that my feelings don't matter when she wants to be alone. I feel like this because it seems like she doesn't care at all during these times about how I'm doing. At one point I got kind of depressed about something that had happened to me, and she didn't even respond to me.\n\nThe point is, I feel like I'm being used.\n\nThen one day she goes on another trip with some family, and asks me to come hang out with her when she returns (I live nearby the biggest airport around, so she uses it). I do and tell her \"hey, next month I'm taking a trip and I'll be passing right by your city (visiting her would literally be like a 15 minute detour) , let's have lunch\". She agrees and tells me to give her details. About a week before I head out I hit her up to remind her, since she can be kind of busy, and she responds with basically an \"ok\", but very disconnected. This was during one of those times she wanted to be alone, but it's not often I come by so I thought it might be special. I text her a few more times through the week letting her know the exact time I'll be coming through.\n\nFinally the day comes and I try calling her when I'm around to try to meet up and get no response. I don't want to waste too much time since I'm on a schedule, but I do wait around for a response. I decide just to eat lunch in town and maybe she'll hit me up during and I can at least say hi (Ironically I ended up eating lunch down the street from where she works. This isn't like a creepy stalker thing, it was a total accident and I only recognized the place based on descriptions she had given me. She also doesn't know this so I don't think it played into her behaviour).\n\nShe never contacts me and I'm frustrated but figure she was too busy so I leave. A couple hours later she texts me.\n\n\"I was asleep.\"\n\nWell sorry, but now we're fighting. I told her the EXACT time I was coming through, and she works in the morning, so you made the choice to wake up, go to work, and come back home and sleep despite agreeing to have lunch with me. She tried to tell me I never texted her, which I responded to by vindictively  sending her screens of the texts which SHE RESPONDED TO. She told me she didn't see those, and I'm starting to boil over.\n\n I feel really used, and she's not even apologizing. She seems to think that her sleeping is a good reason for missing me, when the very fact that she chose to sleep is what bothers me. All I want is for her to say I'm sorry at this point. And I'm not vague about it, I ask her to apologize and we don't have to fight anymore, but she very adamantly refuses to. \"I won't apologize for being me\". At this point it's obvious she's not listening so I tell her never to speak to me again. I feel completely manipulated.\n\nFunnily enough I had shipped a birthday present to her a bit before, so when that came she said thank you and I said happy birthday, but besides that I haven't spoken to her. She's reached out a couple times but I do not respond, that friendship was just too toxic.\n\nBut I also wonder... I was an asshole several times to. Was I being inconsiderate? I mean she was probably really tired, and she has a pretty stressful life so maybe I should have understood that.\n\nI'm not sure, and it still bugs me. Am I the asshole?\n\nSorry this was so long jesus...", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t care for the woman, and to be honest, I don\u2019t like her. She lives six hours away and isn\u2019t a dot on my radar at any time, but she\u2019s in town, so he wants to see her I guess. My brother and I have always been the sort of oddballs of the family. We\u2019re not very close to anyone besides my one cousin, and a few tias and tios. I can only guess his reason for wanting to see her is because he wants to get closer to the family. \n\nWell he\u2019s decided that I\u2019m going to join him, and by decide I mean he\u2019s told my parents he wants to go see her, and somehow it\u2019s now us going to see her. I don\u2019t want to. I have work, I don\u2019t know her, and again I don\u2019t care for her.\n\nNow let\u2019s get to the why: my grandmother is a bad person. Plain and simple. She\u2019s a hypocrite who thumps the bible, but talks about how all \u201cthem n-words are moving to the town now.\u201d She\u2019s \u201chad\u201d every disease under the sun. In one year she had cancer, a broken elbow, cancer again, and a stroke. The year before that she had cancer again. Sometimes the cancer is in her lungs, sometimes brain, sometimes it\u2019s random body parts that develop cancer. My dad had a heart attack last year, and a week later she also had a heart attack with the same story as my dad\u2019s. She talks like a baby because of her \u201cstroke\u201d so holding a conversation with her is impossible. Basically either this woman is real life iron man and should be studied, or she\u2019s a liar. The fact that she\u2019s never been sick from her \u201ccancer treatments\u201d or looks the same year after year leads me to believe she\u2019s full of shit. So there\u2019s a few reasons I don\u2019t like her.\n\nI don\u2019t know this woman, I\u2019m an adult, she\u2019s someone who I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t like and don\u2019t want to spend time with. I\u2019m not going to start shit, but I\u2019m not going out of my way to visit her, and if she wants to come see me I\u2019ll tell her no. My brother, my dad, and my mom (who usually agrees with me about this) say I should lighten up, but I\u2019m not arguing with them, I\u2019m just firmly saying no. They say I\u2019ll regret it later, which may be true, but I can worry about that later. Also, again I do not know this woman, so if something happens to her I cannot say I would care too much, or it would be a huge burden. I love my family, but they don\u2019t need me to tag along with them. Also I work that night, and they want me to go spend my free time before work with her, and I can think of a million fucking things I\u2019d rather do than see her. But maybe I should lighten up.\n\nSo, AITA? Because I really feel like I\u2019m being one, but at the same time, I can\u2019t help the way I feel, and I don\u2019t want to have this bitter angry feeling that I\u2019ll know I get from seeing her.

I made sure I would be home so I could meet him.  I have two pets and wanted to make sure they would get along with the guy.  \n\nWhen the guy showed up though, I got a weird feeling in my gut.

However, my roommate isn\u2019t the one that will be living with whoever he finds so I think it\u2019s inconsiderate to not even try to consider what the house dynamics will be like after he leaves.  I think my roommate also already told the other guy he could have the room if he passes the background check.  If this person moves in then I\u2019m going to probably try to move so I can live with people closer in age. \n\nSo anyway AITA for not wanting to live with him and not signing off on adding him to the lease?  I feel like maybe I\u2019m holding my roommate hostage, but I also feel like I\u2019m entitled to comfort in my own home.\n\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

Its an old and low income neighborhood and its pretty obvious when people actually live here or are just driving through. There are 3 parks and an elementary school within 200 yards of my house, so there's a lot of foot traffic (dog walkers, joggers, cyclists, kids walking to school).\n\nThe fact that its a shortcut to the freeway means that we get a LOT of traffic coming through and people drive pretty quickly through the neighborhood. I understand going 5 over, but its common to see cars going 45mph with a limit of 30. I've had people road rage on me while i ride my bike, I even have people use the wrong lane to pass me when I'm in my car.\n\nI've gotten tired of these people abusing our neighborhood and endangering people that live here. I recently started purposely driving 5mph under the limit within neighborhood limits (so 25mph). I also take my sweet ass time pulling out and into my driveway to make people have to slow down a little. I do a full stop at stop signs and wait a few seconds before continuing even when its clear. When turning left, I am extra cautious and wait till its completely clear before beginning my turn. I do this 1. To hopefully remind the shortcut people that this is a neighborhood and they need to drive carefully 2. To hopefully make people rethink using this street as a shortcut and 3. Because I LOVE to see these people flip out in my rearview mirror when all I'm doing is driving cautiously. AITA for roadraging back?\n\nMy most recent incident was yesterday. I was leaving for work and began to pull out of my driveway. I noticed a truck further down the street that was driving noticeably over the limit so i made sure i took my time to reverse out of my drive, come to a stop, switch gears, and calmly speed up to 25mph. The way I did this meant that the truck behind me needed to slow down to about 15 mph while i finished. He then proceeded to tailgate me the entire way up the road while flashing his highbeams. When we came to the stop sign, he switched to the opposite lane and ran it before i could even come to a stop.\n\nI know that this can also be considered road rage. Yes, I know that i can petition the city to install speed bumps. A neighbor tried that process but failed because we didn't meet minimum traffic requirements. They just lowered the minimum and I think we can easily get it, but I have to wait till next year before we can apply again. \n\nThere are 2 ways I've thought about this behavior. One is that I'm just following the rules and hopefully slowing other people down in the process in a 'malicious compliance' type deal. The other is that I'm going out of my way to antagonize these people who are just trying to go about their day, and possibly even angering them to the point where they drive even more aggressively (like with the truck).\n\nAITA for passive aggressively road raging?", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

My dad doesn't have a steady income and gets paid per job. My stepmom meanwhile is on disability and therefore gets a fixed income from social security. I am a student working part time, and I plan to pay off a truck I am buying from a friend. I started making payments in December, and told him I would finish in March.\n\nLast night my stepmom asked me if she could borrow my car because my dad would working late. I (reluctantly) said yes after she said she would be gone for just over an hour. She was gone until close to 11:30. She left around 7.\nAn hour after she got home, she came back into my room, and asked me if she could borrow $40 because her friend was at the casino and she wanted to go. I said sure, but all I have is a hundred dollar bill, and to just bring me the $60 in change back because it's the last of my money until I get paid and give me the other $40 when she had it. She hadn't asked me to borrow my car, I assumed my dad had come home sooner than expected and she was taking his van. Later I find out she took my car. I let it go because she has always been good about asking to borrow it and I let her borrow it earlier.\n\nThis morning, I get up and find out that she didn't come last night and slept at her friends house with my car because she didn't want to get pulled over (I have a headlight out). So my dad takes me to get my car, turns out now it has a flat tire. Not only that, but I also learned she disregarded what I said about the $60 and spent the entire $100. I was pissed about the money, but I didn't have class today so I wasn't super upset about the tire.. I just bought the tire a year and a half ago and I knew the warranty was still good, so I took it to the shop I got it from, told him what happened, and he said he would take care of it. I thought everything was done.\n\nThen he called me saying she must've hit a pothole last night because she dented the rim and broke the seal on the tire, and that the warranty isn't going to cover it. He said he could fix it and give me a break on the tire but, best case scenario, I'm looking at minimum $200. I then told my dad all of this and he said I should just not fix it since I'm going to be getting rid of the car in two weeks and it would be a waste of my money. But I'm not just getting rid of it I'm giving it to my mother since she needs a vehicle.\n\nSo, a long story, and probably more than I needed share, but my question is: Would I be the asshole for asking my stepmom to pay for the repairs since she caused them? If I dish out $200 to fix this thing, then I won't be able to keep my word and give my friend my truck payment for this month. At the same time, I refuse to screw my mom over in this situation and make it her problem. I also know 100% that my father is going to argue that my stepmom shouldn't have to pay for the repairs because I can't be absolutely certain that she is the one who dented my rim, and it wasn't me.", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

My friend has a 5 month old baby and just found out she's pregnant again with her second but she's acting like it's her first pregnancy and the 5 month old doesn't even exist.\n\nBit of background: when her baby was born, let's call the baby summer, she didn't bond very well and didn't even hold the baby for the first 12 hours because she \"didn't know how\" her boyfriend, let's call him Jim, who is not the biological father, held the baby first, dressed her did her first nappy and bottle feed etc. (Biological father is out of the picture entirely) This of course led to post natal depression but she's never got help with it or admitted it to anyone but me and her boyfriend. She told her boyfriend a few months ago (I only just found this out) to take summer away because she can't cope and she's struggling and it's obvious she has not bonded at all. He said no he's not even her dad and never wants to be called dad etc he will always be Jim. She puts summer in a high chair in front of the TV or lays her on the floor and that's pretty much it, when she cries but isn't hungry she gives her Calpol to get her to go to sleep. As soon as Jim is home from work he is on full baby duty. Jim is from a town a few hours away and quite frequently he takes the baby to his parents and stays there for a few days while the mum stays at home by herself. This first happened when the baby was 5 days old. Jim's parents look after the baby while he goes out and has fun with his mates. \n\nNow she's pregnant again with Jim's baby this time and she says she's so excited to have a 'new baby' because new babies are cute. She also said because she's pregnant she needs to find something to do for the next 9 months while waiting for the baby because she's got nothing to do. Her period is literally only 2 days late and only just had a positive test, she's already thinking about the birth, telling her manager and parents etc. It's crazy. For anyone who doesn't know the first 12 weeks are sadly really high risk of losing the baby anything can happen. She's literally forgotten the 5 month old even exists of course she's got things to do for the next 9 months and that's raising the baby she's already got! I'm concerned for summer and the mum because the mum can't cope with the one she's got, let alone having 2 under 2, but won't seek help, I've told her to get help before but she just says she's better now and its only this current age she can't cope with. She's solely focused on being pregnant it's ALL she talks about.\n\nI'm really concerned so would I be the asshole for saying she needs to slow down, not solely focus on the new one until after 12 weeks and get some professional help with bonding with summer before anything else? \n\nTL;DR: my friend has a 5 month old baby who she can't cope with and is 1 month pregnant again already and acting like it's her first.", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

After discussing further, we decided to book it, thinking it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal and that everyone would be better off.  More butts in beds, no one is out any money.\n\nUnfortunately, Sam and a few others seem to be pretty upset with us, insinuating that we\u2019re screwing up the trip.  They don\u2019t understand why we care about having a bed, when there is room for air mattresses and the like.  Plus, they\u2019re upset that we won\u2019t be with the group the whole time, even though we plan on hanging out at the house to do everything but sleep.\n\nSo, before this gets any longer, are we the assholes for booking this separate condo on a group trip?\n\nTLDR: Group books large ski trip for multiple years running. My fianc\u00e9, me, and another couple decide to book a condo separate from the group so we can have beds and more people in the main house have beds too.  No one is out money in this scenario, but people are upset that we won\u2019t be staying with the group.

I do remember waking up in an alley way(I'm pretty sure I thought we were going across the road to wait for my uber. Somehow I've got charges for 4 cancelled ubers from that night), co worker was slapping my face trying to get me to open my mouth, he had his dick in my face. I was holding my mouth closed. I woke up again, he was holding my mouth open, I freak out, either black out or pass out again. Wake up again - realise 'shit, I'm still here' try to comply to get it over with. The second I was complicit, he went soft (Edit 4: This made me think he was into the lack of consent). I go to sleep. Can't move, but can feel everything. He got under my skirt (and did stuff. He made a mess). \nI was really pissed off. Next time I saw him, I kicked his legs a few times and told him I was mad at him. He convinced me 'no no it was concensual, except maybe the last part, which I probably shouldn't have done'.

Here's where it gets murky - I convince myself that if it was because he liked me (as opposed to an attack) he'd want to do it more. So we hooked up, and it was terrible. - didn't go all the way. Then I started persuing him - we are both married, definitely not something either should do. I have no idea why I did that. I don't like him at all. He's not my type. He always makes really sexual comments then acts like nothing has happened. He's twice my age and very senior at work. AITA?\nEdit: I really agressively started persuing him, texting all the time. We sometimes have work drinks on Fridays (he's from the same department, different office)- if I drank a bit much, I'd text and if he said no, I'd reply something like 'do you only want me when I say no?' or something similar. \nI know this sounds fake, it's extremely stupid I know.\nEdit 2: I had a STI test done (negative), got the morning after pill.

We moved to a city together when we first started dating and have a lot of the same friends. \n\nThe reason I bring this up is that a few years back we tried to open up our relationship and one weekend during that time while my ex was out of town, I ended up hanging out with one of the women (35F) in our friend group for an entire weekend while my ex was gone. Nothing sexual happened but I did spend the entire weekend at her house. Things didn't go over well with my ex (I told her immediately when she got home) and at the time caused some turmoil in our relationship which we were able to overcome.\n\nThere was also tension between my ex and this woman, but quickly the two of them became closer than they ever had been before. It should be noted that my ex had hooked up with a random guy while I was out of town previous to this while she was out with a few friends so most everyone knew about this open relationship thing.\n\nFast forward to about a year ago and I was out with some friends and ran into the same woman. We hung out and I spent the night and the following night at her place (nothing sexual happened again) and that was that. We both get along well but she told me she cared about my ex and didn't want to hurt the relationship since they are closer and better friends now. I was respectful of this and that was that between us other than seeing each other at various get-togethers.\n\nFast forward to about a month ago and we find ourselves together at a bar and hit it off quite well as we do except this time she texts me after she leaves. Since that night we have been hanging out together (No sex still at this point) and things are going well. She has mentioned that she really likes hanging out with me but still has the same apprehension. I understand where she is coming from and this is the reason why we haven't had sex or started exploring this relationship more. I really want to be respectful but I am kind of letting things happen and not fully supporting letting this thing go since I like this person.\n\nI don't want to compromise my ex and this womans relationship but part of me feels like my ex is somehow controlling this in some capacity. The reason I say this is the first time after we spent that weekend together I was getting the vibe that my ex put herself more in this womans life to check that nothing was going on between us and is still doing that. I don't view my ex in a bad light and I still love her very much as a person and I know she feels the same about me but my ex wanted our relationship to end.

He's since paid back rent and such. When I first bought my house 6 years ago, I furnished it entirely myself. He has since bought 3 things of his own (coffee table, tread mill, and dresser in his room) otherwise it was all furnished by me, and he didn't pay half of it. I'm okay with this, given the situation he escaped. Other things, like a fence and shed in the backyard, he agreed to pay half - shed because he didn't feel like he had anything with the house, and fence because he wanted a place for his 2 dogs to run around. I built most of the shed, all of the fence, without his help. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bought a Kitchenaid mixer last fall, admittedly on a whim, and he immediately said he wasn't paying half of it as he'd \"never get use out of it\". Last night he said he wanted to get an attachment for it for making zucchini noodles, and I said that's fine - as long as he pays half. He got upset, insisted (while at the store at 10 pm) I tell him if I expected him to pay half of all other things he hasn't paid half on, like the washer/dryer I bought 6 years ago. I said no, just this, because it's not a household item and he insisted he would never use it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistory, we typically pay half for things we'll both use. I asked him about his moving out plans 6 months ago, and he said he doesn't foresee being able to move out for 2+ years as he finishes school, plus he can't afford to move out alone, doesn't want to/can't because of medical issues, doesn't trust moving in with a friend, and has 2 dogs + 1 cat and rentals don't like that many animals, especially apartments. He complained at the time that his rent was too high, so we agreed on a plan to lower it a little more to help him save to move out, but he's largely not done that, either. So he's not going anywhere, for a while, unless I formally evict him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I have also bought things that he's later used that he didn't pay half for.

POST : No matter how this ends, it's gonna be awkward because one of the friends is my college roommate. Also, this is my first post so here goes. I've been annoyed by how often my roommate rants about even the most slightly controversial things (she's always been doing this somewhat regularly but it's been daily since last week). For example, last night, my friends and I were watching a movie and there was a scene where a woman takes off her bra but her breasts weren't on-screen (the movie was rated PG-13) and she whined for a solid 5 minutes about how sexualized breasts are and that they should be revered as \"life-giving and sacred,\" then ended it with how bras are \"designed by men to oppose women/women should 'free their nipples.'\" She does this with other things she sees and reads about, and although she's entitled to her own opinion, I hate how out-of-the-blue and constant it is. Every time I try to counter her with an opposing opinion or become visibly irritated, everyone calls me rude. I just think they're overreacting. The fact that I'm never taken seriously since I don't talk and act like they do has bothered me since day one, but I kept my mouth shut about it since they're--apparently--good people. \nIt doesn't end here though because what really set me off was another one of my friends saying that everyone in Wisconsin is racist--and they all know that I was born and raised in Wisconsin. I then explained that from personal experience, that's not true, but they ignored me anyway. Overall, they claim to be accepting but treat me like I'm from another planet and aren't afraid to personally offend me when I'm right in front of them. I've been considering drifting away from them and making some other friends instead, yet I'm afraid to at the same time since I need to pick my roommate for sophomore year next month.

Other coworkers have complained about his comments such as \"hey hurry up, this chink ordered a burger\" or \"I'm tired of these people speaking mexican in here\" among other similarly racist comments. I've told him to stop countless times and he hasn't. He rants about how immigrants are ruining this country and asians and hispanics are stealing our jobs and look weird and so on. He usually keeps this rhetoric to the staff but a few times he's gotten into altercations with customers who've then complained to me. He almost got into a fight with a hispanic customer after saying wetbacks should be deported and sent back to mexico or something like that. I had to intervene to stop the fight from happening. I've usually settled these incidents  by giving them free drink and told dale to stfu or I'm firing him. At this point though i've told dale to stop or i would fire him but he hasn't. Yesterday he told an old vietnamese man that he should stop blocking the doorway or he'd pour some agent orange in his next cocktail instead of politely asking him to move.

He's obviously a very morally  bad person but if i fire him it'll screw over the other people who depend on him.

She apparently got a dwi when she was in her early 20s after her birthday dinner with friends. That she blew a .09 and was pulled over for going about 7-8 over the speed limit. She said she didn't have any jail time, it was just hours of community service, and she couldn't drive on the weekends for a year. She told me that it hasn't really affected her life since, that her car insurance was high but manageable for a few years and hasn't been mysteriously rejected from any job since.

We have a lot of the same hobbies (cycling, running, sketching, video games). We even recently signed up for a biathlon happening later in the Spring and we both started training for it over the past 2 weeks.

POST : Hey guys, so since November, my girlfriend and I were planning to go to somewhere for a 3-day weekend before school starts (Vegas, Lake Tahoe, LA). Shit had hit the fan because last semester I joined a business fraternity where I had became friends with many people. Beforehand, my girlfriend had occupied so much of my time, we'd talk 6-8 hours a day and had led me losing any of my close friends. When the semester started, I loss touch with her, I became more involved with my fraternity and shit had hit the fan because she became jealous of other girls that I was getting to know (not flirting or anything, but becoming friends with), so as the semester ended we tried fixing my issues of lack of communication and openness. \n\nCue the end of December and my fraternity announces a retreat to Tahoe, to potentially party, have very fun moments and really develop bonds with other people in the fraternity I haven't got to know. It is on the same date that my girlfriend and I had originally planned to go on vacation together, and I was torn in between these two events. For one thing, I had never had gone on such a trip with friends and for another thing it's from what I hear something people in my fraternity won't forget. So I am allured to that idea. I feel like going on a trip with my girlfriend is so expensive FWIW (Each of us are looking at $500 which is not really wise for both of us who are in college, in comparison to $55, but I can't bring her). I also feel like there may be fights and horrible experiences just because are relationship is just pulling itself back together. In fact, we just started planning this 2 days ago when it should have been 1 month ago minimum. \n\nDeep inside I just wanted to have fun on a trip that I may not be able to experience again, and I was hoping my girl can trust me, but she can't because I had deleted a text to another girl saying Happy thanksgiving\" when I told my gf I wouldn't reply back. It seems crazy and childish, but a lot of trust was lost because I was replying to other girls texts before her. I wasn't trying to get with any of these girls, it just feels so great being friends with people.

My best friend (let us call her Harley) and I met on our first year of highschool and we were very close, basically like sisters, ever since. In our class was this one guy (we'll call him Batman) that I had a huge crush on, but nothing ever happened since he was already dating someone back then, so the 3 of us were nothing more than really close friends.\n\nA year ago he broke up with his girlfriend, but I never could really figure out when it would be a good time to confess. However, Harley also had a crush on him as well, but at some point told me she got over it and doesn't like him that way anymore. Now it is 5 years after we met. We all celebrated new years together, as we always do, but since I was out of country for Christmas, I was only coming back on December 31st, and Harley &amp; Batman along with our other mutual friend went to do shopping for new year, like food and drinks we are gonna need. Apparently that is when things between them started happening. On new years Batman gave Harley a confession letter in which he asks if they could try to be together and see how it works out. She promptly took a picture of it and sent it to me telling me how she said yes. I was so hurt and broken. I told them both how much this hurt me and how I am gonna keep my distance away from them for a while until it settles a bit. Batman was understanding, but Harley kept asking me to come hang out with them like it was all fine and I started ghosting her. It has been 2 months now, and it still hurts. I can't open any social media without them popping up everywhere.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am happy for them, but what hurts is that my, basically sister, knowing I liked him, agreed to date him. If the tables were turned I could never do this to her knowing it would hurt her as much as it hurts me. My mentality is that I go by the \"bro code\" and if she really liked a guy I could never have anything even remotely flirty with him. She doesn't get that and keeps acting like things are all fine and the way they used to be before. She is very confused as to why I am upset with her and keeps pestering our other mutual friends to ask me why I am upset with her. And it pisses me off more that she keeps dragging in all our mutual friends into something that is supposed to be just between us.\n\nI am also starting to think she never loved me for me for ME. I feel she only loved the things I was providing her with, like my love and attention, my care for her and support I constantly gave her. And now that she is dating with him, she doesn't need me anymore. I could literally disappear and they would still be happy and not effected in any way. Am I in the wrong for feeling betrayed?

Josh started not caring about her feelings and ignoring her when May had depressive episode.\nMay told him that she went through a lot of shit and needed him to help her out, bc she wouldn't be able to go through this without anyone (she moved from his hometown, so she didn't had any friends there). And there is went shit went wild.\nJosh started saying that her depressive episodes wasn't his fault, and that was something she had to deal with. Josh told her that he was also in love with his ex, who died a year before they started, and talking a lot of shit about May. She didn't like that too much, but she was still in love with him.\nThis had gone for over 10 months, and they broke up and went together again like 9 times. So, as time went by, May realized that he was a dick, and started hitting back. She told John that he could go fuck his ex, that maybe his favourite movie was Corpse Bride, telling him to shut the fuck up when he started complaining about her crying bc of stress.\nAs today, they are still together, bc she isn't able to let him go, as she is still in love with him.\nAlso, it seems like Josh cheated on May, several times.

I obliged and we went out on a few dates. Fast forward to about a week ago, we had been dating for 3 months. I had grown to really care for her child and I was falling in love with her.

And this is when he snaps at me and loudly says, \"I feel like you're trying to control my life right now\" and other sentences about why he cant throw the trash away if its full. I tell him beacause his apartment is already mostly messy and dirty and throwing the trash away when we are leaving and I have a set time to leave wont make a difference. As I'm saying this without even raising my voice he loudly says, \"CALM DOWN\" four times at me and to stop talking.

Anyways later in the day its brought up again because I dont feel he should've snapped like that. The exact morning as I got to his place he rushed me in and was rude when I took two stops becase I have a broken toe and I took a second to allow him to unlock the door. I mentioned he can be just as rude sometimes and say rude remarks with attitude and I never escalate the sitaution or get loud or anything. I just ignore it and move on so I expect the same from him. He says that he NEVER wants any attitude at all directed towards him and if he ever gives me attitude again I should call him out on it instead of saying nothing. I feel thats impossible to never give even a little attitude when I dont see it as anything personal. I told him he should act the same way I do instead of always giving attitude back. So reddit am I the asshole thinking its impossible to never give attitude?

I told her that I didn't want to give it away for free and she said that I should.

They could still be useful\". No word of lie, hes gone fucking bonkers at me.. \"Stop talking to me as if I am stupid.

TL;DR is at the bottom, but honestly reading the entire post is kind of a requirement to truly understand what's happening. This is being typed and posted from mobile so formatting may be incorrect, I'll fix what I can.\n\n\n\nBackground: My Japanese grandfather recently passed away. I grew up in the US so I have no idea how anything works in Japan (this is important later). I recently decided to move to Japan in 2018 to be with my grandparents and work since they are old and don't have a lot of time left. My father is bilingual, English and Japanese. He was born and raised in Japan and moved to the US around 30 years old. I was born in Japan and lived there for 4 years before moving with my family to the US, I barely speak Japanese. I can ask basic questions and understand basic responses.\n\n\n\nI don't like my biological father, that's why I call him my biological father. He didn't raise me, there is no emotional connection. He had custody of my brother and I during the summer time when we were kids. He would force us to do Kumon (Japanese after school homework program) during his time with him. He was verbally abusive and some times would get slap happy when we didn't do something right. Nothing that left bruises or anything. After middle school I cut off all contact because I could. He never made an effort to reach out to me either. That was fine, I enjoyed not having to deal with his bullshit.\n\n\n\nRecently we've been talking more only because I've chosen to live in Japan with \"his\" family. He likes to refer to our family as \"My father...\" or \"My mother...\" instead of \"Your grandpa...\" or \"Grandma wants you to...\" so it seems like he's not including me in the family, but I just write that off as not being 100% fluent in English nuance and natural phrasing.\n\n\n\nThere's been a lot of paperwork recently with my grandfather, his money, plans for the funeral, etc. It's a big deal as all events like this are and a lot of preparation has to be done.\n\n\n\nAnyway, on to the main story:\n\n\n\nMy grandfather (his father) passed away last week. We had a funeral service tonight (5pm Japan Standard Time) and it went well, only two hours and it was mostly close family with some neighbors. After the service we went back to my grandmother's house and relax. As I've said before, I'm not familiar with all the customs and rituals. Considering my father can speak both English and Japanese and has knowledge about the customs and rituals, I figure now would be a great time to ask him since neither of us are busy.\n\n\n\nNow, in my experience, it's usually a great time to ask questions or talk about something when people are aren't busy. My father claims the exact opposite.\n\n\n\nI asked him about the schedule for tomorrow and what I should prepare for. He vaguely tells me about what will happen, \n\n\n\n* Wake up at 8\n* Start of the ceremony at 10\n* Cremation at 12\n* More ceremony later\n* Finish\n\n\n\nThis doesn't really answer my questions, so I ask about the specifics, \"Will it be like tonight?\" - \"How many people will be there?\" - \"Will the same monk come and do more chanting?\" - \"Will I have to stand up and do anything?\"\n\n\n\nHis response was: \"DerpHard, why don't you look it up on the internet?\"\n\n\n\nAt first I was dumbfounded, but then I remembered the kind of person he was. Still I pressed on to make an effort to get him to talk to me. To make this easier, I'll be turning this into a dialogue, M is me, D is dad.\n\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\n\nM: Why can't you just tell me?\n\n\n\nD: everything you need to know is on the internet.\n\n\n\nM: Yes, but as your son, you should teach me about family rituals, because you know, that's your job.\n\n\n\nD: Why? It's much easier if you just read it on the internet.\n\n\n\nM: I agree with you, but you are my father and I'd like to create a bonding experience.\n\n\n\nD: DerpHard, I'm relaxing right now, you had the past 4 days to ask me about these questions but you didn't.\n\n\n\nM: the past 4 days you've been busy making funeral arrangements, talking to relatives, figuring out finances, making sure everything is in order. Why would I bother you during all of that to ask you questions about the funeral?\n\n\n\nD: You know what? The best time to ask me is when I'm busy. My brain is in the right state at that moment, I'm already thinking about those things so you should ask me then. You need to learn to not bother people when they are relaxing and ask questions when they are busy.\n\n\n\nM: *scoff* that doesn't make any sense. Why would I bother someone when they are busy talking to other people and writing down information?\n\n\n\nD: That's how people do it, it's a fact.\n\n\n\nM: no, that's not a fact, I've never heard that in my life. I was always taught in every life situation not to bother someone when they are busy. Of course there's situations at work when you need to ask for directions or how to do something, but asking for **knowledge** about something is usually done when no one is busy.\n\n\n\nD: That's your opinion.\n\n\n\nM: yeah that is my opinion, but what you said is also an opinion and not a fact.\n\n\n\nD: no, it's a fact, everyone knows that.\n\n\n\nM: so you want me to ask you questions in the middle of being busy?\n\n\n\nD: yes, that's what you are supposed to do.\n\n\n\nM: Okay, I'll remember that.\n\n\n\nD: I don't know how you grew up with your mom, but maybe you need to find new friends because you don't know how the world works.\n\n\n\nM: what does any of this have to do with my friends?\n\n\n\nD: They're the people you talk to. Maybe they are asking questions when you are relaxing and that's why you don't know anything.\n\n\n\nM: That doesn't make any sense at all. My friends and the people I talk to are completely irrelevant to this conversation and have nothing to do with asking someone a question when they are relaxing. \n\n\n\nD: It does. These are the people who taught you how to ask questions and now you don't even know when to ask questions.\n\n\n\nM: You know what, forget it. I'll figure it out by myself.\n\n\n\nD: you can laugh and think what you want, but I'm just trying to teach you when to ask questions.\n\n\n\nM: You could've taken this time to teach me about the funeral ceremony happening tomorrow, but instead you decided to \"teach\" me when to ask a question.\n\n\n\nD: I answered your question, you asked me about the ceremony and I told you to find out on the internet.\n\n\n\nM: I don't want to use the internet, I've used the internet my whole life because no one answered my questions. Now that we're sitting here and literally nothing is happening right now, I want you to answer a couple questions about the ceremony. Why can't you just answer the questions?\n\n\n\nD: I'm relaxing right now, you don't ask people questions when they're relaxing.\n\n\n\nM: Alright, nevermind. Forget I ever asked anything.\n\n\n\nD: I'm just-\n\n\n\nM: No no, don't worry about it, you're relaxing right now, I don't want to bother you. It's fine.\n\n\n\nD: Everything you want to know is on the internet. Just look it up yourself.\n\n\n\nM: yep that's what I'm doing right now, thank you for your great advice.\n\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n\n\nNow, **AM I THE ASSHOLE** for bothering my own father while he was relaxing and asking questions about the family funeral? Should I have handled that differently? Personally I don't think I'm an asshole, but that's why I'm posting here. I want your opinion.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I ask my biological father about family customs and ceremony rituals and admitting this would be a bonding experience for us, he tells me to look on the internet instead of bothering him while he's relaxing. He proceeds to lecture me about the right time to ask questions instead of teaching me about the family rituals.

I normally help her organize her things, she\u2019s is a MAJOR hoarder of paper and antique furniture. She asked me if I would put a storage unit in my name for 30 days (30 days only cost $1, after that the price is $240 per month). She had been given a notice to remove refuse (old furniture) from the property that she\u2019s renting or face eviction. I agreed. I added her as an authorized user for the unit. She payed me $20 for this favor. Well September was coming to a close and it was time for her to move her things out of the storage unit. September 26th she tells me that she needs me to be available September 29th to help with the storage removal and closing the account. I told her that I was unavailable to be present that day which was a Saturday. So, she said she would start it Saturday and finish it Sunday (30th) then I could close the account. I agreed. Well Friday the 28th she tells me that she has to drive a truck across country from California to New Jersey, so her daughter would be doing the moving for her. I just needed to close the account after the daughter was done moving. Sunday the 30th rolls around and I don\u2019t hear from her. She never gave me her daughter\u2019s number so I waited to hear from the lady or her daughter. She calls me at 6:11 pm on a 3 way call with her daughter. She asks me if I had called the storage company to let them know she would be moving out. Mind you, she\u2019s an authorized user and she could\u2019ve done this herself. I told her that I spoke to them earlier in the week but not over the weekend, but I had just arrived at my in laws house 85 miles from home and I couldn\u2019t talk long, as we had a family emergency. She tells me that she has an emergency as well. LADY SAYS: \u201cYou were supposed to be available to close the account out today. I took the key with me so daughter couldn\u2019t get into the unit and you are the only one that they will cut the lock for. You need to call them so that I don\u2019t get charged.\u201d \n\nSo, I said I would call back when I could talk. She sends me her daughter\u2019s phone number so that I can coordinate with her (too little too late IMO). At the time that she called, the storage place was closed, it closed at 5 pm because it was Sunday. When I spoke to her daughter, the daughter admitted that she forgot about having to move out of the unit Sunday around 3 and when she got to the storage place she realized that she didn\u2019t have a key. So we made a plan to try and keep from being charged the $240. I already knew it was I vain, but I humored her. She has blamed me the entire month because she cannot afford $240 for a storage unit. Well, she kept the unit for an ADDITIONAL 30 days. I told her last week that she would need to close out the account after she moved out. I cannot be there to do so, and since she is on the account, I do not need to be. She finally paid the past due balance on October 30th. She asked me several times when she needed to be out of the unit. I told her every specific detail. \n\n\u201cTHE FINAL DAY TO MOVE AND MAKE A PAYMENT IS OCTOBER 31st. YOU MUST WALK INTO THE OFFICE WITHIN THE BUILDING TO CLOSE OUT THE ACCOUNT AT LEAST 15 MINUTES BEFORE THEY CLOSE. IF YOU DO NOT CLOSE OUT THE ACCOUNT, YOU WILL BE BILLED FOR ANOTHER MONTH. I DO NOT NEED TO BE PRESENT FOR YOU TO CLOSE THE ACCOUNT. YOU NEED TO DO IT.\u201d\n\nShe got a major attitude and told me that I was full of excuses as to why I couldn\u2019t be present. She also informed me today that she was on the road again delivering a truck somewhere and that she would TRY to make it back before they closed. I am beyond infuriated. I checked the online account and it has not been closed out, which means she probably didn\u2019t make it back in time to move her things out. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t pay the $240 that\u2019s now due November 1st, AITA if I have the storage company break the lock so that I can change it? If I am going to be stuck with a bill, I am going to try to sell whatever may still be there. I don\u2019t think the storage company will restrict access because the current bill isn\u2019t past due yet. I am afraid that she is going to take her stuff and ditch this second bill. She blames me for the account being open when I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HER FAILURE TO MOVE!!\n\nANY other advice in this situation would be very helpful as well.

He ended up telling her what happened and she basically said that I was acting crazy and that he\u2019s his own person and he can do what he wants but I feel like driving under the influence is not an okay thing to do.\nMy other reason is he\u2019s lied to me about being with her before. This was the weekend before my birthday and he was out shopping. He was being vague and kind of secretive but I chalked it up to it being about my birthday. Eventually I get a text from one of my friends saying that she had seen my so with his friend. When he came to my house I asked him about it and he reacted in a defensive angry way, even saying I had sent my friend to spy on him.\nWhenever I try to talk to him about how I\u2019m feeling he always gets defensive about her and says I don\u2019t have reason to not like her.

I\u2019m a college student going to a primarily liberal college and I\u2019ve learned a lot about the many hardships that African Americans had to suffer through.\n\nI work a part time job at a drug store (Don\u2019t want to give too many details on where I work). My main duties are to stock shelves, keep an eye out for shoplifters, help customers and occasionally work the register. I\u2019ve been working at this establishment for a little over a year and a half I\u2019ve noticed a pattern\u2026 I\u2019ve noticed that a STRONG 90% of the shoplifters that come to the store are African American. About twice a day a grown African American man or woman (mostly women) come to the store and shop lift. At first, I thought I just be a coincidence, but it keeps on happening! Our shoppers are roughly 30ish percent black 50ish percent white and 20ish percent other races if I made a guess. I am aware of selective attention bias and when I first started noticing a pattern I always tried my best to make sure that I\u2019m paying equal attention to everyone, but it\u2019s gotten to the point where the only people that I have noticed shoplifting are African Americans and Kids. I\u2019m not one of those people who thinks they steal \u201cBeCauSE iTs iN tHeRE dNa\u201d I understand that the mostly likely explanation is the population density of low-income houses/apartments in the vicinity of the store. Because of this, whenever an African American comes into the store I take their race into account when considering if I need to keep an eye out on them. This isn\u2019t the only basis I would use, for example, Shoplifters often LOOK/ACT suspicious, there always staring at me and my coworkers and pace back in forth in one spot. (The point I\u2019m trying to make is that I don\u2019t SOLEY base it one race.)\n\nSide Note- I would NEVER accuse someone of shoplifting unless I was 1000% sure that they are. I am WAY to socially awkward to blindly accuse people. Its one of my nightmares to accuse someone who isn\u2019t shoplifting of shoplifting, I would look like such a dumbass. Additionally, when I\u2019m suspecting someone, I don\u2019t make it obvious I\u2019m observing them. I believe everyone should feel comfortable when shopping and not feel like they are being watched. I use the mirrors we have on the ceiling and try to only observe without their knowledge. (cuz they usually shoplift when they think they aren\u2019t being watched, and if they don\u2019t shoplift I don\u2019t want them to feel targeted.) Also---- EVERY SINGLE TIME I confront someone who I am 100% CERTAIN is stealing (1. I saw them take something and store it in a suspicious place. 2. They try to leave without paying it.)

Yes, this would be a great opportunity for them to get to meet my coworkers, but it's also a trip with a limited number of spots.

My spouse struggles to sleep at night due to their tinnitus. They often sit in the kitchen with the faucet running in order to fall asleep.

When he asked me out, I said yes because I had a crush on him then. We dated throughout the summer even though we were about 4 hours apart (He went home for the summer). At the end of summer, he asked me to be his girlfriend which again was an yes from me. \n\nBut at some point, the relationship started to fade on my side. It was my first real relationship so I was mostly confused and I thought it would pass. It didn't and I started to close off more and more. \n\nI still stayed with him, trying desperately to see if I could maybe fall in love with him. Eventually I realised that the warm summer crush feeling I had was gone and it wasn't going to come back.

We agreed to meet up to play some tabletop games (an interest he got me into) and I made up my mind then that I would break up after the game. We met up and he kept telling me about the plans he had for Christmas. It was getting painful and I just decided to pull off the bandage. I got him away from his friends and broke up with him.\n\nHe wasn't surprised because he said he could tell when a girl was having second thoughts. I felt so guilty and apologized for putting him through this. Then he asked me, \"Why didn't you take the out when I gave it to you?\" That made me a little upset because at that point I still had feelings for him and I was trying to push forward with my slow pace in the relationship. I didn't say anything about it though and just apologized again for hurting him like this.\n\nAt the end of the day, he asked me more uncomfortable questions about our relationship with questions I didn't have answers for.

She was great, super sweet, and most importantly she was ok with me being a cripple in a wheelchair. I asked her out almost immediately, so I wouldn\u2019t have to fret about that very long. She said yes, but she didn\u2019t have a day off work for two weeks and we talked until then. It got pretty serious, we talked about everything. Here\u2019s where it started to fall apart. I\u2019m a serial introvert, so I thrive being alone and not taking to people, and after a certain point everything that\u2019s worth talking about gets talked about, and your just talking for the sake of talking. Like I really don\u2019t care about your favorite zoo animal, and I know that makes me an asshole, but I\u2019m sorry I would rather play video games. Then I came to the realization that maybe I\u2019m not supposed to be in a relationship at all, and that I was only seeking one because I thought that was what people did to get happiness. What makes it even worse is that she kept saying how great of a guy I was, and how easily hurt she was. She kept saying she wasn\u2019t bothered by my introvertedness, but I think she really was. After I had this epiphany I felt really bad it was a little less than a week before the date, and I\u2019ve never been on a date and I really wanted to have that experience and to see if my mind changed. So I lead her on, and for that I am truly an asshole, but then Karma struck and she got sick the day of, turns out she had been sick the whole week and didn\u2019t tell me because she wanted to go on the date. The next day I did the right thing and broke it off. I went about it ok I would say, I do regret a couple things I said, I think I led her to believe I led her on for longer than I did, and that letting me be my introvert self had something to do with it, so that was sucky of me, but at that point it was too late, her heart was already on the mend and I didn\u2019t want to make it worse by going back and apologizing, I wanted to give her time and space to heal. My biggest regret though is that it took her getting heartbroken to make me realize that I\u2019m not supposed to be in a relationship, and I really want her to know that I\u2019m sorry for that. Like I said this was a little over a month ago, so what should I do? Is my epiphany correct? Should i wait longer? Should I have said something sooner? Should I never contact her again? Should I have toughed it out and gone on the date? \n\n", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

When we first got together and he found out I cant orgasm vaginally he started bragging about how many orgasms other women have had through him vaginally(immature I know...we are both in our late 30s so that was an ew moment for me). He's referred to me as an alien, abnormal, and being broken sexually. We've tried toys and whatnot to get me to cum vaginally but it just doesnt work so he usually just goes down on me to get me off.\n\nI don't need to get off everytime we have sex and Ive told him I dont expect him to get me off everytime, most of the time Im perfectly satisfied with just a good pounding, but it really bothers him to the point of he gets irritated at me that I cant cum through intercourse and then I feel like there's some thing wrong with me. This has turned sex into something somewhat stressful and makes it take longer than normal for me to cum when he goes down on me because the whole time Im feeling self conscious. I feel like if I cant get to orgasm quickly then I've failed at sex and making him happy.\n\n3 weeks ago I started taking anti depressants, and a side effect is inability to orgasm or taking much longer to get there than normal. I told him this but he's getting even more irritated now because he wants me to cum within minutes when he goes down. \n\nThe last two times he went down on me it felt great as usual but I just didnt feel any of the usual build up to climax and I knew if I told him I didnt think I was going to cum because of the meds he would say something assholish about me being broken again, so I decided to fake it both times. He was happy that he \"made me cum\" and asked for the usual accolades and I avoided the awkwardness and irritation from him afterwards.

To start off, I work at a local pet food store. We pride ourselves on having high quality foods at good prices that help pets live good lives. Since I'm an employee, I'm entitled to a very generous discount towards food items. \n\nWhen our family bought a kitten in September, I tried to explain why I thought it would be better for me to buy healthier food for it. It was agreed upon by everyone in the house that I would buy food for the cat. Some time in early December, my dad and stepmother took a 2 week long trip and I was in charge of taking care of the cat. During this time, I fed the cat mainly one brand of food from the store, just getting different flavors for variety sake.\n\nHere is where the problem started. I noticed my stepmother had started feeding the cat Purina, and I brought it up with her. She said that the cat was refusing to eat the food I was bringing home,  which I thought was weird because he seemed to like it when I served it to him. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be confrontational and start an argument, but I got her to agree to let me try out different brands so we wouldn't have to get lower quality foods like Fancy Feast. All was well for a while.\n\nOnly now, without telling me at all, she has gone back to getting the Purina. I only knew because I happened to see it in the storage closet next to the litterbox. I can get much better food for the same price, and I pay for it because it's much simpler that way. I want to look out for the health of our cat, and I don't understand why she is taking it into her own hands to feed him with what I view is crap.

We called my sister about it and she said that she\u2019d talk to someone about taking her name off the list or something so we wouldn\u2019t have to wait. Well eventually we got in because a very generous person gave us one of his tickets and so we went in and she didn\u2019t get called. So this led to my parents believing that she didn\u2019t graduate, even though a few months later, she received her degree in the mail. They still don\u2019t believe her to this day. \n\nMy sister got heavily involved in drugs after she graduated and moved back home. Cigarettes and heroin every single day. My mom wanted to send her to rehab but she refused and claimed that she wasn\u2019t on anything. This led to fighting everyday. Through the stress of my junior and senior years of high school, I couldn\u2019t take it and only applied to schools over a few hundred miles away, even though my parents wanted me to stay close. \n\nAfter I moved out, I gradually stopped the constant contact with my family. We now only call about 1-2 times per week. \n\nMy mom is very stubborn and manipulative, yet sensitive. If you even raise your voice at her, she\u2019ll cry and claim that she\u2019s going to die because of you. If something doesn\u2019t go her way, she\u2019ll just stop talking to you. She believes money is everything and will yell at you for spending your own money. \nMy sister has anger issues. Yells at everyone and everything, even my parents. Thinks she knows everything. Can be very condescending. I still don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s completely drug free or not. \nThe only person I can really rely on is my dad. I miss him everyday. He is my definite number one and sometimes the only reason I want to come home. \n\nI definitely have plans of staying where I am after I graduate college, but my family will not understand. I am grateful for everything they have done for me, but I just can\u2019t stand having to be in the same room as all of them for even just a day. After all I\u2019ve gone through, am I really the asshole for wanting to stay away?\n\nTLDR; I think being around my family is toxic for my mental and emotional wellbeing so I moved away for college and I plan on staying away after I graduate.

POST : Hello, first time poster here.\n\nSome context: I \\[21F\\] made a friend \\[23M\\] via Tinder during my travels, never met up; however, because of the distance we never really started anything or move beyond flirting and sexual talking in the beginning. He used to tell me all of the time how in love with one of his close friends he was and we have since remained very good friends who are into separate people. \n\nRecently, said friend has gone back to being very flirtatious and sexual with me (approx. a year later). For example, he likes to ask me for photos and/or ask if I want him to send me any photos. He also makes frequent allusions to our old sexual conversations and expands on them. After telling him that I would prefer it if the sexual conversation stopped and that it's not something I wish to engage with with him any longer, he acknowledged it and apologized soon after so I thought it was sufficiently over. Cue him once again making sexual comments and sending photos that are less-than-ideal. I got a little bit more aggressive with him by this point, telling him very explicitly how uncomfortable his advancements were making me and that I wanted them to stop. Again, he got very sad about upsetting me and promised it would stop.\n\nCue today. He decides to take it upon himself to tell me all of the details about a sex dream he had about the two of us, framing it as something silly and weird that I would like to be told. To which I responded very minutely and have been distancing myself since. \n\nI understand that because we used to talk in a particular way, he might think it is still okay all this time later. However, after expressing how uncomfortable it makes me, I would like to be able to expect a little bit of respect towards my feelings from someone I consider a great friend. I honestly don't think he is malicious at the end of the day, but he really isn't making any honest attempts to stop this behaviour.

We both started out poor, but now I have $20,000 saved up in my bank and he still struggles to survive (we don't live together or share bills). When we got together when I was 15 (he was 19) from poor backgrounds and dreamed about getting rich and spending our lives together. He didn't work for that time period because of a disability but also because he's somewhat lazy, he used to try a lot in the beginning to get jobs but nothing ever came from them so he just stopped with time and stayed on welfare. \n\nRight now I'm 20 and he's 24. I'm in my second year of med school and have had a lot of well paid experience, scholarships and bursaries that I've saved money (as I still live with parents) and I will finish school with an excess of $20,000 in my bank, While I wouldn't call this 'rich' as he does it is still a nice financial position to be in. Meanwhile he tried to get back into education for a few years and failed, but last year it seemed like he had his shit together and got top marks and was admitted into college too on an Architecture BS.\n\nAs far as his personality goes he's pretty mature so now he just focuses on his work, but as far as his finances go he's still struggling to survive from bill to bill. He wastes a lot of money on ordering food and cigarettes, while I live a very modest life trying not to spend anything; although, he does still spend what spare money he has on me for presents and gestures but again I tell him that's a waste of money and he shouldn't do that. \n\nSo, when we go out for meals or we do activities together he says I should pay, that we should be a team and help each other out financially, essentially he says MY money should be 'our' money. He says this because we were poor together, and over time the dynamic changed slightly as I acquired more money and he did not. He wants us to act as a married couple and we DO plan to get married at some point in the future, but I don't think that justifies sharing my money with him right now.  \n\n\nI know the career path he's taking means he'll have a good income in the future, and at that point we may possibly share our income to pay the bills of the household, and I even mean to become a housewife at some point and live off of his wage while looking after our future children.

POST : On mobile so apologies for formatting.\n\nBackground information: Years ago when I was working my first job as a teenager, I worked at a popular breakfast/lunch in my family\u2019s well-to-do neighbourhood. We had a 25-30ish regular who would order a meal (not cheap) and ask for our recycling. I was told that he was brain-damaged ex-military and that his parents (who lived a short bus ride) housed him, clothed him and covered his food bills but he collected recycling for pocket money. \n\nAnyways, he would come in every other day, hit on all the female staff, explain to male staff that he wasn\u2019t gay (almost every time) and then relentlessly go after our baker. He would ask her out, ask to kiss her, ask to have sex with her, ask to have dinner at her house, ask her and her husband to take him out for dinner. She was actually quite friendly to him but obviously didn\u2019t take him seriously, and kindly excused her way out. I found out later that he had actually successfully invited himself to her wedding, had been over to her house for dinner multiple times (with husband present), and had attempted to three wheel her honeymoon.\n\nShe eventually told me (in parts overtime) that because of his condition, we had to be more sympathetic and kinder to him than the average customer:person, and that essentially it was the brain damage that made him act that way. Fortunately I never had to deal with him much while working since he always wanted her, the head baker, to take his order personally (not her job) and she did it because we have to \u201cthink of his condition\u201d. When I told my parents about this, they agreed with the baker and I didn\u2019t (and still don\u2019t really) know the effects of brain damage so I left it like that.\n\nNext to the assholery: Even though I didn\u2019t really deal with him much at work, we used the same bus stop (and occasionally same bus). He used to recognize me from work and beeline it for me, be overly friendly (he assumed we were really good friends since I smiled and asked him how he was when I was working), asked to sit next to me on the bus and sat down before I could respond (I let him because he was and customer at my work and I was a stupid teenager with severe social anxiety), or sit super close to me at the bus stop when the whole bench was empty. Mind you I was a minor at this time.\n\nAs the years passed (and I was no longer working at my first job), I would still run into him at the bus stop and he would hit one and ask me out. I would turn him down absolutely but kindly, keeping in mind his \u201ccondition\u201d. It never even gave him pause, he kept on trying. I want to remind readers that I have really bad social anxiety that makes me dread any interaction with strangers etc and even most acquaintances. This was truly awful for me.\n\nEventually I go travelling, work in various places, take some classes across the country and then come home, live with my parents and start finishing up my degree at a local university. And sure enough, he\u2019s still here, still taking the same bus and still trying to talk to me. I don\u2019t think he recognized me but I still feel singled out: I\u2019m an awkward polte-looking young girl who might seem like an easy target.\n\nThe first time he comes up to me and starts talking to me, I take off my headphones (which I always wear since I hate talking to people), tell him \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t like talking to people,\u201d and put my headphones back on. He just stares at me silently, still standing uncomfortable close to me, until I walk away. This repeats a couple times until I start pretending I don\u2019t hear him and wander aimlessly away. I have tried hiding from him, it doesn\u2019t work; the guy has a spidey sense for young girls (I have seen him act like this towards other girls). Tonight when he bothered me I just looked at him and walked to the other side of the bus stop, he tried to follow me so I walked behind it and waited there, keeping an eye on him until his bus came. The next time I see him I might just tell him to fuck off, despite my damn social anxiety.\n\nAm I asshole? Most of my friends and family think so. They\u2019ve told me to be more patient and considerate of his \u201ccondition\u201d. But they don\u2019t have to deal with his relentlessness. He\u2019s never been physical and comes off as cheery/friendly but he seems to have no sense of object permanence or concept that no means no, not ever and not just no for this specific thing for the next five minutes. I guess it\u2019s possible that his injury affects his memory (even though he remembered me for years after I quit my first job. But I still don\u2019t feel like I should have to deal with this on basically a weekly basis.\n\nI feel like no one has ever told him no seriously and then held him accountable when he tries again.

POST : AITA?\n\nSorry for the length...thank you for reading. \n\nA little back story: I have been seeing my boyfriend for going on 3 years and we have a beautiful son. The first time I \u2018met\u2019 her she made it clear to ignore and avoid me before I was finally introduced to her formally. (We were all casually hanging at a bar she says hi to everyone but skips over me) she pulls him away and continues to ignore me. No big deal. No harm no foul. I didnt even know that was his good friend until after, but I figured she should know I was the person he was seeing and would say hello. Even if I was a newcomer people typically say hello to new people. \n\nThroughout our relationship she never really makes an effort to get to know me. She only ever wants to hang out with him at the bar and prefers if it is just him. \n\nA few times we have all been hanging out with friends she always manages to pull him away from the group to have these close conversations in which she is very touchy with him. Her close girlfriends have told me that she does that to make sure she is the closest to him. They warned me that she would do this to me as well. 4 of her own close friends have said to me something of a similar nature.  I was sure of myself and don\u2019t feel threatened by her in any capacity. She is not a stunning looker and she lives with her mom still. I have never even felt the need to ask my boyfriend if their relationship was ever anything more. \n\nAs time progresses there are instances of her just... what I am assuming is... trying to put me in my place. She posted a picture of herself kissing my boyfriend on the cheek on her Instagram story. I was pissed. Thats blatantly disrespectful in my eyes. They explained it away and said it was no big deal. Another night we were out, she borrows his jacket to wear because she forgot hers. She is a bigger girl and instead of asking another one of the single guys who are her size she asks my boyfriend who is smaller than she is.  I feel insane being upset at this but the demeanor and history makes me look at it in a shady kind of way.  Yet another night him and I are standing by the dance floor waiting for a good song, holding hands. She comes up behind us and physically breaks our hands apart so that she can run to the dance floor too. And nearly any time we are out she becomes too touchy with him. Not the normal hugs and such. But talking to him like a girlfriend would. Leaning into him holding on to his chest or shirt. Another time she showed up on his guys trip with his best friend (a trip that I obviously cant go on) and posted a ton of pics of her with my BF. \n\nIt has just been a series of small petty shit that sneakily insinuates her disrespect for me and my relationship with him. I have told my bf that I feel I should talk to her woman to woman but he knows her better and says its not necessary. \n\nI know many opinions are going to focus on my boyfriends role in this and I agree. It has been a point of contention that he just doesn\u2019t see or want to acknowledge that he needs to give it to her straight. Tell her to cut the shit. I don\u2019t believe their friendship will change if she just cuts the shit. Given these things it is difficult to really start a friendship with her. I\u2019m not into the competition thing...\n\nFor a point of reference I get along with all of his other female friends and have become close with some of them. My boyfriend does NOT reciprocate her actions and is not touchy feely with her at all. \n\nBack to the present:\nWe are out for a friends Birthday. She shows late and gives me a half hearted wave after hugs to everyone. Whatever I couldn\u2019t care less. She means nothing in my life. But the rest of the night she pulls my boyfriend away. I cannot even dance or hang out with him unless I go track them down and interrupt them. No exaggeration. Again I blame him as well. We didn\u2019t come have him disappear most of the night with her. The first few times I go up friendly and ask him to dance. She looks annoyed and glares at me and continues to keep talking to him. He seems torn but comes with me anyways. He doesn\u2019t want to be in that uncomfortable situation and it\u2019s understandable. She had made mention in front of me using their friendship as something unbreakable. I feel that she holds their long history over our relationship and he buys into it being that \u201crelationships can come and go, but friends are forever\u201d...\n\nThe final straw of the same night was when we leave to a new bar and she pulls him away once again to the bar and they are together the entire time we are there. People are asking me where he is and I don\u2019t know until I have to track them down in the crowd or at a bar. I pulled him aside to mention wth was going on and he said he was here with me. Ok cool he sees it. A few minutes later we are socializing and doing whatever you do at the bar and I see them again together at the bar getting a drink. No big deal. It turns into 10 minutes then 20.... she is leaning on him and grabs his head a plants a kiss on his cheek. That pushes my boundary and have had enough of her shady actions that night. I go to them and ask what the hell is going on and what is so important that they are chatting the whole night. (Just her talking about some drama with herself, she is always in the middle of some drama) We (her and I) start yelling at one another and the bouncers say they are going to ask us to leave if we don\u2019t stop. She asks what my problem with her is and I attempt to tell her. She over talks me saying how much she tries with me and how much respect she has had for me. I suggest we talk about all this outside. We go outside and once we are away from the group and my boyfriend, her whole attitude changes. She doesn\u2019t even try to hear anything I want to explain (I was heated but calm enough to not get out of control). She goes for low blows and begins bringing up rough patches in my relationship that I thought were private. She says he tells her everything and asks \u201c you think he really loves you... no\u201d and \u201cI love when you are threatened by me. I makes me feel so good\u201d. I can\u2019t keep talking to this chick. And leave with my BF. He was on my side but not fully. He kept trying to tell me to give her a chance. He said he won\u2019t choose and I would never ask him to. \n\nI had no intentions to start anything on a night we were celebrating someone\u2019s birthday.  \n\nAm I missing some perspective here? I feel that is is difficult to explain these vibes that I get from her and because no one is in my shoes they think I am over-reacting. \n\nAm I the asshole for not \u201cgiving this person a chance\u201d in the first place, letting it get to a boiling point and losing it with her?\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Firstly, what a wild Reddit ride it has been the last day. I have tried to read and respond as much as I can. Being that his career involves working 24 hour shifts we have had 3 days of \u201cspace\u201d....I still need more and have planned to stay else where for a while. \n \nYour comments have put my feelings into words and I feel somewhat clearer in that aspect. \n\nI don\u2019t know how or what will be the next step here but I know it won\u2019t be easy. \n\nThank you all. \n\n\nUPDATE 2: the turmoil has gotten worse and we are looking at an extended \u201cbreak\u201d. I need to get back to putting myself first so that I can be a strong mother and woman. He needs to figure out if he can prioritize our relationship and family or if it will continue to be himself and his friends that are always first. I am seeking a family therapist to give us guidance during this break because honestly we have both dug this hole that we have found ourselves in and if we think that just time and space will fix anything. We are being idiots. Even if the relationship doesn\u2019t continue we will need to coparent. And at this point if he disrespected me in our relationship I expect that it may be the same in our coparenting relationship. And that leaves us in an even shittier position because I will feel helpless in times that he has my son and I cannot rely on him to parent in a way that is respectful to whatever wishes I have. Even with counseling, it is ultimately up to him to want to accept the reality of what it takes to have a family together with me or not.

I rarely spend time at home, I work and i go out and really am only here mostly to sleep, shower, and on the weekends when I spend mornings with them. \n\nMy stepbrother is a teacher so he's gonna from like 7am-5pm and my sister stays at home with the baby. \n\nBefore they moved in, our house was pretty clean. My brother is 15 and he's at school all day and when he's not, he's in his room. My stepdad and Mom work all day so since the house is almost always empty everything was always tidy. \n\nEver since they moved in it's been much, much messier. They cook often and don't wash the dishes right away, the share my bathroom with me and now we only have one bathroom because my sister fell in the other tub and broke it with her knee so they have to get it fixed. \n\nI have cleaned the bathroom/bathtub the last 3 times they've needed to be cleaned mostly because I feel gross in it knowing no one else has cleaned it. I rarely wash dishes unless I use then since I don't cook and am hardly home. \n\nToday is my 1 day off from work, I worked the last 6 days straight and I was looking forward to literally just vegging out in my bed. My mom called me to ask if he could put away/wash the dishes and clean the bathroom. I'm really annoyed because the dishes are not mine and I've cleaned the bathroom every time it's needed to be cleaned since they moved in. \n\nI'm going to do it regardless bc it's gross but my mom knows I complain about it and she says I need to help because I also live here and this house isn't a hotel. I understand that but I also don't feel like it's my responsibility to clean after them :/ I don't mind cleaning especially the bathroom but it's just so annoying that I'm expected to do it. I'd feel much better about it if it was asked of me as a favor rather than being expected of me. \n\nSo am I the asshole for being annoyed? I get they have a brand new baby but the difference from how clean our house used to be to how it is now is astounding. It's frustrating to be in a house so messy which is another reason why I'm not around often. \n\nI guess I'd just like to know if I'm being a dick for being upset with them even though they have a new baby.

I ask said friend if she wanted to get some food. She agrees and offers to drive. Couple other friends want to join the order so they decide to come too. Before we leave, something comes up and I have to stay behind so I just tell my friend what i wanted to get and offer to pay her back. I should also mention that she wanted one of the items that I told her to get. \n\nSo they leave, I attended to my situation, and they come back 30 mins later.\n\nShe hands me the food and says \" they ran out of the item we both wanted, they had one left and I kept it for myself.\"  I get it and since she drove I thought it was reasonable. Then she says that instead she got me something similar that I didn't ask for. okay, I guess better than nothing. Then I check the other items and I find out that everything I ordered, a total of 4 items, NONE of them was what I ordered. She said they ran out of most things and so she just got me things I didn't ask for or need because she thought I would want it. \n\nI asked her why she didn't  text me and she said that I never reply or take to long.

On top of this, when I asked for a recpit she kept saying she knew the amount I owed her and that a receipt wouldnt change that.  w.t.f. \n\nSo we argued for a bit, and then she said if I didn't pay for the food she would take it back, so I  let the food go and she straight up takes it, and asks our friend group (who btw were all listening into this argument) if anyone wanted my food for FREE( I feel like this was a power move and was meant to make me feel like shit). I got so mad. So I tried to stay calm, packed my shit and left. the whole situation pissed me off. I usually get mad and react with anger but I've recently been working on personal development and this reaction is not common for me so everyone was a bit shocked. the aftermath, i haven't seen or talked to anyone in that friend group and I'm starting to think I'm at fault, should I stand my ground, or AITA and i should apologize. \n\n\nAlso, a side not, later that night the same friend offered to drive me to McD's but I declined because of how shitty she handled the situation.

POST : First off sorry for any incorrect formatting, I\u2019m on mobile and don\u2019t wanna wait till I get home. About 3 weeks ago my relationship started becoming very rocky because my girlfriend, or ex girlfriend now, told me she wanted to move back to her home town because she missed her family. We\u2019ve been together for 2 years now and she\u2019s been around my 3 year old for the past 2 years. She decided she missed her family so much she wanted to end our relationship to be with her family. I\u2019m not entirely upset about her wanting to be back with her family but it sucks because my son really took a liking to her. Unfortunately we ended up breaking off our relationship because of this. We still live together so we\u2019ve been sleeping at friends houses or I\u2019ve slept on the floor. We were being very civil with each other until last night. Instead of going home and being miserable I went out and had a bonfire at my friends house. It just happens that one of my friends, we will call her P for short, was there and I\u2019ve known and been close to P since early high school. Me and P have been in a relationship and it never worked out like I wanted. But I had a really good time being with my friends and enjoying my night until I got home. Even though my and ex weren\u2019t together she questioned where I was and kept yelling at me because I was home late. She then found out who I was hanging out with her she became extremely hostile. Telling me things like she was going to stay and now she isn\u2019t and she doesn\u2019t trust me anymore and all this other shit.  She ended up going through my phone and leaving the house and staying at a friends. My biggest issue with this is that I tried so hard to keep our relationship together while she just seemed to give up, ultimately causing our relationship to end. It really hurt my feelings because even though I didn\u2019t think I did anything wrong I still feel guilty.

POST : Let me give some context to this first.   \n\n\nMy friend who I know in real life who's in her late teens, about the same age as me, has anxiety problems she's been dealing with for a couple of years now. Each time that she has a problem she comes on our group chats and basically vents and says all the problems and self deprecating thoughts she's been having even when people are talking or something else is going on or no one has anything to say that hasn't already been said, and this usually happens every three days or sometimes days in a row. Most of these problems she's talking about can't be solved by **only** coming to us, such as being highly shaky or having migraines. She also has problems with her dad at home as far as I know, but I don't really know how often it is since I'm not her.  \nBefore this situation that I'm about to explain happened, we were basically best friends.  \n\n\nOne day she started to basically break down to me over the internet, and this is where I stopped talking to her mainly.  \nShe comes on asking me if she's being annoying, I ask her if there was a specific instance that made her feel that way and she said no. Seconds later completely out of the blue, she says she hates herself, wants to pretend she doesn't exist, and would be cutting herself if I didn't make her promise not to. (I made her promise not to when I first her about it because it gave me peace of mind to know she's okay.)  \n\n\nAt this point, I feel kind of annoyed since she comes to us every day with her problems and isn't taking her own steps to fix them. I say that I'd expect her own sense of integrity to do the right thing, not just my solemn promise. She says she just wants to be able to vent, that her anxiety is a hellish feeling, and that her giving her word to someone is important because her integrity won't do the right thing. I understand these things, but the main problem I'm having with it is that she isn't taking steps to confront her problems herself (as in get professional help) and, what feels to me, like she is looking for validation.  \n\n\nI took steps back from talking or inviting her to things lately because of this entire thing and because of how much stress I felt when I was dumping into this. I told her at the end to find things that would help her physically and to do more to help herself. When I see her in public I try not to talk to her because I don't want to get back into this.\n\nIt's about a month later, and she hasn't done anything to change.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole, though?

Because of government regulations based on the size of business, they had no choice but to provide two handicapped parking spaces right by the front door in the small main lot of about 12 cars.  There was also an excess lot for about 40 cars behind the building, which people were occasionally forced to use and walk around to the front because the back entrance was a fire door only.   Please note: this is a **rock climbing gym**, if you aren't at least able-bodied (and don't work behind the register) there really isn't much chance you will have a reason to want to park here.   I knew all the employees and there was no one with a handicapped plate who worked there. \n\nOne day, after about 6 months of never seeing a single person park there, I decided to use the second best of the handicapped spots instead of being forced to use the back lot because we had been getting freezing rain for a few hours and the sun was going down, and I didn't feel like falling on my ass coming down or going up an icy slope because I was saving a spot for someone who is NEVER going to need it.   There was no problem that day.    \n\nThis became a habit.  Any time (rain or shine) that I couldn't park in a free space up front, I'd take the handicapped spot.  Eventually, I started doing it on \"on principle\" because I figured that if I used one of these two spots that always went to waste, that's one less other person who gets stuck driving around to the back if the lot filled up later.\n\nOne day, one of the other climbers found out it was me who'd been doing it and told me I was the worst piece of privileged shit in the world.  (He was a little extra outraged because he had a friend who was recently paralyzed in a climbing accident outdoors.)   I told him I was sorry, that I thought the likelihood of anyone wanting to use the spot legitimately was so remote it was wasted, and pointed out the that best handicapped spot remains open.  He said I was a selfish piece of shit, and I have to admit, former climbers who are now injured wanting to come to the gym was not something I had thought of.

There was a function at her halfway house that we went to because she invited us. This was the first time I had ever officially met her, and the first time my fianc\u00e9 had seen her in years. \n\nI come from a small rural town. Back when we were younger, she really made a name for herself. Stealing from people, selling fake drugs to younger kids, the whole nine. She was \u201cthat\u201d girl.

POST : Context:\n\nMy ex from college (dated for about 6 months) broke up with me 2 years ago because he realized he didn't care enough about the relationship to continue over long distance. He was my first love and broke my heart, so things were rough for me. We had no contact for about a year in which I had a casual fling and got over him 100%, but started talking again and got closure about a year ago (right before I met my current bf). \n\nWe're on good terms now. We chat on facebook or catch up over facetime every few months or so. We've stayed friends because we were best friends before dating, same college friend group, dated for only the end of college briefly, and it's just nice to stay connected to someone who meant a lot to you from the past, especially from such a formative time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have now been dating my current bf for almost a year. Everything is amazing, and I love him. It is a way more serious and mature relationship than my last. Last week, we were talking and he expressed he is insecure about my ex, specifically because it was a \"first love\" type thing. I have reassured him there is literally nothing going on and I am not interested in my ex romantically at all anymore (all true!!). Any romantic feelings feel so far back in the past. I am way over it and 100% into my current bf. He trusts my reassurances and is also friends with an ex, so he somewhat understands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Issue:\n\nToday, I was scrolling through my phone and my boyfriend saw 2 things that upset him:\n\n1) While my current boyfriend and I were in the hooking up/not sure what we are stage, ex and I had a life update chat with my ex on facebook messenger in which I told him \"I miss you (definitely not in the same way I did before) ! Hope you are well, hope to see you soon!\"\n\n2) A few months ago (after my boyfriend and I started dating), my ex was in town and asked to hang out. I couldn't make it at the time but offered to facetime to catch up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis point of view:\n\n1. He is worried that I was still into my ex (by saying I miss you) at the time we had already started hooking up.\n2. He is very upset that I have never mentioned that I facetime my ex occasionally, and that when my boyfriend and I saw each other/texted (don't remember which it was) that day I didn't mention it happening. He thinks it is disrespectful and that I meant to lie by omission.\n\nMy point of view:\n\n1. The I miss you was completely platonic on my end. It happened a few months after we had that good closure conversation and I wanted to express good will and friendship. I was hanging out with an old college friend at the time so naturally I thought of him and missed that he wasn't there too. IN A FRIENDLY WAY, which I tried to express! And current boyfriend and I were not yet serious, so it reflects nothing on our relationship, in my opinion.\n2. The idea that talking to my ex would be disrespectful to my current boyfriend honestly did not cross my mind :( , as I do call my other college friends sometimes and never mention it either. Not on purpose! Had it come up, I would NEVER lie about anything, it just wasn't thought of. It also was a quick call for mayyybe at most an hour and we haven't hung out in person nor been romantic/sexual at ALL after our break up. Also at the time, my boyfriend and I had only been official for about 2 months and I had ZERO idea he was so insecure over my ex. So, it was literally a non-issue to me at the time, and to specifically bring it up would make it sound like I thought it was a bigger deal than it really was. I think it would have been weird to bring it up with no prompting or any reason to. \n\nSo am I in the wrong? Please let me know if anything I did was me being the asshole! I just seriously can't tell what would have been the right choice of action each time these things happened in the past, and I want to be better in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : We're getting married in July and are finalizing the list of invitations, but we're deciding whether we should invite her extended family on her dad's side. There was a pretty serious fallout with that side of the family:\n\nMy fiancee's father (Dad) was one of 5 kids, and their mother passed away in 2014 with severe Alzheimer's and dementia. She owned a lake house that the whole family would use. One of Dad's siblings (Bro) wrote her will for her and had her sign off on it (presumably not really knowing what she was signing) stating that the lake house would be split 5 ways between each of the siblings, and in the event of the death of one of the siblings, their portion of the estate would be split among their children and not go to their spouse.\n\nDad was diagnosed with terminal cancer a few months before his mother passed away, so that seemed specifically targeted at my fiancee's immediate family. Owning a portion of the estate meant that you would be responsible for annual dues on upkeep/repairs/updates. Dad's portion would have been split three ways between my fiancee and her sisters, meaning they wouldn't have had enough voting power to try and stop expensive, unnecessary upgrades to the house so they would be on the hook for annual dues and renovation costs when none of them were in a good financial standing to pay for it.\n\nBro kept giving the reasons of my FMIL \"not being part of the family\" even though they'd been together for over 40 years, and that Dad's kids getting his part of the estate was \"what Nana would have wanted\". After months of my fiancee certain that she and her sisters would be stuck in this estate with no way out, Dad finally got Bro to agree to buy out his part of the estate. Dad was deep into his battle with cancer at this point and ended up passing away less than three weeks after they made the agreement.\n\nFollowing Dad's death, Bro and the other siblings have all but cut out my fiancee's family short of receiving the occasional holiday card, and her mom is extremely uncomfortable about being near any of them after they told her she wasn't part of the family anymore. We're upset with the way Dad's siblings treated him too (since they sided with Bro and voted not to let my FMIL take over his portion of the estate or buy them out) so we don't really want them there either, but we don't want to look petty by not inviting them.\n\nWe think that not inviting Dad's siblings and their spouses but still inviting my fiancee's cousins would be a bad look, and the cousins might not come if the siblings try to convince them that my fiancee's family is the one that cut them all out. We could not invite any of that side of the family, which ends up being around 30-40 people, but we don't really want to cut out people who weren't the ones that did anything wrong (guilty by association isn't fair?)

I came to mutual friends to try and get advice on the situation, and they all told me I was in the wrong for yelling at her and for putting the PSA on my snap. They all told me I had to apologize. I eventually relented because I realized I\u2019d destroy my friendships with all of them if I didn\u2019t, and so the next time I saw G I stumbled through an apology I didn\u2019t mean, feeling totally humiliated. She thanked me and things have gone back to normal since, but when I mean normal I\u2019m saying the continual bullying. Every once in a while she\u2019ll give subtle hints to the things I said to her, throwing them back in my face, but never outright saying it. Am I the asshole? I feel like at any time I could\u2019ve just apologized and ended it before it spiraled out of control, and I guess in retrospect the PSA was kind of passive aggressive, but I still feel like G\u2019s response was out of proportion to the situation at hand.

My husband has two children (stepdaughter 15 and stepson 13) with his ex-wife and she has two children from a relationship before she met him.  My stepson lives with me and my husband and my stepdaughter lives with her mother.  We get stepdaughter every other weekend. \n\nEx-wife\u2019s oldest son (OS) got his license about six months ago and ever since, he and stepdaughter have taken to driving around and stopping by our house randomly.  They also are doing all the pick-up and drop offs for ex-wife when it\u2019s her weekend to have stepson.  The problem is that OS and stepdaughter never knock when they stop by.  They just walk into the house.  They have almost walked in on my husband naked (stepson was at a friend\u2019s), did walk on me wrapping stepdaughters Christmas gifts and have scared the crap out of me several times because I walk into people just standing in my living room when I thought no one else was home.\n\nI want to ask my husband to have his daughter at least knock to let us know someone is there before she walks in.  I\u2019m nervous about it because in the past he has accused me of not understanding what it\u2019s like to have divorced parents (true).  We got into a huge argument when he went behind my back and gave stepdaughter a key to our house several years ago.  My thought process was that she had no need for a key because there has never been a time that she was at our house with no one home (husband always picks her up for his weekend visits).  Also, ex-wife goes through a lot men and they always wind up living with her for a while.  Before OS got his license, these random men would be the ones picking up and dropping off stepson to our home.  I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with a key to our house being accessible to these people we didn\u2019t know.   Husband said it wasn\u2019t fair that stepson had a key (he lived with us and needed one) and stepdaughter didn\u2019t.  It was her house too.   I still don\u2019t think \u201cfair\u201d is a good enough reason but whatever.\n\nNow, I just want to know if I would be as asshole if I asked my husband to talk to stepdaughter about knocking first.  I don\u2019t mean that she has to wait for us to answer the door, but just as a warning that someone is coming into the house.  My husband is very sensitive about anything to do with his kids.  If the consensus is that I\u2019m an asshole, I just won\u2019t bring it up at all and avoid the conflict.\n\nBeing a stepparent isn\u2019t always easy, I don\u2019t want to be the \u201cevil\u201d stepmom but I also think that it should be ok to have boundaries.\n", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

So me, tired and irrational, is there listening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngf came home from a night out with her work friends. When she got in I woke up, we were talking about how her night was. Apparently they were reminiscing about some old times from a few years ago when they were single.  She says about a threesome she had with two of her friends and says \n\n\"it was amazing, glad it happened. never would again\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thought of her with the guy both turned me on and made me a bit jealous, though that's neither here nor there. I never had a threesome so it was something that became an unfulfilled fantasy when we became exclusive (she wasn't up for it anymore). It's still a bit of a sore spot as is it something I would have wanted to experience in this lifetime, but being with her is more important and long term. So this memory/sentence was a bit of salt on the wounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there I am, getting upset by what I see as this insensitive sentence for three reasons:\n\n1 experience I'll never have with her (I know this is something I have to learn to let go of, I just dont know how, could appreciate advice there too)\n\n2 seeing her reminisce about wild sex when we haven't had sex in ages makes it feel like we're all downhill from here (probably the only genuine one here)\n\n3 Insecurity from this, why weren't we having drunk sex instead of her reminiscing/why would she let someone she cares less about have a threesome and not me (I know that one is petty)\n\nSo here's me two days later being crotchety and bitter, trying to let it go or figure it out and failing. not sure if there'd be any benefit to bringing this up other than making the situation worse (particularly about sex. once that's brought up as a problem I feel a line has been irreversibly crossed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR - gf talking about a past threesome, saying 'amazing but never again', me getting upset because \n\n1 we didnt and wont do that together, \n\n2 we havent had sex in ages, \n\n3 insecurity, why not me. \n\nNow i'm still feeling upset two days later and am finding myself grumpy/aloof towards her.

I think she left feeling hurt that I ruined what she wanted to do and me feeling that she ruined what we had planned with a surprise which could have been pleasant if it had been done differently. Am I the asshole here?\n\n**Backstory:**\n\nI'm 26 and she is 36. We've been dating for a few months now. There have been a few times where I felt she was unreliable with plans already made or things she said and didn't follow through with. There have been a few occasions where she wasn't ready at the time we had planned on. There have been a few occasions where she said she would call/message in a while and didn't. Or she would stop over when something was done and didn't. Or changed her mind altogether.\n\nMy previous relationship ended with me breaking up with my ex because she continuously blew me off last minute for other things. One time we were planning to see a movie and she said she would rather hang out with some friends. I wasn't invited and later came to find out they had gone to the movies. This hurt me deeply and to lookout for myself I called it quits with that relationship. It had become a pattern.\n\nI shared this with my current girlfriend and on the occasions I mentioned above rather than bottle things up I let her know that it bothered me so she wasn't new to how much being reliable meant to me. I said it along the lines of I don't think there are a lot of things which bother me much but this is a sore spot and something that ended my previous relationship and with it bothering me could she please be considerate of that.\n\n**Which leads us to tonight:**\n\nI had spent the night at her place and before leaving to do some stuff I put out there that maybe we could do something later. She knows I've been wanting to go see a movie together for a while. As I was finishing up at the gym at about 9pm I asked if she would like to see a movie.\n\nThe conversation went like this:\n\nMe: I could go for some chicken tenders and an ice cream cookies sandwich. What about you? (the theater has food)\nHer: What time\nMe: Would you like to pick? I know I'd like the tenders ice cream and you. Not too worried about which movie or time.\nHer: Sure let me look :)\nHer: Okay I picked that happy death day 2 at 10:30pm is that okay\nMe: Yes, done.\nMe: I'm home now going to have a protein shake. I'll be back over in time for the movie.\nHer: Is there anything you want me to bring\nMe: Not that I can think of.\n\nWhen I was leaving the house I told her I was on my way and she said no don't go she is on her way. At that point I was in the car just down the street but no big deal I went back home. She gets over and comes in, sits down for a few minutes and I play some music. We were timing the movie to get there missing most of the previews. I was very much looking forward to and planning on being warm with a blanket at the theater and getting food there because I was hungry. As I was putting my coat on for us to go out the door she tells me wait. That I have encouraged her to speak her mind and go with what she is feeling. I asked what's up. She said she doesn't really want to go to the movie now and would rather do something else. She isn't sure what but will I come along for a surprise night. She mentioned going to a graveyard or some railroad tracks or out to a bar to get a drink and shoot pool. I told her that yes she is most certainly free to speak her mind but those things didn't interest me at the moment, my heart was set on getting food and being cuddled up watching a movie. I said I didn't want to be outside in the cold (New York) and we had gone out to a bar on Friday already. She asked why I couldn't be more open minded to surprises. I responded that I'm okay with surprises but I didn't like how last minute this was after we already had plans and were almost out the door. I told her I believe that had she instead suggested a surprise night earlier such as at 9pm when I first asked about seeing a movie, I would have been receptive to it. I followed up with, can we still go see the movie tonight and do a surprise something another time? She said no, she isn't going to see the movie now but I am welcome to still go myself. I said okay you can go do what you want and I'll go see the movie and I don't like that we ended up in this situation. There was some more back and forth at which point I likely would have missed the beginning of the movie so I changed to I would stay home and find something to eat.\n\n**Change of plans:**\n\nLet me admit I was upset now and took a snarky tone. She wanted me to go along with her for the ride and see what happened. I asked if we could still take care of me getting something to eat and not be in the cold. So there I am and we're in the car. She stops for gas and we're talking. I brought up again that reliability is very important to me and that I felt this was her being unreliable and reminded her that it had ended a relationship before. I'm not sure how rough it came across to her. I didn't mean it as a threat, rather I was distressed and urgently trying to convey how important this was to me so that it would be taken seriously. She said she would just take me home. I said here I am already with you, I can stay quiet if you like, let's just do what you want to do and make the best of things. She took us to Walmart where she proceeded to wander around and get nothing. As we talked while walking around she divulged that she had wanted to go to her father's grave but I had ruined that for her and she was no longer in the mood for it. I said I wish she had said so sooner, that I thought that would be a sweet thing to do and that I was up for doing that. She lost her father about a year ago which I am sympathetic to. I went on to say I would be honored to go with her and that I recognize the significance of her inviting me there. She reiterated that it was already ruined for her at the moment. I asked how long she had known this was what she wanted to do. She said it hadn't occurred to her that it was what she wanted to do until when we were leaving the gas station.\n\nAt that point I wasn't happy but was talking about salvaging the night doing something and said of all things I didn't want to just walk around Walmart. So we left and she said she would drop me off at home. I said we could watch a movie at my place, still go to the graveyard, go out for a drink, do something to end the night on a better note. She could come in or we could go to her place. Reluctantly she came in but just started cleaning stuff. We weren't doing anything together. She said I could start doing what I wanted and I said what I wanted was to do something together. She said I told you in the car I didn't want to do anything together right now and want space. She got her coat and left. \n\nSo from planning to see a movie and have food to being here writing this.

One girl, Tif, is shy, doesn\u2019t talk much and I don\u2019t have her phone contact or social media. The other is Add, who cares about her academics. \nAnd then there\u2019s me, I cannot speak Spanish if my life depended on it. My family is Chinese and I have only started taking high school spanish last year (I took Chinese in middle school but it\u2019s not offered in high school). I currently have an 80% in that class and it\u2019s my only grade below an A (it\u2019s also going down now).\n\nThe assignment was to do a presentation based on food. We were essentially going to make a cookbook. Add took charge in finding the format of the PowerPoint and I contributed to the PowerPoint by typing the ingredients. The assignment was due Wednesday, which was yesterday. But Add asked if we could present it on Thursday (today) cause we weren\u2019t ready. We had everything down on the slides, but it wasn\u2019t what Add had in mind. We worked on it in class but really not that much because Add wanted to go home and finish it and she was talking to her friends. Tiff did not work on the slides the night before but and I told her my contact info so she could contact me (but she never did). I asked Add if there was anything I could do, but because she did not do one of her sections yet, I could not start mine. \n\nSo that night, Add got rid of the old recipe and replaced it with something more complex. I translated the whole thing in the right conjugation. We had to present this in an interviewer-guest way. So Add was our interviewer and Tif &amp; I were the guests presenting the cookbook. Add told me to study the answer to #2,4,5 and i did just that. Therefore, Tif had #1,3,6 and #3 included remembering the recipe. \n\nDuring the presentation, I did mess up on one of the questions, but corrected it. When we got to #3, no one said anything at all, so I started reading the PowerPoint, which I (or any team member) was supposed to memorize. We eventually made it through to the end, where our teacher is supposed to question us. However, I did not talk during the questions, mainly Add did. \n\nWe eventually had to have a private conversation with our teacher in the hallway. She said our project grade earned a 65% and asked if we want to split the grade so we all have an individual grade. Add &amp; I didn\u2019t say anything but Tif immediately said split. \n\nI tried talking to my teacher but I really don\u2019t know what to say.

I wasn't a huge fan of the idea for multiple reasons but the main one being he was underage and it was a dry campus. I knew there was going to be alcohol there and I tried to tell him that of they get roudy in a dorm room the campus police will be called and it would be potentially bad.

The game is going to last for 5 hours if we play through the whole thing, so I tell my parents that I won't be able to do anything that night (It was a night that my mom was hoping do something but I said I do anything that night because I had the game I was planning for a month.)\n\nWhile playing the game, everybody still on the board makes a pact against one player, lets call him mac, because he was trying to put everybody into conflict with each other with lies (The game is all about diplomacy and lying so this is expected.) We agreed that after he's defeated we'd end the game. This is especially satisfying for me who's been the butt end of a running joke in my group of friends about a mistake I did in the game that lead to similar situation, and if the game was to end early I could do something with my family.\n\nAs he's on his last legs in the game, one player who's tired of the game and somewhat thinks the game is done decides to leave. We could probably still beat mac, but it will take longer not only because the person who left won't be supporting us anymore, but also because we'll have to \"wait\" for him to put in his turns for the turn to go through meaning we'd have to wait the entire turn timer.\n\nAt this time, it seems pretty certain still that that person would lose, but mac believed there was a small chance that he could survive until the game time ran out and draw.

We started talking a bit before I started liking her; she hit up me first. She mentioned that she did weed and I didn't think anything of it because I wasn't romantically interested in her yet.  \n\nI ask her out and the day after, we're on call and she tells me she's high. She asks if I'm mad, and I say no. She falls asleep on call, and in that time I realized that I was very unhappy because I am personally against weed/smoking, and I didn't want an SO that did it. I told her this the next day, and she said that she would stop for me.  \n\nThen about a week later, she \"asks for permission\" to do it again. I repeat my feelings. She regularly \"asks for permission\" until about two weeks later when I go out of state for the night, and she smokes, feels guilty the next day and tells me. Towards the end of November, we got into a bit of an argument over it and when I got home, she texted me a lot about how she hated her self, she would rather have me happy than weed, and she promised she would never bring it up again. That promise lasted maybe a week or two before she started bringing it up again.  \n\nAbout a week ago, we had a pregnancy scare and she told me that if the test ends up being negative, she is going to smoke to calm down. I regretfully told her that I'd be fine with it considering the stress she was under. A couple days ago, we argued about it again.  \n\nMy stance: I get very bothered when I even imagine her doing it, more often than not just the thought of it puts me in a bad mood almost immediately. I never realized how much I was against weed until I started dating her. I have told her many times that I am not comfortable nor willing to be in a relationship with somebody that does it or smokes in general. It's a very big turn off for me. I have tried many times to become more accepting and open-minded but I cannot help being bothered by it.  \n\nHer stance: She has been doing it since about March or April, 2018, I believe. It started out as something to help calm her down, relax her, but progressed into doing it for fun with her mother, who provides it for her. In her words, she could quit it anytime she wanted to, but says that, because I ask her not to, it only makes her want to do it more. She says if she had to she would choose me over weed, but she really does not want to make that choice. Many times her reasoning for doing it has contradicted itself; one day she says \"I'll stop after I'm 18, high school is what's causing all the stress\", the next day she says \"After I'm 18 I should be allowed to do it because I'll be an adult.\" She told me recently that when she was giving me these reasons she was just trying to say the \"right\" things.  \n\nWhat we agree on: My girlfriend and I are very much in love with each other and want nothing but to spend the rest of our lives together. We accept that either way, no matter what the outcome of this issue is, there will not be complete happiness for either of us.

Sorry if this (first) post turns out so long and unreadable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if this is better suited to relationships, but I\u2019m so worried whether I\u2019ve been the asshole or not. If that\u2019s the verdict, I\u2019ll be making changes / amends. I\u2019m torn between wanting to be accommodating and realistic with my relationship, but also not be a doormat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis isn\u2019t totally V-day (a dirty word for some people) centric. My bf\u2019s and my 2.5 yr relationship hasn\u2019t always been straightforward \u2013 we came to the table with very different approaches. I\u2019ve (30) been in 2-3 of longer term relationships. Bf (32) tells me I am his first committed relationship; aside from that I know nothing about his romantic past. His Facebook is a closed book (photos very limited to any outside viewer on his page), and we didn\u2019t know each other before 3 years ago. We live abroad so I\u2019ve little potential for meeting his older friend. I don\u2019t feel too comfortable asking questions about his past; when I have in the past it\u2019s turned up some information I struggled with. I try not to ask questions in case I\u2019m not prepared for the answers. In all other respects he\u2019s a kind, loving and respectful partner.\n\nI learnt quickly what seems \u2018obvious\u2019 to me probably won\u2019t to him, and that\u2019s ok. He has some anxiety issues and I think I adjusted to thinking of about things differently. Examples \u2013 agreeing to come to a party with me might not mean he\u2019ll talk to anyone or last past 10 minutes; planning a night in together might not happen if he\u2019s in a certain headspace and just needs to be in a different room by himself. I know some of my friends had views on that, but I have worked on changing my expectations, being more open about what means a lot to me, and trying to work within what is comfortable to him at different times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing about me I\u2019ve tried to improve on is that I tend to get excited and look forward to things we plan to do together, so if we\u2019ve been discussing going out for dinner on Friday all week and he needs to cancel, I can get sad. It\u2019s an almost physical feeling of sadness and disappointment when something changes. I\u2019ve worked on managing expectations and not looking forward to something until the last minute, and he\u2019s worked on having a calendar of things somewhere obvious so he feels more accountable for commitments. We don\u2019t do too much, maybe one or two planned thing a week, less if he is sick or tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there\u2019s been a bit of a cumulative effect. I feel like my confidence is going; I\u2019ve started looking at things I\u2019d like to do as an imposition to him. Sometimes he\u2019ll ask 2-3 times if I still want to do something, and by the 3rd time I\u2019ll assume he\u2019s still asking because he doesn\u2019t want to do it, I feel like a burden and I feel guilt for making him go to that effort. I\u2019ll then say we should cancel, because I feel like I\u2019m forcing it otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nManaging my expectations works to an extent \u2013 I don\u2019t assume I\u2019ll get something silly like Christmas or birthday presents, I assume nothing for things like Valentines. However I like it \u2013 and I know if I want something (a Christmas dinner, a meal on Valentines) that I\u2019m happy to plan it myself. This week however we had been having such a wonderful week \u2013 we had a big bit of good news early in the week, his anxiety seemed good, so I got a little too hopeful on the 13th and sent a text \u201cI\u2019ll be cooking us steak tomorrow, I forgot to mention, but if possible, it would be great if you could contribute to dinner tomorrow night (a) a bottle of wine (b) a small amount of flowers or (c) some kind of chocolate / dessert item xx Just one of the above would be appreciated :D\u201d. I got back a heart, and \u201cI was planning to get something you know.. I mean after you reminded me it was valentines day\u201d which I had done, when telling him I would be cooking dinner on Thursday.\n\nSo I thoughtlessly took that to mean that he would be able to contribute one of those things, and stupidly thought it might even mean he had planned something that I hadn\u2019t asked for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCome V day I had shopped, bought and was ready to prepare snacks and a pricier steak dinner. I took longer off work to go to a medical appointment so I could stop and get a better type of food than we usually eat, as a treat for v-day and to celebrate the good news earlier in the week that he had suggested going out to celebrate, but for another reason we did not get around to doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis plans changed slightly, so was home before me and for the whole evening. He made a comment about still planning to walk into town \u201cto get \u2018those\u2019 items\u201d. I felt bad, and suggested the easiest of the three items \u2013 a bottle of wine from the store about 400m away from our house, and say that would be great. He doesn\u2019t drink wine as routinely as me, and has said he finds it hard to buy sometimes, but I just said maybe he could get something he likes and we might both enjoy with dinner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hours pass and I get snacks out for both of us, and he takes a bath. I start to cook dinner and he comes up to ask if I still really want wine. I feel guilty - it's winter out, too - and say only if he would drink some; he asks a couple more times and I say no, not to worry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get disappointed and I think he can tell I\u2019m feeling sad. I try to ignore it until it passes \u2013 go on cooking dinner, chatting, trying to not act differently. But it\u2019s not the wine, it\u2019s the effort I guess. It\u2019s that he said he would. I get a little more sad, I feel silly for forcing things by cooking dinner. I can tell he had seen I\u2019m a bit off \u2013 quieter \u2013 as he starts to hang around more, and ask to help cook (food was done) and be more cuddly / attentive. I start to feel less like spending time together. Just\u2026sad. Later he cuddles up to me like he wants to be intimate, which is a big deal as he is less often interested in that, and as a result I leave it up to him to initiate pretty much always, so I don\u2019t put him in the position of having to brush me off. I think this is one of the only times in our relationship I don\u2019t respond to \u2018advances\u2019. I can\u2019t make myself feel warm and stop feeling sad, so I agree when he asks if I want to be alone. I want to get the feeling out my head, so say to him I am feeling \u2018grumpy\u2019 and wish he would not say he is going to do something if he won\u2019t do it. He doesn\u2019t remember the message saying he had planned to contribute to the night, and doesn\u2019t remember me saying the wine would be great, only that eventually I told him not to bother. He looks like he\u2019s going to cry, that I\u2019ve made him feel bad for putting the pressure on him on a stupid holiday, and I feel guilty like I should console him and make up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I just feel sad. I feel like I\u2019m the asshole, and I should just manage my expectations better \u2013 this is such a tiny thing. But it\u2019s having cumulative effects: I don\u2019t look forward to things like planned dinners any more- even if we go, maybe he\u2019ll be in a mood to rather be along and it won\u2019t be fun. I don\u2019t feel turned on anymore until we\u2019re way into foreplay \u2013 what if he pulls away 5 minutes in and I\u2019m already invested. I shouldn\u2019t have asked for anything or \u2018bought into\u2019 valentines, I\u2019m an idiot. But AITA? It's not his holiday, he didn't want to hurt me on purpose, and I just made him feel guilty and pushed him away when he wanted to try and be close.", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

Also I know it might sound silly or obvious, but I do feel conflicted.\n\nFor some context: Cisco (28M) and I (26F) met at university and have been good friends for about 5 years now. We did our first internship together and when we graduated, we both started working at the same building. He is a pretty amazing person. He has driven me to the airport, hospital, took care of my drunk ass, helped me move. Good friend. I had a crush on him when we first met but he had a gf so I never really pursued it. \n\nJanuary of 2017, just before he broke up with his gf we got really drunk together and hooked up. We were both complete messes at the time and I know it was wrong. We remained good friends and hooked up a couple times more (after he broke up) but nothing more than that. \n\nI met Betty (26F) at our building because she and Cisco were going out for a while. A few months later she and I became friends, hanging out a lot. I never mentioned Cisco and I hooked up, as far as I knew they were no longer going out and I never felt I needed to tell her. \n\nEarly this week she invited me to a party and mentioned Cisco might come and that they would still casually meet, but she didn\u2019t really know how he felt about her. She was into him. \n\nAt that point, I felt I needed to \u201cwarn\u201d her. Yes, he\u2019s sweet and all but to please be aware he would not take it further. He told me multiple times he was not planning to be in a relationship anytime soon and was going out with a few different girls. And that he knew the way he treated said girls led them to think he wanted more so he was clear from the beginning. I told her all that over text. She kept asking me questions and I kept telling her some stuff I knew about him. Later I realized I overshared and told her \u201cplease don\u2019t think ill of him. It was all complicated and we can talk more in person\u201d. \n\nI wake up today to a huge text from her. He pretty much called me a terrible friend, \u201cspilling\u201d his secrets to others and that she didn\u2019t know what my intentions were but she thought it was mean that I told her about him and I. That i\u2019m not trustworthy and that she only kept me talking to see how far would i go on \u201cbetraying my friend\u201d, which felt like plain manipulation. She said we shouldn\u2019t be friends anymore and told him the same, that she didn\u2019t want to associate with \u201cthat kind of people\u201d. She went on about us hooking up last year. It was harsh. \n\nI later called him, explained and apologized. He didn\u2019t care a bit. \n\nTo me, it was girl talk with a trusted friend. She didn\u2019t see it that way. She thinks I was on some kind of agenda. \n\nAm I The Asshole?\n\nTL;DR: I told my friend the guy she fancied didn\u2019t want a relationship. I went on and overshared stuff about his life bc I\u2019m friends with him.

My dad got fired from his longtime time about 3 years ago and my parents divorced last year. He hasn\u2019t gotten a job since and is only making a little side money doing photography. He has never really been good with finances and that became apparent as I got older. He made pretty good money and he should have had built a really nice savings up but instead he has tens of thousands in credit card debt and has filed for bankruptcy 3 times in the past. I remember him always spending his money on random expensive things but still he should have plenty of money.

I honestly have no idea where his money has gone.\n\nI found out from my mom last week that he was really struggling and that he is putting his house on the market. He burrowed 2K from my mom and my uncle took out a personal loan to help him out over the past 3-4 months. I was shocked by this because 2 months ago he bought a BRAND-NEW living room set even though his old couch was perfectly fine. How can he burrow money and turn around and buy a living room set? \n\nAnyways, I knew that he would eventually ask me for money and today it finally happened. He came over and asked for $1,500 and that he would pay me back this week. He said he doesn\u2019t have enough for his mortgage.

There\u2019s also a TLDR at the bottom for those who don\u2019t want to read all of this. For those who do...sorry. There\u2019s a lot.\n\nSo I just started my second year in college. My first year I met this guy (we\u2019ll call him Chad) who was finishing up his fourth year. He was cool to me and my friends so we decided to hang out with him a few times throughout the year. There were more than a few times he bought booze for us and was overall a swell guy. Until one night... to make a long story short, he was rubbing up on a few of my female friends\u2019 feet and being super creepy about it. It made everyone super uncomfortable, to the point that my friends said they didn\u2019t want him around at anymore parties. I agreed and we never hung out again.\n\nFlash forward a couple months, and I\u2019m at a party with a different group of friends and Chad happens to be there. He makes me some drinks, we chat and I get very drunk. At some point in the night a bunch of us are sleeping in the living room and my friend on the other end of the room jumps up from the couch and runs into the kitchen. A few of my other friends follow her and they talk in the kitchen for about an hour and come back, everyone goes back to sleep. A few weeks later, she tells me that she freaked out cuz Chad was grabbing at her feet while she was sleeping, causing her to wake up and have a panic attack. After hearing about that, my whole friend group (except one guy, we\u2019ll name him Bob) swore off hanging out with Chad since he\u2019d been acting so creepy.\n\nOk, now to the actual meat. About two months ago was my college\u2019s homecoming game. We (being me and the second group of friends) decided to have a party to celebrate and hang out. Bob volunteered to host at his apartment, and the night was set. All of a sudden, Chad shows up at the homecoming football game asking when the party is and where. Myself and six of my fiends pull Bob aside and tell him that if Chad is going to the party then the rest of us aren\u2019t. He said he\u2019d take care of it.\n\nWe get to the party. It\u2019s lit, everyone has a great time and post a bunch of pics and videos on our Snapchat stories and other social media platforms as you do when the party is lit. We all pass out feeling pretty good and not worrying about anything. However, when we wake up about 15 of us (including myself) have texts waiting for us from Chad about how we all betrayed his trust and how he can\u2019t believe that he called us his friends. He blocks everyone who was at the party on every social media he has and has his fianc\u00e9 do the same. As it turns out, when Bob said he would take care of it he meant he would tell Chad that the party was canceled and just throw it anyway. So when we put a bunch of pics online of us hanging out, Chad saw it and got pissed. He and Bob had a huge fight and weren\u2019t on speaking terms for a while. I think they\u2019ve made up now, but I\u2019m not sure. The rest of us have made no attempt to patch things up with him, and some of us are more than ok with the way that things turned out. After all, Chad was a total creep and we didn\u2019t like him.\n\nSo anyway...are we the assholes? I know Bob could\u2019ve handled that differently, but should we have made him choose between Chad and us? Was it really fair of us to put him in that position? We\u2019ve all sort of accepted that Chad isn\u2019t around anymore, and some of us like I said are pretty happy about it given his creepy vibe. We\u2019ve come to terms with what we did, but I\u2018m interested to hear some opinions from outsiders.\n\nTLDR: A guy I met last year turned out to be a total creep. We found out he was gonna be at a party we were going to, and told the host was a close friend of his to chose between us and him.

I've faced years of bullying at school because I was being myself, and I had a very confusing and anger-filled time growing up. It really wasn't easy. I'm now a depressed, anxious, insecure adult because of it. A lot of the stuff I faced was due to being autistic, and how I was treated by others.\n\nI get annoyed every time I see those videos on social media where a kid with some kind of disability gets asked to prom, and then a post is shared around about it, and people see the non-disabled person as 'an inspiration'. In the UK, there's a show named The Undateables, and it's based around people with various disabilities finding love. That's fine, right up until they named it that. We're disabled, and we're seen as 'undateable' by the general public, and when we do get into relationships (Which is a normal thing), it's suddenly 'aww how sweet'. It's not seen the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy point is that I feel these acts are based totally around pity and condescension. The girl in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy, or the guy with down syndrome, or the autistic classmate, they're lied to and used by the other kids for 'kind points' on social media. I've spoke up about this a few times in the past, and I've been called heartless, hateful, and cynical because I disagreed. Damn it, they deserve to be invited to all the things, just like everybody else. It didn't NEED a media circus!  \n\n\nAnother example is when someone films them self giving food or money to homeless people. I find it incredibly telling how there's a camera rolling right before the act. They frankly don't give a shit about the homeless guy, they're just trying to portray themselves as kind and benevolent, when they're clearly just trying to get likes.  \n\nI'm really sad and angry that this is happening.\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

My child lives with us full time and I receive child support. My two step-kids live with their mother (one is in college now though) and my husband pays child support. We're all very geographically distant but everyone is involved to the extent they can be. All of us are lower middle class, with similar incomes and cost of living.\n\nI started a saving account for my son just after I split with my son\u2019s father, roughly 10 years ago. I budget the child support separately and any remaining CS money goes into my son\u2019s savings account. When I told my ex I was doing this, he voluntarily started sending a bit more child support to up what would go into savings. I put 50% of all my son's holiday money in there and his dad occasionally tosses a bit more money at it too. The plan is to gift this money to our child upon some as of yet undetermined adult life event. I project this account will be somewhere between $20-$25K by the time my son graduates high school.\n\nMy husband has gifted two years of college tuition and all major living expenses for that time to each of his two children, paid through a work related benefit. He doesn\u2019t have any additional savings set up for them though and I don't know if their mother does either. It's highly likely that she doesn't as saving has never been one of her strengths.\n\nSo, I was complaining about a banking error in my son\u2019s savings account when my friend made a comment about how unfair it was that my son would eventually be given this large sum of money while my step-kids will not. I was more than a little taken aback. I explained that the savings account for my son had never used joint household money for funding and came directly from the child support I received from his father; It had nothing to do with my husband or my step-kids. She was still quite angry and insisted it was wrong not to be strictly equitable no matter where the money came from.\n\nNow I\u2019m not sure what to think. I\u2019ve always viewed it more like I was saving my son\u2019s own money for him.  The child support was never \u201cmine\u201d or my husband's. My step-kids' mother was equally as capable of doing something similar with the child support she received, especially given that she has always received significantly more in child support than I did. On the other hand, it certainly isn't my stepchildren's fault if their mother didn't do this. It is very likely that they would see this as being unfair and mean too. I'm not willing to short my son and I'm also not interested in being viewed as the stereotypical Wicked Stepmother, but I can't make 40K appear out of thin air in the next several years.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I continue with my plans to save and gift my son with this large sum of money without doing the same for my step-kids?", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

My sister called me today and I've just found out that she has an entire different view on it. She has ground rules because of the baby, but I completely disagree with many of them which I'll talk about below. Some of them, I get and am supportive of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what she's proposing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-&gt; My medicine in a lock box in my room\n\n\\-&gt; I must keep my room baby friendly (no choking hazards, etc)\n\n\\-&gt; My cat needs to be locked in the basement at all times\n\n\\-&gt; I have to keep my dishes in my room or in one single area (food allergies)\n\n\\-&gt; I have a list of her pet peeves that I can't do (No left overs in the fridge, etc)\n\n\\-&gt; I can't bring most of my furniture, only the small things bc there is 'no space'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, from this it's implied that her and baby will have free reign of my room. I want to keep my cat in my bedroom at first until it becomes accustomed to the people/house and then most likely let it stay in the basement with me when I'm down there because it's a much larger space. I 100% understand that she's not comfortable with a cat near her child, so I get not letting it roam the house, but why can't it be in my bedroom?\n\nI mentioned putting a lock on my door to keep baby out and safe but she said that baby's always find a way into rooms and that my cat will be let out. I asked why people will be entering my room, and she said that she wants somewhere she can go to be alone when I'm not there. She's upset because she shares a room with the baby and doesn't have her own space. I told her that despite that I still need and want my own space.\n\nShe also said that she wants help with the baby and implied that I would be able to help watch him anytime she wanted some freedom. IMO, this isn't ok. I'm fine with babysitting and helping out but I have my own life and can't be watching a baby whenever she wants a break.\n\nI also told her that I'll be bring my furniture will put the 2-3 non bedroom things in the basement. She said that there's no room and that I should throw it out. I'll be moving out in a year or so and can't afford to re-buy my furniture. \n\nAITA for demanding that my sister and her baby stay out of my room when I'm not there?

My parents have probably been split for a solid 4 years now and because of the constant arguing and me already having self esteem issues i blamed myself for the breakup. After the breakup my mom gained full custody of me and my at the time 15 brother (my brother isn't my dads son hes just my half brother) but my mom would make us stay over at his house for every single day aside from weekends. My dad was happy with it since he sees my brother as his son as well due to taking care of him since he was 2. Once she found a house we moved in with her and she had told us her fiance which my brother and I haven't known for very long before him moving in. Immediately there was problems such as him yelling at me and my brother for being lazy even though he was the one that never took care of the house due do his \"breathing problems\" even though he is still a very avid smoker. He also took the door knob off of my door and would regularly walk into my room without knocking, causing him to walk in on me changing multiple times without apologizing. \n\nSkip forward to December of 2018, my brother turned 18 in January of 2018 and moved out so i was all alone in the house. My dad gains custody of me. It was one of the happiest times of my life. court date was on a Wednesday so my dad told me to stay the rest of the week and he will pick me up on Saturday. But as soon as my mom got home she tried to guilt me saying I don't love her yada yada yada. \n\nAll seemed fine at my dads, his girlfriend moved in prior to me staying there full time and she seemed like a nice person and so did her family. Boy was I wrong. September 2018 is when i started dating my boyfriend that I am still dating right now. My dad gave me a lot more freedom than my mom did so i tried to spend as much time with my boyfriend as I can and my dad seemed fine with it, i made sure that he met my boyfriend and his parents. But for the past i want to say 6 months my stepmom started to get on me. If i didn't put away a single dish that was in the sink I would get yelled at. If i didn't have breakfast with them on the weekends because i would eat something prior to them waking up, i'd get yelled at. It turned into a vicious cycle of her and I arguing her accusing me of stealing her stuff and her always insulting my mother and my boyfriend and my life decisions. I'll admit that I have a very bad attitude but she is more of a \"I'm going to ruin her life in secret\" person. Now my boyfriend dropped out of high school mid sophomore year but I know he is very smart and very much wants to go to college after getting his GED. He is working full time and has a truck and his license. He is a very hard worker and he worked for everything he has now, being born to a mother with very bad bipolar disorder and an injured navy veteran. Because of her strong judgments towards my boyfriend and his parents, she started to push it onto my dad. And my dad listens to her. I don't want to say my dad is a pushover but he sure as hell believes every little thing that woman shoves down her throat. It's gotten to the point where my dad will find any reason for me to not go over to my boyfriends house and even flat out said that he will not help me pay my college tuition if i move out of the house when i turn 18 knowing if me and my bf are still together by then, that is my exact plan. \n\nWhere I live the legal age of working is 16 and i turned 16 in October. I was job hunting and i still am trying my best to find a job so I am able to be financially independent as soon as i'm 18. Now it's February 2019 and I have still yet to find a job although i do have an interview next week. My dad is forcing me to apply for different jobs, not acknowledging that most places don't want to hire people that are still in school especially not a 16 year old. But he says I'm grounded until I find one. My self esteem and my motivation have lowered and it has gotten to the point where I don't think I want to live here anymore but I also wouldn't want to go back to my mother.

POST : Some backstory:\nTL;DR: my sister has been milking her son\u2019s death for sympathy and pity points in arguments for 2 years, even let his dog die so she could get more sympathy.\n\nDuring my nephew\u2019s life, my sister showed little interest in him. She would threaten to kick him out when all he wanted was for her to spend time with him as much as she did with her younger kids. She told people multiple times she wished he wasn\u2019t around so she could \u201cget some peace and quiet\u201d, to the point where she actually begged my mum to take him from her, but not the other 3. The amount of times he would come to me, sobbing, that he wished she\u2019d loved him was heartbreaking. All he wanted was love and understanding, but no one seemed to give him it. She encouraged her younger children to be cruel to him. They\u2019d all ignore him, be violent to him, and call him names whenever he spoke back to my sister, and she didn\u2019t care.\n\nWhen he got diagnosed with diabetes when he was 17, on my 18th birthday, my sister suddenly started \u201ccaring\u201d. She would make him do his insulin shots in front of people - she did this at my birthday party, he wanted to go to the bathroom and do it in peace, but she wanted him to stay there to \u201cmake sure he was doing it right\u201d, all whilst she accepted all the sympathy offered towards him. After a while, people stopped offering her sympathy, and she lost interest in her son again. \n\nA year later, after he\u2019d seen me go off to university, he decided he wanted that, too. When he told my sister that\u2019s what he wanted, she mocked him and told him she wouldn\u2019t support him in doing what he wanted to do. He did it anyway, and a day after he\u2019d gone to uni she\u2019d removed his bed and any belongings he\u2019d left behind, and threw them away. He\u2019d gone to the same uni as me, and I told her \u201cbut he\u2019ll be back home again at Christmas, we can\u2019t stay there\u201d she said \u201cwell he can have the couch before he goes back\u201d.  He didn\u2019t end up coming back for Christmas. He only made it 3 months until he died, alone, in his uni bedroom, 2 years ago today. \n\nWhen he died, she suddenly started acting as though she were the most attentive and caring mother in the world. She would refer to him as \u201cmy blue-eyed boy\u201d, a name she never referred to him as when he was alive. She would post about him all the time, which slowly became clear it was attention and sympathy she was after. \n\nI know that, as shitty as she was, she is still his mother. Of course she\u2019d be devastated, especially as she was the one who found him a day after he\u2019d died. I admire how she knew something was wrong, in all honesty. He hadn\u2019t been on Facebook in over 24 hours, something very unlike him, so she went to check on him. So I guess she wasn\u2019t all bad. But I still seethe with anger whenever I see her post yet another status about how he was her world, as she simultaneously threatens her other kids with homelessness if they put a toe out of line, encouraging them to bottle up and hide their emotions, so now it\u2019s coming out in drug abuse, running off to other countries, and her youngest son is now refusing to go to school at all - she\u2019s encouraging that, it means she can keep him under her longer if he has no friends. \n\nShe\u2019d used him as a weapon all his life, threatening people with not being able to see him if they did something she didn\u2019t approve of - like my mum saying she didn\u2019t trust my sister\u2019s husband as he was engaged to someone else who\u2019d just had his baby when he left her for my sister, never wanting to look after his other son again. My sister revoked all access to my nephew, didn\u2019t even let my mum see him when he was born. She even told my mum to come see her at the hospital, then left before my mum could get there and refused to let her into the house. It got harder to do that once he got older. We were inseparable, so he\u2019d ignore her when she told him he couldn\u2019t come see me because she\u2019d have an argument with my mum and decide she didn\u2019t deserve to see her grandkids. \n\nWhen he died, it became very apparent she was going to use him as a weapon again. When she caught me smoking, she\u2019d say \u201cwhat would ryan think?\u201d (He also smoked, sometimes with me). If she was ever losing in an argument, or when she was called out on her shitty behaviour, she\u2019d start crying and say \u201cyou don\u2019t understand! I\u2019ve lost my baby!\u201d. \n\nI had an argument with her early this year. We were planning my mum\u2019s 60th birthday party, a surprise for her, and me and our other sister were sorting out everything, whilst she just had to get people\u2019s orders for the restaurant. She was in a shitty mood, and I had jokingly called our brother a nob. Not the harshest thing I\u2019ve called him, and he has said a lot worse things about all of us. She immediately starts on at me, calling me a lazy bitch and yelling at me for being mean to my brother, a man almost 20 years older than me and who didn\u2019t care if I called him a nob. I told her to calm down, and that she was taking things way out of proportion. She said she was stressed, and that she didn\u2019t want to go to my mum\u2019s birthday party anymore and I said \u201cwe\u2019re all stressed, but it\u2019ll be worth it when mum sees the effort we put in, so calm down and stop being selfish\u201d. That set her into a tirade of insults, and her only rebuttal was that I was being unfair calling her selfish after her son had died. I got angry and called her out on using my best friend to guilt me into backing down over an argument she started. And that ended our entire relationship. \n\nWe stopped talking for months. She made my fianc\u00e9\u2019s life a living hell at work, causing his mental health to deteriorate which lead to him needing time off for stress under his doctor\u2019s orders, which he was subsequently fired for. She bitched about me to everyone, sending the texts I sent her but conveniently cropping out the texts that made her look bad. All this time, I was petrified she\u2019d delete me off my nephews Facebook - which she\u2019d done to our sister to punish her for doing drugs. I use my nephews Facebook to message him when I really miss him, so losing that would have be agony for me. She finally tried to start talking to me again back in the summer because I had lent her \u00a3200 for an operation on her sick dog. I didn\u2019t want to make amends, I just don\u2019t want a dog to suffer because of an argument between me and her. It didn\u2019t matter in the end, as she let my nephew\u2019s dog, a gorgeous black lab he had loved and cared for until the day he died and who loved him and pined for him when he didn\u2019t come back from uni, suffer for months and months. She had a tumour on her belly, but she kept her hidden enough that by the time we saw it we knew it was too late for her. We tried to get her to take her the vets, but she refused, and Maisie died a few weeks ago. Of course, that meant my sister could post about how \u201cMaisie\u2019s with Ryan now, our precious little girl \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\u201d on Facebook. \n\nMy problem:\nToday we\u2019re meant to be spending the evening at my sister\u2019s. I don\u2019t want to be around her and her hypocritical grief and her desire for sympathy. I want to mourn him on my own, away from her so I don\u2019t cause an argument or spend the entire day seething with anger. I can\u2019t forgive her for the argument we had this year, I can\u2019t forgive her for treating my family like shit, and I can\u2019t forgive her for neglecting her dog in favour for the 4 others she has. I told my mum I don\u2019t want to go, and my mum is angry at me, saying I\u2019m selfish for not wanting to support my sister on this tough day. I\u2019m happy to be civil when I must, but today I cannot. Today I don\u2019t have the strength to push that all out my mind. I just want to cry for him in my own time and in my own space, away from her.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

Sorry for bad English in advance, not a native.\n\nTl;dr: ghosted a person after they started acting clingy and weird.\n\nSo basically, i know this confession page on Facebook (yes i use facebook) that's pretty popular in my country, the point of this page is for people to make friends and write stories together (kinda like roleplaying but you can say it's more complicated). Now, i was pretty lonely back them, and so i thought it wouldn't hurt to give this a try, so i wrote a confession, introducing myself and stating my preferences, what kind of friends am i looking for,... etc. This wasn't the first time i've ever written a confession on this page, i actually got myself a few friends in the past so i figured this time would go smoothly again.\n\nOhhh was I wrong.\n\nAbout 4 - 5 people replied to my confession, said that they want to give it a try. I pmed all of them, none actually went well, but I'll talk about one person that really stood out, let's call her A.\n\nSo, since it was stranger on stranger communication, i didn't know anything about A, her facebook wall is mostly empty (only avatar updates etc but it's because she got her posts mostly set on Friends only). We talked back and forth, she introduced herself and lo and behold she's the same age as me, has the same hobbies, quite similar mood swings/personalities, so needless to say, we clicked. I thought i've just found myself a new friend and everything was going well, she seemed to have pretty severe anxiety, but at that point i did too, so i told her it's okay and we'll work through it together. Her next message was my first red flag, though.\n\nA said she easily develops a crush, is clingy, needs affection instantly, and by that i mean INSTANTLY. We'll get into details later, but the way she said these things kinda pulled me back a litte bit, but again, we seemed perfect, i didn't have no one, she didn't have no one, and it felt great again having a friend by your side.\n\nNow this is the part where it got really weird.\n\nAt first A and I talked a lot, days and nights for about 3 days, then I had to go back to school because, well, i had school and am still a student. She seemed to have studied in the mornings only while I had a full day (7am - 5pm, top tier school of the city, yes i'm an asian). In the evenings i needed to do homework, dealt with my stress and organized myself, so needless to say, i didn't have the time give her much affection and even if i did, i think couldn't have brought myself to do it due to all the shit i'm going through (depression made me lose interest in everything). A on the other hand was free as hell, and messaged me every. 10. minutes asking what i was doing, could we talk, she missed me,... Keep in mind, I've only KNOWN her for like a week or less, so it was really weird to me. I tried to replied to all her messages saying i got homework to do, i didn't feel like talking, i was busy etc. She was kinda upset, apologized for being \"annoying\" and left me alone, for about an hour before she started doing it again. She said i didn't initiate conversations and that hurt her, so i promised i would start to initiate conversations with her from that point on. This went on for like 2 - 3 days, I was busy, she demanded affection, we only really talked at night and even then, i didn't really felt like talking and that she was taking all of my free time, she needed instant comfort, affection and reassurance so she wouldn't have a breakdown. I was tired dealing with my depression alone, so I was pretty strained by giving everything i had to her yet not having the guts to talk about my personal problems yet (like come on, would you tell a stranger on the internet that you've known for a week about your personal life? no). I went to ask a few friends about this, what should i do, and almost all of them said I should cut A off. I agree with this idea, but I myself hesitated to actually do it because i'm scared she would throw shit on me and breakdown-- It's actually really hard to confront a person with mental illnesses because you feel like their life's hanging over your head and one wrong move, they're dead. This doesn't defend my action though, and if i'm the asshole, i'm still the asshole.\n\nSo that led me to one final decision.\n\nI ghosted her.\n\nAt first she kept on messaging me like usual, asking me where I was, why I didn't talk to her, saying she missed me, she apologized if she did something wrong and wished i would come back. I ignored it all. It stopped for like a week, then there they were, the final messages she sent me were super long, like a 5 page microsoft word essay, talking about her past traumas, people that have left and hurt her, why she is annoying, why she hates herself, all kinds of stuff. I was scared at this point. Like, genuinely scared. So, I left her messages there for about 3 weeks before i finally decided to take out my trusty computer, install an unseen extension and see her messages. She has blocked me, but it still shocked me to the core seeing what she wrote to me, how unnerving and weird it was, i feel like i dodged a bullet, but it still made me questions if i was really an asshole because i feel like i couldn't help her through her hard time, gave her the affection she needed and ghosted her in the end. I feel like she's not at fault because the human mind can be weird sometimes, along with her obvious mental problems.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

So I like this girl in our high school, she is in the same class as me and we we are very good mates. So over a video call I told her that I liked her and we decided to go on a date. It was a pretty nice date, I had a nice time anyway, and that was that. We had been messaging very often since then at which point I asked her if she wanted to go any further with the 'relationship'. As she had recently came out of a long-term relationship, she said she wasn't quite ready but she liked me too - which I accepted. I left it a little while and we continued messaging and voice calling most days until last night. Where she messaged me and said \"sorry for not messaging you I was at the cinema\". I received this message at midnight so I thought obviously her parents have been out with her all night or.... She went to the cinema with another guy. I asked her who she went with and she replied with \"someone\", at which point alarm bells started to ring. I called up some mates to help me out and to find out who this girl that I really like went to the cinema with and after several messages and me getting quite confused and upset about the whole situation we found out that she went out with a guy, from the grade above me.

POST : Background: My husband and I have three kids together: one from his previous  marriage (17) and two from our marriage (14, 16). We obviously love them all equally, and treat them all the same. The two kids from our marriage are in out of school sports, with one getting private swimming lessons and the other being involved in drums corps, which is basically professional marching band which you pay to participate in. The one from our previous marriage had  not involved in any extracurricular activities outside of school so far.\n\n\n\nThat said, my husband works at a gym that teaches all sorts of martial arts, so you can imagine how excited he was when our oldest said he wanted to start practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu! The same day our kid told us, he got it cleared with his boss and told us at dinner that his boss was perfectly okay with him training at their gym for free. \n\n\n\n\nWe thought he would be excited, but he was seemingly disappointed. He said he did not want to train at the same gym at my husband, because it would be weird to get lessons from him. (My husband teaches Brazilian Jiu Jitsu every other day) I think my husband was hurt by this, but told him it would be fine if he went only on the days he was teaching the cardio classes so that they wouldn't  train together, but our son wasn't having it. He said it's not fair that the other kids were getting their activities paid for, and that we couldn't pay for his. I sort of see where he's coming from, I'm sure at his age it seems unfair, but my husband was not having it. He told him he should be grateful for the free lessons, and that he would be learning the same things at a gym we pay for anyways. They had an argument, and now our son is accusing us of playing favorites, as we pay for the other kids' stuff.\n\n\n\n\nI'm honestly torn about the situation. Like I said, I'm sure as a teenager it may seem like getting the hand me down clothes while everyone else gets brand new stuff. At the same time, my husband insists that it would be wasteful to pay for something that is being offered for free, and I see that point. The lessons he would be getting at another gym cost around $120 a month in a class setting, and $200 plus a month for the hour and a half long private and semi private lessons he would be getting for free at my husband's gym. To play devil's advocate though, I think my husband was very hurt at our son not wanting to train with him after he got so excited about it all, and at this point is just trying to win the argument. \n\n\n\nSo Reddit, what do you think? Is it fair to stand our ground and tell him to attend my husband's gym, or is it fair to pay for lessons elsewhere? I honestly want to be fair to everyone, and make sure nobody gets their feelings hurt!", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : Hi folks, this is something that has been pressing my mind for a while, and after some more recent events, it's been heavily on my mind. Sorry it's a little long, but I'll put a TL;DR at the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 21-year-old college psych student who is about eight hours away from her parents. My mom and dad are divorced (I believe they divorced in 2008) however they keep in very close contacts with each other. Like, people mistake them as a married couple all the time. This is relative but isn't the issue I'm having.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom has a lot of mental health issues and is very gullible when it comes to social media. In the past year, she met someone online, on a popular dating app. The guy is pretty good looking from his pictures, in the army, and I guess he is very charming. I say I guess because she has never physically met the man but is obsessed with him. My mother is almost 60 years old, and this man looks like he's in his early 30s. Which, hey their both adults. What bothers me is that the man (I'll call him R) ask for money constantly to where it has put my mom very far in debt. I believe he is a catfish trying to scam my mother. Every time he says he's going to meet her, he never shows up and says that he can't because 'the captain wants him to stay' or 'he doesn't have the money to get back.' R also says he's in the military (I think the Army), but the pictures he's sent my mom are always in different uniforms. I don 't know a lot about the military, but I know that if you're in the Army, you usually don't wear a Navy's uniform, or etc. Yet, the pictures have different uniforms on each time. Also, the guy always looks different to me in each photo, as if they were different people.\n\nR also asks for ridiculous amounts of money too, the most he has asked for is $4,000 in USD, but wants them sent to Ghana. Before my third year of school started, my mom said that if I wanted to live there I'd have to send R $3000  (I had some money from a car accident I was in and was compensated for) and we would call that the rent. Because I had nowhere else to go (I will explain why in a bit) I did it. I'm not proud of it, but I didn't really have a choice. \n\nMy mom has also asked me to text R, and I say no because I don't trust him and she becomes verbally and emotionally abusive when I say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, is generally a nice guy. I'm really close to him, and he's a bit more street smart. However, my dad does a lot of dangerous shit like drugs and hangs out with crowds I'm not comfortable with. He also believes that R is a catfish, but my mom will lash out at my dad too. My mom thinks my dad is still in love with her, which is not the case. My dad has an on-and-off-again girlfriend who I will call B. B I have met, and from what I have seen about her, I also do not trust her. She has been civil with me, so I return the favor. However, she is more addicted to drugs then my dad has many accounts on apps like Tinder, POF, etc. and she gets physically abusive on my dad. For example, B once threatened to stab my dad, then she blamed her 'rapid mood swings' on being diagnosed with Bipolar 1. (Which btw, that's not how Bipolar works, people with Bipolar do not become rapidly and dangerously angry in a few hours.) People with Bipolar usually go from manic to depressed at the quickest, in a month.) So I think B is really dangerous for my dad.\n\nMy dad will also expect B of cheating on her because she was an 'adult entertainer' before she met my dad. She will go out at odd hours and come home 3 hours later. My dad gets really mad about this, and once he strongly thinks she is cheating on him, he will think he has her, come to me or my mother, bawling his eyes out, plot some type of revenge on B (getting her housing taken away, getting her arrested for prostitution, etc.) though after a week they will get back together. This cycle repeats once a month.\n\n Because my dad stays with B, when they fight, he is homeless and asks me for money. They live in a pretty bad area of town too that is known for gangs, drugs, prostitutes, and dangerous crimes, (I've been groped by strangers when I went to high school in his area twice) so I refuse to go live down there. \n\nI'm okay with my parents venting to me because, hey, we all need an open ear, but when I try and offer them advice they either ignore it, get mad at me, or block me. A few weeks ago my dad ranted about B kicking him out again, only for today he got back with her and now is thinking about moving cities with her. They broke up the 10th of February and made up the 14th of February. (I wrote this on the 17th of February) I told him that maybe they should really think this over, since it's been an off an on thing for a while, and if your name is both on a lease, then it will be hard for him to get out of that. He told me he talked it over with B, and they would be happy, and he wasn't worried about a 'little fight.' And it's not kind of judge B.\n\nMy mom asked me to text R because they got into a fight, and I said, no because I don't feel comfortable fixing their fight. My mom told me to go fuck myself because I don't like R. My mother even said that if it was my dad and her getting back together, then I wouldn't fight them on this. This is also untrue because they are very unhealthy for each other too.\n\nAs you can see, I'm very upset about this, and I told both of them that I was tired of being a scapegoat and if they didn't want to listen to the issues I have with their S.O then I'm not going to talk to them. Both of them are in a very unhealthy relationship, I don't really like either of their S.O, and I don't want to really talk to them until they break up with them or get some help, which they don't do either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth don't really have anyone to talk to because my mom is a hermit (literally, she stays in her house all day) and my dad doesn't trust his friends. Both have been known to have suicidal tendencies, and I feel like if they did break up with their S.O and I didn't talk to them, they might try to kill themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister and my friends think it would be a good idea to not talk to them because I'm in the middle and they use me as a stress relief more than an ear. My brother and some of my family thinks I'm being too hard on them and to not give up on them because they are family and if I give up on them they might hurt themselves, and I'm being selfish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in my 3rd year of college and getting ready to explore grad school. Part of me even wants to move out of the state because my life is less chaotic when I don't have to deal with their bullcrap. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I think my parents are in unhealthy relationships and they want me to fix everything. I tell them I don't want to hear it, and not to talk to me until they break-up with them.

POST : To preface this, I have severe depression, and have few friends, and of those friends there was only one I trusted with anything to do with my depression. The other day I was struggling with it, and texted him about it, and he told me that all I ever do is complain even though my life isnt so bad, and I'm always inconsiderate of him. I didnt respond, gave myself a few days to clear my head, and realized that I dont really want to fix a friendship with somebody who thinks that about me. Problem is I've been storing my computer at his house due to unrelated reasons, which led to this conversation\n\nMe: I'll come over sunday to get my computer\n\nHim: so you have no desire to fix our friendship\n\nMe: I think it's best for both of us if I distance myself for now\n\nHim: Distance yourself from what\nSo this says to me so this says to me that our friendship means so little to you that you have no desire to try and fix it\n\nMe: I'm trying to figure out how to explain this without hurting any feelings but dammit it's not easy. To put it bluntly you dont believe in depression, and it's impossible to make any progress with depression if your support system doesnt believe in depression\n\nHim: You're absolutely right however if you really believe I don't believe in depression then you don't know me at all and you're right we should just end this now. Goodbye Panda\n\nMe: From everything you've said it sounds like you dont, what really ended up getting me was \"your lifes not that bad\" when that really doesnt have much to do with it\n\nHim: You're right however you should also understand that I was in a pretty rough space that day and pretty angry. And I don't believe that the fates are against you however I have never said that I didn't think you were depressed I know you're depressed I've worked very hard at trying to support you and getting help. But I guess that doesn't matter\n\nMe: It's not the first time you've said something like that that's bothered me, I just kept my mouth shut because i didnt want to hurt your feelings. That being said I would be willing to be more considerate of you, but you have to put in the effort too. I know I should be considering how your doing more, that's something I need to work on, but it's up to you\n\nHim: The problem Panda is because you haven't told me when I said things that bothered you I don't know when it is so now you're going to ask me to be considerate when I don't know when it's been bothering you so then I'm going to not be considerate cuz I don't know and we're going to be right back to where we started\n\nMe: Would you like me to start pointing them out? Cause I can, I just dont like to make people feel bad about things they've said\n\nHim: Honestly at this point I don't know if this friendship is salvageable.\nThe reality of the situation to me cuz I expressed myself in a way that was a little harsh however it still holds true that I feel like you don't really care about my feelings or what's going on with me. And your response is to one put that second to your own concerns belittle me for not caring about you and then putting conditions on trying to fix our relationship\n\nMe: That's not what I was suggesting. Both issues are equally important to me, but if that's how you see it then so be it\n\nHim: I really don't think you understand what I'm saying or that you don't care to understand what I'm saying I don't know what it is.\n\nMe: Funny I'm getting the same impression from you.\n\nHim: I don't see anything funny about this\n\nMe: So nothings changed.

POST :  \n\nSo I\u2019m a second semester freshman at my college, and throughout my entire first semester I was having a fair amount of issues with my roommate (whose name will remain unrevealed for the sake of her and me just in case she finds this and figures out it\u2019s me).\n\nShe never paid for her half of the microfridge, which I asked her about a few times. She also would regularly use it for her own food, and would stick her disgusting, smelly fucking pizza (I swear I\u2019ll never get a job at Dominoes with how much I ranted about it online) in the fridge and store it there for a week. After I started to sort of push her out by storing my food in there more and more (up to that point I had only put in a few water bottles), she starting leaving her pizza OUT in the room for around a week and a half at a time. I actually had to buy multiple, very strong air fresheners to block out the scent, but one time, near the beginning of the semester, it got so bad that I couldn\u2019t fall asleep because the scent was causing my eyes to water. That too was something I addressed with her, and she even admitting to not liking Dominoes that much. Then, when I got back from winter break, while my mom was helping me get settled in again, she noticed just how filthy she had left the freezer and microwave. They were disgusting, and my mom even said that we would probably have to use an ice scraper to clean it.\n\nShe also continuously used her phone and played videos (a lot of which were really high pitched, annoying videos) without headphones, which I called her out for three times throughout the semester, and while she did stop for a bit, she started up again around the end. After one of my confrontations with her, SHE asked ME to not use my alarm (a Sonic alarm), which I need to use because of the fact that I\u2019m a very heavy sleeper, who can\u2019t wake up on time without it. My disabilities counselor (I have a fairly bad case of ADHD) even recommended it for me. She also was very loud when she was on the phone with her friends. Meanwhile, the one time I was getting into an argument with my parents on the phone (they were fighting about something while I was trying to get something done with their help), she told \\*me\\* to quiet down.\n\nThere are also other, minor things she did that annoyed me. She would knock my trash can over whenever it was near the middle of the room, so it would fall over and shit would fall out, but instead of picking it up she would just fucking leave it and all the shit that fell out all over the floor. She slept with her head on the side of the microwave (we had our beds aligned parallel against one of the walls , with the microfridge in the middle). This made it harder for me to use the microwave, especially because she would charge her phone using the microwave outlets. She seemed to have a 9:30 lights out policy, because she would always turn the light off around that time. which fucked with me because I\u2019m a late night owl. She would use my fan which I had bought for myself during the heatwave we had at the beginning of the semester, and then have the audacity to point it at herself alone. When we were both up late working on something and our movement sensitive light would turn off, \\*I\\* would have to be the one to get up to turn it back on, even though she was on the side closest to the switch/sensor, because she would just let it stay off. Meanwhile, it was also harder to get it to turn back on because her stuff was in the way of the sensor.\n\nAdmittedly, I have my own issues that prevented me from addressing this with her directly most of the time. One of the symptoms of my aforementioned ADHD is that I have RSD (rejection sensitive dysphoria), which causes me to have a sort of fear of rejection times ten. The thought of bringing up some of this with her, especially the minor things, actually causes my heart to start clenching up on itself. As for the things I have already addressed with her, I actually get more and more afraid to ask again the more I have to so, because the possibility of her getting angry at me gets larger in my mind the more I ask. I\u2019m also afraid to bring it to my RA, because I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll see my problems as being minor OR she\u2019ll bring it up to my roommate and that\u2019ll make things more tense. I also just had an internal issue with doing anything involving cleaning while she was in the room; it made me uncomfortable to do so. Also a side effect of my ADHD, I have SPD (sensory processing disorder) which causes me to either desire sensory input sometimes, or suffer from sensory overloads. This seems to mostly effect my auditory input especially. For example, I need there to be at least white noise in the background wherever I am, because the sound of silence is very unnerving to me. However, sudden loud noises, or more than two loud noises at once, or even the sound of someone talking to me while I\u2019m in pain, cause my senses to go into absolutely overload, so my annoyance with her seeming lack of headphones is more along the lines of almost panic inducing at times.\n\nNear the end of our first semester, I remember her telling me that she was probably not going to be coming back for the spring semester. I got excited. No roommate, and no more from her? I thought it was great. I didn\u2019t tell her that mind you, but I still thought it. When winter break started, her name seemingly disappeared from where my it was supposed to be listed for indicating who my roommate was. It stayed that way for five whole weeks. I was beyond excited at this point.

POST : Using a throwaway because I\u2019m not ready to share these feelings with anyone who knows me. \n\nA little background, I started dating my wife in high school and we have been together for 15 years and married for 7. My wife is the most beautiful, caring, kind hearted, and affectionate woman I have ever met.\n\nAbout 10 years ago she was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis, an Irritable Bowel Disease similar to Chrons Disease, except that it is isolated to the colon. After years of failed medications, we made the decision about a year ago to opt for surgery. \n\nSurgery entailed removing her entire colon (large intestine), creating a stoma, and attaching an ileostomy bag. With the surgery my wife is now symptom free and happier than I have ever seen her. \n\nThere is a follow up surgery called J-Pouch surgery, where they remove the stoma, create a sudo-colon by stretching the small intestine, and reattaching it to the anus. Our plan is too get this surgery, however, it affects the ability to get pregnant and we also want to start a family. So our plan with the surgeon was to have our kids, and then go for this surgery afterwards. \n\nThis is where the problem comes in. My wife\u2019s biggest fear going into all of this was that I would no longer find her attractive. If I am being completely honest, I had a slight fear of this too, but to me her health was priority 1 and I didn\u2019t want to see her suffer with her disease anymore. To me she was (and still is) the most beautiful woman in the world and nothing would change that. \n\nPost surgery, I am having a hard time being intimate with her. I do not find her stoma repulsive but it does make me uncomfortable, and things like going down on her (which I used to love) are unpleasant for me now. \n\nI\u2019m worried that if I share my feelings with her, I will break her heart and strain our marriage, but I\u2019m also not sure how long I can fake intimacy.

It's not, and I tell him as much, and he immediately goes off on me about how I'm being hugely inconsiderate to the pet owners in the neighborhood, because they still have to walk their dogs in the winter and how it's terrible that he has to be extra sure that his dog isn't hurt by the salt because of people like me. I kinda brushed him off, and after he saw that I wasn't going to engage with him, he left.\n\nNow, a couple of points in my defense: I don't have any pets. Pet safe rock salt is both more expensive ($11/bag vs. $4/bag) and it's a smaller bad (fifteen pound bags vs. twenty pound bags). This guy lives at the other end of the street from me, almost a quarter of a mile away, and he doesn't bring his dog this far down the street often anyway, as it apparently is old and has medical issues (this was all mentioned in his rant about how inconsiderate I was being).

POST : Pretext - In college I had a friend group which occasionally involved a gender neutral person and an ace / trans. Statistically the percentage of non-cis non-hetero people in the group was pretty high but I didn't notice, or did I really bother to find out the specifics of each persons situation. Just didn't seem super important to know just to hang out with them in a group you know? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway fast forward, towards the end of college and out of college, and occasionally these people come up in conversation. When speaking about them my friends use pronouns such as \"they\" to refer to them, and they try to make it look organic but I can tell the flow of their speech is a little off for the sake of accommodating a person not even involved in the conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally don't use \"they\". It's not that I find their situations to be illegitimate or anything, that part I couldn't care less about. It just seems cumbersome to have to remember to alter my speech patterns for this one specific circumstance to avoid being accidentally offensive or something. I understand \"they\" can be used both as a plural and singular, but at least the way I speak I only use it as a singular referring to someone I don't really know, or speaking to someone about someone they don't know (see how I used they there talking about this hypothetical person that you don't know?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know, it's a nuanced thing and I understand it can work, but it's awkward to pause mid-sentence and change he or she to they just to seem super PC. It almost feels like virtue signaling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGetting around it I just use the persons name.

She left the apartment to pick up some things and came back saying things with \u201cwe\u201d and I was confused thinking she was alone. So I asked and she said she was with her friend. Then I asked if she and her friend were going to chill at my apartment and she then said yea if it was ok with me. I then told her that I thought it was a bit weird for people to be at my place, but since her friend was already there then they might as well. They hadn\u2019t moved her clothes or anything just gone to pick other stuff up from nearby. \n\nMy girlfriend was upset by this saying that she mentioned her friend helping her, but she hadn\u2019t mentioned when or that they were even together. I was more upset that she was inviting people, and I was the one that asked if they were hanging out at my place before she even mentioned it. She ended up sending her friend home and getting really upset saying that she wants to move out because I don\u2019t make it feel like her home too. In reality I know it\u2019s not a big deal if her friend had stayed to chill but I would have liked a bit more of a heads up than me asking if she\u2019s alone when in reality her and the friend are already driving to my place. \n\nSo AITA for getting upset ", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

They are the puppies of my old dog Zoey. She was my first pet and i loved her to death. I had her for two year, and then she got pregnant. See she was a pit/lab mix and the dad is a lab/retriever mix. We called around and found people to take all the puppies when they were born. When they were born there were nine. We managed to give away 7 of them to our close friends and family so they could still play together as they got older. We still had 2 puppies and Zoey, but Zoey was starting to get really  weak. When i took her to the vet, i found out that she had an issue with her heart and would due within the next month. So i took her home and told my parents and brother.\nMy brother then has the bright idea of keeping 2 of the puppies. One for him and my mom to share and the other one for me to keep when Zoey died.  I was pretty upset with him about that.  For the next month he would make snide comments about Zoey and how i should just have her put down early. We got into a fight and my mom told me to chill out because it's \"just a dog, your brother should be more important.\" So time passes, Zoey dies and i have one of her daughters as my new dog. The dog my brother kept was the largest of the litter. He also got a skin issue from Zoey because she was half pit. So my mom takes my brother and his dog to the vet to get special pills that will help his skin. After my mom was charged the bill she told my brother that he owed her for the pills ( it was around $88). He said he spent all of his money  on stuff for his wii u(lie). Then  my mom then tries to ask me for the money. I said no because 1. Its not my dog and 2. My brother does have the money, he just doesn't want to spend it on his own pet.

POST : **TL/DR: I have not spoken to a friend for a year or so because I felt ditched and left out.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (24F) and my friend (24F) have been friends throughout university and a little bit after that (so maybe 4-5 years in total). We used to be quite close and would support each other through difficult time. The event in question occured maybe 1-2 years after university. She and I lived in different towns at this stage and we agreed that we would spend some time around New Years at her holiday home. \n\nI brought my partner with me (30M) with her consent. She had her family over at that time (so mum, dad, brothers, etc), her partner (24M) and her housemate (24F). Several others were also present but not quite important to the story. \n\nHer holiday home is situated in a beach area. I have mentioned it several times that my partner is not that great at swimming (he can float and take care of himself in shallow water but he is not particularly confident in deep water). No issue arose so off we went to her holiday home. \n\nFirst day we (me and my partner, along with her and her partner) at the beach, enjoying the hot sun and water (you may now notice that I live in the Southern Hemisphere). It was great and it was fun. She then mentioned that the next day she and her partner would have to pick up her housemate from the airport (as she flew in) and she will be gone at most several hours. Obviously my partner and I felt a bit awkward since we did not know her family very well (but they were extremely kind) but we thought we could spend the second day just sightseeing and going to the beach again just us two. So second day, off she went to pick up her housemate. \"Several hours\" turned into the whole day  - while I was irritated I understood that they might want to stop at several places along the way.\n\nThis is the first time I met the housemate - I really tried to talk to her and get to know her but I had a feeling she did not like me very much from the way she brushed me off. I don't want to sound too high-schooly since we were adults but it also felt like she did not like that we were there with my friend (as in, she wanted to be the centre of attention). I am a pretty quiet person so I couldn't care about attention, and I slowly allowed her the limelight because to be honest, I kind of just wanted to spend time with my friend since we haven't seen each other for a while and I did not really care for the competition.\n\nThird day - we all (including her brothers) went to a swimming place (like a creek area not a beach). I let her and her housemate, her brothers, and her partner have fun in the deeper end while I hang out with my partner at the shallower end. We weren't being downers - we laughed at their dives and encouraged them to have their own fun as we were actually enjoying ourselves as well. That night, we were playing cards against humanity and I thought we were all having fun. But maybe sometime during I must have annoyed my friend because she all of the sudden went off to do something else (with her housemate following her) while I continued to play the game with everyone else. \n\nFourth day - during the morning, my friend came up to me and told me that her, her housemate, and her partner wanted to go on their boat. The conversation goes something like this:\n\n&gt;Her: Hey, we wanted to go on the boat today. Sorry but it can only take 3 people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Oh ok I guess... so I'm guessing it's just you, \\[your housemate\\] and \\[your partner\\]?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Her: Yeah, are you and \\[my partner\\] have any plans today then? You can totally go to the beach again  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: I guess we could. I'm sure we will find something we can do. \n\nFor some reason, I was extremely angry at this point. I quite literally came all the way down to her place to see her and spend time with her as friends. But I felt ditched and quite frankly if I wanted to just spend time with my partner I WOULD JUST GO WITH HIM ELSEWHERE. It could also be the compouding effect of everything else that happened - feeling left out because of her housemate's attitude, her ditching me on the second day for the whole day, and me feeling quite out of place with her family members (I'm really shy and while I can hold conversations I don't generally like to be with people I don't really know that well). Also just as a background: I always try to make plans with her when she's in my town (she goes often because her partner lives in my town) and she would normally cancel (myriad reasons). This may have also fueled my anger slightly. \n\nShe may have ditched me and my partner because of his swimming issue - valid reason but in my mind, I would never ditch someone like that. I would try to actually find activities that we could all do together, but I guess what I would have done in her position is not really that relevant. \n\nI talked with my partner and we decided that we want to go home (it's within driving distance for us). However, I felt bad for her family's hospitality to us (they were really kind and did not charge us for staying with them and fed us) so we bought them an expensive bottle of champagne and some more BBQ type food for everyone as a thank you. I gave these to her mum while my friend was out on the boat, we then gathered our things and we left without saying goodbye to my friend. \n\nShe tried calling that night, and I eventually told her that I was back home (I kept it civil, I didn't call her names or even express my anger at her). We have not talked since then (this was 2017-2018 new years), and this has been on my mind a lot lately. I guess I want to know if I'm the person in the wrong for not reaching out because of this.

POST : First time poster here, English is my second language, I hope I'll be able to explain the situation correctly! It's a long story, so here i go!   \n\n\nBackground : I (20M) am living with four other room-mates at my old mother's house. Since she wasn't able to sell it, she rented it to me and my friends (one guy and two girls). Note that we did not sign a lease, since it was a friendly agreement. At first, the rent was a bit expensive for only four people, so one of the girl brought her friend (26F) in September. It wasn't sure how many months she was supposed to stay, but we were pretty happy about it. When I met her, I immediately knew that she was the anxious kind of person, and I felt for her. But I didn't know what was to come.\n\n&gt;Her presence alone changed the dynamic in the house. She decided to buy a cat (to help reduce her anxiety), even thought the first floor was supposed to be cat-less because there is one girl that is allergic. I had cats that stayed in the basement and they had fights with the new cat, which she indirectly blamed me for. Every time I encountered her in the house, I tried to have a friendly chat with her, but I felt some weird tension. When I asked her for simple services, such as a little bit of olive oil, it always seemed to disturb her and she often declined with what seemed a lack of empathy. Often, I put that on the account of her anxiety disorder (she eventually told me she had one) and let it go. But then, she also started complaining about the housework in a backdoor way. For example, she left a list on the fridge on the 'steps not to forget when cleaning the kitchen' and notes such as \u00abParasites are at our door!\u00bb. Me and the other guy knew that it concerned us, we just didn't understand why she didn't told us about her discontent first. We did not felt good about it. Also, whenever she wrote in our house group chat, it was only to complain and express her discomfort about something.  \n\nAs you can see, I had my load of anxiety living with her and I considered many times having a talk about the situation, to explain how and why we feel uneasy, and also to understand why she acted that way. I never did, since I knew she would not be at ease and would start to either blame herself of reject the blame. Months passed and it was going fine, until she started worrying about what was going to happen in July 2019 (we were in January, btw). Since I did not want to live with her another year (and since the other girls were moving out of town next summer), I told her she'd have to look for another place to stay in July. Then, one week ago, she told me she had found a new place to stay and that she would leave at the end of the month. I was kind of shocked. I asked her if she would at least pay her rent for March, which resulted in a categorical refusal. I told her that usually, when leaving a housing, you need to notify one month in advance, therefore that she had to pay for next month also. Big anxious no. I asked again. Still refusing, saying that she won't pay for two rents at once, that she already signed the lease at the other place and that anyway, she hadn't signed any lease with us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's when I lost it. I got really pissed off, I raised my voice and started ineffectively asking again and again. I was boiling. She repeated that there was no lease. I shouted \u00abWell if there is no lease, we could just kick you anytime we want and you'd have no right to stay here!\u00bb \\[Still refusing\\] \u00abDon't expect to stay the whole month here\u00bb. I then left the house for the rest of the day. When I came back, she was gone. She took all her things and left. \n\nI had talked about this with my friend and he agreed with me that she was a toxic person. But the girls were on her side, even thought we never talked about it. I know it wasn't right to burst in anger and shout at her, but I feel that it was justified. Am I the asshole?

POST : On mobile and I'm sorry for formatting.\n\nSome backstory:\n\nI've been with my SO for three years now going well into our fourth. I am Filipino/Vietnamese and she has a Greek/Italian background. When we started dating I couldn't meet her parents because they originally disapproved of her dating someone that wasn't of European decent and so we had to keep our relationship quiet. Her Mum caught on but we then found out she doesn't mind us dating as long as her daughter is happy. She only took on that mentality because of her husband and upbringing but had since moved on from it and changed her mentality. But her Dad has been a struggle. My SO has tried telling him on multiple occasions that we were in a relationship and every time she brought up the subject of dating, he would always mention that dating someone out of their original race or skin colour was a bad thing because you're not respecting your heritage and he would sometimes even get angry and threaten suicide if he found out anyone in the family was dating someone of a different ethnicity. Throughout the years her Dad has been abusive and emotionally manipulative. He has OCD and gets everyone to do work for him around the house and things like that because he has a lot of triggers for it. He has always blamed someone or something else when things go wrong and has never thought to look inward and take the blame. He once got violent after she came home late because she was out with me and a few mates. He knew I was a close friend and definitely did not want me dating his daughter and would call me really shitty and derogatory names according to my SO. \n\n\nRecently in the past year her Dad had been kicked out of the house and after an incident that turned violent in the house involving my SO's Dad and her Brother. He is now cut off from the family and my SO is the only who talks to him now. She has since told him of our relationship. She mentions every now and then her Dad wants to take us out to concerts and events and things like that, I laugh it off and make a joke about not wanting to go, but I'm still really hesitant to talk to the him or even meet him. A month ago he popped up to visit us out of nowhere and without warning and I had a panic attack and ran upstairs to our apartment and just freaked out and ignored her Dad. My girlfriend is starting to catch on and is actually wanting me to meet with him and try to bury the hatchet. I think that I am overreacting because he might actually be trying to fix his past mistakes but he still refers to me as \"The Asian\" instead of my actual name and seeing shit like that bothers me. I also don't want him around because from the texts I see he threatens suicide every time he doesn't get his way.

POST : I'm a 29 year old guy, and my friend, let's call her bestie, is a 30 year old girl.\n\nWe have a mutual friend who is borderline neckbeard/nice guy, has a crush on bestie, and is extremely creepy around her, to the point where he sits beside her, rubs her thigh, puts his head on her shoulder, invites her home for drinks at night etc. The thing is that she's happily engaged, which she has said many times.\n\nLast saturday we had a housewarming party for me, and both attended. Creepy friend did like he always does, and bestie was extremely uncomfortable but was otherwise nice to him, laughed and talked. More and more as the night progressed she turned to me to get away from him, which worked.\n\nAnyways, to the main point. Back on monday, or if it was tuesday, she posted a screenshot of him texting her about how nice it was to see her again and that she missed him. We both laughed about it, but this is where things apparently turned sour;\n\nI wrote \"I hope you don't think of me as shitty for saying but, but I kind of think you kind of enable his behaviour. That Creepy friend is EXTREMELY slow in getting hints, and that she needs to give him an absolute verbal asswhooping, so that he understands, and finally stops. As long as you don't make your point absolutely 110% clear that you don't like him romantically, he won't stop, because he's slow.\".\n\nI thought things were alright, as all she said was \"I thought he'd understand with my ring on my finger and all\", and I didn't hear anything more... until about half an hour ago.\n\nShe wrote that she wasn't mad, but that she was flabbergasted and disappointed that I had written that to her.\n\nI immediately felt shame, and apologised and that I had no intention of it sounding like I blamed her, just that I wanted to fix the awkwardness between them, and giving my point of view as to how to fix it.\n\nWe quickly made up and things are good again, but it still got me thinking. AITA?\n\nI am in no way blaming my actions on this, but it's still important to know. I have mild Aspergers, which makes it sometime that stuff I say or write sometimes doesn't get interpreted the way I intend it t, and this is what happened here. \n\nWhat I thought was helpful advice, as I want bestie to be comfortable around creepy, I just said what I thought would help.\n\nI have no problem being the asshole, as I felt ashamed, and I apologised profoundly, but at the same time I want to hear other people's perspective as to WHY I would be the asshole, WHY what I said was interpreted as a rude thing to say, and how I should think about it in the future so I don't repeat it. \n\nLike I told bestie, I would neve rever intentionally hurt her, but that I'm struggling socially every day and I'm learning new social rules every day and that I'm willing to learn from my mistakes as I always aim to be the most kind-hearted person I can be.

POST :  I had two friends help build a PC back in May, with one being the subject of the post. He had helped me pick parts, and repeatedly said that he\u2019d be more than happy to help me build it. Important thing to note here is that it was never a point of discussion pre-build that I would be paying him to help. \n\nAs we start on the project, he\u2019s did nearly all the work besides grunt things my other friend and I did. He was very controlling over the whole build, but at the time I was just grateful he was helping me out. PC gets built, and I\u2019m ecstatic. I start to feel bad he did mostly everything, and so I nonchalantly tell him I owe him for it and that I\u2019d give him $20 for all the hard work at some point after I got my paycheck. A few days pass and while hanging out with friends he mocks me for not having \u201cpaid\u201d him yet. I found this odd as the tip I mentioned was more of a gesture that I would get to at earliest convenience, rather than an \u201cIOU.\u201d Almost every time I talked to him after building the PC he berated me for the $20, and it quickly started to piss me off until I finally decided fuck em\u2019 I\u2019m not giving him $20. Slowly we became distant, but this didn\u2019t stop him from nearly 2 months later bringing it up in a group chat that I had yet to pay him his \u201cfee\u201d for building my PC. I kept ignoring him until he started calling me a \u201cjew\u201d nearly every other sentence just because he was so butthurt I didn\u2019t tip him for what was originally just inviting my buddies over to help me build my PC. Finally I snap and tell him \u201calright what\u2019s your Paypal I\u2019ll send it to you\u201d and he obliges. I then sent him 20 payments of $1, knowing full well Paypal deducts per transaction, and he\u2019d only get around $15 of it. He messages me \u201care you fucking serious\u201d and then proceeds to breakdown what I did like I was 5 years old and didn\u2019t understand what I had done. I play dumb, say I\u2019m sorry and that I was just trolling him a bit, and offer for him to refund it and I\u2019d send it in full, but he takes all 20 payments anyways. I finally start to think this bs is over with, until today, nearly 10 months from when we built the PC, 7 months from when I paypalled him, he brings it back up in a group chat after getting roasted about something completely unrelated (and not by me), stating that I had never paid him for building my PC, and again calling me a jew. At this point I recap about everything I\u2019ve said in this post in the group chat, and that it was ridiculous that 7 months after I in fact paid him, with him only losing $5 of what I originally was going to tip him, he still proceeded to act like I was this grand cheap ass for thinking I had a friend who wanted to just help me build the PC at zero cost. We argue back and forth, with his core argument being that he shouldn\u2019t have had to say he wanted to get paid for it, I just should have been a good \u201ccustomer\u201d and assume he was not doing it for free.

Found out a short time later that he had a crush on me.  I let him know that i wasn't interested but that we could remain friends.  He was a fun person to be around and i had a lot of free time then so we hung out a lot.  His family was also very nice to me and often had me over for dinner and treated me like family.  His father even helped me get a better job where he works.  After a few months we became really close friends and i confided in him about a lot of personal stuff and really extended a lot of trust to him however he didn't let the crush go and became secretly obsessed with me throughout this whole time.  \n\nI ended up matching with this super cute girl on Tinder and we really seemed to be hitting it off.  So she gives me her number and we start texting.  Funny enough I come to find out she lives one street over from my friends house.  And my friend says he actually knows her, and that she jogs by his house all the time.  I try to meet up with her but her mother is dying of cancer and something always happens where she has to go be with her or help her when we were gonna meet up.  Of course i'm understanding of this i can't imagine what she must be going through etc.  She doesn't want to talk on the phone just keeps saying we'll meet up soon, this goes on for maybe a couple weeks, and things are starting to get fishy.  My friend tells me that he saw her at the store and started talking to her and brings me up.  She ends up hanging out with him a couple times when i'm conveniently busy or at work and then she would start talking about my friend with me and get super angry and stop talking to me for supposedly talking shit about him, even though i didn't.  But then he would talk to her and tell her what a wonderful person i was etc etc and she would give me another chance or whatever.  And i'm kind of getting fed up with this shit but at the same time I think that with her mother dying and all she's just having a rough time with it all.  So then one night i'm at my friends house and had a few drinks, so i'm staying the night and me and her are texting and she starts getting sexual.  But then it takes a twist when she starts to say that my friend, her and I should have a threesome.  Which i quickly shoot down.  So she says that I should just let him suck my dick and it would be real nice of me and that she'll make it worth my while etc.  So i'm weirded the fuck out now and know somethings up, So I confront my friend and he says he doesn't know he didn't tell her anything etc etc.  Still know somethings up, and I bring it up to one of his longtime friends and she tells me that he still has a crush on me and that he's catfishing me and that he's done this before.  So i immediately call him and confront him about it and threaten to cut him off cold unless he confesses the truth, and after 30 minutes of denying it, he finally confesses to making the whole thing up, he used some french instagram models pics and lied about her mother having cancer and everything.  \n\nTurns out he's a crazy compulsive liar.  So i'm furious and feel like a chump and don't talk to him for a week, he keeps trying to apologize and tell me he understands if i never want to talk to him again and he never meant for it to get that far he was only trying to make me feel good about myself that such a cute girl would be interested in me (which i don't need and it's a crock of shit) and all this i know i messed up crap.  \n\nNow his parents don't know he's gay and that any of this transpired and he tells me if i tell them why we're not friends anymore and out him that he's going to tell everyone what i told him (my brother is gay and my parents are super religious and would throw him out, and a bunch of other just personal things) And that if i embarrassed him he would do that to me and get me fired (His father is close friends with my boss and they talk as well).  So i tell him i'm not going to out him and end up staying kind of uneasy friends that drags on for a while cause i'm afraid that i'm going to lose my job if i cut him off, so that was 6 months ago but he's actually been better and his family has been very kind to me but I don't consider him a real friend, and i'm basically just pretending to be friends at this point and enjoying the perks (he has a pool) and knows a lot of people and cute girls i can get to easier.  He definitely has his issues but i think he might actually consider me a friend, I don't want him around long term but based on what i've seen how he's treated ex-friends i'm afraid of what he might do if i ditch him.  I should've just cut him off right after this happened but i didn't.  I thought i'd use him as revenge.  I'm passed that point i just don't care anymore but until i get a new job and other circumstances in life change I'm worried he might open his mouth, so i'm pretending be his friend to keep his mouth shut.\n\nSo, AITA for pretending to be his friend despite what he's done?

We met in high school and quickly became friends since we both were kind of the outcasts. He has always been the type of person who is kind of annoying but I never cared because I knew he was just trying to be funny. (side note, he has adhd) Well a few years after high school we ended up working at the same store and I thought it was great! I always enjoyed his company.  We went away to help build up a new store (Same store only in a different city) I really wanted him to go with me since he was my best friend and I'd feel so much better with him there.\n\nWhile working he would continue to be annoying, I thought I was used to it but I guess not. And after awhile he even been to be condesending towards me. Saying stuff like:\n\"You can't handle more then that?\"\n\"You are to slow, stop slacking\" (I was working to the point that I wanted to go cry in the bathroom because of my anxiety)\n\nI asked him to stop multiple times, and guess what, he didn't listen. So after 4 days of putting up with his crap I resorted to text him, telling him to stop annoying me and stop putting himself above me. It was my first time ever building up a new store and he had done it once before but also worked other jobs so of course he could handle the pain and long hours (it was 12 hour shifts with little to no breaks, was going to be working for 14 days ended up leaving after 5). He texted me back saying that I had never asked him to stop annoying me, never asked him to try and be nice etc. He even dragged his 3 year old daughter into it saying:\n\"Even my daughter (not going to write her name) knows how to say stop and she is 3!\"\n\"You learn how to say stop in kindergarten, maybe you should go back there\"\n\nAfter awhile I got tired of this and told him that I appreciated the time we had and hoped he had a good life.

POST : Let me preface this by explaining, I go to a pretty difficult high school where we learn hard courses and are expected to understand everything. While this is difficult we are supported by our great teachers who can teach very well.\n\nAbout two months we got a student teacher for my Literature class, she only teaches my period. She also goes to a really good college and is still learning how to teach fully. She\u2019s very interactive with students and follows what my normal teacher tells her to do. Previously I also had a student math teacher in which he stayed for a month taking notes during my period and taught a during a different.\n\nThe only issue is that she cannot teach that well, and is definitely not ready to teach at my school. She is not present for other lessons and only reads the lesson plan. Her handwriting is barely readable and we constantly have to pause to ask her what word was written. She grades overly harsh while barely teaching us half the material or creating terrible projects that are only based on prior knowledge. (One project was a trailer where I drew the unlucky straw and got a group where no one knew how to edit a video). This really showed with a recent test we had. My teacher said that we would be tested on quotes from one of the Shakespeare books we were reading while only getting a section of the quote. We had to identify the character, the context, theme and etc. All the quotes from the test we also supposed to be quotes we discussed before as well. After identifying all the quotes we\u2019ve studied it was pretty easy to study for said test. Only issue is, half of the quotes were never discussed.\n\nSome friends from another period felt the test was easy while basically everyone from my class struggled trying to find out what each quote was.

Mom was in poor health for the past two years. My brother has lived on her place rent-free for 20 years. Mom paid all his expenses for at least the last few years (he lost his job). His social security checks begin this spring, but they will be a modest $1,200 monthly.  \n\n\nMom's always been high-strung and high-maintenance. I loved her, but she made me crazy. So I told my brother he could have her land and mobile home if he would just take (better) care of her. I don't live nearby and still work 12-hour shifts. Well, he didn't take good care of her. At one point, I had to drive her to the emergency room because we couldn't get him on the phone. There were several other instances of him not caring for her, and not looking out for her like an unemployed son with absolutely nothing else to do should have been doing. I'm not saying I was any better as an absentee daughter, but we went on outings occasionally, and I definitely wasn't any worse as her daughter than he was as her son.   \n\n\nHer will leaves her estate to me and my brother, 50/50. I was named independent executrix. I knew mom had a life insurance split between me and brother, and also knew she had two CD's, one for each of us.

That's their understanding, at least.  \n\n\nAITA for keeping her cash assets, including the CD's. After the smoke clears and I pay for everything I said I would, it might be $25,000. Her home and land, otoh, are worth at least $68,000, with a fair market value of about $80-90,000.  \n\n\nWe went to probate hearing then had it out afterwards. They are very unhappy that I won't just turn over $10,000 to the two of them, even though I will only have about 25k, while they will have a minimum of 68k. My niece had shot a warning volley across the bow a few weeks ago when she said, \"Surely you realize property is not as valuable as cash. Besides, granny meant for me to have that money, and daddy to have \"his\" CD. (The CD's do not list any beneficiaries).  \n\n\nSo, AITA? And if they already think that I AM the asshole, shouldn't I just go ahead and make arrangements to sell the home and land so we can each get what we really think we should have out of mom's estate, 50% to me and my brother, $5,000 to my niece?", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

My name is Kyle / Dabstep, and this is a story about the standards of friends and how I believe you should never let people treat you however they like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere we go! I have had this friend since high school (best friend, even). He is 26 and I am 25. We have been through some thick and some thin, including school jobs and drugs. We have quite the history, but this last year he has proven to me that he is less than a friend to me now. He has asked me to be his best man at his wedding recently, where he is marrying his stripper girlfriend of 8 months. I don't necessarily believe in the wedding based on the number of times they have broken up in that 8 months, but I agreed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started off this year unfortunately moving into my parents house after breaking up with my girlfriend and not being able to move into a place on my own. I would go to his house quite often during this time to play games and hang out because being around my parents is pretty much the worst. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRyan lives with his Dad in the basement, where he hasn't had a stable last him a month for almost three years at this point. He survives because his Dad and his girlfriend (stripper) buy him everything he needs and makes it so he doesn't have to me motivated to do anything. I don't care about this too much as it doesn't effect me, but I can see how its changing him over the years. He hasn't tried to get a job in a very long time, and any job that he gets, he find a reason to quit it right away. The dude couldn't even deliver pizza because \"the job was bs\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSix months into living at my parents again, the arguing has taken a turn for the worst and I am debating living in my car because it sounds better than that. I tell him about this and he agrees to move me in at 300 dollars a month for at least six months, which was great and I moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometime after I move in, he notices my computer is standing up on a 20 dollar Walmart table I had just bought, and he offered to let me use a card table in place. I took it and let him use the table for his figures (this is important to the story).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso important to the story: he owes me 100 dollars because I bought him a bike so that he could get to work, a job he quit after a week. Whenever I ask about the 100, he simply says \"when I have a job\". It has been almost six months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne month later, he comes to me about how the room I am in is worth at least 700, and that I need to start paying more. This is bullshit and I argue about it but end up agreeing to pay 400 dollars per month. During this whole time I am unable to use the laundry, unable to store food anywhere, and getting blamed for food that is going missing (none of which was my doing).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother month in, he really starts hinting that he wants me to pay 600 or he wants me out sooner than 6 months. I told him that I don't have anywhere to go and that I am not moving into my parents house who I had just moved out of and his response is \"that sucks dude, start looking\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the beginning of the last month, I am coming home from my girlfriends house to see what he is up to, asking to hang out and play some games. He mentioned he was eating tacos, so I told him about how I had just eaten a breakfast burrito. Before I was able to continue and say that my girlfriend had made it for me at her house, he interjects and starts screaming at me \"oh so you fucking at my burrito this morning? you are a piece of shit and you need to be out by the end of the month.\" I try to say what is going on but he hangs up and texts me that he isn't going to put up with my bullshit anymore and that he told his dad, and his dad now wants me out.\" (for context, the missing burrito was out of a freezer pack of 8 el montereys)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I reluctantly set up to move in with my girlfriend into the smallest room that is now going to be shared. Three days before I move out, he comes to me and says \"hey man I am kind of an asshole about kicking you out over the burrito, if you need another month you can stay\" which is ridiculous to say to someone after they have been setting up to move out for the last few weeks. I say no and move out, in which I give him his card table back but don't ask for my table back because I didn't have anywhere to put it and he was conveniently using it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward three months to today, I have moved into my own house in a nice part of town, am living alone, but am very broke because of how much money I just had to put down on this place. I text him a few days ago \"hey man, is there any way I can get that table back? my TV is standing on a very crappy nightstand and I could really use it back.\" He is now saying that I gave it to him when I moved out, which I never did and would never have done. I have no furniture so I am not about to give out what little is mine. He has multiple tables to put all of his little things on. I have two for my computer and TV.  I explain this to him and he is not having it. He believes that because I used him as \"public storage\" for months for the table that it his now his and that I am \"Indian-giving\" as he said to me word-for-word. How do you argue with a 26 year old person that uses that term?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I asked him one more time today if I am ever going to see that table and he said \"Nah man like I said indian giving, buy yourself another table at Walmart\" to which I replied \"enjoy the table, find yourself a new best man\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas this the right choice? AITA? Thanks for taking the time to read this! Sorry I am not an English major, nor have I done any school in the last few years so bear with my grammar!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: \"best friend\" kicks me out over burrito I didnt eat, refuses to give me back a table when he owes me 100 dollars on top of it. I tell him I won't stand at his wedding that is in 6 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

My girlfriend is from China, studying in the United States. I am a domestic American student. This seems to be part of the problem. Whenever my girlfriend is having troubles with the school (dealing with different departments, or trying to ask questions/get help) she often will get frustrated and come to me for comfort. While venting, she often uses vast overgeneralizations that don't make me feel good and she expects me to agree and say similar things to help. \n\nBecause of this I'll lose my willingness to be supportive and help because I don't agree with these overgeneralizations. For example, she'll start ranting about how, because this one person in the one department wasn't able to help her right away, \"everyone in this country is just so inefficient, if this was China they would be fired.\" It annoys me mostly because from what she's told me, China is also very inefficient with many things and it feels like she's just criticizing my country while comparing to hers. I'm not some ultra patriotic person, but when she expects me to agree with everything she's saying, it makes me a little annoyed, especially since if I don't I'm \"not being supportive of her\" and \"arguing is not what [she] needs right now, it's not the time for [me] to talk about my opinion, I just need to be supportive\". \n\nThis problem also stems to other areas. For example, I introduced her to some of my friends, a girl and her boyfriend who I'm close with. We hung out with the boyfriend for a little bit while we had to wait for the girlfriend because she was stuck in a floor meeting at her dorm. Eventually she was done and we hung out for a little bit so they could meet and then we left. Afterwards, my girlfriend was annoyed and ranting how it's annoying that she (the girlfriend) made us wait so long. I tried telling her that there wasn't much she could do because she couldn't skip her floor meeting (otherwise the dorm wouldn't let her sign her boyfriend in to visit later that night). But she just told me she was annoyed that I wasn't taking her side and she just wanted me to criticize my friend to make her feel better (which I didn't want to do because I'm not about to bash my friends behind their back when they didn't do anything wrong in my eyes). \n\nSo AITA?

(Haha 12 girls for year 12). We weren\u2019t all that close as we friendship groups that kind of joined together after a lot of people left my high school. In that group, I had 2 girls who I considered my best friends since we were good friends since year 7. At the beginning of year 12 we all got along swimmingly but as we got into the exam period it got more and tenser and a lot of people\u2019s true colors showed up (mine included).\n\nSo, it all started with a girl I\u2019ll call TL. She was quite pretty and had long gorgeous hair. It was her pride and joy. Me and TL had a weird history of being friends and not being friends. We never quite clicked (despite the both of us going to the same primary school together) and it was the case of when we good we were very, very good and when we were bad we were horrid. And in year 12 we were horrid.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure what had gotten me so heated with TL that day, but we were throwing underhand jabs at each other in legal studies which carried out into recess. At one-point, TL stated that she wanted to be a model, specifically a hair shampoo model which I had bluntly replied: \u201cDon\u2019t you have to be pretty to be a shampoo model?\u201d (I know, that was unnecessary and cruel but I was angry and I saw an opening and took it). A few girls giggled and I threw her a superficial apology and forgot all about it. \n\nTL did not. My offhanded jab at her lead her to create a separate messenger group which was dedicated to her listing all my flaws such as that I was fat, my hair was too thin, my skirt was too short, and that people liked me so I could give them notes for the classes I was in (ouch but true). This side messenger group included my two best friends as well. They created events which they didn\u2019t invite me to, and only told me after it was over with excuses like \u2018oh we didn\u2019t think you\u2019ll like it.\u2019 I\u2019m sure TL had great pleasure in seeing me attempt to cover up my frustrations about being left out but I never really said much about it. After a few of these exclusions, I spent a lot of time in the library, studying or chatting with the librarians who took me under their wing and helped me find textbooks for my classes. \n\nBy the end of term 3 and with HSC looming overhead I thought TL had forgotten the whole ordeal but, alas, she had not. She created formal get together for the girls to buy dresses and hired a limo for the girls to go in for formal. All these small things hurt but it didn\u2019t really hurt as my two best friends going along with it and then later pulling me aside one day and unloading everything on me all at once. They showed me screenshots of the secret group chat and the circle jerks of TL and her close friends talking about me. It was a cold and hard reality check. \n\nSo high school comes and goes, and I get into the university of my dreams and I make a wonderful new group of friends. As time passed, I look back critically at my high school experience and realize I am not faultless (with my mouth I definitely unconsciously ruffled a few feathers)  in my exclusion from the group but my best friends, as well as the other girls who were neutral, were not faultless either. \n\nI unfriended everyone in that group including my best friends and put my best foot forward. And for a time, I was content with my decision. But then one day a girl who I\u2019ll call FH, used to go to my old high school and I befriended bought up my ex-friends. She told me they told her that they were hurt by my sudden decision to cut them off and that they believed I was taking out my inability to get over high school drama out on them. I told her that I wanted a fresh start. My ex best friends and the other girls were still friends with TL. They still went on outings and had meet-ups with her and her friends. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with that anymore. This back and forth went on for a while before FH told me that all my friends thought I was a bitch who couldn\u2019t get over some petty high school drama. To tell you guys the truth, this drama really fucked me up. I went to therapy for some time and even now with my close uni friends, I struggle to trust everything they say to face value. I\u2019m just waiting for the bomb to drop that they never like me and they befriended me because they felt sorry for me.\n\nI was content with my decision to cut them off before but now I\u2019m not sure. I feel like I should have said something or done something else.\n\nTL;DR I cut off old high school friends who are still friends with a group of girls who excluded me and talked behind my back for a year.\n\nAm I the asshole?

I am a college student looking to fill the room of a student in my apartment who is graduating. I also was looking for a summer sublease, but later learned from my landlord that we are not able to sublease per pur contract. Overall I had made two posts on Facebook groups, one for the lease and one for the sublease. After I learned that I could not sublease, I tried to disperse the sublease contacts and I deleted the post. Over a month later a girl who had contacted before me asked again if I still had a room available, and I said yes (I thought she was referring to the regular lease). We set up a date for her to visit but I had warned her to make other appointments or find something to do in town to make the trip worth it since she was going to be driving to see my apartment for over an hour and a half and I couldn't guarantee her the room unless we met and decided she would be a good fit. This afternoon she came out and I quickly learned that she was actually looking for a sublease and that our original conversation had been about just that. So she just quietly turned around and left.

She's in her early 30s and I'm only 20 btw so there is an age gap, I'm getting my life figured out and she... well has 3 kids. Due to being bipolar, depressed, anxiety and shit I have neglected my relationship with her at times (with all family at times as well) and now that I'm pulling my life together I am trying to be more involved with family, because I love and care for them and I'm really thankful for their support with my mental health struggles. My sister has really been a big help for me at times, when I had no one else I can count on her and been able to go to her house and hang out and with my nephews. Lately, I have not been hanging out with her, which I've recently noticed and I'm trying to make steps to fix. I posted on r/relationships about this, how I want to improve my relationship with her. The problem is, my sister does not plan well (according to my mom she never has, IDK) and I know that she is really busy. For example, a few weeks ago I called and asked my sister what her and the kids were doing Saturday, and if it was an option I could maybe join them. She said they were doing a community clean up with the city/boyscouts, and then a hike and then a movie in the park. I said I would go on the hike with them and then the movie, if she didn't mind. She said sure and said she would get back to me on the times then never did, so I didn't go. Then, on Sunday she calls me \"Hey, we are about to be at the house in 2 minutes to pick up something and go to the park, do you want to go?\" I said no because, I really don't like last minute things like that at all, anxiety wise. I like to be able to have some planning on when something will be, even if it's a day or two, it helps a lot. The problem is, I can't ever seem to plan something out with my sister, and it's all last minute things which I 9/10 times say no too, due to anxiety. Anyway, in r/relationships I got told by a couple of people that basically I'm being unreasonable and entitled basically, because she had 3 kids and is busy and I cant expect me to get preferred treatment.OK, I get it she is really busy, while I am not. I am 100% focused on bettering my mental health, so maybe I'm lacking perspective here. Am I an asshole for expecting my sister to be able to work with me on times to hang out, and not just last minute \"hey Im in town right now\" scenarios? Keep in mind, I am fine going out and doing her already planned activities with her and the boys as well, not asking her to cancel plans or work my in her schedule.   \n\n\nAlso, my sister is NTA, i posted on relationships to try and figure out how to talk with this about her and absolve this issue, because she's not doing it on purpose- I just got told I was wrong for expecting this for her.

POST : WIBTA if I tell my friend that he is being cheated on?\n\nI'll try to keep this story straight with names, it might get a little complicated. There's me, my gf (M), my gf's roommate (A), my roommate (T), and my friend (E).\n\nBackstory: Me, E, and T all good friends two years ago, freshman year of college. We hang out all the time, life's great. A and T meet and start hanging out, one night E asks me if I wanna come to the hookah lounge with him, A and T. I accept, and I meet A for the first time. Immediately she's off-putting. Making weird comments how how muscular I am, in front of two guys that clearly have huge crushes on her, and just overall having no sense of what to say in the room, really killing any vibe, you probably know the type. Anywho, I found out around present day that A told M right before she got with T that she was going to choose E, saying that \"he's THE ONE\", which is batshit crazy seeing as they have known each other for like two weeks and are 18.\n\nA actually ends up choosing T, and they have a long and horrible relationship filled with miscommunications, fights, drama, etc. M and I are on the sidelines of this because I live with T and she lives with A. At least once a week T goes to break up with her, but for some reason A thinks it has to be agreed on, and they end up fucking and just resuming the cycle. So much drama and it's pathetic because of how idiotic they act. They have no boundaries, A has taken condoms from M and I and denied stealing them, T never does anything for anyone but himself. it makes everyone so tired of them. Anyway, over last summer T finds a girl he actually likes for reasons outside of the bedroom, and breaks it off with A for good. T enjoys his new girl, but one night A comes down to our place BLASTED drunk and hits her head, passed out. Me and a friend take her to the ER because they cant afford an ambulance, and we are good friends, and don't want to see anyone die tonight. This seemed to be a wake up call for A. she goes home and lives with her parents for a bit, eventually comes back and see,s changed.\n\nA ends up getting with E, and they start spending all their time together, despite E seeing how A and T played out. Then, 2 days ago, T and her meet up at 11pm to \"delete their messages/pictures together\" (wtf). They end up staying the night at her place, and staying together locked in her room for the entire day and the majority of yesterday. We know they had sex, since M's friend saw condoms that aren't the brand A and E use (A tried to give M some back for the ones she stole), and given their history no one is surprised.\n\nT also left a big pile of his disgusting dishes in the sink for a week, and I put them on his bed last night so they would be out of the sink, which he got mad about, so I'm pretty much done since I asked him to clean them up 3 or more times.

Usually there was something going on and I get it, he can't be on his phone 100% while he is with family/friends/etc. But yesterday, that small 30 min. seemed deliberate. \n\nAnyways, I tried not to let it bother me.

While I was asking, I pointed to what I wrote, and the first thing my teacher did was read it out loud.\n\n\"(Cheater) is cheating\".\n\nMy heart sank immediately, and I knew he definitely heard cuz my teacher said it fairly loudly, and his name being in the message likely caught his attention. I don't think my teacher meant to read it out on purpose cuz he probably didnt know it was supposed to be for his eyes/ears only. He just said \"Yeah, I know\" which made it worse, so I just went back and sat down. The cheater was staring at me right after, and now I feel like shit. He is Chinese as well, and he's connected to a whole group of Chinese kids that are known for cheating (since they can whisper in mandarin so the teacher doesnt understand if he hears), so Im probably gunna be getting glares from that group in the hallways for the rest of my high school career. I'm not sure what I did was right or wrong, but I have little respect for chronic cheaters so it felt right at the time. Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR - Gave note to teacher telling him somebody was cheating, teacher read it out loud alerting the cheater that I was snitching on him, and he and his entire group probably hates me now.", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : Hi, I'd like to first give a disclaimer because I am on mobile.\n\nAbout a year ago when I graduated highschool I moved in with my sister who is 6 years older than me and has a daughter who is 10 years younger than me. It was great because she had an apartment with an extra bedroom, and I had no idea where I wanted my life to go after I graduated. Not to mention I had already been staying with her over weekends and breaks because my niece has a (currently undiagnosed) developmental delay, she barely talks or signs and can be a little agressive and clumsy, and my family does not trust her with people we don't know well.\n\nAfter less than a month of living with them my sister had helped me get a job in the pharmacy where she worked and everything was good. Then the next spring we decided it was a good idea to move across town to be closer to my niece's school because the apartment complex was horribly managed.\n\nWe were beyond lucky to get approved to rent half of a duplex 2 blocks away from the school and around 1.5 miles from our workplace for near the same price as our apartment. However that's when things took a slight downward turn.\n\nMy sister in general has always taken care of the bigger bills like rent, where as I take care of more of the smaller ones since I hadn't had as long as her to save up (babysitting all through high school ment it was pointless for me to get a part time job since i was never in town). This ment that while I was buying new household items we would need she was paying a month of rent on each place while we moved.\n\nAround this time my niece also needed to get dental surgery, which wouldn't have been bad if they hadn't had to put her under to do it (she gets aggressive around strangers especially ones that touch her) this came out to a much larger bill than my sister was quoted which lead to her being really stressed.\n\nGiven how stressed she was I was drawn to do anything I could to try and make her feel less stressed, as I tend to be a very empathetic person and her stress was physically effecting my neice and me. So I would buy her her favorite coffee, I started making more \"adult\" meals, and I also took to doing the dishes every night.\n\nIt's been nearly 9 months now and my sister is no longer a walking ball of stress, but I still clean the kitchen and do the dishes every night. And I know it shouldn't be a big deal. But I just find it exhausting after working all day while she's been home to just see a stack of dishes in the sink that I know I will end up cleaning.\n\nThe only times she's done the dishes are when I was sick or not home, and it's almost like she's come to a point of \"it's not my problem\" with them where she'll use an excessive amount of dishes over the day and not even bother rinsing them off. She never puts the clean dishes away, and only sweeps or mops if my niece makes a particularly large mess on the floor.\n\nI've reached a point where 90% of the time it's an emotional and physical chore to deal with and I'll procrastinate until late night to do it even though I'd rather go to sleep right away. I just get stupidly depressed every day when I look at our kitchen and see all the mess she's left for me.\n\nWe work roughly the same amount of hours doing the same type of work, and we both take charge of cleaning the rest of the house. However I just feel like it would be a dick move to make a big deal over a dirty kitchen. Especially given how much my sister does for me all the time and has been doing since I was born.\n\ntl;dr My sister basically set me up with a dream life for a 19 year old where I have a job (with benefits) a house and anything I could need. However after 9 months of cleaning our kitchen every night I'm annoyed and exhausted that she doesn't help.\n\nAm I the asshole? Would I be the asshole for complaining to her about something this small?", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : AITA \n\nI'm getting married in October, and I'm trying to keep the guest list to people who are good friends and family (we're anticipating about 100-130 guests). My wedding is in London where we live (most of my side are from Florida/the States), but my fiance is from London. My dad's side of the family is considerably larger than my mom's (parents are divorced FYI, but pretty civil), and I have always been much closer to them, but I have decided to only invite my aunts and uncles and first cousins from both sides. I have invited my uncle and his family from my mother's side because I grew up having a relationship with them and always see them when I visit. My mom has one other brother who is estranged and no one speaks to (I met him one time when I was a toddler), which is fine as she is not asking him to be invited, nor would she want him there.\n\nHowever, she keeps demanding that I invite my great aunt and three of her cousins. I barely have a relationship with them. I see them once maybe every ten years, and we don't speak otherwise. I don't even know the names of some of their kids who are around my age. We're not close and never have been. I don't dislike them or anything (I don't particularly care for her aunt and one of the cousins because I find them a bit rude and weird, and one of them talked shit about me to my mom at my gran's funeral). But it's now become a huge argument between us. She's brought it up 5 times after I've repeatedly said no, and we just had a big fight about it. She thinks they might not even come, so I should just send them an invitation, but I know they have money and most are semi-retired, so I think they might. I've told her that we're only inviting my aunts, uncles, and first cousins, and I'm not inviting any of my dad's cousins or his aunts. Her argument is \"they're family and would do anything for me\". I told my mom that she was starting to make my wedding about her, and she implied that because I'm her daughter, it is a little about her.\n\nI wouldn't expect to be invited to any of her cousin's kid's major life events, and I haven't been. And when I went to California, her cousin didn't offer to let me stay at her place when she had let my mom and other sisters, which is fine, I don't really mind, but to me, that takes away from the argument of \"they would do anything for me\". Also, one of the cousins had said my older sister could stay with her in NYC and then rescinded her offer a few weeks before she was scheduled to fly there.\n\nBottom line is, I'm not, nor have I ever been close with this part of my mom's family and wouldn't really want them there, but it's starting to cause problems between my mom and me. And now I'm not sure if I should just send them an invite to ease the tension between us.\n\nAITA for not inviting them?\n\nSide note: we have a limited budget (my dad and my fiance's parents are splitting the cost)", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : As a bit of a background - both my wife and I are professionals, earning a good wage and have a two year old son.  We've never been one to splash cash, or show off... and we have a variety of friends.  Most of our friends however fall into the category of professionals and I'd assume household incomes in excess of \u00a3100K were fairly common.  I.e, they aren't struggling.  This will become relevant later.\n\nNow, we're good friends with a couple who live near us, who also have a two year old (a couple of months older than our son).  So it makes sense that we hang out a bit, given the kids go to the same nursery, and seem to like playing together etc.  So we do family outings to the zoo, or go on walks together etc.\n\nEverything was fine until my son started talking.  Like a real chatterbox.  We spend a lot of the time on these outings talking to our son, and teaching him new words.  We also try and do the same with their son.  The thing is he's not a talker.  Yes, people say our son talks beyond his age, but i also know he was amongst the last to walk amongst his peers. I've always prescribed to the \"Kids do things at different ages philosophy\", and as such have never really gave it much notice.\n\nA couple of times now I've received passive aggressive comments from these friends about constantly proving my son can talk better than ours.  They even said once that my son was \"acting like a trained monkey\".  This pissed me off.  A lot.  I am not showing off, he asks questions about what things are called, and repeats them, and understands them.  He enjoys it.  It's also what's best for my child.\n\nWe have now also started to get comments about the price of things, and whether we should really be getting our child a certain toy, or take him to so many places as he'll be \"spoilt\".  This is also something I'm acutely aware of and yes my son gets gifts, sure... but we have never, ever brought him something when he demanded it in a shop, and have taught him manners.  From when he was a year old we let him look at toys in the shop, but made him say \"bye bye\" to them, and put them back on the shelf himself.  Going back to one of my first points... they have plenty of disposable cash themselves it's not like I'm sending my kid of horse riding whilst they're struggling to buy food.\n\nI can see where they're coming from, and my wife seems to think we should dial our communication down with our son when we're with them, and maybe hide some of his toys to prevent comment from them.\n\nBut I absolutely refuse to. I talk to my son the same way when we're alone, and I'm not going to cater to their wants.  If this was a normal \"be aware of others feelings and circumstances\" things, I'd think I was being an ass hole.  But as this will limit my son's enjoyment of things I simply refuse to cater to it.\n\nSo, am I entitled to my views?

In my ELA class and Advisory I have a kid in my class that is really just a jerk, not a bully, but not a nice kid. This dude is pretty messed up and does not really do his work in class. We will call him K, because his name starts with K.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was reading my book and talking to some people in my advisory class, my advisory teacher is really chill and does not really care if you talk. She then told us that there would be a fire drill in a few minutes, so I put down my book. My eyes were wandering around, waiting for the alarm to blare, but then something caught my eye. I saw K was on his phone looking at a photo of a guy wearing no shirt and having googles on. He then scrolled down a little bit and the dudes butt was on full display.  I looked at his face because I was wondering if this was just something random in his Instagram fee, but K had a full blown smile on his face and liked the picture. He liked the picture, he liked a PORN picture in school! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would have confronted K about it right then, but the fire alarm went off. We went outside for a few minutes then came back, so I decided to confront him there when he was alone (I did not want to embarrass him, you never know, it could have been a meme). I went up to him and asked him why he was looking at porn in school and he denied all claims. I asked him if it was a meme, but he said he did not look at anything inappropriate. I kept on asking questions, but when he did not tell me anything I decided I had to put him on the hotspot, so I decided to ask him in front of his friends. When  K was with his friends he changed his mind and said it was a meme, so I told his friends how he already said it was not a meme.

I did not really feel the need to tell them it was gay porn right away, but whenever I found out he had a girlfriend I did.

Now I\u2019m just going to have to wait until she is actually pregnant. Also 18 M and a throw away.

My friend has recently started speaking to him and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making a big deal out of nothing. \n\nWe\u2019d been speaking quite a bit and I wanted to make new friends after starting a school not knowing anyone. He\u2019d mentioned wanting to watch a film together so I was like yeah sure I\u2019ll come to yours one day after school and that was that. \n\nWalking to his house he started talking shit about people that we were friends with and that made me paranoid about what he said about me but I let it go because I hadn\u2019t known them as long as he had. Arriving at his house he let me know his parents wouldn\u2019t be back a while and I was like sure whatever. \n\nThis guy takes me to his room to dump my stuff and goes into his bathroom to get changed whilst I sit on the bed. I sit there waiting and can see nails (as in toe and finger nails) on the floor which makes me feel a bit ill because it\u2019s unhygienic or whatever. \n\nSo he comes back in and let\u2019s me choose a film which I think is really nice and am happy to choose. He gets on the bed and tries to get me to lay down with him but I refuse and he tried to pressure me some more but gives up when he realises I\u2019m not going to. Everything is fine whilst we watch the film and I\u2019m like okay maybe I was overreacting. \n\nThe film finishes and he wants to go downstairs for food, he offers to make me something and I decline as I\u2019m not hungry and feel it would be rude not to eat something if he made it. He\u2019s pretty upset but let\u2019s it go. Next he puts on a song that I recommended to him and asks me if I\u2019m not going to dance. He wanted me to dance for him?! It might just be me but I found this incredibly weird. \n\nI decided to leave early and was waiting for my lift. When I let him know he out on his \u2018sad music\u2019 playlist and starts talking about how sad he is and then just sits with his back to me until I leave. \n\nI message him about how he made me feel like shit and he only said that he\u2019d done nothing wrong. He\u2019d been treated like shit before and he hasn\u2019t treated me that way.\n\nI thought he was really manipulative but I still think I could\u2019ve handled things differently.

POST : Background: Currently rooming with a friend, both at the same air force base for pilot training. I got married recently and my wife (also in the military) got assigned here and is moving in a few weeks once she completes training. I want to live with my wife, but she has a cat and my current apartment isn't pet friendly. I've talked with my landlord and she isn't willing to budge on the lease at all. Which is fine, it's a legal contract, I just figured I'd ask. We've already found a pet friendly apartment in the town, and have put in an application. \n\nThings get complicated now. When my buddy and I first moved in together, we discussed the fact that I was planning to get married in the spring. We didn't know when my wife would be able to come here, so we got a 12 month lease which ends in August. I had to change my plans and get married earlier so she could get the join spouse assignment to come here. So we got married in November, and a couple weeks ago she got her assignment to this base. I was excited that she got this base and told my roommate, and he was happy for me but was concerned about what would happen with the lease. Before we agreed to room together, I discussed with him that I would be moving in with my wife whenever she came here. I don't think he remembered our previous conversation (it was like 7 months ago so there's that). I told him I'd talk with our landlord and see if she could get him a one bedroom instead of the two we currently have, so he wouldn't have to pay the full rent on this one. I went to her with my idea, and she said the only option was for him to stay and pay the rent for our current unit. \n\nHere's my plan: I'll move in with my wife at our new place. I will also pay my roommate my half of the rent for March (since I'll live here for at least half of March) and then I'll pay him the difference between the one bedroom he was fine with and the two bedroom we have now (745-675=70 per month for the rest of the lease, so 350) at once before I leave. I may even bump that up to like 500. I feel bad for dipping out halfway through the lease and leaving him with more apartment than he wants, but I want to live with my wife and don't think that's a crazy thing to want. \n\nWIBTA if I go through with my plan and leave my roommate paying most of the rent for the remainder of the lease?", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

This turned into a bit of a rant...\n\nI\u2019m a person with typically no drama in my life so this whole situation was an out of this world experience for me. I (28f) have been friends with Slim (35m) for over a year now. He sells drugs low key (Ike 3 customers) and I never really cared cos he was fun to talk to, always surprised me with his intellect, and we just had fun times together. I knew he had a gf named Hops (20f) when I first met him. \n\nHe and I first connected because he was in a relationship with a junkie and I had just gotten out of one so needless to say I had a lot of solid advice that I wish I had known sooner and hearing about my failed methods seemed to really give him perspective. This developed into a strong friendship and although he sometimes got a little too close I never went there because of his relationship and my lack of attraction. \n\nLong story short, their relationship went from trying to work things out to - broken up then back together for a day and broken up again etc. I only met Hops once or twice and even she told me she was leaving him the next week. So one night he and I took a popular club drug and ended up doing the deed. I didn\u2019t feel guilty cos they weren\u2019t together. the drug made me horny, and you skip the awkwardness when you fuck a friend. \n\nMonths go by during which they are mostly broken up and she is moving out but as these things go, they end up together again. Slim and I remained good friends and Hops knew I was a friend and thought I was a customer. I never wanted this girl at my home but Slim talked me into it one night. Saturday before Halloween. Three of us were partying pretty hard and planning to go out once dressed. Hops offered to do my costume makeup. During this time I got REALLY fucked up and ended up passing out in her lap. \n\nI woke up at 3am with my phone missing, work laptop, engagement ring, and other valuables. And my dog howling to be let in as she had been let out on a dangerous street. No word from the perps for 12 hours. Finally Slim contacts me. Apparently Hops broke into my phone and spend hours going through my messages. She found maybe 3 sexual ones from months ago but she also found some shitty stuff Slim said about her like he wanted to get her to pass out so she wouldn\u2019t bother us (I never replied to those kind of comments cos WTF?!) In her (righteous) hurt and anger, she started going through my belongings. Slim tried to stop her but she said it\u2019s either that or she pummels me in my unconscious state. He said he watched everything she took and made sure it ended up only in his trunk and then His storage unit so he could return it to me. \n\nHe told me she was hurt and I should take it easy. Being someone who was cheated on, I decided to oblige. He ended up bringing back a lot of my stuff (work laptop was vital) and I talked to her for 5 hours instead of sleeping. She claimed if I answered her questions I\u2019d have my stuff back. I asked if she had my things and she lied and said she did then got hostile when I asked for proof. \n\nAnyways, my point was that I was as nice and understanding to her as possible considering the situation and I felt and still feel like a shit human even though I don\u2019t feel I did anything morally wrong. Here\u2019s where i decided to be an asshole. She left her makeup bag and a go pro during her get away. I planned to give it back but never offered and was eventually asked (begged) by Slim to do it because it was her bday. \n\nI couldn\u2019t just give it back however. So I mixed some rancid shit together (piss, toilet water, dog shit, drain cleaner) and dipped every brush and painted it on every item of makeup. Then I took apart the go pro and disconnected some cable so it didn\u2019t work but wasn\u2019t technically broken either. The makeup thing is gross af but it made me feel good knowing she is putting this on her face. \n\nI felt like she deserved it because of how she acted... that victim woe is me mentality. When I was in her shoes (mind you my husband had a year long affair so my shoes were much worse) I still had the sense to take some responsibility. So did my husband. His mistress acted just like Hops did, like she did nothing wrong and deserved all the sympathy. \n\nThis girl violated me and I say with complete seriousness that I would rather relive my rape than that Halloween night. I know I\u2019m an asshole for what I did. I guess am I THE asshole? \n\nTLDR: girl violated me by robbing me in my sleep after I opened up and was vulnerable to her. To retaliate I drowned her makeup in piss and shit. \n\nAlso, how would this story fare in pro revenge? Worried they\u2019ll hate on me there but I am still proud of my revenge despite feeling sympathy for the girl and remorse for how the situation went down.

POST : Some History:\n\n\nSo about a month ago, I was promoted to Night Shift Team Lead at a distributing company I work for. My coworker who I became good friends with while working here also interviewed for the position. He did *not* get the position, but I did. I NJ had voiced concern over there being hard feelings in a situation like this, but he assured me that wouldn't be the case. It most definitely *was* the case. He was an asshole for a solid week after the fact, but then finally realized himself and apologized for his behavior. Fast forward to the week of Thanksgiving when we were performing a warehouse wide inventory. Everyone was divided into 3 teams with a \"Point Man\" directing each team. I split \"Point Man\" duties with the current night shift manager as a part of my ongoing training, but my name wasnt explicitly announced during the dividing of teams, so my friend was under the impression that I was just another counter, and not a director. For three days, he would walk by and make snide comments, along the lines of \"boy, you're working awful hard\" and the like.

Also, throwaway.\n\nSo, a few years back my brother moved in with us (my husband and I) when we got a new place, as we were all ready to get out of my parents place and figured it made sense for us all to live together.\n\nI was pregnant with my first kid when we moved in, and had her several months later.\n\nMy relationship with my brother did not survive this. Things were kinda shitty before I had her, but they turned absolutely irreparable afterwards.\n\nHe made absolutely 0 effort to be around/be a part of my life/my kids life from the moment I stepped into the hospital, and he was blatantly disrespectful while he was blowing us all off.\n\nMy brother in law was stationed in Korea during this time, and he made an effort to be and succeeded in being a larger part of my newborn daughters life than my own brother ever has. Yeah. A guy stationed in a different COUNTRY was a better uncle than the guy sitting upstairs. \n\nanyways, he moved out and we pretty much dropped all contact, mutually. He doesnt really like any of our family so he usually stays away from family events. Its been easy for us to just ignore each other. He doesnt seem to have any issue with this, and I dont either.\n\nHowever, tomorrow is one of my extended family members birthday. We were all set to go and celebrate, but my mom texted me tonight and told me that my brother is going to be there.\n\nI WOULD just go and ignore him, except I KNOW my family is going to refer to him as \"uncle (his name)\" around my daughter.\n\nI dont want that. At ALL. \n\nHe has done nothing to be her uncle. Everyone she knows as an uncle, has made an effort to be in her life and she knows they love her. My brother has done nothing to warrant that title except be related to her by blood, and that's not good enough for me.\n\nIt would basically insinuate to her that my brother is a close family member, akin to her very beloved Uncle (BIL name), when he absolutely is not.\n\nI would just ignore my feelings and deal with being uncomfortable about it - however, my kid is going to be 3 very soon. She's old enough now where if anyone refers to him as \"uncle (name)\", she's going to come home with me and ask about him/to see him.\n\nThat's why it's an issue. I dont want to deal with that.\n\nHowever, I know that if I tell my family not to call him that in front of her, I'm going to be called out as the asshole.\n\nAlso, INB4 \"but he's family!\" Both my hubs and I have had difficult relations with blood family, so we subscribe to the \"family are those who care about you\" line of thinking. \n\nOne of my friends already kinda voted me as YTA because \"hes family and [I] cant keep him out of her life forever\" but I feel like I can and its warranted.\n\nSo, WIBTA for asking my family not to refer to my brother as my daughters uncle, and to just have him go by only his name instead?", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

I did not want to, but with the uncle (who i do not know at all) dying of brain cancer, I did not want to be rude and say no, so I agreed to visit for about 7 days. Since they insisted on using their airline miles to pay for the ticket, I was told it was cheaper to fly me out after 14 days, which I found disagreeable since I only get 14 days of PTO per year atm, but it was dismissed. It's their money after all. \n\nAnyways, I find that the flight itself is quite miserable; delayed (of course, so w/e), I catch the flu, sleep for about 4 hours out of the 15 hour flight, and found that the airline has Australian power outlets that I don't have an adapter for, etc. Minor stuff I suppose, but I complain about it with my mother and step dad as they're picking me up.\n\nThe step-dad tells me that I'm acting like a 2 year old, that I'm making my mother feel guilty about the flight, and that if I hated it here so much I can grab a hotel nearby and fly back to CA tomorrow. I actually started walking to one when he caught up to me and said we should stop fighting, since it's upsetting my mother. So I agree to continue to go to their home to stay at.\n\nI find that we are not staying at the home, to my dismay, as I was hoping to rest up and deal with my newfound flu. Instead, we're taking a 1.5 hr drive to their beach house.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.", "input": "Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : I live in an apartment complex with four bedrooms per unit. Two shared bathrooms. Shared kitchen/living space. Last semester I only had two roommates, and while I wasn't fond of them, things were alright. Recently, the fourth room was filled, and it's started to fall apart. I lived in this apartment last year with friends, but two of them graduated and one dropped out, so it was just me, and the complex assigned these three roommates to fill the spots. All of them are best friends, and I don't know any of them.\n\nI will admit that I tend to leave notes rather than talk to them directly. I do this for three reasons: 1. we're not usually home at the same time, or when we are we often have people over, so if I wait to talk to them in person when they're not busy with friends/boyfriends, I'd be waiting for days. A note is more convenient. In every rooming situation I've been in we've used notes mutually a lot to great affect; I only yesterday found out *these* roommates hate notes. 2. I often don't know *who* the note is addressed to. I don't know *whose* dishes are in the sink, I just know they've been there for days. 3. It's 3 against 1 and if it turns into a big argument I don't want to get ganged up on. I haven't left a lot of notes; last semester at the start of the semester when they were moving in and I was gone from 6am-12am every day, I left about three notes. The note I left above the sink this weekend is the only other note I've left. Otherwise I've talked to them in person or handled it myself (if both sides of the sink are full I'll consolidate it to one side so it's still usable, if they leave stuff in the dryer for a long time I'll take it out, if they leave trash in the living room I'll throw it out, etc.)\n\nAnyway, two weeks ago my roommates we're all hanging out playing loud music and shouting and shrieking at about 1am. I was trying to sleep, so I peaked out my door and asked them to turn the music down. They immediately fell silent and disappeared into their rooms.\n\nOn Saturday, I was going out of town for the day, but they had been cooking a lot the last few days and our entire kitchen sink was full of their dirty pots and pans, so I left a note asking them to clean them.\n\nSaturday night, it was 1am again and they came home *trashed*. They were loud, one of them was sobbing, they brought like  five different people with them (one of whom straight up opened my door and walked into my room, but I'm not blaming my roommates for that.) Since one of them was crying, I decided to bite my tongue and try to sleep through the noise. By 5am however they started blasting music, so I got up and went and asked them to either turn down the music or shut their doors. They all just stared at me. I went back to bed, and they shut their doors.\n\nSunday morning however, I was in bed and they were all in the kitchen with some of their friends. The walls and doors are paper thin, so I can hear them talking, and I realize they're talking about me. Their complaints:\n\n1. First and foremost, that I ruin their vibe. Because I ask them to turn down their music late at night, because I ask them to not smoke weed in the apartment. They think that by doing so I am not respecting the fact that they also live here, we pay the same rent, etc.\n\n2. They don't think I clean enough. Specifically on the topic of dishes, they complained that \"we have to clean his dishes all the time, we've been cleaning his dishes like every day.\" This isn't true. It's just not. For one, I haven't eaten in two weeks, I'm sick, I don't have any dishes. For two, I put my dishes in the dishwasher as soon as I use them, and if I do have to soak a dish first, at the very least I only leave it a couple hours and don't take up both sides of the sink. They also argue I never clean because I don't sweep and they are the only ones who sweep. This is true. I argue they never clean because they don't wipe down counters, leave food caked in the microwave, they leave their shoes all over the entryway, etc. I'm the only one who cleans up that stuff.\n\nThose are the big broad arguments. I kill their vibe and I don't clean. I think they're inconsiderate and they don't clean.\n\nThey hate my notes. But now they pace around in the kitchen going \" I can't wait til he comes out of his room, I'm gonna get all up in his face, I'm gonna go off...\" I don't feel comfortable or safe talking to them in person if they're just all going to surround me and yell at me.\n\nOne of my biggest issues is that *I didn't know these were issues.* Whenever they've left dishes in the sink for a long time, or clothes in the washer/dryer a long time, or they're really loud late at night, any time I have a problem, I communicate it. They have never communicated with me. Whenever they talk to me, they tell me how much they love me, how glad they are to have me as a roommate. They join me watching a movie and go on about how we need to hang out more, whatever. If I ask them, like, \"do you mind that I keep having this friend over and we're watching the TV, I don't want to be hogging the space\" or whatever, they always tell me it's fine. They bitch about me leaving notes, but they have *never* communicated to me in *any* fashion the problems that they have with me. Everything I know, I know from overhearing them with their friends.\n\nThere's just a lot going on at once, and I can't even process it. Am I the bad guy? Should I let them smoke weed in the apartment and have parties at 5am? Is it wrong of me to leave notes?

For the past 5 years, I\u2019ve been giving her daily assistance with learning the internet &amp; web browsing, a lot of which includes helping her with online shopping. She had a slight addiction for a minute and was ordering 5+ items from a multitude of shops and having me complete all the return/support tickets when she doesn\u2019t like her items...which is almost always. \n\nI digress. I\u2019m just trying to paint an accurate portrait of our give and take relationship. She\u2019s on social assistance which pays for our rent.

I work about a 40 minute walk away from my house. It\u2019s a 5 minute car ride. It\u2019s freezing out right now, and taking the bus takes almost as long as walking since the schedules are wonky. \n\nI asked her if she\u2019d mind dropping me off (since her days are always 100% free) and she says no. I asked her why not, and her reasoning was that her boyfriend is awake and might want to use the car in the 10 minutes she\u2019d be gone. I told her I would really appreciate just a drop off and had full intentions of taking the bus home. Still no. \n\nShe very rarely gave me rides as kid\u2014I relied on the bus for school &amp; hanging out, even in the winter.

She takes very poor care of herself without my help, and I fear that if I leave her, she\u2019ll let go altogether. \n\nI\u2019m just bitter lately because I feel like she has no remorse asking me for a million things because she \u201cputs a roof over my head\u201d (technically the government does but whatever) but when I ask her to drop me off, it\u2019s the end of the bloody world.

I said once that I wanna go to med school and the next day Ruby wanted to become a doctor too.\n\nI started noticing that she is harsh with her daughter. I don't wanna say she's abusive but from my perspective she seems like that.

We've never really been friends but we've still kept in contact over the years from mutual friends and get togethers. Trey is roommates with some of my good friends so I see him a lot more often than Amy but she stays at his house during weekends semi frequently, but I've never really spoken to them beyond pleasantries and light conversation, except for one time a few years ago when I got really drunk and came on to Trey but he denied me because he had just started dating Amy (which i was unaware of because we aren't really close). Amy heard about it but she wasn't mad because she knew the fact that they were dating hadn't gotten to me yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout two months ago, I went to a get together at Treys house and Amy was away visiting family. As things started winding down and my friends went to bed, I sat down in the kitchen and started playing with the dog. Trey then sat down next to me and started playing with the dog too. He then came right out and asked me if I wanted to go to his room and suck his dick. I was pretty shocked and only really managed a polite \"no\" and then Trey went to bed without pushing it and I left and went home. \n\nI didn't want to tell Amy for a few reasons. First one being when I came on to him while they started dating awhile ago and I thought she would think I did something to encourage him to say that. I also thought maybe Trey wasn't in his right mind because he was drinking and smoking all night and I didn't wanna blow up his life over a mistake. And lastly, I don't believe i'm close enough to either of them to get involved in their relationship like that.\n\nSince then I've seen Trey a couple times and everything has been totally normal so I figured he was fucked up and forgot anything happened, while I was feeling guilty for not telling Amy.\n\nThen last week, Trey and I were by ourselves outside smoking and I brought it up. He said he's been waiting for me to say something about it , he apologized profusely and said he wasn't in his right mind. I said that that was what I assumed and I didn't say anything to anyone about it and just ended up forgiving him.

I asked her for notes and it all started from there. As I started getting to know her better, I started liking her even more. She was smart, thoughtful, and very pretty. We had plenty of similar interests from films and music to our careers. I believed that she was the one for me &amp; I would never find someone like her.\n\nBut, she was dating someone in a different city for 2 years. It seemed to be going well. However, a week before our final exams, she called me, in tears, saying how he had broken up with her. \n\nWhen we met after the exams, she confessed to me that she liked me, I told her I liked her too. Confused abt her ex, she said she wasn\u2019t sure what to do, and me, being an idiot, told her that it was probably better to go with her ex. The reason I said that, instead of suggesting we get together, was that I was headed abroad for Uni and was skeptical about a LD relationship. Also, I thought that if she started to like me while she was in a long distance, she might end up liking someone while I was away. \n\nShe decided that she was no longer interested in dating anyone at all until she got her 5 year degree. I accepted that, being  heartbroken. Tbf, I kinda did tell her to move on and focus on her career, and didn't present myself as an option, only hinting at it.\n\nI went abroad for my degree soon. A few months in, I asked her how she was and she said she was much better. I then asked her how she felt about me and if she wanted to try a long distance relationship. She said she wasn\u2019t interested in dating anyone and that if I wanted to date her, I would wait for her to get her degree. I asked if she still had feelings for me, to which she didn\u2019t bother responding. I told her that it wouldn\u2019t make sense for me to wait for her, unless she felt the same way about me, but she said that I should wait regardless. We stopped talking altogether later. \n\nI contacted her after months and we got back to talking. I once again expressed my feelings to her, and she regurgitated the whole wait for me bit.

According to them, I was a really affectionate baby and would always hug/kiss/cling to my grandmother. Now, physical contact (16F) makes me kind of uncomfortable. I can only accept small tokens, like touching cheeks for a second with my dad, for example (comes up later) without feeling jittery. Thing is, she keep trying to pull me into hugs randomly or kiss whatever body part is available (cheek, hands, arms, legs when she lays down). Not like brushes, by the way like full on smacking, lasts for seconds, lowkey wet(?) kisses. I told her I loved her but could she please tone it down? \n\nShe didn\u2019t take it well. She said that she spent years of her life raising me, taking me to school, teaching me how to swim and how to sing Chinese songs (we\u2019re Chinese, so filial piety and all that, which factors in later). I don\u2019t want to make it sound like she feels entitled to my affection because she doesn\u2019t but she said that she\u2019s getting old, doesn\u2019t have time left and why do I not love her like I did when I was younger? She also brought up how I show affection with my dad and that I didn\u2019t \u201cshow disgust whenever we (my father and I) touched.\u201d I tried to say it wasn\u2019t on the same level, but she didn\u2019t listen to me.\n\nFast forward a bit, she told my dad. He told me that when he was busy, she took up the responsibility to raise me and I need to listen to what she wants. He also said how she was the oldest member of the family, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left, etc etc and to just suck it up. \n\nI get that boundaries are a thing so it might look like I\u2019m asking for validation, but in my culture it\u2019s usually adults first, kids last and I\u2019m the youngest in my family (closest one in age is 10 years). Now I\u2019m thinking I should have just sucked it up and not said anything because like everyone keeps saying, she\u2019s not going to be around forever.

Before doing any of this, I sat down with my roommate, explained the situation, and encouraged him to also reach out to the landlord with the same offer if he's also interested in snagging the apartment himself and we'll just leave the decision in the hands of our landlord.\n\nInitially he seemed cool with this but last night, he confronted me and tried to guilt/pressure me into rescinding my interest in the place and just move out, saying that he's been in the apartment for longer (only by a couple months), I'm the one who moved in, etc, so he should get to keep it. There is one other element of this worth mentioning:\n\nIn the last month of our previous lease (so around 10 months ago), his girlfriend moved out of her apartment and moved in \"with her parents\". In reality, she started spending 7 nights/week at our place and has lived here full time since then without paying rent. He did not ask me if I was okay with this, said that it would be temporary, and his timing was impeccable as the terms of our lease (which was about to expire) VERY clearly stated it was for two tenants and anyone who spends more than 10 nights per month in the apartment is considered a tenant. However, with the lease expired, I didn't want to make any waves since the landlord knows him better and I couldn't afford to potentially get kicked out and replaced by his girlfriend for bringing it up. \n\nThe way I see it, I'm giving both roommates/couples equal footing to vie for the apartment. Yes, I'm the one disrupting the status quo here, but the status quo was an unfair situation that was taking advantage of me and my financial inability to escape it. The way he sees it, its not my apartment to vie for and he should get to keep it without involving the landlord by virtue of being here first.\n\nAm I the dick here, is he, or are we both two assholes who deserve each other?", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

I'm in college and last year when I was showering, one of my friends (Mark for the story) took my clothes in the communal bathroom and would only give them back when I shouted, \"I DO BUTT STUFF WITH MEN.\" (I'm a heterosexual male.)

Mark comes down to my room and we're just chatting like normal. He spots the stains on my bedsheet and asks if they're jizz stains. I tell him they aren't, but he took a photo of them. I knew it was going to be a repeat of the \"I DO BUTT STUFF WITH MEN\" episode, so I launched at him to delete the photo (Wrestling isn't entirely out of the ordinary for us.) After about ten minutes of wrestling, I got him to unlock his phone and I deleted it. His phone took a couple hard hits, but nothing ridiculous and we thought nothing of it.\n\nToday, Mark told me his phone microphone isn't working anymore and he wants me to pay for a new one. I was busy when he told me about it, so I said I'd be happy to discuss it this evening when I had time.

If im scheduled to leave at 7 i want to be clocked out by 7:05 (barring any projects, tasks , emergencies) tue problem is when morning shift comes in and takes their sweet time starting to work( morning chit chat, coffee, slow and waking up ). So the morning rounds begin at 4 and my shift ends at 7. Often i will begin the work at 3 to guarantee it is done or reasonably complete by 7 (the bulk 90+ % done, work always trickles into the lab ) before i leave. We have these older coworkers who take their morning breaks religiously ( not lunch breaks ) and more often im stuck staying late to help with the trickle of work that comes in after im supposed to leave so they can get their breakfast in. \n\nAdditional info: \n-on nights we only get our 30 min lunch\n-numbers alone i do 50-60% of all the morning rounds work, even though there are 2 other people to split the work.\n- its usually 30 min to an 1hr after im scheduled to be done that  i get to leave because they go slow and won't pull their weight.\n\nI want to leave when its my time. I don't want to stay to help with routine work or to cover for breaks that i don't get. I don't like the morning shift coworkers as colligues or perosnaly so i hold no desire o help them out of good will and I'm already working  12+ hrs of overtime. \n\nTLDR; coworkers are slow, and cause me to stay 30 to 60 min late 3 out of 5 days. I want to leave when im scheduled to not when its convenient for them.

On the listing I noticed it said a Nintendo Switch with 2 games for 200.00 dollars. I didn't think I would have a shot but since I got the Craiglist app I noticed the time of post was just an hour ago so I make contact.\nMe: is the switch still available?\nSeller: Yeah sure is. If you want it you will have to come to ____ station.\nMe: okay cool. That is a hour away from my station but I can do it. What day works best with you?\nSeller: Next weekend works great for me.\nMe: Alright cool, my kakao ID is ***** just message me a exact time and date when you can.\n\n/24 hours past/\n\n/Thursday/ I got no message on kakao from the seller so I emailed at 11am  asking if they wanted to meet that day. I gave this option as my job is only 30 min from their station and would make more sense for me. I would be ok with any answer as I had the money but I was excited to finally own a switch. I leave work to find that i got no replay.\n\nEmails total: 4\n\n/Friday/ i felt odd to have been ghosted by a seller so i decide to try a different approach. I emailed the seller again from my alternate email address.

He mentioned non of this in his original post which I am showing here. So I am legit getting heated from the nerve of him not only going silent on me but not keeping his word.\n\nMe: You did not even mention that as a option. I had the money and YOU picked the date. This is bullshit on your part as you never updated me. I even asked to come to your station the following day to do the purchase yet you chose to ignore me. Fuck you.\n\nNow i wanted to know if I should be as angry as I currently am.

POST : Now this has to do a lot with my parents past.\n\nI (17m) life with my mother, my half brother (another father) and my full sister.\n\nMy parents had me when they were in their very early 20s. After my mun was pregnant with me, my dad said he wanted to teach me piano (he was a music teacher at a local school). My mum agreed. As soon as I was born, my dad showed his bad sides, gambling, drinking, smoking a lot. When I turned 5, he taught me to play the piano, well taught would be wrong, as he more or less beat the lessons into me. My mum didn't know about it as I didnt say anything. during the span of one year, he became more and more violent, hitting my mum and even attacking her with a knife once whilst drunk. My mum decided to leave him in a rush, for the sake of our safety. Now I don't know if this has to do anything with it, but I was a rough child. my mum had to give up a job, as she had to constantly go to the kindergarden or school, whenever I misbehaved (fighting and doing dumb shit). I got diagnosed with ADHD and my mum decided to resort to medicine (I don't blame her). It worked out and I behaved well. Fast forward a bit and I'm 14. We're on a vacation to see my dads parents who I haven't seen in 12 years (so never really). My dad was also there at that time with his new daughter, about 5 years old. I really liked her as she's been the kind of little sister I've always wanted. My little sister was never on good terms with me, dunno why tbh. \nFast forward 2 days and we're still there. A stupid family arguement breaks out with two sides. The agressive A-Holes including my father and his bitch sister who claimed that my cousin punched her son (she didn't) and the ones that wanted to talk, including all of my family, my cousin, my grandparents and some other cousins. My dad goes to attack one of the male cousins with a pipe which he blocks. fight ends as soon as my dads older brother arrives. He tells us to leave for our own safety (in a kind way, gave us money for a hotel) and apologised for his siblings behaviour. This incident was the last time I saw my dad. \n\nI also need to add, that I am still playing piano and if it wasnt for me learning the piano, I wouldn't have got to known the most amazing person I've ever met, who made my life so much more joyable. I know that she would've wanted me to meet up with my dad as well. I'm grateful to my dad that he gave me this gift.\n\nNow here comes the thing:\nMy mother has been badmouthing my dad forever, and tbh most of those things I would say sound like things he'd do. But I don't hold grudges against people, as life is simply to short for that. My mother on the other hand still hates him and I understand. \nHe contacted me and my sister in November 2018, if we wanted to meet up every two weeks again. My sister instantly said no. I don't blame her, She barely got to know this man, only a few times and he just jelled and had a pipe in his hand. I on the other hand agreed. Now I do have the right to see my dad and my mother or anyone else can't do anything against it. She got pissed at me for saying yes, calling me a \"betrayer\" (haven't heard that for the first time) and saying \"do you know what I had to go through, do you know how much therapy I needed to get past his abuse?\"\nWell I said no but I still wanted to see him. \nWe somehow ended the arguement and left it open. My dad contacted me last week, saying he wanted to meet me. How'd he get my number? I didn't care. All I cared about was if he's the real guy. So I asked a couple of questions which he got right. He told me his wife got a second child after the first one and they want to meet their big brother. Now, he did contact my sister but she instantly blocked him. I didn't tell my mum. Instead I told we'd meet at a caf\u00e9 and I'd bring along a friend. Time comes and we're at the meeting and talking about how things are. He invites us to his place and we meet the girls. They are lovely and I love both of them. The wife is also very kind and caring. I left with a positive attitude.\nI went home and told my mum that \"oh yeah, today I met up with dad\"\nshe just asked \" what do you mean\" so I told hee the same thing I just told you guys. Shw gets furious, screaming at me that she told me not to do it and even if, I needed her permission. \nThe incident spread throughout the family in an hour and I got threats from different family members. One said he'd take away my laptop, console and piano (all things I paid for with my part time job money) to which I replied he can go ahead, as I wont back down about meeting him regularily. He took the laptop and the console. well I wanted to go to the police about it but my mum said she'd not file a complaint (I needed parental confirmation or some shit like wtf) \nThe piano stayed as my mum convinced her brother/my uncle to stop it).\nI'm in this situation where I don't know what to do. \nI understand my mothers worried actions, but she needs to understand how I feel too (which is always last priority in this family).\n\nAITA, does ESH or is NTA?", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

It didn't matter though, I said, that based on my experiences in the past, these kind of trips are mostly just talk. We're from a place and at an age where most students (17-19yo) either won't have the money, didn't have the permission, or ultimately no one would take the initiative to plan it and thus trips such as these almost always didn't happen.

This obviously also made me feel terrible, because she spends no where near the amount of effort planning time between us.\n\nNow, few days before the trip, she starts to become overwhelmed by everyone else's lack of involvement in said planning.

POST : Ok so this happened a few months ago and we have since broken up (for various reasons; butted heads too much) but this still bothers me and I want to know if I\u2019m in the wrong. So her birthday was coming up and I asked her how she wanted to spend the day; it fell on a weekend so we were both off and I\u2019d be able to enjoy the whole day with her. She said she wanted to go to a high end strip mall about two hours away to go shopping, then meet up with some friends at a bar in the evening. She was always into designer clothes and handbags etc. I never understood the hype around that  (and I don\u2019t have the money to be able to shop like that) but I said I was fine with it, it\u2019s her birthday and we should do what she wants. Well a few weeks prior to that she had also hinted that she really wanted a strawberry cheesecake for her birthday. I mean really really hinted, not subtle at all. It seemed really important to her so I thought it would be nice if I made it from scratch for her rather than buying it. I\u2019d never made a cheesecake before so I was a little nervous I would screw it up but I started doing research to prepare for it, learned how to do all the cool stuff like make the wavy details on the top with pur\u00e9ed strawberries and stuff. Online I read that cheesecake tastes the best when it\u2019s prepared within 24 hours of being eaten so I figured I would stay at my place the night before and start it around 9am so I\u2019d be ready to go leave for the strip mall at noon; I got home late the night before and didn\u2019t have time to make it before bed. Well, I completely underestimated the time it would take me to make a cheesecake and ended up WAY behind schedule; it didn\u2019t help that my electric mixer died halfway through and I had to run over to a neighbor\u2019s and borrow theirs. The cake was supposed to be a surprise, but after constant texts of why I\u2019m so late and what I\u2019m doing I decided to tell her. I thought it would make her slightly more understanding (knowing that I was trying to make her happy instead of goofing off with friends or oversleeping) but it just got her more angry with me. She claimed that the strip mall was what she really wanted to do for her birthday and the cake meant nothing to her, I should\u2019ve just bought one instead of delaying everything. I realized I was in the fault by not planning better, and she really hates when I\u2019m late to things, but her reaction surprised me and hurt a bit. I ended up getting to her house around 3pm with the cake. She said we didn\u2019t have any time to go shopping anymore and wouldn\u2019t let me take her somewhere a little closer by. Eventually she calmed down a bit and was happy with the cake (especially when she tasted it, go me) and we were able to have a nice night out with her friends. We went to the strip mall the next weekend and got there super early so she could stay all day. I thought it was over and done with at this point and that she\u2019d forgiven me but she would continuously bring up how I ruined her birthday when we had fights down the line.

One thing led to another, we ended up having sex, but soon after we both agreed we were better for each other as friends. Next month comes around, Ana apologizes, we get back together, but i refrain from telling her about my encounter until a few weeks after.

POST : So to give some context, I've been friends with this girl, let's call her Clara, since I was roughly five, our parents knew each other, and we grew up together. We were tight right up until we graduated and went to college, along with three others who formed our tight knit friend group. Two of the others went to college in the same place as me, and the third stayed in our home town and started working, while she went to a college about two hours away. We still talked a lot of Facebook, and as none of us were too far from home and spent summers at home there were many opportunities to hang out etc, however, in the three years since we have started college we have seen each other only a handful of times. \n\nIt all seemed to escalate after she left my 21st birthday after about half an hour, stating that her lift home was leaving and she had no choice, however, other friends coming in late saw her go to a night club across the road with her boyfriend. Shortly after, another girl in our friend group found out her girlfriend had been cheating on her. Rather than support her friend, Clara became close to the girl who had cheated and reported our conversations back and forth with her. \n\nEventually I got drunk, and was with the others for a night out, which Clara had declined to come to. I found they all felt like they had not been close to her for some time, and they felt uncomfortable having her in the Facebook group chat as they felt they couldn't talk openly in it any more. I created a new chat without her in it that night, and we let the other one die. The only communication in it after that was her asking us to go to her birthday, which none of us committed to. Shortly after that she left and hasn't spoken to any of us since. \n\nAm I the asshole for being the one to make the move that ultimately led to her being iced out of the group? As the one who's known her the longest I feel like I at least owed her a conversation to her face about it, but instead we went behind her back. \n\nTL;DR: am I the asshole for effectively cutting out ab old friend who'd grown distant during college from our friend group ?

VERY stable and healthy relationship (imagine at worst a cold shoulder followed by hugs in a few hours, never any \u201cfights\u201d only discussions). Both in our mid-20s. My parents left on a trip for the first time since i was born. He is one of the main caretakers of his grandpa who had an accident about a month ago. We had been discussing me spending a night with him for a couple of weeks but we never set a date. We decided today with my parents being gone and him not working in the morning (very unusual) that I\u2019d spend the night after a taco dinner at his house. At 7pm I had a dinner/galentines. I said I wouldn\u2019t be eating because he and I planned to eat together afterwards. His barber also rescheduled and he had to be there at 7:30 am tomorrow, but this was new info since he was supposed to have that haircut today after work. \n\n\n\n\nThe situation:\n\nAfter work I HAD to drop off packages at the post office but I got there at 5:55 and they chose to close early today. Of course they did. The post is about 10-15 minutes from my house but I ended up spending a nearly hour drive back to my house to get ready for galentines because traffic was terrible. I arrived, got ready, and headed out again close to 7pm. I drove 20 miles to the late night post office, but that took about another hour of traffic. \n\nAt around 8pm I called him anxious and stressed because I was so late and still had to pick up chips before arriving. He was supportive, gave me advice that worked to calm me down, and we talked about me going over later and how great it would be to snuggle all night (we essentially lived together our first year but I moved back in with my parents after uni) \n\nWe hung up around 8:40ish when I arrived. None of our plans had changed. I didn\u2019t eat dinner, but I stayed for gift exchanges and to play one game. Our texts went like this: \n\n\n*less than an hour after I arrived*\nHim (H): I have to be up early to go to the Berber shop. Oh that\u2019s fun! Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t come over babe enjoy your night It\u2019s nice that you are having girl time. We can see each other tomorrow \n\nMe (M): Can I call (sibling) after to see if he's home so I can go sleep with you? \n\nH: If you want to baby but I don\u2019t want you to be rushing around for no reason \n\nM: No but it isn't rushing :) I wanted to see you so much. I'll head over when this game is done? \n\nH: Don\u2019t you want to spend more time with them? Don\u2019t call it early if you don\u2019t have to \n\nM: I want to go with you... \n\n*about 2 hours after I arrived*\nH: How are you?? *insert really sweet cheesy memory from when we first started dating*\n\nMe: awww bae. I\u2019m about to go over.\n\n\n\nOBVIOUSLY hindsight is 20/20 and I didn\u2019t notice he wasn\u2019t just being nice and making sure I didn\u2019t leave a fun event if I didn\u2019t have to, he was lowkey hinting that it was too late for me to go over. I genuinely thought he just didn\u2019t want to inconvenience me, but I had no problem going to bed right after getting there and waking up early with him for the haircut. \n\nHe had good intentions, he didn\u2019t outright tell me not to go because he didn\u2019t want me to feel rejected, BUT I DIDNT GET THE HINT AT ALL. So what\u2019d I do?\n\nI left the place with an excuse, called him in the car and he seemed ambiguous about the time and me going over. I was confused but immediately noticed his wishy washiness so I asked again if he wanted me to spend the night. \n\nHe said if I want to.\n\nI said, NO I\u2019m not spending the night unless you\u2019re okay with it, your family is okay with it, and you explicitly want me to go over. If you don\u2019t want me to, just let me know so I can drive to my house (opposite highways.) \n\nA similar conversation ensued where he kept insisting I could go if I wanted to but he also mentioned the time, how he was going to sleep as soon as his shower was done, what time he had to wake up, etc and all the reasons it was inconvenient. \n\nI almost begged him to just tell me yes or no because I was driving and I already took the highway to his house. He never gave me a solid answer. I just said I would be going home. \n\nOn the way home, I called my brother and I vented that I was upset because I was hungry (waiting to eat with him), not going to get to spend the night I was looking forward to, and I could have just stayed playing games with friends for longer. \n\nIn the process, I went to (ALMOST TO THE SAME AREA AS THE PARTY I JUST LEFT, about another half hour of traffic from an accident!) pick up food since I was starving.\n\nHe called before bed and we talked but I was obviously bothered. When I started saying what bothered me, I definitely spoke purely in an emotional whiny tone, I began to cry, and I said I was so frustrated from the whole situation. I cited not having eaten, him not being clear on whether our plans were cancelled or not, and the general disappointment of not being able to see him. I mentioned how annoyed and sad I was that not only would I not spend the night with him but I could have at least eaten with and stayed around my friends longer. \n\nHe said that it was nearly 11 when I left (he is right) and that he did mention that I should stay with my friends longer if I wanted to. He also said that if I went over I wouldn\u2019t have eaten anyways since he assumed I ate something from how much later things dragged on.\n\nI said I didn\u2019t care about the food though, it\u2019s just a variable. I said that if I got there, didn\u2019t eat, we went to bed and woke up early I would have been perfectly content because all I wanted was to spend time together. Being hungry after NOT seeing him is just worst.\n\nI was very emotional talking about it and I usually don\u2019t get like that. I almost begged him to just tell me not to go over. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you thought it was too late and didn\u2019t want me to go, just PLEASE tell me. I took the wrong highway, I made an excuse to leave early, I didn\u2019t eat food, I just wish you said you didn\u2019t want me to go from the beginning.\u201d \n\nI feel crappy because I didn\u2019t make sure he knew that I was aware that he tried to spare my feelings and guide me to what he was implying, but I was just too upset at all the wasted time that I forgot to say it.\n\n\nAfter he said those statements, he heard me continue to emotionally cry and vent, he apologized and said he would keep it in mind for the future and try for it to not happen again. He also asked if I\u2019d like him to pick me up in the morning to run errands together and hang out. I agreed. I didn\u2019t even want him to apologize. I was just sad and wanted to see him. \n\nWe ended with sending sweet texts apologizing and saying how much we can\u2019t wait to see each other tomorrow morning. The entire thing from leaving the place to my rant ending was about 30-40 minutes. Then we were fine by the time we got off the phone. \n\nBut i keep thinking about my reactions and I feel like such an asshole. I know he did it to spare my feelings and with good intentions. \n\nAm I the asshole for reacting that way to him not explicitly saying not go over?\n\nTLDR: sleep overplans with bf got cancelled because it was late but he didn\u2019t tell me explicitly only implied it. I ended up hungry, bored, and lonely so I emotionally cry-bitched at him over the phone even though I knew he had good intentions.

For example, if he has to wake up too early for our planned trip he gets irritable and sassy, often replying back to me in a passive-aggressive tone. Or if I miss a turn or something Mark will make comments like how I don't know how to drive (in a non-comedic, sarcastic, tone). I've brought this up in the past about how little tone shifts/comments like this can make me feel and how they trigger my anxiety, but nothing really has changed. To his defense, when things like this happen I don't always speak up about it, and rather I (childishly) return  the passive aggressive behavior so in effect his bad mood transfers to me. So lately I've been distancing myself from him and stopped hanging out with him as much as my other friends, which he called me out on.\n\nOn one hand I feel like I'm just being dramatic/overly-sensitive, that everybody has a bad mood every now and then, and that Mark overall is still a supportive and nice friend.

Specifically told me that he didn\u2019t know what to do with them, and thought that I would be able to find a home for them and that he would prefer for them to be able to stay together. He also told me I could have things from his apartment, to take or sell. I asked him if he was coming back for anything, and after a day and a half he responded that he was unsure. \n\nNo one knew what was going on. Not his mother anyone we work with, or the owners of the company.  \n\nAfter two weeks of everyone worried, vague or no response, CW comes back and somehow the company I work for has agreed to give him a second chance and allow him to continue his employment after essentially 2 weeks of no call/no show. This complicates things because it\u2019s someone I will be working directly with and require and decent professional relationship with CW at the very least. \n\nCome to find out the reason he left is that him and his husband (HB) got into a fight, ending with him hitting HB and the cops being called. Rather than be responsible and deal with the situation they both decided he should leave before the cops show up. Which caused a warrant put out for his arrest. He\u2019s currently finishing up probation but rather than deal with the situation they both decide to skip town. They drove up the coast with their other two pets, and gave them away in another state 3,000 miles away to someone up there. \n\nNow that CW is back he spoke with me this morning about taking the two cats back. At the time I told him most likely, but I know that my husband is pretty upset about the situation and that CW abandoned them, which CW doesn\u2019t see it that way because he knew I would get them. I reluctantly told him he could most likely pick the cats up this afternoon, I just needed to talk to my husband. \n\nWell, I sent my husband a text telling him and he called me telling me his friend (FR)  had been promised the cats already, and that we were just holding them for him until FR closes on his house. FR is a 22 year old, who works a good job, buying his first house at a young age, which I think goes to show that he is a responsible stable person, who is very much excited to take in the two cats. \n\nI text CW to tell him I was unaware that they had been promised to someone, and we had found a good home for them, but he doesn\u2019t see it that way and he wants them back. In his argument as to why he\u2019s even stated that he \u201ccan be 100% sure he can keep and care for them, but if not he is 100% sure his mother or brother could\u201d if he can\u2019t. \n\nThe more I think on it, the more I am hesitant to give an animal back to someone who would leave them, and put themselves in that kind of a situation. \n\nAITA for not wanting to give CW his cats back, and rather foster them until they can go with my husbands coworker? \n", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

It\u2019s fondly known as the Hawaii of Canada and the city shuts down when it snows (general unpreparedness all around). I moved to one of the coldest and snowiest provinces of the country. For 5 years I experienced a true Canadian winter. It sucked but it\u2019s the reality of life for so many. I then moved to a smaller city near my hometown that still experiences winter - but not to the degree of the previous province. We are actually in the polar vortex and it\u2019s been -10 to -30C here with a fair amount of snow (a bit unusual but that\u2019s life).\n\nSo here\u2019s the story:\nMy cousin (along with half of my Facebook who lives in my hometown), posted about the snow. These range from dramatic complaints to posts of people enjoying the snow. My cousin took a photo of her car covered in about 2-3 inches of snow and captioned: \u201chas anyone seen my car??? Gunna call it a snow day!\u201d. A few hours later she posted a picture of her and her son playing in the snow. \nWhile scrolling through my Facebook, I \u201cloved\u201d the photo she posted of her son and \u201chaha-ed\u201d the snow day post. A friend of hers commented \u201cget to work *name*\u201d and she \u201chaha-Ed\u201d this reply. I also commented on her photo: \u201cAs a once *oldwintercityperson* this makes me laugh! Snow day? For a light dusting and sweater weather \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c. Enjoy the day!!! \u2744\ufe0f\u26c4\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u201d. \n\nWell, apparently I\u2019m a huge asshole because this comment made her cry and she called her mom and sister (referred to later as other cousin) who have since messaged and called me multiple times to let me know what I said was cruel and insensitive. They want me to apologize. They told me I need to be more understanding since winter is very hard for this city and I shouldn\u2019t be mean. That this city has hills which makes driving in the snow harder. I responded by saying that what I said was a light joke and I genuinely meant her to enjoy her day off. I also said that it\u2019s untrue that winter is harder there. I live in a city built on mountainsides a few hours away which also receives the same wet snow. It\u2019s icy and slippery here too, yet we manage. But I wasn\u2019t speaking out of malice for her not wanting to drive in the snow, I was teasing. I also reiterated that I won\u2019t apologize, and if she is so upset she can talk to me directly. My other cousin then went on to say that my post was like a terminal cancer patient telling her that her MS is not bad in comparison. I responded with \u201cfullstop. This is about snow not medical conditions. This was a light joke poking fun about her reaction to snow and filled with genuine well wishes for her and her son to enjoy the day.

My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride.

POST : Okay so, in college, first year I started dating my husband, he wasnt serious back then at all. He cheated on me with my friend (he more than made it up to me, 4 years later we\u2019re married, very happy). That friend just happened to fall in love with him (he\u2019s really charming, tbh everyone wanted him). So that friend hid this affair from me until 3 years later when I confronted her? I had known for a while cause my husband had told me long before that. When I confronted her,I told her I forgave her and I didn\u2019t care about the past, she was being super defensive, I still forgave her cause I didn\u2019t wanna cause drama in our friend circle, Cause I honestly didn\u2019t care. After that, she just generally hated when me and my husband were together? She would tell me weird shit like he\u2019s not worth it, and don\u2019t be with him! (Let me add that she once came up to me before the confrontation, and tried to convince me that my husband, wasn\u2019t in love with me and was actually in love with her). I ignored it. \nTowards our last year of college she started being even more weird (me and my husband at this point we\u2019re super serious had made our parents meet and we\u2019re talking about marriage) she would go to my other friend and bitch about the me and my husband. Which was ridiculous cause she acted like she was totally okay in front of us.Let me add that at this point she had been distant from everyone no matter how hard we tried to involve her she always acted like she didn\u2019t care. Our friend group was really getting tired of her shit. After we graduated we had an engagement party like 2 months later and said friend also had the rep of getting too drunk and just wanting to party hard and puking everywhere and What not. I honestly didn\u2019t even feel like she was my friend anymore, and nor did I want her to come to my party with my family and my in laws and get drunk and ruin the whole thing? So I sent her a message explaining everything that made me uncomfortable about her and how I think it would be better if we weren\u2019t friends anymore (also she hadnt met me or talked to me since graduation). Honestly her energy and bad vibes were really affecting me. I told her everything nicely and she replied rudly After which I just told her I didn\u2019t want her at my engagement because I don\u2019t want bad vibes in my life specially at such a happy time. Then 9 months later when we were getting married, about a week before, she calls up my other friend (hadn\u2019t heard from her since the last interaction) and starts calling me a bitch and what not and saying I ruined her life and stole all her friends (I literally didn\u2019t care if anyone stayed friends with her, neither did I ever make anyone share my feelings about her or anything), and that I made everyone stop talking to her. I was shocked to hear such stuff! I always felt bad about not inviting her but I feel like I have my reasons honestly! Idk AITA here?

Just a little backstory: Right before we made it official that we were boyfriend/girlfriend and that we were exclusive, he went down to Florida to visit some friends and ended up having a one night stand with this one girl that was friends with his friends down there.  I didn\u2019t count it as cheating because we hadn\u2019t discussed being exclusive and putting a label on our relationship, but it still hurt me a little bit.  \n\nFast forward to present day, his brother wants to go to this convention this summer down in Florida over my boyfriends birthday.

POST : Throwaway, etc, etc. I understand that this question already sounds bad, but I'd like to explain a little and see if I am out of line or if my feelings make sense. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are four dogs at my house. One is mine and my fiancee's, one is my sister's and her BF, and two are the family pets (my parent's dogs, although I pay the medical expenses). They are 1, 3, 8, and 10, respectively. They all got along fine for the longest time, but in the past 6 months or so there have been issues with my sister's dog (lab/pit mix) and the 8 y/o (white german shepard) have been getting into it when they are in the same space. We've been keeping them in separate parts of the house and let them out at different times, but it's not an ideal situation. If a door is left open or a baby gate goes down, they go at it, biting and latching on and won't let go unless we get between them and break it up. One time the 8 y/o got a bite on the leg bad enough that we took her to the vet, and while we were there we found out she had 10-15 mammary tumors. The vet said unless it's proven otherwise, it is most likely cancer. Looking back, there have been other signs like significant weight loss and appetite changes that also point to cancer. We think they may be fighting because the 3 y/o can smell that she is sick and is vying for the alpha spot, or the 8 y/o is uncomfortable and senses aggression from the younger one and wants to defend herself but, I digress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn recent weeks, the 8 y/o has been becoming harder and harder to deal with. She has been rougher with the other two dogs (pushing them around, mouthing their necks), and has been a lot more anxious and vocal. She is constantly whining if someone is not near her and barks at everyone, even if they just changed their shirt and came back. She doesn't listen to commands most of the time, and her attitude is getting to the point where I really just don't want to deal with her anymore. I feel bad because she was a good dog until recently, and I'm not sure what is the exact cause of the change. If it's because she is sick and she is in pain or extremely uncomfortable, she isn't physically acting like she is at that point. She still runs and plays and is not lethargic like one would expect from a girl in her late stages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I don't want her to be put down, but I don't want to have to deal with her and the stress she is putting on the other dogs anymore. Unfortunately with my family and with her health and age, those are kind of the only options. So I ask, AITA for feeling this way?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My 8 y/o white german shepard has cancer, and is causing issues with the other dogs at the house, fighting with one of them.

There were a few things the bride-to-be wanted to do, including a open bar Ferris Wheel and a Drag Brunch, but they were about 2-3h of the entire weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrad friends and I tried to research things to do and take advantage of our time, but the undergrad friends were impossible to move. In response to any suggestion, they would hem and haw and reject all ideas by wasting time without ever suggesting anything. We asked the bride many times what she would prefer, but she just always said she was fine with whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrad friends were interested in going to a Vegas nightclub. The first night, we got dinner nearby then went to some regular bars next to our casino. Fun, but basically not any different than we could have done locally. The next day we brought the idea up again, but the undergrad friends expressed doubt about lines, cost, the dress code, and some worried they would be charged a cover if the bouncer didn\u2019t find them attractive enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater we went to a Thunder Down Under show based on the recommendation of the high school friends, and afterwards we spent at least 20 minutes standing outside while people debated what to do next.

It was very fun, and it was by far the cheapest thing we did the entire weekend. Got our cover waived because we dressed appropriately and got there early to avoid lines, got free drink tickets, and after a while our promoter came in and made his own drinks that he also gave us for free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater found out that the rest of the group spent the next hour and a half going between different fast food places and went to bed by 11:30.

I\u2019m not a social person and I didn\u2019t have many friends, so starting college knowing no one was scary, he was the only true friend I had.\nIt really hurt and upset me that he could just cut all contact with me, made me feel like I was unlikable. After he started ghosting me, I got really depressed and didn\u2019t socialise with anyone, even going on anti-depressants to help keep me sane (I didn't want to exist for a brief period). I\u2019ll admit I went crazy, became an arsehole and messaged him a lot to try and get him to speak to me. He did respond to somethings, but it was short, and he went straight back to ghosting after.\nAfter a few months (felt like half a year, but I can\u2019t be certain) I just went straight to his house to confront him directly, I just wanted my friend back and said something like \u201cLet\u2019s just forget everything which happened and play games\u201d. It somewhat worked, and he started speaking to me a bit, more and more. Fast forward a few years and we\u2019re back together, much better friends than before. We speak to each other for hours playing online games almost every time we are both at home.\nOne day (Like 9 months ago now) I asked him why he ghosted me those years back, and it turns out that it was because he was depressed because a guy in his college friend group called him weird and asked why he was even hanging out with them. So, he didn\u2019t even ghost me because he didn\u2019t like me, but because he was depressed about friends as well.\nBut it still bothers me every day. It really screwed me up, even after he stopped ghosting me. It really crushed my self-worth and social skills. Even now, I feel like he could just as easily drop contact with me and it wouldn\u2019t affect him at all. He\u2019s pretty much over it (or at least doesn\u2019t show it anymore), as he found his group of people and started going to parties and drinking, I\u2019m still depressed (much less so than before though) and anti-social.\nHe\u2019s honestly a really good person and I love him to bits, so I haven\u2019t said anything, or showed anything about still being mad, as I don\u2019t want to cause a divide between us, and I can\u2019t exactly suddenly appear to be mad about something which happened so long ago out of nowhere. (Recently he took a 30 minute bus journey to my house to drop off his controller I asked to borrow, during his 2 hour break from work when it was raining, without me even asking him to do so).\nAITA for still being mad about it? His depression caused him to ignore me, which made me depressed. I can\u2019t be mad at someone for not being social while being depressed, but it still upsets me. AITA for holding him partly responsible for my depression? AITA for still being mad at best friend who ghosted me 4 years ago?\n\nIn case anyone is wondering why I'm posting this now, after being mad for so long, he recently done something which triggered memories of how I felt before (He didn't do anything bad or wrong, just something which reminded me).\n", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

I was surprised to see that the post with seemingly no public response at the time of viewing had already gotten gold.  So I in jest posted the first comment on the post asking \"did you gild yourself lul\".  After about an hour I came back to see the post had spiked a little in popularity but my comment had struck a nerve with OP.  My comment had been downvoted into oblivion and OP had replied to me saying how hard they worked on it, how fucking awful the assertion would be if i was wrong, that its pretty scummy to pull shit like that and how I should keep my \"witchhunty\" comments to myself.  I saw the error in my ways and apologized stating that personally did see anything wrong with self advertising via gilding the post especially with an informative guide and that I thought I was finally viewing the phenomenon first hand.  I felt bad and was trying to make it clear that I wasn't trying to discredit OP merely attempting to point out something that I initially felt was obvious.  OP then again responded saying that they appreciated the apology but that comments had damaged their reputation and that my downvoted comment has been hidden mitigating the damage.  However I later noticed that something people shared my view in that OP did nothing wrong if they gilded their own post, but those comments were also downvoted even though they were in support of OP regardless of the situation.  Overall I feel bad for hijacking their post, but i feel a little brigaded in my attempts to soothe and remedy any hurt feelings.  So i guess again AITA for thinking that gilding one's own post isn't all that bad and suggesting someone did that after seeing a post with seemingly no exposure.\n\nAnd if any one wants to see the post I can make an edit, but I don't know if thats against the rules, and I certainly don't want to counter brigade or make any more trouble/drama.", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : First time poster here with a moral dilemma. \n\n*Backstory: I own a pet hedgehog named Loki.He needed to have an eye surgically removed recently and has finally recovered, but needless to say has been through a lot of stress. (Surgery, anesthetics, vet visits, antibiotics, etc.)\n\nMy vet posted his story to Facebook, with my permission, because hedgehogs are fairly unusual as pets and she was proud of saving his life. This is all fine, personally I don\u2019t use Facebook but apparently the post got a lot of traction within our community. \n\nApparently, our neighbors saw the post as well and showed the pictures of my little companion to their 5 year old son. \n\n*Side note: I\u2019m not close to my neighbors, just the occasional hello.*\n\nJust today, the father rang the doorbell and asked about Loki, referring to the post. It was kind of them to check up on him and I told them that he was doing well, to which he asked if they could see him. More specifically, if his son could see him. \n\nI understand that he is a rare pet and am aware of how exciting he must be to a kid, so I agreed. \n\nI asked them to come back later in the evening, since Loki is nocturnal and I avoid waking him up during the daytime (this was around 2PM, in Loki-time that\u2019s like being shaken awake at 2AM)\n\nHe agreed and came back around 4:30ish (PM), with their son. He was really excited about seeing my hedgehog, so I let them in and brushed over the fact that they ignored my request. Loki wouldn\u2019t be happy about me waking him up this early, but it would be fine. Plus, I don\u2019t know the kids schedule, so maybe anything later wouldn\u2019t have worked. \n\nI led everyone to my room and gently lifted the fleece blanket off my grumpy hedgie. After a while, he calms down.\n\nThe kid *looses his shit*. I mean excited squealing, jumping up and down, etc. This startled Loki and he curled up into a hissing ball (they\u2019re easy to startle), to which I picked him up to calm him down. \n\nThe parents then ask if their son can hold him as well. He gets even more excited. \n\nHere\u2019s where I want to know if I was the asshole: Hedgehog spikes can hurt when they\u2019re defensive, and I wouldn\u2019t trust a kid that young not to drop him out of fright. My hedgehog doesn\u2019t know his scent and the kid was very fidgety prior to this, so I was concerned that this would scare Loki and lead to him being held improperly or dropped. And most importantly, I didn\u2019t want to risk any further stress after his surgery story. \n\nI was polite, but firm when I said no.\n\nThe kid was upset, but ultimately understood and thanked me gloomily for showing him my pet. Despite being unhappy about not being allowed to hold him, but took it very gracefully. (Especially for a kid that young!)\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: When we were at the door, the mom pulled me aside and told me that it was unnecessary of me to refuse her sons wish and that I had made him upset. She still thanked me, but shook her head as she left. \n\nAm I the asshole? Could I have handled it better?

I have a 30 yo male friend who I\u2019ve been close to for near a decade. We\u2019ve never been romantic, nor even entertained it. He started dating a wonderful young woman about two years ago. He has two children from a previous relationship. He is a loving but inconsistent father and provider for his children. His work requires frequent international travel /long period away or overseas and can be inconsistent. \n\nSo, after he introduces me to his new gf we get Along great. Really like her. Kind, a good heart. She reached out to me often, though most often when things are bad or difficult in their relationship. She gets frustrated about his lack of reliability and lack of planning, and he gets upset with what he sees as her unrealistic expectations about finances. (Wanting trips, designer things)\n\nDespite the many concerns and reservations she\u2019d expressed, they moved in together about a year ago. Also bought two cars. Got some pets. All in.  But always late on rent and bills and unstable, which was a big cause of tension between them. At any rate, She\u2019d joke alarmingly regularly over the last few years about wondering if she might be pregnant. Recurring theme. To the point I sat her down several times to ensure she understood science and that if she kept this up she would without a doubt end up pregnant. She didn\u2019t like birth control because it made her moody. \n\nAnyhow title says it all in the summer time they told me she was pregnant. I\u2019ve known him for much longer, and he told me first. He was excited. Wanted to marry her first and asked for help with a baby shower. (Rediculous to plan that so soon but still cute). \n\nThen she tells me. And she\u2019s not so sure, for very valid reasons. I don\u2019t disagree - they are not at all ready. He\u2019s not properly caring for the two he already has and bills are a struggle and things are rocky. We talk a lot. She decides to give herself a week to make a decision. And ultimately decides to abort. When she told me that I was very, very clear that I supported her decision but that she needed to tell him and he deserved to know. I fully thought she would.\n\nBut she did not ever tell him. She told him she miscarried while he was away for work for about a month. He was really sad. \n\nAnd I am so confused about it I\u2019ve just backed away from both of them. I feel like I\u2019m lying to him by not telling him, but know it\u2019s not my business to tell. And I\u2019m angry with her for putting me in a position where I\u2019m expected to hold such a very big lie for her, from my friend who I knew far before her.  It makes me distrust her, knowing she can lie so easily about something so big. Again, I actually think she made a sound decision, but I think lying to him was unfair and wrong. \n\nAm I overdramatizing this? Should I just let it go, am I being a jerk?

POST : Ok, so I (25M) have recently made a decision to give up on a 4-year relationship with 24F in order to start making music and to transform it into my main activity. It was my first long relationship, and it was not smooth sometimes, but I loved her and still do. Or maybe I think I do.  \n\n\nSo our first year was alright, except she became jealous of all my female friends and she asked me to stop communicating with them because she didn't like the way I'm talking to them (she felt like I was flirting, but I was not). I tried to explain to her that there was nothing to worry about since I'm with her, but she didn't want to hear anything. Since I was \"in love\" and all, I swallowed it and had to inform my female friends that I will have to limit our communication. I still had short conversations with them, but it was done secretly and was limited to social networks only. \n\n(I guess this is where it should've ended).  \n\n\nThe second and third years still felt fine, the above limit was live and nothing special was happening. I continued to secretly message my old friends, but not often. It was mainly them asking me how it was going and me replying. With my ex we had many trips here and there, started living together. All seemed to be fine, no major arguments. An important thing, all this time I was working full-time, and occasionally did some gigs with my band. I really loved concerts and I was complaining to my ex that I wanted music to become my career. She started to ask me if I was going to continue doing it and how serious I was. Here is another important thing: Idk if it's the case for all, but for me, our concerts were bringing more and more female fans which irritated my ex. So she was completely pissed because of this fact since she was jealous af. Hence, her questions and some scary things she did which were led by her emotions. I told her that small gigs are enough for me and I was not going to become a McCartney.   \n\n\nLast year was quite difficult since I noticed I started spending more time on music than on anything else plus I got some mental problems with questions like \"What to do next? What is the purpose of all this? Do I want to do what I want to or what I have to?\" I've left my job because we moved to another place and I had troubles finding a new one. Gigs were gone as well. So I was more into myself which made me start heavily doing music at home. It felt like our relationship was something that always existed. She wanted me to be more romantic and attentive, and I was busy trying to deal with my existential crisis. At this moment, she proposed to start living separately thinking it would change something, and I had to move out. Since then, I completely fell out of reality - non-stop writing, recording, thinking. Even wanted to invest all my savings into a studio and instruments, but decided to stop myself. As for the relationship, I was bringing her flowers every week (and it was not a forced move - I really wanted to make her happy with that), but we saw each other during weekends only spending time walking or driving around. And at some point, she comes to me and asks if we are done. I'm like \"Why? We're fine, no?\" And she says \"No, we are not\". Adds, \"if we want to become a family one day and have kids and stuff, I need a stable man that can earn money and make sure the family runs well\". And me with my uncertain music stuff and depression, I am not the one she can think of. So she gave me some time to think it over, and me, after weighing pros and cons, I told her that maybe I should solve all my issues before committing to something serious as this, otherwise, I'll make everyone around me unhappy. She bursts into tears and leaves.  \n\n\nI am still uncomfortable with the decision I made because I had really hard times deciding. On one hand, you just work, make children, die (all of this beautifully wrapped), and I can't say I hated working. I loved what I was doing and I was pretty successful. On the other hand, you're just trying to pursue something you were always dreaming of, and you have no idea whether the result will turn out good or bad. But maybe this tells something about my maturity?  \n\n\nTo give you some more background, I've been doing music occasionally as a hobby since long time but in the past 2 years I've become quite prolific in writing, so I decided to start investing money and time in this activity with no guarantee it could bring me any financial return, and my ex didn't like that. She was hoping I'd become more mature and would work on our relationship and myself to finally become a family with kids and stuff. Of course, she wanted me to think about how I was gonna earn for a living and come up with something stable, and of course, she considers music as something childish and infantile. The same does my family. But it is something I really want to finally spend time on. And something that makes me happy (most of the times).  \n\n\nOh pls, kill me, why being an adult is so complicated?  \n\n\nTL;DR: had a 4-year relationship, found I wanted to change my main activity to music because it made me happy, my gf didn't like that for her reasons, chose music over the relationship after all, although it was a black box with no clear outcome or stability in the future, hurt myself and my ex in the short term\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for grammar - not a native speaker :( ", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

I was so worried in California, every phone call sounded like she was being tortured by everyone trying to help her... I felt horrible so I actually give up my job and home in cali and made my daughter leave her world to come live with and help my mom.   Now I had to get a job, then an apartment, and I got both quickly but maybe only because my mom called 6 times a day for status reports and asking what the hold up is.  I arrived in October and had an apartment by xmas. Moved her in, and became her fucking slave.  She treated my daughter like crap, acted like everything in the world revolved around her stroke, brings up politics and god entirely too much, cried daily over how unfair it all was... but mostly I couldn't leave my 12 year daughter alone with her, she was so mean and on xmas told my daughter she would always be a horrible person... yeah my baby cried and shes not horrible, I blame the meds, my mom changed after this stroke. She will admit she was a beast, so I swear I'm not exaggerating.  Anyway, she got sick of ME and decided to move back to the place I *saved* her from and by then I was done... I maxed out all my credit cards to get to Texas and help her and she lasted 2 months in my care.. I dont call, I hate her voice, and on top of just being uncomfortable seeing my mom in this condition I'm really angry that she would insist I spend so much time and money to help her then not need me... describe me to people as a selfish punk.   I really wish I just never came back to help in the first place. I ruined my life, it's been 7 months since she had someone pick her and her things up. I couldn't afford nor wanted to keep that place or job so I quit everything and moved in with my travelling bf, my daughter is already homeschooled so we are always on the road now and it's been better than Texas but I'm still pissed that I did so much for my mom and it was just a total disaster..  so that's where I'm coming from, sorry of that's long.  ANYWAY she has a blockage in her leg and I assume it's an angioplasty coming up and she called me asking of I could come (currently in utah but maybe heading back to TX in a few weeks) because she needs help for a few days after the procedure.   I just... I honestly feel like when she dies it will be sad but a relief and that makes me feel like shit... I also dont know if these feelings are justified or if I'm just horrible now.  Should I do it?  I havent told her how I feel.  Also she wants help with money and I'm not finding work on the road for extra cash and I wont be asking my bf for money to help her... she sounds so miserable on the phone but I hesitate to feel sorry for her.  I really dont have much family, I dont want to hate them, but 3 or 4 days with her might be too much for me.  I'm kind of looking for justifiable reasons not to feel obligated to ever help her again.

I asserted to him that he was 'just sex' - I didn't want a relationship and would never be anything more. I would only be living in his city for two weeks, too, and made it clear I had no intention of seeing him after that. \n\nExcept I did and I made the six hour drive to see him and spend a week with him about once a month for the next three months. \n\nWe'd made it clear that we were one at a time people - essentially exclusively fucking. I told him that if he were to develop an interest in anybody else, to tell me and break it off.\n\nWe finally admitted it was probably a bit more than sex and we began dating about four/five months in in September/october, and we love eachother despite the difference.\n\nHowever, I recently discovered that during the summer, while I was driving up to see him, he took another girl home after a party and she spent the night. She left hours before I arrived. They didn't have sex in the end but he admits that that was his intention. This was at the end of July.\n\nHe didn't tell me this, despite me asking throughout our relationship if there had been anybody else. He deleted the messages with this girl before I could ever read them but he swears he only sent her one and then ghosted her. \n\nGranted, we weren't together. And I was adamant that he was just a shag at the time which probably didn't make him feel too good about himself. But I was driving the six hour journey to see him...\n\nWhen this came out I also discovered he used to have a sexual relationship with a close friend of his, despite assuring me he had never slept with any of his friends (I have - and he knows exactly who it was and what went down). He assures me nothing has happened with her in the time he's known me, despite keeping this from me. It turns out they've met up a few times, alone and with other friends. Again, he's deleted the messages with this girl so I have no evidence of anything happening but I'm suspicious because the messages have been deleted and he lied about who she was to him.\n\nI am incredibly insecure about all this and have lost a lot of trust in him. It generates many arguments between us. He thinks I should believe there's nothing more than he's told me, and draw a line under it all and live happy ever after.

My girlfriend (20/F) of 7 months is coming to visit me from our home country for one week in April. \n\nShe wants me to take her to Auschwitz because it is one of her dreams to visit the camp. We both agreed that it is dangerous for her to go alone, both for security reasons and because she doesn't know how to use public transports to get where she needs to be (I am already used to it so I know how to do it). I do not want to go to the concentration camp with her because I have already visited it last weekend in a group trip prepared for some erasmus students and I paid around 100\u20ac for that weekend. It seems unwise for me to go again 1 month later considering that: I will be busy with work assignments; all the costs to get there; the money that I will spend that could be used for me to visit other places like I have already semi planned.\n\n\n\nImportant things to consider: \n\n- Right now I have very little money to live off of for the remainder of the semester (around 600\u20ac for 3 and a half months, not considering rent which is 150\u20ac/month). I got most of the scholarship's money at the beginning of the semester and I will receive the other part after the semester ends, but that money is already destined for other stuff (I have some physical problems and I will use the money to pay for doctors appointments and whatever is needed to fix me. Also, I need to buy a new laptop because mine is getting pretty old, although still functional).\n\n- I always knew it was her dream to visit the camp and I would like her to fulfil her dream. However, because of money problems from her side, we were never sure if she could actually come visit me, so I never really kept in mind that I needed to save some money to go with her or that I should not have gone on that weekend trip just so that I could go with her later.\n\n- She has the possibility to go with some family members that are also coming for a visit but she doesn't want to go with them. She wants to go with me for 2 reasons: -She doesn't want to spend 1 day of that week far from me because we have already been apart for 3 months. In my opinion this isn't a good reason because 1. I will be going home for one week after she is here and 2. because we will have time in the future to be together but she probably won't have the opportunity to visit Auschwitz in the future. -She wants it to be an experience shared by both of us so that it will be remembered in the future.\n\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA here?", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

Afterwards I survived two attempts on my own life, went through a a few years of drug and alcohol abuse and homelessness as I stopped working. After a lot of effort I got back on my feet.\n\nI've turned 40 a few months ago. A few years ago I met my current wife. We had been friends for a bit and have been together for 2 years. She knew what I'd been through and was extremely supportive, we've helped eachother through a lot and have overall had a great marriage.\n\nThe other night we had a major blow-up. We've both been dealing with family issues and work related problems and had been short with eachother for a few days. We went out for a date which helped, and she asked to go the next night as well. I had already committed to helping a friend move that day, so I told her we could the day after. In retrospect I know this was wrong of me.\n\nFor the first time she start swearing at me, pushing chairs, telling me to leave. It ended with her saying, verbatim, \"last time you neglected your fucking family for a friend you lost them, that's on you. What if we had a kid [my name], would it take letting them die too before you smarten up?\"\n\nI left that night and came back the next day. We talked and she was extremely apologetic and said she's just been stressed from work, but it came out that she had always been jealous of my first wife which she never mentioned before. I told her I wanted wasn't sure if I could be with her, she's been staying with her sister but begging me for a chance to work through it.\n\nFriends are mixed. Some support me, others think I owe it to her to try to move past it because it was one issue in an otherwise solid marriage and because \"I do still think about my wife so she's right to be jealous.\" I visit my family on their birthdays and Christmas. I keep a photo of my first wife and daughter in my wallet (I also keep one of my current wife) and I've had their names on my back for 10+ years. That's it. I don't compare her to my first wife, nor do I love her less and I don't wallow in grief while ignoring my marriage, I just don't feel like being remarried means I have to act like they never existed. She knew I was a widower when we met. She was the one who offered to talk to me about my wife back then, and I haven't talked to her about my wife since we married. Had she brought up these concerns in a better way, I'd have gladly reassured her and worked on it, but while I can forgive a lot I don't know if I can forgive or ever forget how she said it.\n\nI need opinions.

We\u2019ve just finished the semester so normally all four of us would go home for winter break, and the apartment would sit empty. However, if one so chooses our college offers a winter term where you can pay to take sprint classes that last the duration of the break.

Because of this, we asked this roommate if he would pay the cable/internet for that month (as nobody else would be there to use it, and we could otherwise shut it off if he weren\u2019t there) as well as 50% of the electricity as opposed to his usual 25%. He did not take us even asking well at all.

So now he\u2019s saying that he\u2019s just going to commute instead of staying of winter term (biting off his nose to spite his face), which will be a way bigger hassle for him than it would be to just eat the $150 and be a five minute walk away from class.

He's phased in and out of \"best friend\" territory, but he's sort of one of a small group of guys I consider to be my best friends. 3 of them (4 including me) all met through me, and I always drove us around (first to get a license) and decided what we did back in high school, so I kind of considered myself to be the \"leader\" of the group.\n\nOne dickish thing that happened, just for some more context: my first ever girlfriend was his girlfriend at the time. I didnt do anything but for some reason she wanted to leave him for me, and I was feeling lonely enough that I accepted. She turned out to be an absolute psychopath, and the whole thing was a horrible experience, but even though she tried to turn me against him constantly, it never worked.\n\nOne day, I got another girlfriend, and she and I moved in together waaaaay too soon, but that's just how it happened. Meanwhile all my other 3 friends moved in together without me. We all lived this way for about 6 years.\n\nThis year, she dumped me, and I decided to finally fill that open room in the house. All gravy, right?\n\nWell for some reason, over the last couple years this guy has kept pulling this \"alpha male\" garbage. He used to literally brag about his penis size, and he did this for a good while until I told him he had to cut that out for all our sakes. But still, he's constantly trying to be the driving force behind everything. He wants to be in front, he wants to be in charge, even when he clearly doesnt have a clue what's going on.\n\nAgain, I've talked to him, this ultra dominant alpha stuff is no fun. It just feels inauthentic and annoying. His (ex)girlfriend told me he never lets her on top in the bedroom, and I think that extends from this same need to always be the one in power.\n\nEverything feels like a competition. He targets me down when we're playing smash bros, he does everything in his power to be the most charming, the kindest, the cutest, the smartest, and to get the most girls. To me, it keeps coming across as cocky and full of himself, but it's bern working.\n\nIn fact, girls that had clearly liked me before now seem to like him more, which itself wouldn't be so bad, but they're outright ignoring me at best or being uncharacteristically hostile at worst. I have no idea why, like it's actually a zero sum game.\n\nHe hasn't directly done or said anything bad to me this whole time, but the CONSTANT competition and false dominance has worn me thin long ago and I actually cant even escape it. I live with him and he keeps forcing himself into whatever I'm doing.\n\nRecently, he's friended a coworker of mine that I kind of liked, but she and I have a bit of a strange history. She liked me first back when I was taken, and when I became single, we started getting closer until I said it was too much too fast, and too soon after a 6 year breakup.\n\nAnyway, he friended her, and now his non-stop, hyperactive social media presence is starting to get hearts and laughs from her, and she's starting to send him pictures of stuff she thinks is cute. I'm worried this is going to start to go the same way as the other two girls.\n\nNow I know what some of you might be thinking- he's just insecure and needs validation. Definitely possible, but even the slightest thing gets to his head so badly I just cant even bring myself to be supportive of the guy.

I commute to community college, Monday-Thursday, and I will be graduating after this semester. I have wanted a motorcycle since I was a kid, when my mom had one. I always thought it was super cool, and I wanted to get one when I was older\n\nStarting my freshman year of high school, I started working summers, and saving up money. By the time senior year ended, and I was ready to go to college, I had about $11.000 saved up, between working and birthday/christmas money. (I rarely spend money) Going into college, I knew I had enough money to buy all my courses, and books for the 2 years I was attending college.

I pay for gas, fixes and oil changes, and anything else. Now I am on my last semester of college, and after the 4 semesters, I have about $8,500 saved up. I have a tax return coming in of about $2,000, and leftover christmas/birthday money of about $500. This puts me at a total of about $11,000. I plan on going to work right after school, and I want to get a motorcycle because, 1) I have the money, and 2) I have always wanted one.\n\nMy buddy has a motorcycle, and is willing to sell it to me for about $3,300.

My arguement is, she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about anything. I would pay for it, pay for insurance, and pay for any maintenence.

POST : Hi there folks, be as brutal as you need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner and I have dated for 2 years, 1 long distance and 1 physically together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground information on me, the potential asshole: I am obsessed with picking at bumps in my skin, if there's a zit I'd rather have a deep gash bleeding than any form of zit, pimple, acne, or those little white dots that appear on your skin. I frequently scratch myself until bleeding with my hairline usually taking the worst of it. None of this hurts when I do it as I've been doing this my whole life, I used to pick my hairs as well but I only do that for my armpits now. Long story short, if there's a bump in the skin it's gotta go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started dating a guy who has some problems with acne. It's not cystic, nor does it flare terribly, but he constantly every single day grows around 20+ individual pimples on his body. They are almost always on his back, along his neck and collarbone and face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was reluctant to let me pop them in his past, but let me do so freely when we were long distance. When we moved in together he became more and more reluctant to let me do it until he started denying me flat out. I used a sterile needle and applied a lotion to help heal the small holes most of the time, I always washed my hands and kept things clean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I won't lie and say that I was totally fine with him saying no. I do know that it is his body and his choices, but for whatever reason I get anxious and stressed about acne specifically. I take care of mine, but if he walks around with a big juicy one I feel unrest in my body, both from disgust and also from a desire to get rid of it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe came to a sort of truce where I'd ask if I could pop it and he'd decide if he'd let me or not in the moment, but I will feel so incredibly stressed, anxious and grossed out if he walks around with unpopped acne so I told him that I'd like it if he could at least do it himself. He told me that this was not something he wanted to do and I should just let his body take care of it naturally, but he gets acne every single day anyway so unless it gets popped its constantly there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't discussed skin-care products yet because:  \n1. I am not knowledgeable enough on the field at all.  \n2. I firmly believe that by using a sterile needle, hot water, cold water and being gentle with the hole you make doesn't leave scars as it hasn't left any noticeable ones for me (of course I can be wrong, I just haven't seen anything to prove it wrong).\n\n3. He worries about money a lot due to a credit card debt on his side and would likely feel emasculated if I bought it for him (likely, not guaranteed).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI definitely feel like an asshole, but I also feel uncomfortable and don't know how to proceed because I am not sure if I can feel completely relaxed unless I get to indulge in this popping obsession or if he starts using some sort of skin care to prevent acne outbreaks.", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : I'm sorry this will be a wall of text but will try to stick to only pertinent information. I tried to TL;DR, can't say it explains it all. \n\nI met my best friend (opposite sex for context, I'll call them Q) over 15 years ago.  \n\nWe slept together once in the first year or so of knowing each other. It was left at that and was never once spoken of again. \n\nWithin this 15 years there are a couple in the middle we weren't in touch.  \n\nGet back in touch eight years ago, we are spending a lot of time together, all platonic, I sleep with their best friend after all hanging out together one night within the first 6 months of us being in touch.  \n\nWe become friends with benefits for no longer than that summer, having hung out without my ever discussing it with best friend. (I was an asshole for this, I know)  \n\nFast forward to present, we see each other at least once a week, talk to each other more. We are both older now, single, and have become each others companion. Never argue, always great way of communicating with each other, hold no punches with anything ever talked about. We are each others confidantes, helping each other through some pretty shitty times.   \n\nA couple of months ago, Q drops, \"Maybe we should just get married.\" I question it, they shrug it off. Then they proceed to say these types of things many times in the following months.  \n\nI sit Q down, we talk about, (about four weeks ago?) again won't tell me anything about how they really feel, shrugging it off again, but we continue to have a really crazy intimate talk about other things and we sleep together that night. (mistake #106 by now on my behalf, I know)  \n  \nSince then Q has again mentioned on at least three occasions, let's just get married. We just get along so well. They've has started dropping shit like this almost every time we see each other.  \n\nSo the last couple of weeks I started thinking about it. Maybe it's been there all along and I neglected to see it. So I decided I'd force the issue when I understood how I felt, which took us to Friday.  \nWe had a great time together, and went back to my place for a drink.  \nGet drunk, sleep together again. When we woke up, I force the issue, this is either something or we stop the intimacy before it fucks up the friendship. We have two choices as I see it. We talk for a while and agree we both can see a future with each other. It took prying but it's finally admitted, they've pretty much had feelings for me for the entirety of the friendship.  \nAs soon as this happens, they mention that they knew about my sleeping with their best friend. The whole fucking time. All eight years.   \nAnd Q doesn't know if they can see past it.  \nAm I the asshole for having slept with the best friend? Because That's how it felt last night.   \nNow in the light of day, I feel strung along and a little bit pissed off they've not been honest with me this entire time. And as soon as I tried to talk about any feelings we might have for each other, something I did 8 years ago is going to lose all opportunity to stay friends or anything more.   \n\n\nTL;DR: Friend harboured feelings and when confonted with my own feelings it's thrown in my face I slept with their best friend almost a decade ago.\n\nPlease kind people of reddit, who's the asshole?

Needless to say, with this I was exposed to a whole ton of channerspeak, which has become something of a sensitivity and an alarm raiser, even amongst people I know  I can trust absolutely. \n\nToday, while on Discord, I noticed I had someone blocked and I didn't recognize their name. I also couldn't find any sort of previous conversations with them in any way, and they didn't seem like they were too terrible a person. So I asked if maybe they had been under a different name before.\n\nThey asked why I was asking, and I told them it was because I had them blocked and I couldn't figure out why. They told me no, and also made a joke along the lines of \"block me harder daddy\" (which made me kinda uncomfortable, but whatever). I then unblocked them, at which point they made a post with \"kek\" in it.\n\nI mentioned that this was probably why I blocked them, as often it's a dogwhistle for really shitty people. I didn't go into my history because I didn't want to come off as needy or self-important and figured it would probably come off as a moodkiller.\n\nThey got very upset at me for saying this, saying they were nothing of the sort, and that they were most certainly much more far left than that, and that they'd never encountered more than a couple of channers who said it.\n\nWe've made up, however. We're on good terms, it turns out we share a bunch of servers, they know a bunch of my friends, and all of this is now water under the bridge, but I still wonder - was I the asshole for blocking them?", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : A preface: normally I wouldn\u2019t use a throwaway, this isn\u2019t a huge deal even if I acted like a jerk during it. I\u2019m just on a discord server with a lot of reddit users and if I posted this on my main they would roast the fuck out of me. \n\nSo, to begin with, I\u2019m a straight, cis high school girl. I\u2019m not bi or trans and as the post title states, I\u2019m certainly not a lesbian. But I am very progressive and have a lot of LGBT friends, one of them being a girl I\u2019m just gonna call BFF for now. She *is* a lesbian and we aren\u2019t in a relationship (she has a gf) but we\u2019re super close friends. Since she\u2019s out and we\u2019re so close, a few years back there was this huge annoying rumor circulating about how we were dating. We weren\u2019t. We couldn\u2019t convince anyone we weren\u2019t, as hard as we tried, and it died out naturally. I am on kind of frosty terms with my BFF\u2019s gf because of it though, who\u2019s not possessive, but she is paranoid. I like the girl and all but considering her dislike of me I wouldn\u2019t really be friends with her.\n\nSo. It\u2019s junior year last week, all the shitty dating rumors evaporated a while back, and me and my BFF are in the hallway just chatting before school ends when this guy I\u2019ll call Kevin (courtesy of the infamous Kevin meme) struts into our zone.\n\nImportant fact about Kevin: He\u2019s an asshat. A certified dickprince. He hits on girls constantly unaware of just how much they loathe him, and he\u2019s been eyeing me up for a few days. I knew this was coming, but I was just hoping to ignore him.\n\nHe begins to try and put the moves on me with a bunch of stupid comments about my face and butt and how we should copulate. Infantile and dumb. My BFF and I try to walk away from him, but he keeps following us. Finally, out of frustration, I blurt out at him \u201cI\u2019M A LESBIAN!\u201d In hopes that he\u2019ll leave me and my BFF the fuck alone. He doesn\u2019t immediately, makes a bunch of dumb comments about how he could turn me and how we should make out, but it\u2019s obviously pretty discouraging and he leaves like a minute after I say it. So I\u2019m standing there, pretty smug and self-satisfied at how I handled the situation, and then I notice my BFF is frowning at me. I can\u2019t remember exactly what she said but to paraphrase, it was something along the lines of \u201cThat was kind of dickish of you, Kevin\u2019s going to tell everyone that you\u2019re a lesbian and they\u2019ll all think we\u2019re dating, [her GF] will get pissed-\u201c (my BFF and her GF are in all different classes so it\u2019s not common knowledge that they\u2019re dating) \u201c-we\u2019ll have to ward off all the rumors again, and if you date guys in the future that just gives people more reason to think that lesbianism is something that can be changed.\u201d She also went on about how calling yourself a lesbian isn\u2019t a get-out-Of-being-hit-on free card. \n\nInitially I thought she was overreacting, but after reflecting on it I can see why she\u2019d be mad, and I think it\u2019s possible I was a bitch.

Throw away because...subject matter.\n\nSo, my brother and I were both college students at the time. We were back in town visiting my parents. I was feeling ill and left the dinner table early and laid down on the couch. I guess I ended up falling asleep there because I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of my bro masturbating. Now, this was 100% unintentional. He had no idea I was there. I was on the couch in the living room and he was sitting on the floor on the other side of the living room.

The maintenance of a relationship and most interactions with them are almost certain to be negative and stressful, which takes a huge toll mentally. I have been in a happy and stable relationship for 18+ months now, with someone I had known 2 years prior. Parents met him 12 months ago but did not embrace him anywhere near close to how they embraced past SO\u2019s. Fast forward a few months &amp; we are getting nowhere with them &amp; it is taking a huge toll on me mentally. SO struggling too from the perspective of he can see first-hand the affect it was having on me. We both tried to speak to parents about it on numerous occasions and work out a solution, to which they fiercely rejected all. The only solution they\u2019re willing to work with was to only have a relationship with me &amp; were happy to make me live two life streams \u2013 one as a partner to SO and one as a daughter to them. From that point, I decided to cut them out and get on with building a life with SO - rather than work on what I felt like was a brick wall with my folks.\n \nI started speaking to them just over a month ago, shortly after SO &amp; I found out we were 7 weeks pregnant. Given our history with them, we deliberated whether to tell them early. Finally we decided to tell them early, as figured they would be resentful later down the road if we didn\u2019t. They live in a different time-zone, so I chose email to share the news with them. Admittedly my email was very formal as I chose not to put any emotion into it for all the above reasons. Father replied \u201cDon\u2019t contact me directly anymore, do it through your mother or siblings. I can do without your drama. Good luck in your endeavours and hope things work out the way you think they will.\u201d Mother shortly replied in the more excited fashion which opened up a dialogue between us \u2013 she even started whatsapping SO!\nThings chug along okay with mother, with me and SO keeping her updated on baby progress via email and whatsapp. Late last week, she shares that she and father wish to visit and spend some time with SO &amp; I before baby arrives &amp; wish to visit it Feb. This seemed very odd to me as Father has not spoken to me since his \u2018do not contact email\u2019.

That being said I also asked that he tell me if he's having people over and he agreed. \n\nRoughly 8 months and one break up later an additional rule is that my ex can under no circumstances be at the apartment. (Things didn't end that bed, just rough emotionally on me, but roommate is still friends with her.) My roommate has since been super weird about people coming over, sometimes telling me, and sometimes not saying anything until he finds out I'm coming home or he tells me right before he knows I'm on my way. This isn't just frustrating because he blatantly ignores my (imho) very simple courtesy request, but also because of the way he sneaks around it. He'll text me to ask when I'm home, like tonight for example. I was on my way back from out of town and was supposed to arrive around six. I got invited to hang out with a friend and I texted my roommate to tell him I'd be back at closer to midnight. As I'm scrolling through my social media feed I see that he has people at the house. I decide it can wait and don't say anything. At 11:30 he asks if I'll be home soon. I reply\n\n\"Probably, btw i really don't apparently you not telling me you're having people over. We've talked about this multiple times\"\n\n*Seen*\n\n\"Seriously it's not that hard to text me, for instance, instead of asking when I'll be back so you'll know whether or not I'll come back while they're there friggin just tell me you're having people over\"\n\n*Seen*\n\nWhen I come home he's on his computer and I have some small talk and start unpacking my stuff. As I set up my desk I notice that my bag of little popper things which was full, is now almost empty. I ask him about it as he pops into a call and he says that they used a few (they used like 3/4 of the bag) I tell him how rude that is and he avoids eye contact and says he'll buy me more. I tell him that's not what it's about it's about the blatantly lack of respect for me. I bring up the having people over and he basically blows me off. I just don't even know what to say to him.

But she refuses to do anything like that and defends the guys at the same time. \n\nSo reddit, Am I the Asshole for this?", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

They were a little pricey, but fair. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwhich on glazed and fries.\n\nThe place was busy but not insanely packed. I heard my name called and when I approached the worker simply said, \"spicy chicken?\" So I assumed it was mine. I pulled the fries out and started eating them but when I opened the box, it had strips, not a sandwich. \n\nI brought it back up and a cook overheard me and immediately started making the correct order and handed it to me.\n\nHowever, after my friends and I finish eating, I hear them calling my name again. The place was now empty and I went up, the worker said, spicy chicken on a donut with fries? They definitely made my order twice and I accepted both of them. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}]
