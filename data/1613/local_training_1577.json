There will also be debate about Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election -- an issue the incoming President doesn't want to focus on, saying last week it's time to \"move on\" -- but many in his own party view as a serious threat.Obamacare and confirming Trump's nominees top the agendaRussia's involvement in the 2016 election also promises to be a top issue \n Question:Their plan is to use a budget process known as \"reconciliation\" to wipe away the major planks of _.", "output": "Obamacare", "category": "Question Answering 967.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be presented with a passage and have to answer a question based on your understanding of the events inferred from the passage.
