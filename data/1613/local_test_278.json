Of 128 isolates, multiple serotypes were defined and all were biochemically typical for Yersinia enterocolitica. Other agents were seen in 20 patients; of these, seven were Yersinia fredriksenii and six were Clostridium difficile. Diarrhea (80%) and abdominal pain (64%) were common, whereas other features such as fever (9%) and bloody stools (8%) were unusual. Use of antibiotics (24%) or opiates (28%) in the month before culture was common. The terminal ileum was seen radiographically in 20 patients, but only two barium studies showed abnormalities. Fiberoptic endoscopy and biopsy studies, done in greater than 50% of the cases, showed minimal or no changes in most patients. However, 3 patients had pseudomembranous colitis with concomitant Clostridium difficile cytotoxin and 7 had diffuse severe colitis. New culture techniques, and possibly geographic differences, have contributed to the high isolation rates of this organism. Yersinia enterocolitica occurs sporadically, involves a variety of serotypes, and is associated with a broader clinical spectrum than was formerly appreciated. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Eleven patients with vesicoureteric reflux secondary to neuropathic bladder were treated by endoscopic injection of pyrolised polytetrafluoroethylene (Polytef) paste.

Diagnosis is based on culture or serologic demonstration of recent infection. There is evidence that doxycycline therapy started early in the course of the disease favorably affects duration and severity. Antibiotic therapy is often initiated because of a strong suspicion of the disease, before bacteriologic or serologic confirmation of the diagnosis is completed. Public health measures play an important role in minimizing the incidence of leptospirosis. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "No", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Thalidomide is effective in the treatment of such disabling dermatologic diseases as aphthosis, discoid lupus erythematosus, and prurigo nodularis, in which other drugs fail. However, its use can induce neuropathy necessitating caution in its administration. It was found in this electrophysiologic study of 13 patients that the data best revealing neuropathy, even when clinical abnormalities were not apparent, were reduction of sensory nerve action potential amplitude on the sural nerve, increase of somatosensory evoked potential latency following sural nerve stimulation, and reduction of sensory action potential amplitude on stimulating the median nerve at the wrist. In two patients, electrophysiologic abnormalities had increased after withdrawal, suggesting a prolonged action of thalidomide. Timely reduction of dosage, after detection of changes indicating the onset of side effects, could reduce the risk of the sometimes rapid emergence of clinical symptoms. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Many patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma have dyspnea or chest pain. Cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease. To better define the clinical characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma, the electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed. A total of 19/64 (30%) patients had autopsy studies available for review. The EKG was abnormal in 55 patients (89%). Over half (60%) had an arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia (42%), premature atrial and ventricular contractions (13%), atrial fibrillation (3%), and atrial flutter (1%). Over one third (37%) had a conduction abnormality, including bundle branch block (13%), hemiblock (8.5%), and incomplete right bundle branch block (13%). Echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with pericardial effusions, two with pericardial thickening, and one with an anterior sonolucent space. Of 19 autopsies, cardiac invasion was found in 14 (74%), with more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium. It is concluded that: clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, pathologic cardiac invasion occurs in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma, and the EKG and echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Of 21 patients with clinically definite hypokalemic, hyperkalemic, or normokalemic periodic paralysis, 15 (71%) had a greater than normal increase in compound muscle action potential amplitude during 2-5 minutes of intermittent strong voluntary contraction of the muscle. This increase was followed by a progressive decline in amplitude, which was greater than in a control population and which was most rapid during the first 20 minutes after exercise. The amplitude often decreased to a level below the preexercise level. A similar response was seen in six of nine patients with periodic paralysis secondary to disorders such as thyrotoxicosis. This test may have value in the identification of patients with periodic paralysis. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: The possible role of prostaglandins in mediating large coronary artery vasodilation by nitrates was investigated by quantitative magnification coronary angiography. The effects of aspirin (1 g systemically and 100 mg intracoronary) in preventing large coronary artery vasodilation induced by intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate was investigated in 16 patients. Of these, 5 received 0.3 mg (Group 1A) and 11 received 3 mg (Group 1B) intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate, before and 15 minutes after aspirin. Relative to control, 0.3 mg isosorbide dinitrate induced a 19 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD) (p less than 0.01) and 19.5 +/- 11% (p less than 0.01) increase in coronary diameter before and after aspirin, respectively (p = NS). Changes after 3 mg isosorbide were 23 +/- 12% (p less than 0.01) and 26.5 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01), respectively, before and after aspirin (p = NS). In 10 additional patients (Group 2), the effect of the same dose of aspirin on rest coronary artery tone was assessed: changes relative to control were 0.9 +/- 5.5% (p = NS) minutes after aspirin. The intracoronary administration of 3 mg isosorbide dinitrate produced a 24.7 +/- 11% increase in coronary diameter (p = NS versus pre- and postaspirin isosorbide in Group 1B). Urinary 6-ketoprostaglandin-F1 alpha values in urine samples collected in the 8 hours before and the 8 hours after the study in five patients in Group 1B and five patients of Group 2, revealed a 36 +/- 14% (mean +/- SD) reduction in excretion of prostacyclin (p less than 0.01). These data rule out a role for prostaglandins both in mediating dilation of large coronary arteries by nitrates and in affecting their vascular tone at rest. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: The role of optimal placement of electrodes and mode of shock delivery from a defibrillator was examined in dogs with and without myocardial infarction. Single, double and triple truncated exponential shocks separated by 1 ms were delivered through various electrode combinations and cardiac vectors after electrical induction of ventricular fibrillation. A single shock through a pathway not incorporating the interventricular septum (catheter electrodes or epicardial patches between anterior and posterior left ventricle) required the highest total energy (22.6 and greater than 26.4 J, respectively) and peak voltage (1,004 and greater than 1,094 V, respectively) to terminate ventricular fibrillation. A single shock through a pathway including the interventricular septum required lower total energy and peak voltage to defibrillate. Combinations of two sequential shocks between an intracardiac catheter electrode and anterior left ventricular epicardial patch, between the catheter electrode and subcutaneous extrathoracic plate and between three ventricular epicardial patches all significantly reduced total energy (7.7, 8.7 and 7.8 J, respectively) and peak voltage (424, 436 and 424 V, respectively) needed to defibrillate. Three sequential shocks exerted no significant additional reduction in total energy of the defibrillation threshold than did two sequential shocks. Infarcted canine heart required less peak voltage but not total energy to terminate ventricular fibrillation than did noninfarcted heart. Therefore, two sequential shocks over different pathways reduce both total energy and peak voltage required to terminate ventricular fibrillation. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Repetitive chest pain of obscure origin is commonly encountered in older children and adolescents. A questionnaire study was conducted to determine the long-term outcome in 31 patients diagnosed as having idiopathic recurrent chest pain after an average 4.1-year follow-up period. Although 45 percent reported having had persistent symptoms, chest pain had disappeared in 81 percent of those followed more than 3 years. Equally reassuring is the fact that in no case did occult disease subsequently appear to account for the initial symptoms. This study supports the current clinical approach of limited diagnostic evaluation and reassurance in the management of these patients. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: The chemotactic activity of human C5a des Arg is enhanced significantly by an anionic polypeptide (cochemotaxin) in normal human serum and plasma. We have found that the cochemotaxin attaches to the oligosaccharide chain of native C5a des Arg to form a complex with potent chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Although capable of enhancing the chemotactic activity of native C5a des Arg, the cochemotaxin had no effect on the chemotactic activity of either deglycosylated C5a des Arg, native C5a, or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Of the known components of the oligosaccharide chain, only sialic acid prevented enhancement by the cochemotaxin of the chemotactic activity exhibited by native C5a des Arg. Sialic acid also prevented the formation of C5a des Arg-cochemotaxin complexes, detected by acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, molecular sieve chromatography on polyacrylamide gels, and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Although increased efficacy has been described with a five-day schedule of high-dose cisplatin (CDDP) in hypertonic saline, severe myelosuppression and cumulative neurotoxicity have limited the usefulness of this therapy. In order to evaluate a possible dose-response relationship in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 17 patients with metastatic disease were treated with a modified dose schedule delivering the same total dose (200 mg/m2) in a divided day 1 and 8 schedule. During a pilot study, a total of 47 cycles of therapy were administered, with a median of three cycles per patient and a median total cumulative dose of 600 mg/m2. Nine of 17 patients received at least 600 mg/m2. While nephrotoxicity was similar to previous reports of the five-day schedule, the incidence and severity of myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy were markedly reduced. Using this modified schedule, severe myelosuppression did not occur. Clinically severe peripheral neuropathy developed in only one patient (6%). The overall response rate was 47% (eight of 17 patients). Plasma platinum pharmacokinetics during five cycles of the modified day 1 and 8 schedule were compared with pharmacokinetics of the five-day schedule. Accumulation of plasma ultrafiltrate platinum occurred in the five-day schedule, but not in the day 1 and 8 schedule. This difference in pharmacokinetics is one possible explanation for the reduced toxicity of this modified schedule. Although the degree of activity seen in this pilot study is encouraging, the efficacy of high-dose CDDP in NSCLC remains to be defined. In view of reduced myelosuppression and neurotoxicity, further trials with this modified schedule are indicated. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: An extremely large claw bone, some 30 cm long, was found in Wealden (Lower Cretaceous) deposits in a Surrey claypit in January 1983. This led to the discovery the following month of the well-preserved skeleton of a new large theropod dinosaur. Only one other theropod specimen comprising more than a few bones had ever been found in Britain, and that discovery was more than a century ago. Indeed, no large theropod, reasonably complete, had previously been discovered in Lower Cretaceous rocks anywhere in the world. Our study so far suggests that the Surrey dinosaur was a typical large theropod in certain respects, resembling, for example Allosaurus. In several other respects, however, it differs sufficiently from all known dinosaurs to merit designation as the representative of a new species, genus and family. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}]
